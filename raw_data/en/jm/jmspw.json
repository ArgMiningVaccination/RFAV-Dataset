These recommendations were produced through the collabora tive efforts of the South Dakota Department of Heal th, the South Dakota Foundation for Medical Care, and numerous providers. More than 38,170 South Dakotans ov er the age of 17 have been di agnosed with diabetes and an additional 16,359 could have the disease and not ev en know it, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 30% of people with diabetes are undiagnosed. These recommendations u tilize current research a nd evidence-based practic es and are meant to serve as a guide to providing appropriate care and treatment to people at-risk-for and with diabetes. Providers are encouraged to adapt the recommen dations to provide individualized, culturally sensitive care to all patients for optimal health outcomes and to provide consistency in the treatment and prevention of the long-term complications of diabetes. The recommendations were developed as part of a statewid e initiative to improve the health care of people with diabetes, and are consistent with the South Dakota Diabetes State Plan 2007-2009, available at http:diabetes.sd.gov . If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the Sout h Dakota Diabetes Prevention and Control Program at 1-800-738-2301 or the South Dakota Foundation for Medical Care at 1-800-658-2285.

This guide has been developed as part of a statewide ini tiative to improve the health care of people with diabetes, and is consistent with the South Dakota Diabetes State Plan (2007-2009) . Much work has been done, but many challenge s still lie ahead. According to information accessible at http://doh.sd.gov/Statistics/default.aspx , the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) is the main be havioral surveillance tool used in South Dakota for data collection for Healthy People 2010 objectives. The South Dakota Department of Health's Survey \"The Health Behaviors of South Dakotans\" conducted in 2006 and reported in 2007, indica tes the prevalence of diabetes has increased in South Dakota from a low of 2.9 percent in 1995 to a high of 7.1 percent in 2003. Currently, there is a 6.5 percent preval ence rate in the state. The highest prevalence of diabetes was noted in the 55 to 75+ age range, in sparsely populated geographic locations across the stat e, including central South Dakota and the Native American counties. Lower socioeconom ic income status and lower levels of education completed were also prevalent in this population group. Further, this survey indicates that disparities ex ist in South Dakota in both race and geographic location. Survey data lists the prevalence of diabetes in South Dakota at 6.1 percent for whites and 13.4 percent for Native Americans. Aberdeen Area Indian Health Service reports their 2007 prevalence rate for diabetes in all ages of their population at 12 percent, up from 11.8 percent in 2006. This disparity translates into shorter life spans for the Native American population. The South Dakota Vital Statistics Report (2006) reveals that diabetes ranks as the 7th leading cause of death for whites and 5th for American Indians, resulting in the median age of death at 82 years for whites and 69 years for American Indians. As health care providers, if we are to address the global epid emic of diabetes and obesity in the world today, focus must be centered on forming partnerships to create awareness, provide education, treatment, and preventive pr actices to mitigate the burden of diabetes in South Dakota. In order to provide culturally relevant care that honors the values of the population, we must begin at the local level if we are to have an impact on the worldwide diabetes epidemic. Armed with the positive outcomes from the Diabetes Prevention Program, health care providers and their interdisciplinary partne rs have the knowledge and tools to focus on prevention activities. There are no quick fixes for the social and health problems facing citizens today, but by joining together, Sout h Dakotans can overcome the public health threat of diabetes and secure a healthier futu re for our children, adults, elders, and future generations yet to come. These recommendations provide practitioners with the current research and evidence- based practice according to existing national stan dards, and are meant to serve as a guide to provide appropriate care and treatment to people at risk for and with diabetes. Providers are encouraged to adapt recommenda tions to provide individualized, culturally sensitive care to all patients to improve health outcomes and to avoid disparity in treatment, and to provide consistency in th e treatment and prevention of the long-term complications of diabetes. Funding for this project is through a coope rative agreement between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Diabetes Translation and the South Dakota Department of Health, Diabetes Prevention and Control Program.

Zawada, Jr., MD Screening/Diagnosis for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \u0099 The purpose of screening is to identify asympt omatic individuals who are at high-risk or likely to have diabetes or pre-diabetes. \u0099 Screening to detect pre-diabetes (Impaire d Fasting Glucose-IFG or Impaired Glucose Tolerance-IGT) and diabetes should be considered in individuals > 45 years of age, particularly in those with a BMI > 25 kg/m2, and if normal, s hould be repeated at 3-year intervals. \u0099 Testing should be considered at a younger ag e or be carried out more frequently in individuals who are/have: 1) Overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m2) and have additional risk factors; 2) Habitually physically inactive; 3) A first-degree relative with diabetes; 4) Are members of a high-risk ethnic populati on (e.g. African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander) ; 5) Delivered a baby weighing > 9 lbs or have been diagnosed with Gestational Diab etes Mellitus (GDM); 6) Hypertensive (> 140/90 < 35 mg/dl (0.90 mmol/l) and/or a triglyceride level Polycystic insu lin resistance (e.g. PCOS or Acanthosis Nigricans); 10) Hi story of vascular disease; 11) Medications that cause hyperglycemia\u2014i.e. steroids, et c.; and 12) Psychiatric illnes s (American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) risk factor). \u0099 Providers caring for Native Americans or Al askan Natives are encouraged to follow the Indian Health Service Standards of Care for Adults with Type 2 Diabetes (2006). \u0099 A fasting plasma glucose test (FPG) is the pr eferred test to diagnose diabetes in children and non-pregnant adults due to its simplicity and cost effectiveness. \u0099 Use of the A1C for the diagnosis of diab etes is not recommended at this time. \u0099 A FPG result > 126 mg/dl on two separate occasions is diagnostic of diabetes. Values of 100 to 125 mg/dl are termed impaired fasting glucose or pre-diabetes. FPG values < 100 mg/dl are considered normal according to both American Diabetes Association (ADA) and AACE Standards/Guidelines. \u0099 Individuals with glucose levels of 144 to 199 mg/dl after a two-hour glucose tolerance test are consider to have Im paired Glucose Tolerance (IGT) or pre-diabetes, even though these individuals do not meet the criteria for diagnosed diabetes. \u0099 Individuals with impaired glucose tolera nce can significantly reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes through interventi on with diet and exercise or Metformin. \u0099 People with psychiatric illness such as schizoph renia are at a greater risk for obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome with dyslip idemia, and hypertension than the general population. Who should be screened for type 2 diabetes mellitus? Diabetes screening is recommended for high-risk children and adults who have not previously been diagnosed and who are asymptomatic. Type 2 diabetes is frequently not diagnosed until symptoms appear. Incidence of type 2 diabetes in adolescents has shown a dramatic increase in the last decade. Consistent with screening r ecommendations for adults, only children and youth at increased risk for type 2 diab etes should be tested. Early det ection and treatment can decrease the burden of diabetes. Who are high-risk individuals? Adults: Individuals with one or more ma jor risk factors should be screen ed. No single risk factor is correlated with a 100 percent risk for type 2 di abetes. The greater the number of major risk factors present, the greater the risk of diabetes. The likelihood of diagnosi ng type 2 diabetes in a person with no risk factors is very low. What are the major risk factors? \u0099 First degree relatives with diabetes (parents or siblings) \u0099 Overweight (> 20 percent over desired body weight or Body Mass Index (BMI*) > 25 kg/m2) \u0099 Age greater than 45 years old \u0099 Sedentary lifestyle (habit ually physically inactive) \u0099 Other clinical a ssociated with polycystic < 35 mg/dl triglyceride level > 250 mg/dl (2.82 mmol/l) \u0099 Previously identified impaired fasting glucose or impaired gl ucose tolerance (see below) \u0099 History of gestational diabetes or delivery of a baby over 9 pounds \u0099 Hypertension (> 140/90 mmHg) \u0099 African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Na tive Americans, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders \u0099 Psychiatric illness (new addition from AACE) *Body Mass Index (BMI) = weight in kilograms/(height in meters)2, or BMI = weight in pounds x 703/height in inches x height in inches What are the testing criteria fo r type 2 diabetes in children? \u0099 Overweight (BMI > 85th percentile for age and sex, weight for height > 85th percentile, or weight > 120 percent of ideal for height) Plus any two of the following risk factors: \u0099 Family history of type 2 diabetes in first or second-degree relative \u0099 Race/ethnicity (Native American, African American, Latino, Asia n American, Pacific Islander) \u0099 Signs of insulin resistance or conditions asso ciated with insulin resistance ovary syndrome (PCOS)) history of diabetes or gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) Age of initiation : Age 10 years or at onset of pubert y, if puberty occurs at a younger age Frequency : Every 2 years Test: Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) preferred Clinical judgment should be used to test for diabetes in high-ri sk patients who do not meet these criteria. When should re-screening be done? If the initial scr eening is negative, those ove r 45 years of age should be re-screened every three years. Multiple risk factors or a high degree of clinical suspicion are indications for shorter intervals between screenings in certain individuals, and/or consid ering a more sensitive screening test such as a two-hour glucose tolerance test (see below). Chil dren whose initial screening is negative, but are at high risk fo r development of type 2 diabetes, should be screened every two years utilizing FPG testing. What screening tests should clinicians use? The FPG test is the preferred screening test for asymptoma tic individuals because it is convenient and inexpensive. Fasting is defined as no consumption of food or caloric beverage for at least eight hours prior to testing. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is also appropriate for screening, but is less convenient and more expensive than a FPG. The OGTT is a more sensitive test for type 2 diabetes and other states of impaired glucose metabolism, and shoul d be considered when the FPG is negative, but the clinical suspicion for abnormal glucose me tabolism is high. The DECODE study found that the two-hour value on OGTT correlated better with risk of both cardiova scular and all-cause mortality than did the FPG. Data from the Diabetes Prevention Program indicates that individuals with impaired glucose tolerance can significantly reduce the ri sk of developing type 2 diabetes through intervention with diet and exercise or Metformin. Random plasma glucose can be used as a non-diagnostic sc reening test. A random test is any plasma glucose test obtained wit hout regard to the time since th e meal. A level of > 160 mg/dl should be interpreted as abnormal and > 200 is a pr ovisional diagnosis of diabetes. A subsequent elevated FPG or OGTT result is needed to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes. If an individual has symptoms of diabetes (increased thirst, incr eased urination, unexpected weight loss) and has a random plasma glucose > 200 mg/dl, the diagnosis needs to be confirmed on a subsequent day by measurement of FPG, 2-hour OGTT, or a second random plasma glucose. A1C is not recommended by the American Diabetes Association as a screening test because of inter-laboratory variability and th e absence of established cut-off values for the normal range of results. Patients with diabetes may have normal A1C values, and such a result does not rule out diabetes. Elevated A1C results, although not di agnostic, are strongly s uggestive of diabetes. Whole blood glucose testing , finger stick or venous blood, is not recommended for screening or diagnostic testing. Results are us ually 10 to 15 percent lower than plasma glucose levels and much less accurate if obtained by a home blood glucose monitoring device. How should FPG and OGTT results be interpreted? Screening test results fall into three categories: diabetic, impaired, or normal. For fasting plasma glucose: \u0099 Diabetic range is defined as FPG > 126 mg/dl \u0099 Impaired fasting glucose is define d as FPG > 100 mg/dl, but < 126 mg/dl \u0099 Normal fasting glucose is < 100 mg/dl (ADA and AACE) For the OGTT (75-g oral glucose tolerance test): \u0099 Diabetic range is defined as a two-ho ur post-load glucose value > 200 mg/d \u0099 Impaired glucose tolerance or pre-diabetes is defined as tw o-hour values > 140 mg/dl, but < 200 mg/dl \u0099 Normal range is two-hour post-load value < 140 mg/dl What action should be taken ba sed on screening test results? An elevated result requires retesting on a di fferent day to confirm the diagnosis. A second elevated result confirms th e diagnosis of diabetes. Impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance are major risk factors for the development of diabetes. The interval between th e next screening should be no greater than three years. Lifestyle treatment may be appropriate. In tervention with diet and exercise, or Metformin, can significantly reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. If test results are normal , the interval between the next scr eening should be no greater than three years if other major ri sk factors persist. What medications can produce hypergly cemia and result in false positive screening results? thiazides, estroge n containing products, \u00df-blockers, and nicotinic acid may produce hyperglycemia. Is screening recommended for type 1 DM? Screening for type 1 diabetes is not recommended because the incidence is too low to justify the expense, the interval between insulin failure and acute symptoms is short, there is no consensus on appropriate interventions for the \"prediabetic\" phase, and nor mal levels for autoantibodies related to type 1 diabetes have not been established. Screening for gestational diabetes is covered in a separate section of this manual. Why are patients with psychiatric illness at risk for type 2 diabetes? People with psychiatric illness, su ch as schizophrenia, are at a greater risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome with dyslipidemia, and hypertensi on than the general population. Data from recent clinical trials documents an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) as well as a high prevalence of undiagnosed and untreated metabolic disease (obesity, glucose homeostasis disorders, and dyslipidemia) in patients with severe mental illness who are prescribed antipsychotic drugs. Clinical evidence data links the use of certain second-generation anti-psychotics and increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome and CVD. The problem represents a major public health issue with multiple causative factors such as lifestyle factors, inequalities in the provision of healthcare, and medication-related adverse effects. In addition, smoking, poor diet, reduced physical activity, a nd alcohol or drug abuse are prevalent in people with schizophrenia, and c ontribute to the overall CVD risk. Increasing evidence suggests that having a di agnosis of schizophrenia per se may be a risk factor for development of diseases with metabolic disord ers. Management and minimization of metabolic risk factors are pertinent when providing optimal care to patients w ith schizophrenia. Health care practitioners are encouraged to develop a plan of care that includes ongoing assessment, monitoring, and management of clients with schizophrenia and psychiatric illness. Why does the Indian Health Service h ave their own Standards of Care for patients with type 2 diabetes? The Indian Health Service ha s developed guidelines specific to the Native American and Alaskan Native population to addres s the unique aspects of diabetes care delivered in a culturally sensitive manner. Although many of the criteria are consistent with those of the American Diabetes Association, some diff erences exist including the follow ing: 1) Three plasma blood tests when establishing the diagnos is of diabetes; 2) Use of A1 Cs are not recommended for the diagnosis of diabetes; 3) Provisi on of wholistic (care of the whole person) care; and 4) Screening for depression, cancer, tobacco use, tuberculosis , nonalcoholic fatty liver, anemia, and alcohol and drug abuse. The overall goal fo r treatment is to ensure consistent quality care to everyone.

Pre-Diabetes \u0099 Pre-diabetes refers to the intermediate metabolic state between normal and diabetic glucose homeostasis, i.e. impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and is a component of metabolic syndrome. \u0099 IGT is categorized by the World Health Organization (W HO) and the ADA as a stage in the natural progression of disordered carbohydr ate metabolism. Diagnosis is determined by OGTT with normal fasting plasma glucose, but elevated two-hour plasma glucose readings of 140 to 199 mg/dL. Although higher than normal, this reading is not high enough to be classified as type 2 diabetes. \u0099 IFG is used to classify individuals who ha ve fasting plasma glucose values above the normal range, but below 126 mg/dL. What is pre-diabetes? Pre-diabetes is a major risk factor for developm ent of type 2 diabetes. IGT has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular dis ease and mortality. Data from the Diabetes Intervention Study and the Honolulu Heart Study indicated an increase d risk of CVD with impaired glucose tolerance (Lui et al, 2007). Considerable evidence indicates that pre-diabetes, specifically impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), can be modified with lifestyle or drug therapy intervention to either delay or prev ent the onset of type 2 diabetes. Pre-diabetes describes two distinctive abnormaliti es of glucose metabolism. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is thought to be secondary to in creased hepatic gluconeoge nesis and decreasing or impaired pancreatic beta cell f unction. Impaired glucose toleran ce arises from peripheral insulin resistance. People with pre-diabetes have blood glucose levels higher than normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. Pre-diabetes is considered to be a precursor to type 2 diabetes and raises the risk of developing heart disease and str oke. Approximately 30 percent to 40 percent of patients with pre-diabetes develop type 2 diabetes within a 5-year time frame. ADA recommendations for pre-diabetes screening in clude patients 45 years or older, especially if BMI is 25 kg/m2 or higher with a FPG or OGGT , respectively. Patients with either IGT or IFG should be screened every one to two years to ch eck for the development of type 2 diabetes, and those with normal values should be re-screened in three years. High-risk patients should be counseled regarding the potential benefits of increased activity and weight loss based on data garnered from clinical trials. Because of th e high prevalence of CVD associated with pre- diabetes, in addition to measuremen t of weight and BMI, patients should be assessed for tobacco use, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. What are the guidelines for diagnosis? Current ADA guidelines are as follows: \u0099 IFG: Fasting glucose level between 100 and and 6.9 mmol/L). \u0099 IGT: 2-hour post-75-g concentration of 140 to 199 mg/dL (7.8 to 11.0 mmol/L). Currently there are no standards for use of A1C te sts to screen for pre-di abetes, but individuals with an A1C above the population mean (often cons idered 5.5 percent) are at increased risk for developing diabetes. What are the treatment goals for patients with pre-diabetes? Pre-diabetes is a major risk f actor associated with metabolic syndrome. For patients with pre- diabetes, the goal is to decreas e the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease by promoting physical activity and healthy food ch oices that result in moderate we ight loss that is sustainable, or at a minimum, prevents further weight ga in. Refer to pages 103 and 104 for the goals of medical nutrition therapy (MNT). It should be noted that MNT is the same for both pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Is drug therapy useful in patients with pre-diabetes? Drug therapy is not recommended by the ADA due to the limited efficacy of treatment versus lifestyle modification, potential for adverse drug reactions, lack of data supporting reduction of microvascular or macrovascular complications of diabetes in this patient population, and insufficient assessment of the cost -effectiveness of drug treatment. However, not all patients are able to implement lifestyle modifications due to physical or other limitations, and based on limited data available, drug therapy may be a reas onable option to delay onset of type 2 diabetes and provide a cardiovascul ar benefit (TRIPOD and STOP-NIDDM data).

Metabolic Syndrome (Insulin Resistance Syndrome) \u0099 People with metabolic syndrome are at increased risk of coronary heart disease and other diseases related to plaque deposits/buildups in artery walls (stroke and peripheral vascular disease) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. \u0099 Underlying risk factors for this syndrome ar e abdominal obesity and insulin resistance. \u0099 Criteria for diagnosis of metabolic syndrom e are based on common clinical measures including waist circumference, triglycerides, HDL-C, blood pr essure, and fasting glucose levels. The presence of defined abnormalities in any three of these five measures constitutes a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. What is metabolic syndrome? Metabolic syndrome is characterize d by a group of metabolic risk fa ctors in an individual, which include abdominal obesity, ather ogenic dyslipidemia, elevated bl ood pressure, insulin resistance or glucose intolerance, prothrombotic state (as evidenced by high fibrinogen or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in the blood), and proinflammatory state w ith elevated C-reactive protein in the blood. What is the main reason for an increa sed number of patients with metabolic syndrome? The National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III report (ATP III) considers the rising obesity epidemic in the United States to be responsible for the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Risk factors associated with obesity increase proportionately as abdominal girth expands, causing elevation of serum cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, hyperglycemia, and hypertensi on. Other factors, such as aging, physical inactivity, proinflammatory state, hormonal changes/imba lances, and genetic predisposition have been implicated as contributors as well. What are the major compone nts of metabolic syndrome? The National Cholesterol Education Program iden tifies metabolic syndrome as a multiplex risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although criteria established by ATP III differ slightly from other organizations, all recognize CVD as a pr imary outcome of meta bolic syndrome. World Health Organization (WHO) agrees that CVD is a risk factor associated with metabolic syndrome, but posits that insulin resistance is a required component for diagnosis. The American Association of Clinical Endocrino logists (AACE) proposes a third set of clinical criteria for insulin resistance syndrome and parallel those of WHO and ATP III, but do not define a specific number of risk factors. ATP III considers the si x following components to be characteristic of metabolic syndrome: 1. Abdominal obesity is the form of obesity most often associated with metabolic syndrome. It presents clinically as increased waist ci rcumference greater than 40 inches in men and 35 inches in females. 2. Atherogenic dyslipidemia is evidenced by raised triglycerides and low concentrations of HDL cholesterol on lipid profile studies. Ot her lipid abnormalities may also be noted with elevated LDL and small HDL particles. 3. Elevated blood pressure is associated with obesity and insulin-resistance as increasing arterial stiffness contribute s significantly to systolic hypertension in the elderly. 4. Insulin resistance is present in the majority of pe ople with metabolic syndrome and is strongly linked to CVD. Patients with l ongstanding insulin re sistance often show symptoms of glucose intolerance , and if left untreated will ev olve into full-blown type 2 diabetes. 5. A proinflammatory state manifests itself through elevations of highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). As a result of obesity, ex cess adipose tissue releases inflammatory cytokines that may be reflected in elevated hs-CRP levels. Prospective studies (Aguilar et al, 2006) in middle-aged individuals have observed that incr eased serum CRP levels may predict the development of metabolic syndrome. 6. A prothrombotic state is characterized by increase d plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 acute-phase reactant (like CRP) and rises in response to a high-cytokine state. Prothrombotic and proinflammatory states may be metabolically interconnected. What are the criteria for diag nosis of metabolic syndrome? The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) proposed a simple set of diagnostic criteria ba sed on common clinical measures including waist circumference, triglycerides, HDL-C, blood pressure, and fasting glucose level. The presence of defined abnormalities in any three of these five measures constitutes a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome. Patients having fewer th an three abnormalities are at high-risk for developing metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabet es mellitus, and require close monitoring and ongoing assessment. Please refer to Table 1 on the following page fo r diagnostic criteria for Metabolic Syndrome. Table 1: Diagnostic Criteria for Meta bolic Syndrome (Adapted from AHA, 2004) Measure (Any 3 of 5 Criteria Constitute Diagnosis of Metabolic Syndrome) Categorical Cut Points Elevated waist circumference* + *To measure waist circumference, locate top of right iliac crest. Place a measuring tape in a horizontal plane around the abdomen at level of iliac crest. Before reading tape measure, ensure the tape is snug but does not compress the skin and is parallel to floor. Measurement is made at the end of normal expiration. > 102 cm (> 40 inches) in men > 88 cm (> 35 inches) in women +Some US adults of non- Asian origin (e.g. white, black, Hispanic) with marginally increased waist circumference (e.g. 94-101 cm or 37-39 inches in men; and 80-87 cm or 31-34 inches in women) may have strong genetic contribution to insulin resistance and should be nefit from changes in lifestyle habits, similar to men with categorical increases in waist circumference. Lower waist circumference cut point (e.g. > 90 cm/35 inches in men; and > 80 cm/31 inches in women) appears to be appropriate for Asian Americans. Elevated Triglyceride #Fibrates and nicotinic acid are the most commonly used drugs for elevated Triglyceride and reduced HDL-C. Patients taking one of these drugs are presumed to have high triglyceride and low HDL. > 150 mg/L (1.7 mmol/L) or Drug treatment for elevated triglyceride Reduced HDL-C < 40 mg/dL (1.03 mmol/L) in men < 50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) in women or Drug treatment for reduced HDL-C Elevated BP > 130 mm Hg systolic BP, or > 85 mm Hg diastolic BP, or Drug treatment for hypertension Elevated fasting glucose > 100 mg/dL or drug treatment for elevated glucose What is the primary goal of clinical management of metabolic syndrome? The primary goal of clinical mana gement of metabolic syndrome is to reduce the risk for clinical atherosclerotic disease. A second closely related goal is to reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients who are at high-risk. First line therapy is to reduce major modifiable risk factors such as cessation of t obacco use, target lowering LDL-C and triglycerides, raise HDL, and lower blood pressure and glucose levels to recommended goals. Both the long-term and short-term goals include interven tions to reduce metabolic risk f actors and include weight loss, increased physical activity, and diet modification to low fat intake. Refer to the section on medical nutrition therapy for additional information (pages 103-105). Blood pressure management including lifestyle changes are recommended for readings that range from 120 to 139 systolic and 80 to 90 mmHg diastolic. Readings higher than > 140/90 should be considered for drug therapies accordin g to current hypertension guidelines. When either diabetes or chronic renal disease is present, reducing blood pressu re to < 120/80 mm Hg, with drugs if necessary, is recommended. Table 2: Medication Therapy Action of Drug Drug Choices Commonly Used ATHEROGENIC DYSLIPIDEMIA Standard LDL-Lowering Drugs Medication therapy for the treatment of atherogenic dyslipidemia is based on NCEP guidelines and target lowering the LDL-C and raising HDL-C. Statins, exetimibe, and bile acid sequestrants (Recent research findings from the parent company Merck/Schering-Plough (2008) question the efficacy of exetimibe when combined with simvastatin (Vytorin)). Secondary Drugs Produce moderate reductions of LDL-C Nicotinic acid and fibrates are considered to be secondary drugs to lower non-HDL-C and to raise HDL-C after LDL-C goals are achieved. Severe Hypertriglyceridemia The fibrates or nicotinic aci d are first-line therapy for patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia for the purpose of preventing acute pancreatitis. CAUTION: Caution must be exercised in using fibrates (particularly gemfibrozil) with statins because of the accentuated risk for severe myopathy. Low Dose Aspirin Use of low-dose aspirin is recommended for individuals exhibiti ng the following: 2) a 10-year risk for CHD > 10%; 3) those with overt type 2 diabetes; 4) ASCVD; or 5) other high risk categories In patients with ASCVD in whom aspirin is contraindicated, considerati on should be given to use of clopidogrel. Treatment of IFG Drug therapy to reduce plas ma glucose or insulin resistance is not recommende d for patients with IFG. Once diabetes is diagnosed, drug therapy is indicated to achieve the recommended ADA goal for hemoglobin A1C of < 7% (6.5% per AACE). What are the therapeutic goals for long-term prevention of ASCVD? Refer to Table 3 for current therapeutic goals for the long-term prevention of ASCVD. Table 3: Therapeutic Goals for ASCVD Prevention Therapeutic Target Goals of Therapy Therapeutic Recommendations Abdominal obesity \u0099 Reduce body weight by 7%-10% during first year of therapy \u0099 Continue weight loss thereafter to extent possible with goal to ultimately achieve desirable weight (BMI < 25 kg/m2) Consistently encourage weight maintenance/ reduction through appropriate balance of physical activity, caloric intake, and formal behavioral programs when indicated to maintain/achieve waist circumference of < 40 inches in men and < 35 inches in women. Aim initially at slow reduction of and 7%-10% from baseline weight. Even small amounts of weight loss are associated with significant health benefits. Physical inactivity \u0099 Regular moderate- intensity physical activity; at least 30 minutes of continuous/intermittent (preferably 60 minutes) 5 days/week, but preferably daily In patients with established CVD, assess risk with detailed physical ac tivity history and/or exercise test to guide prescription. Encourage 30 to 60 min of modera te-intensity aerobic activity (e.g., brisk walk ing), preferably daily, supplemented by an increase in daily lifestyle activities (e.g. pedometer step tracking, walking breaks at work, gardening, household work). Higher exercise times achieved by accumulating exercise throughout day. Encourage resistance training 2 d/wk. Advise medically supervised programs for high-risk patients (e.g. recent acute coronary syndrome or revascularization, CHF). Atherogenic diet \u0099 Reduced intakes of saturated fat, transfat, cholesterol Saturated fat < 7% of total calories; reduce trans fat; dietary cholesterol < 200 mg/d; total fat 25%-35% of total calories. Most dietary fat should be unsaturated, simple sugars should be limited . References: 1.

Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) \u0099 The increase in gestational diabetes is consis tent with the current national obesity trends and epidemic of type 2 diabetes, further it pos es a significant public health risk of obesity and glucose intolerance in children. \u0099 Prenatal screening for GDM is important; how ever, there is controversy about whether screening should be universal or selective. \u0099 The ADA (2008) and the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine recommend screening for GDM using risk factor analysis at the first prenatal visit and later at 24 to 28 weeks by use of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). \u0099 According to the ADA, women with GDM are at extremely high-risk for developing type 2 diabetes and should be screened for diabetes six to twelve weeks postpartum and every one to two years to check for the deve lopment of diabetes or pre-diabetes. \u0099 Clinical studies show a correlation between GDM and the lifelong risk of type 2 diabetes related to progressive beta cell failure due to overcompensation by the body for ongoing insulin resistance. \u0099 The 2006 South Dakota Vital Statistics Report indicated that 4.9 pe rcent of mothers who gave birth in 2006 reported having gestational diabetes. What is gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)? Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as glucose intolerance that begins during pregnancy or is first recognized during pregnancy. The diagnosi s is independent of whether management is limited to diet or requires insu lin. It includes previous ly unrecognized glucose intolerance that predated pre gnancy. Nationally, 7 percent of pregnancies are complicated by GDM. Current data suggests that the prevalence of GDM has increased over time, and parallels the increased prevalence of obesity nationwid e. Approximately 700 cases of GDM occur each year in South Dakota. GDM affects maternal-child health and is associated with a potential for preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, and type 2 diabetes in the mother, and with higher rates of perinatal mortality, macrosomia, birth trauma, hyperbilirubinemia, and neonatal hypoglycemia in the infant. Who should be screened? The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) continues to recommend universal screening. Both the ADA and the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine recommend using risk factor analysis at the first prenatal visit and later at 24 to 28 weeks if indicated by use of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2006) concluded there was insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening for GDM, but mo re than 90 percent of obstetric physicians report screening all patients. The SD Diabetes Prevention and Control Program and the SD Diabetes Advisory Council curre ntly recommend universal scr eening. The American Diabetes Association (2008) recommends screening for GDM using risk factor analysis and, if appropriate, use of an OGTT. Patients at high-risk for GDM should undergo glucose testing as soon after confirmation of pregnancy as feasible, and then be retested at 24 to 28 weeks if the initial test is normal. Women at average risk should be screened at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation. The ADA continues not to recommend testing for low-risk women. Refe r to Table 4 below for 2008 screening and diagnosis criteria. While there is no definitive answer to the question of whether universal or selective screening is optimal, many medical centers choose to employ universal screening due to the difficulty involved in adhering to a selectiv e screening protocol in a busy practice. Universal screening is the more sensitive strategy, identifying near ly all women with GDM. Because of the high incidence of overt diabetes later in life, and the opportunity to provide counseling regarding life style at an early stage, missing the diagnosis of GDM may have long-term adverse effects. Table 4: Screening for and Diagnosis of GDM (ADA, 2008 Standards of Medical Care) Risk Determination Risk Factors Very High Risk for GDM Screening: Screening should be conducted using standard diagnostic testing ( fasting plasma glucose, symptoms of hyperglycemia, a casual plasma glucose > 200 mg/dl, or a 2-hour plasma glucose > 200 mg/dl during an OGTT ) as soon as possible after confirmation of pregnancy at first prenatal visit \u0099 Severe obesity \u0099 Prior history of GDM or delivery of large- for-gestational age infant \u0099 Presence of glycosuria \u0099 Diagnosis of PCOS \u0099 Strong family history of type 2 diabetes Higher Than Low Risk: Includes all women of hi gher than low risk of GDM, including those above not found to have diabetes early in pregnancy Screening: Should undergo GDM testing at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation \u0099 > 25 years old \u0099 Abnormal weight before pregnancy \u0099 High risk ethnic/racial heritage (Hispanic American, Native American, Asian American, African American, or Pacific Islander) \u0099 Family history of either type 1 or type 2 diabetes in first-degree relatives \u0099 History of abnormal glucose tolerance \u0099 History of poor obstetric outcome \u0099 History of fetal macrosomia (infant weight > 4000 grams) Low Risk Status: Is limited to any woman who meets all of the following criteria listed Screening: Does not require GDM screening \u0099 Age < 25 years old \u0099 Weight normal before pregnancy (body mass index of 25 or less) \u0099 Member of an ethnic group with a low prevalence of GDM \u0099 No known diabetes in first-degree relatives \u0099 No history of abnormal glucose tolerance \u0099 No history of poor obstetric outcome What screening test result should be used as a threshold for subsequent diagnostic testing? In the US, the current standard screening test is a 50-gram oral glucose load (either fasting or non-fasting) followed by a plasma glucose level one hour after the load. For those women who exceed the chosen threshold on a 50-gram sc reening, a diagnostic 100-gram OGTT may be performed on a separate day, if indicated. In the recent past, the ADA recommended specifi cally that a screeni ng result of 140 mg/dl warranted confirmation. In 2000 the ADA no longer recommended a specific threshold level, rather it suggested that a prude nt threshold lies somewhere be tween 130 mg/dl and 140 mg/dl. A threshold of 140 mg/dl will miss 20 percent of women with GDM, whereas a threshold of 130 mg/dl will miss 10 percent of women with GDM. Ho wever, the more sensitive but less specific threshold of 130 mg/dl will result in more false po sitive results. For example, 25 percent of all patients will screen positive when a threshold of 130 is used and will re quire a three-hour oral glucose tolerance test. The ADA suggests that administering a fasting 100- gram three-hour oral gl ucose tolerance test (OGTT) as an initial test may be appropriate in high-risk individuals or in high-risk populations. New data obtained from ACOG Fellows indicate that they are becoming more comfortable managing GDM and are following the universal scr eening with a 50-gram glucose one-hour test, medical nutrition therapy, exercise, and SBGM in patients identified with gestational diabetes. More than half of those surveyed indicated they evaluated their patients with the 75-gram, two- hour oral glucose tolerance test. How is the diagnosis of GDM confirmed? Confirmation of the diagnosis of GDM requires th at two or more of the four plasma glucose values obtained during a fasting 100-gram three-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) be elevated. In 2000 the ADA adopted the Carpenter-C oustan definitions for the upper limits of normal for OGTT values (see table below). Table 5: Confirmation of Diagnosis of GDM Upper limits of normal for OGTT Plasma glucose Carpenter-Coustan 3-hour 140 mg/dl What prenatal monitoring should be done in women with GDM? Glycemia Daily self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is superior to intermittent office monitoring of plasma glucose. For women treated with insuli n, postprandial monitori ng is superior to preprandial monitoring. Urine gluc ose monitoring is not useful. Ketonemia Urine ketone monitoring may be useful in detec ting inadequate caloric or carbohydrate intake in women treated with calorie restriction. Hypertensive disorders Serial blood pressure measurement is recomm ended. Serial urine protein measurement is recommended if hypertension exists. Fetal well-being Increased monitoring of fetal well-being is indi cated if fasting blood glucose levels are > 105 mg/dl or the pregnancy is post-term. The speci fic monitoring techniqu e employed, the time of initiation of the monitoring, and the freque ncy of the monitoring are dependent on the uniqueness of each patient and the cumulative fetal risk from GDM and other medical/obstetric conditions. Asymmetric fetal growth Ultrasound measurement of fetal abdominal girt h may be helpful in detecting women whose infants are at increased risk for macrosomia. De tection of asymmetrical growth, particularly during the third trimester, may identify fetuses th at would benefit from maternal insulin therapy. Macrosomic fetuses are a risk factor for shoulder dystocia and cesarean section. What treatment is prescribed for GDM? Diet and exercise All women with GDM should receive individuali zed medical nutrition therapy by a registered dietitian consistent with current ADA reco mmendations. Obese women (BMI > 30) whose caloric intake is reduced 30-33 percent (~ 25 kcal /kg actual weight per day) experience reduced hyperglycemia and lower triglyceride levels. Activ e lifestyles should be encouraged. Moderate exercise has been shown to lower maternal glycemia. A previous 1998 study by Major et al. showed that restriction of carbohydrates to 35-40 percent of total calories decreased maternal glucose leve ls and improved maternal and fetal outcomes. It is important to note that caloric restriction can lead to ketonemia and ketonuria, which can affect the fetus. Therefore, it must be done with great caution. Pharmacologic therapy Insulin is the pharmacologic therapy that has mo st consistently been shown to reduce fetal morbidity when used in conjunction with medical nutrition thera py. The ADA recommends initiating pharmacologic therapy when medical nutrition therapy fails to keep fasting whole blood glucose levels < 95 mg/dl, one-hour postp randial whole blood glucose levels < 140 mg/dl, or two-hour postprandial whole bl ood glucose level < 120 mg/dl. The goal of therapy is to maintain maternal glycemia below the above cut-off levels. Medication doses should be determined by whole blood/plasma assay finger stick measurements. Postprandial whole blood finger stick measurements are superi or to preprandial measurements. Currently, oral glucose-lowering agents ar e not generally recommended for use during pregnancy. Glyburide is not FDA approved for the treatment of gestational diabetes. The ADA feels that further studies are needed to establish it s safety. Recent evidence gathered from clinical trials has shown the efficacy and safety of oral agents during pregnancy and suggests the use of oral agents during pregnancy warrants further st udy. One author concluded that poorly controlled glycemia was responsible for development of fetal anomalies, not the oral agents used to control hyperglycemia. Is postpartum screening recommended? The ADA recommends that all women with GDM should be screened for gl ucose intolerance six to twelve weeks after delivery. Those women with a greater degree of glucose impairment during pregnancy have the greatest risk for persistenc e of glucose intoleran ce postpartum. All women with a history of gestational di abetes should be educated regard ing lifestyle modifications and the risk of developing insulin resistance. If postpartum glucose levels are normal, subsequent serial evaluation of gl ycemia should occur at a minimum of three-year intervals. If the results at six weeks postpartum show impaired fa sting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance, patients should be retested annuall y. All women with GDM should receive intensive medical nutrition therapy and prescribed individual exercise programs because of their very high risk of developing diabetes. Referra l to practitioners with expertis e in the education and care of adult diabetes is appropriate for women with postpartum impaired glucose levels. Patients with abnormal postpartum glucose levels should be referred to practitioners with expertise in the management of diabetes. What postpartum education is recommended? Diet and exercise Women should be encouraged to maintain a normal body weight with a regimen of medical nutrition therapy and exercise in an effort to reduce insulin resistance. Medications Medications that increase insu lin resistance (e.g. glucocorticoids and nicotinic acid) should be avoided if possible. The use of low dose estr ogen-progesterone oral contraceptives is not contraindicated in women prev iously diagnosed with GDM. Symptoms of hyperglycemia Women should be educated about the symptoms of hyperglycemia and encouraged to seek medical attention with th e advent of symptoms. Family planning and future pregnancies Family planning should be encour aged to assure optimal glycem ia monitoring and regulation in subsequent pregnancies. Implications for offspring Women should be advised of the need for their o ffspring to be monitored for the development of obesity and glucose intolerance. References: 1. ACOG Committee on Practice.

Obesity Treatment and Management of Type 2 Diabetes in Adults \u0099 In persons with type 2 diabetes, obesity is associated with poor control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol, and elevates risks of cardiovascular and microvascular disease. \u0099 Intentional weight loss is associated with a decrease in mortality in overweight persons with type 2 diabetes. \u0099 Weight loss is recommended to lower elevated blood glucose levels in overweight and obese persons with type 2 diabetes. \u0099 Weight loss and weight maintenance ther apy should employ the combination of reduced-calorie diets, in creased physical activity, and behavior therapy. \u0099 During the past two decades, the prevalence of obesity in adults has risen sharply. South Dakota statistics parall el those of the nation. \u0099 Healthy People 2010 goals for South Dakotans ar e to reduce overweight and obesity within state residents by promo ting physical activity and healthy eating. Currently 64.2 percent of a dults are overweight and 25.4 percent are classified as obese. What is the definition of obesity? Obesity is defined as a Body Mass Index (B MI) of > 30 kg/m2 with overweight being a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m2. Elevated BMI is only one factor related to risk in overweight or obese individuals. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recommends the addition of the following guidelines: \u0099 The individual's waist circumference (because abdominal fat is a predictor of risk for obesity-related diseases). \u0099 Other risk factors the individual has for diseases and conditions associated with obesity (e.g. hypertension or physical inactivity). What is the relationship between obesity and type 2 diabetes? As many as 90 percent of individuals with t ype 2 diabetes are ove rweight or obese. Not only is there a strong association between the presence of obesity and the development of type 2 diabetes, but obesity also complicat es its management. Th e presence of obesity exacerbates the metabolic abnormalities of type 2 diabetes, including hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and dyslipidemia. Obesity also increases insulin resistance and glucose intolerance and ultimately may contribute to excessive morbidity and mortality, mostly as a result of cardiovascular comorbidities su ch as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes. Additionally, obesity can contribute to musculoskeletal disorders, cancer, psychological and psychosocial disturbances, and quality of life impairments. There is strong evidence that weight loss produced by lifestyle modification can reduce blood glucose and A1C levels in pa tients with type 2 diabetes. What are the obesity treatment goals for people with type 2 diabetes? Weight loss is recommended to lower elevat ed blood glucose levels in overweight and obese persons with type 2 diabetes. Goals include: \u0099 Reduce body weight by 10 percent from ba seline through lifestyle modification (generally one to two pounds per we ek for a period of six months). \u0099 Maintain a lower body weight over the long term. \u0099 Prevent further weight gain. What is lifestyle modification? The components of an effective lifestyle modification program include dietary modification, physical activity, and behavior modification. Can weight loss be maintained? After successful weight loss, a program cons isting of dietary therapy, physical activity, and behavior therapy, which should be continue d indefinitely, enhan ces the likelihood of weight loss maintenance. A weight maintena nce program should be a priority after the initial six months of weight loss therapy. Research sugge sts that increased contact between a patient and a practiti oner is predictive of long-te rm weight loss maintenance. Table 6: Weight Loss and Weight Maintenance Therapy Treatment Component Strategy Dietary Therapy Low-calorie diets are recommended. Reducing dietary fat alone without reducing calories is not sufficient for weight loss. A diet that is individually planned to help create a deficit of 500 to 1000 kcal/day should be an integral part of any program aimed to achieve a weight loss of one to two pounds/week. Physical Activity Physical activity should be an integral part of weight loss therapy and weight maintenance. Initially, moderate levels of physical activity for 30 to 45 minutes, 3 to 5 days a week, should be encouraged with a long-term goal to accumulate at least 30 minutes or more of moderate- intensity physical activity on 5 or more days a week. Behavior Therapy Practitioners need to assess the patient's motivation to enter weight loss therapy, assess the readiness of the patient to implement the plan, and then take appropriate steps to motivate the patient for treatment. Behavior therapy strategies to promote diet and physical activity should be used routinely as they are he lpful in achieving weight loss and weight maintenance. References: 1.

Obesity in Children and Adolescents \u0099 The prevalence of overweight among children a nd adolescents has dramatically increased and is a significant public health concern. \u0099 Overweight in children and adolescents can be linked to a variety of adverse health outcomes, including type 2 diabetes mellitu s, obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome. \u0099 A BMI percentile > 5th and < 85th is considered normal weight for height; the 85th to the 95th percentile is considered overweight and > 95th percentile is defined as obesity. \u0099 Data from the SD BRFSS study showed that 16.4 percent of 5 to 19 year olds are overweight and an additional 16.6 percent are at risk of being overweight (2004-2005 SD Height and Weight Report). According to the CDC, since the mid 1970s, th e prevalence of overwei ght and obesity has dramatically increased in bot h adults and children. Data from two NHANES surveys show increases in overweight among children and teens. For children aged 2 to 5 years, the prevalence of overweight increased from 5.0 percent to 13.9 percent; for those aged 6 to 11 years, prevalence increased from 6.5 percent to 18.8 pe rcent; and for those ages 12 to 19 years, prevalence increased from 5.0 percent to 17.4 per cent. These increasing rates of obesity and overweight have significant imp lications to the health care co mmunity due to the increase in long-term chronic health problems for all gene rations of people. Being overweight/obese increases the risk for hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, co ronary artery disease, stroke, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis , sleep apnea and respiratory problems, and increased risk for some types of cancers (endometrial, breast, a nd colon). Statistics from South Dakota mirror national trends with 13.9 percen t of 2 to 5 years old listed as overweight (BMI-for-age 95th percentile and above) and an a dditional 18.1 percent are at risk of becoming overweight (BMI- for-age 85-94th percentile BMI-for-age). What contributes to overweight and obesity? There are a variety of factors that play a role in overweight/obesity. \u0099 Overweight and obesity result from an energy imbalance th at involves eating too many calories and not getting enough phys ical activity. This is direc tly related to large portion sizes of food and beverages, eating fast food, frequent snacking on high calorie, high fat foods, and consuming sugary beverages (soda, sweetened juices, sports drinks, etc.). \u0099 Body weight is directly relate d to genetic tendencies, metabol ism, behavior, environment, culture, and socioeconomic status. \u0099 Behavior and environment play a large role in causing people to be overweight and obese, and are target areas for pr evention and treatment activities. \u0099 Lack of physical activity is another contribu ting factor to overweight/obese children and adolescents. Less than one-th ird of high school students ( 28 percent) currently meet recommended levels of physical activity. Child ren aged 8 to 18 years of age are more sedentary and spend over 3 hours per day watchi ng television, playing video games, and other media devices. \u0099 Home, childcare, school, and community en vironments can influence children's behaviors related to food intake and physical activity. Over 80 percent of children over the age of 5 have working mothers and sp end an average of 40 hours per week in childcare facilities. Community environmen ts influence physical activity opportunities for children. Lack of sidewalks, safe bi ke paths, neighborhood parks, and access to affordable, healthy food choices can be ba rriers to physical activity and purchasing healthy foods. How is BMI used for screening for overweight and obesity in children? Body Mass Index (BMI) is a practical measure to determine overweight, and is determined by measuring weight in relation to height to determine weight status. BMI is the most widely accepted method used to screen for overweight and obesity in children and adolescents, as it is relatively easy to obtain height and weight measurements. For ch ildren and adolescents (aged 2 to 19 years), the result is plot ted on the CDC growth charts to determine the corresponding BMI- for-age percentile. Obesity is defined as a BMI at or above the 95th percentile for children of the same age and sex and is based on the 2000 CDC Gr owth Charts for the United States. A child's weight status is determined based on an age a nd sex-specific percentile for BMI rather than by the BMI categories used for adults. Classifications of excess for children and adolescents are age and sex-specific because children's body composition varies as they age and varies between boys and girls.

What efforts are currently in place to prevent obesity in South Dakota? The South Dakota Department of Health has developed a statewide plan for Nutrition and Physical Activity to Prevent Obesity and Other Chronic Disease (January 2006). This plan targets healthy eating and increased physical activity in both a dults and children to achieve a healthy Body Mass Index (BMI). Clinical toolkits to increase awareness of the overweight/obesity problem within the state are available to all healthcare providers through the South Dakota Department of Health. Because South Dakotans depend upon their personal physicians and health care provide rs for health-related counseling, it is hoped that the clinical toolkits will serve as a valuable resource in fighting the epidemic of obesity within the state. The American Medical Association, in collabora tion with the Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Services Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, convened an expert committee to develop recommendations on the assessment, prevention, and treatment of child and youth overweight and obesity. This expert panel representing fifteen professiona l organizations recently recommende d changing the terms used to describe pediatric obesity. If a child's BMI-for-age is between the 85th and 94th percentile in the CDC reference population for children matched for age and gender, the term to describe the chil d is \"overweight.\" The previous term used was \"at risk for overwe ight.\" If a child is at or above the 95th percentile for children of that age and gender, th e child is considered to be \"obese\" rather than the previous term \"overweight.\" The new terms overweight and obese provide continuity to adult definitions of overweight and obese and avoid confusion with the term \"at risk of overweight.\" Although the recommended cutoff points have not changed, thes e definition changes will not affect the prevalence rates of the BMI cat egories (Barlow et al, 2007). What cormorbidities are related to overweight and obesity in youth? Overweight and obesity in children is associat ed with a number of co morbidities that may present during childhood and adolescence. Limited data is available regarding the detrimental effect of overweight, but it is suspected to be similar to that of adults. See Table 7 for adverse outcomes related to childhood obesity. Table 7: Adverse Outcomes in Childhood Obesity Adverse Outcomes in Childhood Obesity Metabolic \u0099 Type 2 diabetes mellitus \u0099 Metabolic syndrome Psychological recommendations? Children < 85th percentile with no other health risk factors should be screened (weight, height, and BMI percentile calculated and plotted) at every well child visit or at least annually. Identification of risk for overwei ght before adolescence is encourag ed so that health habits can be improved at a stage of increased parental in fluence and control. See Table 8. Treatment of overweight should rarely be instituted before two years of age because of the rapid growth and development that occurs during these early year s and lower correlation with overweight in later years. Primary care providers should assess diet and activity habits at annual well child visits as part of the overall plan of care. Family involvement is critical in the treatment of childhood overwe ight. If treatment is initiated when a family is not ready to support the pr ogram, then success is unlikely. The treatment planned should also take into considerati on long-term management with the continued assessment of the child for adequate growth and development because overweight is a long-term problem. See Table 8. What are the guiding principles used in the treatment and management of overweight/obesity? The following five guiding principles provide an important framework for healthcare providers in the treatment of overweight /obese children and adolescent s. Treatment should focus on a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach, target ing eating, activity, and behavior modification in a structured outpatient setting. 1. Establish individual treatment goa ls and approaches based on the child's age, degree of overweight, and presence of co-morbidities. 2. Involve the family or major caregivers in the treatment. 3. Provide frequent assessment a nd monitoring of the patient, and track and store data for future reference and comparison studies. 4. Consider behavioral, psychologica l, and social correlates of weight gain in the treatment plan. 5. Provide recommendations for dietary changes an d increases in physical activity that can be implemented within the family environmen t and that foster optimal health, growth, and development. (American Heart Association, 2005) What is the 5-2-1-0 Healthy Behavior Method? The 5-2-1-0 Healthy Behavior Method is a prevention tactic that families can employ to get children to incorporate healthy lifestyle cha nges into their daily activities and manage overweight/obesity: Five: Eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables daily Two: Spend two hours or less of tele vision/media activities daily One: Get at least one hour of physical activity every day Zero: Consume zero sugar-sweetened beverages daily, limit eating out What are some of the reas ons for treatment failure? Physicians need to tailor their interventions to meet family needs, habits, culture, and risk factors. Physicians and office staff can learn the techniques and tools for utilizing motivational interviewing focusing on asking, listening, advi sing, and informing. Often patients are poorly motivated to make lifestyle or behavioral ch anges and feel a sense of futility and lack of empowerment in treatment of overweight/obesi ty. When treating overweight children and adolescents, parents need to be included in the plan of care and become motivated to achieve positive outcomes.

Pharmacologic Therapies for Glucose Management \u0099 Medication therapy can involve oral agents, insulin, or a combination of the two therapies, and is an integral component of blood sugar control in conjunction with diet and exercise. \u0099 Medication therapy is a ther apeutic tool for use in lo wering and maintaining blood glucose levels. Why is medication therapy used? Results from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and the Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT) conclusi vely revealed that lowering blood glucose reduces the risk of developing complications. Medi cation therapy is a potential therapeutic tool for use in accomplishing blood glucose goals when used in conjunction with diet and exercise. Using medication/insulin therapy in practice. \u0099 Weight gain can occur with insulin therapy in addition to some oral agents. (Insulin Detemir is an exception.) \u0099 The use of insulin secretagogues and insu lin can pose the risk of hypoglycemia. 1. This risk must be taken to achieve impr oved glycemic control; however, in some patients, such as the elderly, th e risks may outweigh the benefits. 2. Self-monitoring of blood sugars allows for better adjustment of therapy as well as better recognition and treat ment of hypoglycemia. 3. Ongoing communication between the patient and the diabetes care team is critical to reach glycemic goals. 4. Diabetes education informs the patient about the interplay between medications, carbohydrate intake, exercise, stress, and illn ess. This allows for better glycemic control. \u0099 Insulins glargine (Lantus) and detemir (L basal insulins with 24-hour duration. In a randomized double blind study conducted by Heise et al (2004), comparing the glucose lowering effects of insulin detemi r, glargine, and NPH in people with type 1 diabetes, results suggest that insulin detemir has a significantly more predictable glucose lowering effect than both NPH insulin and insulin glargine. \u0099 Lente and Ultra Lente insulins have been taken off the market. Refer to the Eli Lilly website for additional information. http://www.lilly.com/products/index.html \u0099 Insulin action (absorption a nd duration) may be variab le for different people. \u0099 The mixing of appropriate insulins and/or mu ltiple daily injections can improve blood glucose levels. (Refer to section on intensive insu lin therapy on page 51.) \u0099 As a general rule, the mixed insuli ns should be of the same brand. \u0099 Regular or analog (Lispro, aspa rt, and glulisine) insulins s hould be drawn up before the longer acting insulins to preven t contamination of the faster acting insulin, leading to dose variance. Detemir and glargine should not be diluted or mixed w ith any other insulin preparations or solutions. \u0099 Refer to the chapter on gestational diab etes for indications during pregnancy. \u0099 Care should be taken to not confuse clear insu lins such as glargine and detemir with rapid acting insulins. Please refer to the table on pa ge 48 for additional information on insulin. \u0099 Refer to Figure 2 on the following page for the current algorithm for metabolic management of type 2 diab etes (Nathan et al, 2006).

Until further data is available, this dr ug now carries a \"Black Box\" warning from the FDA advising patients and physicians to be aw are of signs of heart failure. Risk versus benefits regarding use of this drug should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, with mutual decision-making between the physician and patie nt (Nissen, 2007). Black Box warning further indicates that thiazolidinediones are \"not r ecommended in patients with symptomatic heart failure\" (Avandia and Acto s Product Information). Rosiglitazone has additional information in the \"Black Box\" warning regarding cardiac ischemia. A review of 42 studies (primarily comparing Rosiglitazone to placebo) found an increase in the occurrence of myocardial is chemic events. However, th ree studies comparing Rosiglitazone to other oral agent s to treat diabetes have not yielded definitive results (Avandia Product Information). Rosiglitazone (Avandia) Pioglitazone (Actos) Improves insulin adipose sites; Inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis. Requires 2-16 weeks of use before determining effectiveness Liver enzymes should be checked prior to initiation of therapy with Rosiglitazone and periodically thereafter per clinical judgment of the healthcare provider Rosiglitazone may increase HDL and LDL Pioglitazone decrease s triglycerides and increases HDL May cause weight gain and fluid retention Use with caution in patients with hepatic disease or with advanced heart disease Generally not indicat ed during pregnancy, breastfeeding, or in children Decreases oral contraception effectiveness and may cause resumption of ovulation in anovulatory women Medication Action Prescribing Considerations ALPHA -GLUCOSIDASE INHIBITORS Acarbose (Precose) Miglitol (Glyset) Delays digestion of carbohydrates, lowers rise in post-meal blood glucose.

Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: A consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy. Diabetes Care, 29 , 1963-1972. Intensive Insulin Management \u0099 Candidates for Intensive Insulin Management must be motivated to improve glucose control and be able to assume res ponsibility for their day-to-day care. \u0099 Use of Intensive Insulin Management should be initiated, monitored, and supported by a Comprehensive Diabetes Team. \u0099 Aggressive management of glycemic treatm ent goals with insulin may reduce morbidity in patients with severe acute illness, follo wing myocardial infarction, and in pregnancy to improve patient outcomes. \u0099 Intensive Insulin Management is essential during pregnancy. \u0099 The challenge of treating type 1 diabetes is to mimic physiologic insulin action. New insulins and new insulin delivery devices allow better basal and bolus insulin replacement than ever before. What is Intensive Insulin Management? Intensive Insulin Management is the strategy of making multiple adjustments in insulin dosage each day in order to achieve better glucose control with less hypoglycemia, less hyperglycemia, and more lifestyle flexibility. This strategy is us ed primarily by people with type 1 diabetes and is often the only means of achie ving an ideal level of glucos e control without excessive and unsafe episodes of hypoglycemia. The major emphasis is on making frequent adju stments in short-acting insulin dosages with regular insulin, lispro insulin (Hum alog), glulisine, or insulin aspart (Novalog). The dosage is typically altered based on the pre-meal blood gl ucose level, carbohydrate content of the meal, and sometimes also the anticipated level of physical activity. It is the preferred method of insulin dosing for most patients with type 1 diabetes and can be tailored to fit almost any lifestyle. The two types of insulin delivery for intensive insu lin therapy are continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or an insulin pump, a nd multiple daily injections (MDI). How is this different from conventional insulin management? Conventional insulin regimens usually consist of only two insulin injec tions per day using a mixture of short-acting and intermediate-acting insulins (such as regular and NPH). The dose is usually identical every day, and re quires patients to be very c onsistent about meal times, meal content, timing, and level of any strenuous activity. The use of a sliding scale is also considered conventional insulin management, as it reacts only to the current blood glucose level. Conventional insulin management rarely allows achievement of A1C goals, and requires the patient's lifestyle to revolve ar ound his or her insulin schedule. Learning how to adopt an Intensive Insulin Mana gement plan is complex and ideally involves the instruction and support of a comprehensive di abetes team. This team often includes the following: \u0099 Registered dietician, skilled in the teach ing of carbohydrate coun ting, to accurately estimate meal content. \u0099 Diabetes nurse educator who can instruct patients in proper self-monitoring of blood glucose, insulin administra tion, and other techniques. \u0099 Endocrinologist or other physician skilled in th e use and adjustment of intensive insulin regimens utilizing various combinations of insulin types, timing, and delivery devices such as insulin pumps. What are some examples of Intensive Insulin Management? The following are some examples of so me common intensive insulin regimens. Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) Patients utilizing this insulin stra tegy use a continuous subcutane ous insulin infusion pump worn 24 hours per day (it can be disconnected for s hort periods of time such as bathing). \u0099 Utilization of exclusively rapid-acting insulin such as lispro insulin or insulin aspart. Multiple Daily Injections (MDI) This regimen consists of multiple injections of insulin, three or four times per day, using a combination of short-acting and either long-acti ng or intermediate-acting insulin. Two insulin (Lantus) or detemir insulin (Levemir) at bedtime or in the morning as a fixed dose in combination with lispro insu lin, insulin aspart, Glulisine (Apidra), or regular insulin before each meal (v ariable dose as described above). \u0099 NPH insulin at bedtime and in the morning as a fixed dose in combination with lispro insulin, insulin aspart, or Apidra insulin be fore each meal (variable dose as described above). What are the benefits of insulin pump (CSII) therapy versus multiple daily injections (MDI)? There are several reasons people with diabet es may find an insulin pump provides better outcomes and more lifestyle flexibility than multiple daily injections. Frequently reported benefits include: \u0099 Less variation in insulin absorption (about 3 percent versus 25 percent) due to exclusive use of rapid acting insulin, single injection site, and elimin ating subcutaneous depot of insulin. \u0099 Fewer insulin injections (the subcutaneous cat heter is replaced every two or three days rather than three to four injections each day). \u0099 Can be programmed to more closely mimic nor mal pancreatic insulin secretion patterns (to accommodate working variable shifts, physical activity, nocturnal hypoglycemia, the \"dawn phenomenon,\" unpredictable lifestyle, high fat meals, etc.). \u0099 The pump assists with calculation of insulin doses based on carbohydrates ingested and on the blood sugar. \u0099 It can deliver insulin boluses accurately in 1/10 unit increments (rather than one or two unit increments as with conven tional injections). This is pa rticularly important in very insulin sensitive patients including young children. What are the drawbacks to intensive therapy? Highly motivated patients are able to overcom e many of these problems and achieve success. However, there are drawbacks/limitations to inte nsive therapy including, but not limited to the following: \u0099 A high learning curve is associated w ith pump therapy and continuous glucose monitoring. \u0099 Individuals must be committed to adapt to use of the pump, frequent blood glucose testing, additional injections of insuli n, and time to complete required cares. \u0099 Many physicians and other healthcare providers are unfamiliar with pump therapy and may not be able to provide the necess ary educational support to the patient. \u0099 Technical equipment failure may occur. \u0099 There is an increased risk of ketosis when only rapid-acting or short-acting insulin is used. \u0099 Skin irritation or infections may occur at the needle insertion sites. Frequent site changes are required. \u0099 Expenses associated with intensive therapy may not be covered by insurance, and will incur additional out-of-pocket expenses. \u0099 Hypoglycemia may occur as a result of aggressive therapy. What role does intensive therapy play in type 2 diabetes? Through the natural disease progression of type 2 di abetes, the resultant lo ss of beta-cell function eventually leads to the initiati on of insulin therapy. A number of different regimens have been studied and are currently available for use in type 2 diab etes to improve 24-hour glycemic control. Recent studies (DCCT and UKPDS) have shown that inte nsive therapy improves patient outcomes by reducing microvascular complications and reduced mortality rates of diabetes- related deaths. New recommendations from the American Diabetes Association encourage early use of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Previous insulin therapy was limited to NPH, lente, and ultra-lente insulin before the introduction of insulin analogs. Three rapid-acting insulin analogs\u2014 insulin lispro, insulin in sulin analogs\u2014insulin glargine and insulin detemir, are available and de monstrate consistent abilities to obtain target glucose levels and have a lower rate of hypoglycemia than NPH and regular insulin. Is intensive insulin therapy feasible or appropriate for all patients? As with any therapy, there are people for whom intens ive insulin therapy is not a practical or appropriate strategy. This may include patients with limited insight a nd judgment, those who cannot do accurate self-monitoring of blood gl ucose or estimate carbohydrate content, and patients who are not likely to benefit from impr oved glucose control. Intensive insulin therapy may be unsafe in patients with hypoglycemia una wareness. In the DCCT, the most common side effects of intensive therapy were a three-fold increase in severe hypoglycemic reactions and weight gain. Many patients with type 2 diabet es are less prone to hypoglycemia and can achieve good glycemic control on less intensive insulin regimens. A caveat to the increased inciden ce of hypoglycemia in the DCCT is that insulins used were less physiologic than the current insulin analogs. In addition, the increased hypoglycemia with the pump was cut in half as the trial progressed; sugg esting that familiarity with management of tight glycemic control improved as the trial proceeded (Pickup & Keen, 2002).

Hemoglobin A1C (A1C) \u0099 A1C target goals have been lowered. The ADA suggests a target A1C < 7 percent. The American College of Endocrinology s upports a target A1C < 6.5 percent. \u0099 The ADA recommends re-evaluation and significa nt change in treatment for anyone with an A1C > 8 percent. \u0099 Perform A1C testing at least two times a year in patients who are meeting treatment goals and who have stable glycemic control. \u0099 Perform A1C testing quarterly in patients whose therapy has changed or who are not meeting glycemic goals. \u0099 Use of point-of-care testing for A1C allows for timely decision-making regarding therapy changes, when indicated. \u0099 Glycemic control is best determined by evaluating a combination of both the patient's SMBG results and A1C results. \u0099 In 2006, 91.6 percent of BRFSS respondents wi th diabetes stated a healthcare professional had checked their A1C at least once in the previous year. \u0099 The Healthy People 2010 Objective 5-12 is to increase the pr oportion of adults with diabetes who have an A1C measurement at least once a year. What is A1C? A1C is one of a group of stable minor hemoglobin components, glycated hemoglobin, formed slowly and nonenzymatically from hemoglobin an d glucose. The rate of formation of A1C is directly proportional to the level of blood glucose. A single sample of hemoglobin contains red cells of various ages. Since the average life of a red cell is four months, a single A1C level reflects the blood sugar levels that red cells have been exposed to in the previous two to three months. Thus, A1C levels reflect the average of a person's blood sugar levels in the past two to three months. Certain clinical situations, incl uding frequent episodes of hypoglycemia, may alter the A1C level. Any clinical s ituation that increases erythroc yte turnover and increases the percentage of young circulating erythrocytes, such as a hemolytic anemia, will lower the measured A1C level. Other clin ical situations may interfere with the assay methodology, e.g. hemoglobinopathies, chronic alcohol ingestion, salic ylates, uremia, and sample storage effects. How often should an A1C be obtained? The A1C level should be measured at least every six months in all persons with diabetes. More frequent monitoring is appropriate if a person's diabetes is no t in control or if there are significant changes in management. A1C testing should be dependent on the clinical situation, the treatment regime used, and the judgment of the clinician (ADA, 2007). What assay does my lab use? There are several different types of assays fo r glycated hemoglobin. Some assays measure A1C directly; others actually measure total glycated hemoglobin and derive a calculated A1C result. The range of normal varies between assay types. Clinicians should be aware of the specific assay used in their laboratory and the range of normal values. If a patient changes the laboratory that measures their A1C, the clinician should consider that the results may vary from previous results because of a change in methodology and/or a new range of normal and not because of a change in the patient's clinical status. What is the goal for A1C? The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends a goal A1C of < 7 percent. Practitioners should re-evaluate, a nd in most cases significantly ch ange, the treatment regime for anyone with A1C levels consistently > 8 pe rcent. The American College of Endocrinology (ACE) and the American Association of Diabet es Educators (AADE) are recommending a target A1C of 6.5 percent. This more rigorous target goal is consistent with goal s currently in place in Europe. In patients without diabetes, an A1C of 4 to 6 percent is considered normal. Glycemic control markedly reduces the progressi on of microvascular complications. In the type 1 patients followed in the landmark Diabetes Co ntrol and Complications Trial, there was a 45 percent lower rate of progressi ve retinopathy in persons with a mean A1C of 8.2 percent as compared to patients with a mean A1C of 9 per cent. Patients with a mean A1C of 7.2 percent had a rate of progressive reti nopathy 33 percent lower than pa tients with a mean A1C of 8 percent. Glycemic control also delayed the onset and progression of rena l disease and diabetic neuropathy. More recent clinical trials continue to defend conclusions that improved glycemic control reduces risk of devel oping retinopathy and re duces cardiovascular disease events. Individualized goal setting to at tain a hemoglobin A1C level less than 7 percent is recommended in the majority of patients. However, less st ringent treatment goals may be appropriate for patients who are frail, elderly, experience adverse effects related to tight control, and those who have a short life expectancy due to comorbid conditions. Tight glycemic control benefits ty pe 2 patients as well. The initial results of a ma jor study of the effect of tight glycemic control in type 2 patients, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), were published in 1998. The principa l conclusions of that study to date are: \u0099 Vigorous treatment of hyperglycemia decreases the morbidity and mortality of type 2 diabetes. \u0099 Glycemic control reduces the risk of developing retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. The overall rate of microvascular complications was 25 percent lower in the intensive therapy group than in the conventionall y treated group. \u0099 The use of insulin, sulfonyl ureas, and metformin does not increase the risk of cardiovascular complications, thus there are no reasons not to treat glycemic levels aggressively. \u0099 Control of blood pressure reduces the risk of both microvascular and macrovascular disease. \u0099 The effects of glycemic control and blood pressure control are additive. \u0099 The effect of tight glycemic control on reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, amputation, a nd sudden death) did not reach statistical significance, though patients with the highest levels of gly cemia experienced a greater incidence in major events. What is the newest consensus statement of A1C measurement? The American Diabetes Association, Europ ean Association for th e Study of Diabetes, International Federation of Clin ical Chemistry and Laboratory Me dicine, and the International Diabetes Federation are calling for universal, wo rldwide standardization values for measurement of hemoglobin A1C. They have released a ne w equation and a new system for reporting blood glucose results. The new number will be repor ted as ADAG (A1C derived average glucose). Knowledge gained from the American Associ ation of Diabetes Gl ucose Trials (ADAG) indicated that elevated A1C values increase th e chances of microvascular complications from diabetes. Clinicians worldwide are calling for a universal measurement to monitor glycated hemoglobin A1C levels, with reporti ng of test results in scientifically correct units such as mmol/L, as a percentage value is not a measure. Results from the American Association of Diabetes Glucose Trials (ADAG) have identified a new equation to make numerical assessments of glycemic control more accessible to patients. Refer to the website for additional information www.easd.org . The equation: AG (average glucose in mmol/L) HbA1C - 2.52. Where mmol/L. (Note that 1 mmol/L = 18mg/dl.) With th is system, providers will have three numbers: the usual A1C percentage, the new IFCC versi on in mmol/L, and the new estimated average glucose. *R2 is defined as the root mean square error (the standard deviation of prediction error). The implications are that patients will find it ea sier to integrate this information into their management behaviors and improve control b ecause the average glucose scale matches that of glucose meters. Also, manufacturers of A1C equipm ent will need to update their software. Prior to this new information, the A1C was tied to the results of the DCCT, where a 6 percent was equal to 135 mg/dL. The change occurred as a result of checking and comparing values between A1Cs and values from over two thousand finger stic ks and averaging them out . Thanks in part to new technology, data from thousands of finger sticks, and use of continuous blood glucose monitors, results are more accurate. Use of this equation yields a linear correlation with a wide range of A1C values. This means that a 6 per cent A1C reading in no longer an average of 135 mg/d. The new number values are as 10% = 239 mg/dl Which measure is more important, the A1C or blood glucose? The ADAG trial showed no difference between LifeScan Monitor and CGM data. Conclusions from the study show that perhaps A1C is not the gold standard for correlati ng cardiovascular disease with glucose levels. Data presented at EASD showed that patients wi th the same A1C can have different \"area under the curve\" postprandial glucose (PPG). For th ese patients, high PPG values may be a better indicator of inflammation and CVD risk than A1C. It should be the combinations of data that will most help patients understand how the A1C and the average blood glucose are both important. (Reported at 2007 EASD Symposium) References: 1.

Available at: http://doh.sd.gov/Statis tics/default/aspx Retinopathy \u0099 Treatment is available for patients diagnosed with diabetic retinopat hy. Clinical research trials are underway and have identified ne w medications and treatment modalities to prevent loss of vision in patients with diabet es, in addition to lase r therapy (panretinal photocoagulation). Early dia gnosis and treatment through yearly comprehensive eye examination is essential to iden tify early disease progression. \u0099 Type 1 diabetes: Schedule yearly complete dilated and comprehensive eye examinations starting three to five years after diagnosis and/or at te n years of age, whichever is later. \u0099 Type 2 diabetes: Schedule yearly complete dilated and comprehensive eye examinations starting shortly after diagnosis. \u0099 Pregnant women with pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes : Schedule a first trimester examination w ith close follow-up during pregnancy and for one year postpartum. \u0099 Women with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who are planning pregnancies : Schedule a complete dilated and comprehe nsive eye examination pre-conception, with counseling on the risk of development and/or progression of diabetic retinopathy. \u0099 Cataracts and glaucoma are more common in people with diabetes. \u0099 In 2006, 72.0 percent of BRFSS respondents stated they had reported receiving a dilated eye exam within the previous 12 months , as compared to 77.1 percent in 2000. \u0099 Healthy People 2010 Objective 5-13 is for 75 percent of adults with diabetes to receive a dilated eye exam annually. \u0099 In 2006, 18.0 percent of respondents were told that diabetes ha d affected their eyes or that they had retinopathy, as co mpared to 23.7 percent in 2000. Retinopathy The prevalence of diabetic reti nopathy is strongly correlated with the duration of the disease. After 20 years of diabetes, nearly all persons with type 1 diabetes and > 60 percent of persons with type 2 diabetes will have some retinopat hy. Twenty-one percent of persons with type 2 diabetes will have retinopathy at the time of dia gnosis. Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of new cases of legal blindness in Americans ages 20 to 64 years, despite effective treatments to prevent visual loss or to restor e useful vision. Veteran's Affair Diabetes Trial (VADT) studies conclude that improving glycemic control and no rmalizing blood pressure may reduce the ocular morbidity of diabetes, especially in Af rican American and Hispanic patients. Women who develop gestat ional diabetes are not at increas ed risk for diabetic retinopathy. However, if these women subsequently develop t ype 1 or type 2 disease, their retinopathy risk increases like anyone el se with diabetes. What patients are at highest risk for developing retinopathy? Elevated A1C, as well as proteinuria, has been strongly correlated w ith increased risk for development of and progression of diabetic retinopathy. Poorly controlled systemic hypertension, proteinuria, and hyperlipidemia ar e all positively corr elated with both the incidence and the rate of progression of retinopathy. Pregnancy and puberty may accelerate microvascular progression. Women with pre-exis ting diabetes who are planning a pregnancy should be counseled on the increased risk for deve lopment of and/or the progression of diabetic retinopathy. Why is screening for retinopathy so important? Diabetic retinopathy is often asymptomatic in its early stages. Scr eening provides a cost- effective method of detection and treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy and macular edema. Prevention and screening programs have th e potential to bring sign ificant savings to the Medicare/Medicaid programs and improve the long-term health of patients in today's society. Because the retinal vascular complications of diab etes can result in permanent visual impairment, laser photocoagulation therapy can pr event loss of vision in most patients with severe nonproliferative and proliferative retinopathy. What is the recommended screening exam for retinopathy? Yearly dilated ophthalmoscopic examination is th e best current approach to annual screening. Indirect opthalmoscopy with slit lamp examinati on and measurement of the intraocular pressure are essential. Stereo fundus photography is a se nsitive method, but this modality has not been completely evaluated for efficacy as a screen ing method and is not in widespread use. Who should perform the screening exam? The American Diabetes Association suggests th at an Ophthalmologist or Optometrist with knowledge and experience in the diagnosis and management of diabetic retinopathy should perform the screening. What screening results necessitate a referral to a retinal specialist? Persons with clinically significant macular edema, moderate nonproliferative retinopathy, or any proliferative retinopathy requ ire the prompt care of an Ophthalmologist knowledgeable and experienced in the care of diabetic retinopathy. Cataracts and Glaucoma People with diabetes are at in creased risk for the development of cataracts and glaucoma compared to people without diabetes. A dilated and comprehensive eye examination is the best current approach to annual screening. References: 1. Aiello LP, et al. (1998). Diab etic retinopathy (Technical Review).

Foot Care and Neuropathy \u0099 Perform an annual comprehensive foot exam to provide foot self-care education and teach patients to identify risk factors that may be predictive of ulcers and amputation. \u0099 Foot exams can easily be performed in primar y care settings and should include use of a monofilament, tuning fork, palpation, and vi sual examination of the feet and lower extremities. \u0099 A multidisciplinary approach is recommended for individuals having foot ulcers and high-risk feet, especially those with a history of prior ulcer or amputation. \u0099 Refer patients who use tobacco or with prio r lower-extremity complications to foot specialists for comprehensive preventative care and to de termine a plan for life long monitoring. \u0099 Initial screening for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) should in clude a claudication history and assessment of pedal pulses. Cons ider obtaining arterial Dopplers to obtain early diagnosis as many patients are asymptomatic. \u0099 Patients with significant claudication, abnor mal Doppler studies, or positive ankle brachial index (ABI) should be referred to a vascular specialist for assessment and treatment with medications, exercise, and surgical options as indicated. \u0099 Identify patients with high-risk feet. \u0099 Closely monitor high-risk feet. \u0099 Consider peripheral vascular studies in pati ents with signs or symptoms of vascular compromise. \u0099 Ulcers should respond to tr eatment within a month. \u0099 Treat foot infections aggressively. \u0099 Patients with loss of sensation in feet and lower extremities require protective footgear - i.e. shoes and socks. \u0099 Foot ulceration is a precursor to 85 percent of lower extremity amputations in persons with diabetes. \u0099 In 2006, 74.9 percent of BRFSS respondents stat ed a health care professional had checked their feet for sores or irritations at least once in the previous year. \u0099 Healthy People 2010 Objective 5-14's goal is for 75 percent of a dults with diabetes to receive at least one foot examination annually. What are risk factors for ulceration? The first step in stopping limb loss is to identif y those at risk. Risk f actors for ulceration are distinguishable by general or systemic considerati ons versus those localized to the foot and its pathology. General or Systemic Contributions \u0099 Uncontrolled hyperglycemia \u0099 Duration of diabetes \u0099 Peripheral vascular disease \u0099 Blindness or visual loss \u0099 Chronic renal disease \u0099 History of circulatory disorders \u0099 Intermittent claudication Local Issues \u0099 Peripheral neuropathy \u0099 Structural foot deformity \u0099 Trauma and \u0099 Callus \u0099 History of prior ulcer/amputation \u0099 Prolonged elevated pressures \u0099 Limited joint mobility What is diabetic neuropathy? Diabetic neuropathy refers to the presence of signs and symptoms of peripheral nerve dysfunction in people with diabetes after excluding other causes, and can be motor, sensory, or autonomic. Diagnosis should be made after a th orough examination of the lower limbs including vibratory testing and use of a 5.07 monofilament. Absence of symptoms should not be assumed to indicate absence of signs. Loss of the ability to feel vibration is often the first sensation lost by diabetic patients. Confirmation of diagnosis can be confirme d by quantitative electrophysiology, sensory, and autonomic function testing. Diabetic neuropathies are heterogeneous and affect different parts of the nervous system, and can initially present with a plethora of diverse clini cal manifestations of fo cal or diffuse nature. Sensorimotor distal symmetric polyneuropathy (DPN) and the autonomic neuropathies are most common. DPN is considered to be a diagnosis of exclusion. According to Boulton et al (2005), early diagnosis and treatment of diabetic ne uropathy is important for the following reasons: \u0099 Nondiabetic neuropathies can be present in patients with diabetes mellitus \u0099 Currently a number of treat ment options are available \u0099 Approximately 50 percent of patients with DPN may be asymptomatic \u0099 Patients are at great risk of insensate injury to their feet \u0099 > 80 percent of amputations follow a foot ulcer or injury \u0099 Treatment includes early recognition and provision of patient education \u0099 Appropriate foot care may result in a re duction in the incidence of ulceration and ultimately prevent future amputation \u0099 Autonomic neuropathy may involve every system in the body \u0099 Autonomic neuropathy causes a substantia l increase in morbidity and mortality, especially if cardiovascular autonom ic neuropathy (CAN) is present What are treatment options? The first logical step in treatment is to normali ze glucose control to acceptable limits of normal. Research suggests that neuropathic symptoms may improve with control of blood sugars and avoidance or erratic excursions of hyperglycemia. Currently, a number of non-pharmacological interventions such as topical preparations (Capsaicin, glyceryl trinitrate , spray, patches, etc.), acupuncture, and physical therapy may be beneficial . Medications of benefit to patients include use of tricyclic anticonvuls or opioid-like drugs. Referral to pain clinics may offer some benefit. Aggressive control of blood gluc ose, A1C, blood pressure, lipids, and healthy lifestyle changes may result in reduced incidence of inju ry to the feet and lower extremities. I. Annual Comprehensive Foot Examinat ion with Risk Stratification The U.S. Department of Health and Human Service Monograph, Feet Can Last a Lifetime, includes sample patient education materials, a 5.07 Semmes-Weinstein nylon monofilament, practice management tools, and a comprehens ive resource list. A brief summary of the recommendations follows. A. Steps for Preventing Diabetes Foot Problems 1. Perform a comprehensive foot exam annually. \u0099 Examine skin, hair, toenails, musculoskele tal structure, and evaluate vascular status and protective sensation \u0099 Inspect footwear for proper fit, appropr iate materials, foreign objects, torn linings, and proper cushioning 2. Categorize your findings. Table 9: Risk Assessment of Lower Extremities Low Risk Risk All of the following: One or more of the following: Intact protective sensation Loss of protective sensation Pedal pulses present Absent pedal pulses No foot deformity Foot deformity No history of foot ulcer History of foot ulcer No amputation Prior amputation 3. Document your findings in the medical record. 4. Counsel your patients and/or refer to a diabetes educator. \u0099 Examine feet and lower extremities at each visit \u0099 Talk with your patients about their risk category \u0099 Demonstrate self-care techniques \u0099 Instruct patients to report injuri es, trauma, or signs of infection \u0099 Prescribe appropriate footwear \u0099 Give positive feedback for proper foot care \u0099 Counsel about tobacco cessation if needed \u0099 Exercise \u0099 Reinforce the importance of blood glucose control to reduce the risk for foot problems and other complications (A1C reduction) 5. Follow up with low risk patients. \u0099 Visually inspect feet at every visit \u0099 Inspect footwear at ev ery visit as warranted 6. Follow up with high risk patients. \u0099 Place a \"high risk feet\" sticker on medical record \u0099 Visually inspect feet at every visit \u0099 Inspect footwear at every visit \u0099 Prescribe special inserts and shoes as needed \u0099 Refer to specialist for a ri sk factor you cannot rectify \u0099 Use an interdisciplinary team approach to ensure positive patient outcomes (i.e. primary care physician, podiatry, surg eons, dietician, diabetes educator, home health, etc.) \u0099 Ensure that the elderly and blind have help for daily foot care II. Vascular Evaluation of the Lower Ex tremity in a Patient with Diabetes This section contains additional specific inform ation on the evaluation of the arterial supply to the lower extremities. A. History The patient should be asked about: \u0099 Calf, thigh, or buttock claudication \u0099 Pain at rest in feet and toes (vascula r rest pain is conf ined to the feet) \u0099 Circulation to the extremities \u0099 Previous sepsis \u0099 Other co-morbid conditions, and \u0099 Impaired renal function B. Physical Examination Identify: \u0099 Decreased subcutaneous tissues, and \u0099 Hair loss If there is any historical or physical suggestion of compromised blood supply to the forefoot or toes, even with palpable peda l pulses, non-invasive peripheral vascular testing should be ordered. C. Non-Invasive Peripheral Vascular Testing An objective assessment of the severity of peripheral arterial occlusion can be obtai ned by the use of one or more non-invasive diagnostic tests. Non-invasive testing is also helpful in patients with an equivocal history or physical exam. Typically, a professional w ith expertise in the subject will work in conjunction with the referring practiti oner to determine which tests ar e appropriate given the specific clinical scenario. Segmental measurement of blood pressu re and Ankle Brachial Index (ABI ) Serial placement of a blood pressure cuff and Doppler auscultation allows measurement of blood pressure along the legs. Normally, blood pressures in the legs and arms are equal. In fact, ankle pressure may be slightly higher than arm pressure. The ABI is the ratio of the arteri al pressure in the ankle to that in the arm. The ABI in normal individuals is > 1.0. The ABI in individuals with moderate to severe occlusive diseas e is < 0.7. Additionally, a drop in blood pressure of 20 mmHg or more between leve ls indicates disease in that arterial segment. One of the pitfalls in patients with diabetes is that calcified vessels may give falsely elevated pressu res, therefore definite di agnosis via Doppler studies should be considered. Pulse-Volume Recording (PVR) Significant arterial occlusion decreases the normal volume displacement in the legs that occurs with each pulse and alters the waveform output of the test. Flat or barely pulsatile tracings at the ankle indicate modera tely severe to severe ischemia. Doppler Flow Velocity contour of the Doppler waveform is fl attened with significant disease. This test gives similar information to the PVR. Monophasic flow on Doppler studies and non-healing/slow heali ng wounds may merit further study or referral to a specialist. Treadmill Testing Treadmill exercise testing allows assessm ent of functional li mitation. Decline of the ABI after exercise supports the diagnosis of vasc ular occlusion if history and physical exam are equivocal. This test most frequently is used for patients with normal pulses who have symptoms of claudication to di stinguish between vascular and neurogenic claudication. D. Clinical Scenarios Using Non-Invasive Peripheral Vascular Testing If there are any clinical signs or symptoms of peripheral vasc ular compromise, the patient shoul d undergo non-invasive testing. An ABI of < 0.7 and flat or barely pulsatile PVR tracings at the ankle indicate moderately severe to severe ischemia. Treadmill testing may be helpful if initial results are normal at rest and the pa tient has a strong history of claudication. If a patient is at high-risk for foot probl ems but does not have signs or symptoms of vascular occlusion, a non-invasive test i s indicated to establish a baseline. Examples of high-risk foot conditions incl ude the presence of abnormal foot structure or biomechanics, ne uropathy, and employment that requires ex tensive walking or standing. III. Management of Diabetic Foot Ulcers Ulcers should heal. There are three core therapies of diabetic ulcers: \u0099 Topical therapy \u0099 Pressure reduction dressing \u0099 Edema reduction dressing Emerging technologies that may play a role include growth factors and artificial skin substitutes. Surgical interventions are sometimes necessary, e.g. debridement, bone resection, arthrodesis, tendon lengtheni ng and rerouting, and skin flaps. The presence of an ulcer or the history of a pr evious ulcer should stimulate an evaluation of the underlying cause and appropriate preventiv e management. Specific consideration should be given to the possibility of previ ously undetected vascular compromise. IV. Management of Diabetic Foot Infections All patients with diabetes should be proactivel y encouraged to seek early evaluation at the first suggestion of infection. Pain and tendern ess are not consistent findings and should not be used to judge either the presence of infection or the progress of treatment. A. Infection Classification Severity of infection is based on clinical exam: Type I (mild) infections are charac terized by mild erythema of skin, minimal edema, and only minor breaks in the skin, e.g. superficial ulcer, small laceration, blister. There is no osteomyelitis or systemic toxicity. Type II (moderate, limb threatening) infecti ons usually surround a chronic ulcer. Ulceration extends to deep tissues but no bone is exposed. Edema may extend to the forefoot. Cellulitis is typically present. Purulent drainage and osteomyelitis may be present. Type III (severe, limb and life threatening) infections are typically odorous and draining purulent material. Erythema, celluli tis, and lymphatic streaking are typical. There may be gangrenous, wet, black soft ti ssue present. Bone or joint space may be exposed. Osteomyelitis may be present. Signs and symptoms of systemic toxicity may be present. B. Diagnosis Physical Exam * -Probe bone for soft areas suggestive of osteomyelitis -Probe wound for tracking and undermining -Document wound area and depth -Periodically evaluate wound size and vol ume to gauge response to therapy -Pain and tenderness are not consistent findings *Practitioners unfamiliar w ith wound probing should consult or refer to a physician with training and experience with this assessment. Laboratory -Culture purulent drainage, abscesses, and tissue from deep debridement -Usually avoid culture of superficial lesions as these results are not particularly helpful -Blood cultures are appropriate in serious infections -CBC in Type II and III infections -Renal and liver function tests if needed to guide antibiotic choice -Sedimentation Rate (WESR) may be useful\u2014if elevated, consider osteomyelitis Radiology osteomyelitis not always identifia ble by routine radiographs or CT scans, except in the late phases -Plain radiographs may reveal soft tissue gas in deep infections -Serial radiographs aid monitoring erosive changes in chronic lesions, and are the most useful -Bone scans may not always be helpful in making the diagnosis of osteomyelitis (three phase is necessary) -Bone scans are helpful in detecting a Char cot fracture, as the cause of an acutely swollen foot with no open lesion C. Treatment Type I infections with no evidence of peripheral vascular obstruction may be treated with outpatient oral antibiotics. The most likely organisms are Staphylococcus or Streptococcus. Patients should be seen again in 24 to 48 hours. If there is no improvement within 48 hours, hospital ad mission is indicated for bed rest, wound care, and intravenous antibiotics. If the pati ent has peripheral vascul ar disease, initial hospitalization and surgi cal consultation are reco mmended. Consultation with podiatry is appropriate if underlying deformity or altered biomechanics are present. If there is no response to therapy or re-infection occurs, one should re-evaluate vascular supply, wound care, and antibiotic t herapy. Consultation with an expert in the management of diabetic foot infection is also appropriate. Type II infections necessitate in-hospital intravenous antibiotic therapy. Surgical consultation is indicated for drainage, debridement, and culture. Infectious disease consultation is appropriate. Type II and III infections are typically polymicrobial (gram negative rods, anaerobes, and enterococci). Type III infections are a surgical emergency. Immedi ate surgical drainage and/or amputation is necessary. Infectious disease consultation is appropriate. Type II and III infections are typically polymicrobial (gram negative rods, anaerobes, and enterococci). Please refer to Figures 3 and 4 and Table 10 on the following pages.

Blood Pressure \u0099 Measure blood pressure at every visit. \u0099 The goal for blood pressure is less than 130/80 mmHg. \u0099 Patients with hypertension > 140/90 should receive drug thera py, lifestyle, and behavioral therapy. \u0099 Elevated blood pressure is a major risk f actor for cardiovascular and renal diseases, including stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and kidney failure. \u0099 A recent National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) survey indicated that 27 per cent of adults have a systolic BP > 140 mmHg, diastolic BP > 90 mmHg, or currently take antihypertensive drugs. Another 31 percent have pre- hypertension and are not on medication. \u0099 The lifetime risk of developing hypertensi on among adults > 50 years of age is 90 percent. Why is control of blood pressure important? Hypertension contributes to the development and progression of chronic diabetic complications. Control of hypertension reduces the rate of pr ogression of diabetic nephropathy and reduces complications of hypertensive nephropathy, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease. Antihypertensive treatment has been shown to decr ease the rate of mortality from 43 percent to 9 percent in the first 16 years afte r the development of diabetic ne phropathy. Need for dialysis and transplantation was reduced from 73 percent of patients to 31 pe rcent of patients in the same period. In type 1 diabetes, persistent hypertension is often a manifestation of diabetic nephropathy. In type 2 diabetes, hypertension ofte n is part of a syndrome includi ng glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease (also known as the metabolic syndrome). Isolated systolic hypertension may occur in both types of diabetes and is due, in part, to inelasticity of atherosclerotic large vessels. What are appropriate trea tments for high blood pressure in someone with diabetes? Lifestyle Modifications Lifestyle modifications are the first therapy to be employed to treat hypertension, unless the need to reduce the level of hypertension is emergent. Modifications include: \u0099 weight loss \u0099 exercise \u0099 limiting of dietary sodium to 100 mmol (2,300 mg) of sodium per day \u0099 limiting alcohol consumption to no more than 1-2 drinks per day \u0099 tobacco cessation Individualized goal setting to at tain a blood pressure of < 130/80 is recommended in the majority of patients. However, less stringent treatment goals may be appropria te for patients who are frail, elderly, experience adverse effects related to tight control such as falls, and those who have a short life expectancy due to comorbid conditions. ACEI (angiotensin converting enzyme or clinical proteinuria, ACEI and ARBs are indicated as part of the initial treatment plan. ACEIs and ARBs have an additional benefit to patients with diabetes in that they decrease the rate of progression of renal disease beyond what would be predicted by contro lling their hypertension. Additional Pharmacologic Treatment If after four to six weeks of initial treatment blood pressure goals have not been reached, additional pharmacological treatment is indicate d. Medications should be added in a stepwise fashion. Conclusions from recent clinical trials (An tihypertensive and Lipid-lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial-ALLHAT ) indicate the superiority of use of thiazide diuretics as first- line therapy in preventing cardiovascular disease a nd for their cost effectiveness. However, the presence of concomitant diseases (especially di abetes, vascular disease, fluid overload, etc.) should be considered when choosing medications. Information or advice about medications or treatment strategies for hyperten sion is available from a physicia n experienced in the care of patients with diabetes and renal disease. ACEIs, ARBs, calcium channel blockers, and lo w dose diuretics are associated with fewer adverse effects on glycemic control, lipid pr ofiles, and renal func tion than other anti- hypertension medications. What are treatment goals for isolated sy stolic blood pressure in someone with diabetes? For patients with isolated systolic blood pre ssure of > 180 mmHg, the goal is a blood pressure < 160 mmHg. For patients with systolic pressu re between 160 and 179, the goal is a 20 mmHg reduction. Further lowering to 140 mmHg or less is appropriate if the initial reduction is tolerated. References: 1.

Renal Disease/Nephropathy \u0099 Screen urine for evidence of renal disease ever y year in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. \u0099 For patients with nephropathy, the major goal is to maintain BP < 130/80 mmHg. \u0099 Achieving target glucose goals reduces th e risk and/or slows the progression of nephropathy . When should screening occur for diabetic renal disease? The first clinical evidence of di abetic nephropathy is the appearan ce of a small excess amount of albumin in the urine termed microalbuminuria (> 30 mg albumin excretion per day). Persons with microalbuminuria are referred to as having incipient nephropathy and are likely to progress to clinical proteinuria and decreasing renal function over a period of years. Clinical proteinuria is defined as > 150 mg of protein excretion per day. Normally, small amounts of protein can be found in the urine, bu t usually this does not exceed 150 mg/24 hours, of which about 10 mg is albumin. When the le vel of albumin in the urine reaches 30 to 300 mg/day, it is considered low-leve l albuminuria or microalbuminuria . If the level is greater than 300 mg/day, it is termed macroalbuminuria. Persons with clinical proteinuria are referred to as having overt nephropathy. Once clini cal proteinuria occurs, the risk of progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is high in both type 1 and type 2 disease. Additionally, microalbuminuria is a marker for in creased cardiovascular risk, and, if present, is an indication for screening for vascular diseas e and aggressive intervention to reduce other cardiovascular risk factors, e.g., dyslipidemia, t obacco use, inactivity. In addition, there is some preliminary evidence to suggest that lowering of cholesterol may also reduce the level of proteinuria. What is the glomerular filtration rate? The glomerular filtration rate (GFR ) is an estimate of the filtering capacity of the kidneys. It is usually expressed as milliliters (mL) per minut e (min) and adjusted to a \"standard\" body size with a surface area of 1.73 meters2. The normal GFR ranges between 95 to 120 mL/min/1.73m2 but it varies depending on age , gender, and body size. GFR remain s the most accurate index of kidney function, and is a key element of early mana gement of chronic kidney disease. Refer to Table 11 to view the stages of chronic kidney disease. Commonly Used Formulas (Cockroft-Gault): Female: Male: Web Links for GFR patient's glomerular filtra tion rate, scroll down on the page and click on \"calculate your GFR rate.\" Table 11: Stages of Chronic Kidney Disease Stage Degree of Damage GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2)a 1 Kidney damage with normal or increased GFR 90 2 Kidney damage with mildly decreased GFR 60-89 3 Moderately decreased GFR 30-59 4 Severely decreased GFR 15-29 5 Kidney failure < 15 GFR = glomerular filtration rate. When should screening begin? Because renal disease rarely develops in short du ration type 1 diabetes, screening in persons with type 1 diabetes should start with the beginning of puberty or afte r five years from the initial diagnosis. Because of the difficulty in precise dating of the onset of type 2 diabetes, screening should start at the time of diagnosis. What screening tests should be used? The initial screening test in all adult patients is a routine urinalysis because some patients will already have clinical proteinuria (>150 mg/day), which is detectab le by routine urinalysis. If the routine urinalysis is positive for protein, a quantitative measure of the amount of proteinuria is indicated. Such measures include spot or 24-hour collection for urinary pr otein/creatinine ratio. If the urinalysis is negative, a test for the pr esence of microalbuminuria is indicated. Three screening methods are available: 1. Albumin/creatinine ratio in a single urine sample 2. 24-hour urine collection fo r albumin and creatinine 3. Timed collection (4 hour or overn ight) for albumin and creatinine First void or morning samples ar e preferred for the single urine sample technique. If this timing is not possible, all samples for a given individual should be collected at the same time of day to minimize the effect of normal diurnal variation in albumin excretion. Specific assays are required to detect microalbumi nuria as routine urinalysis and other standard assays for protein are not sufficiently sensitive. Screening with reagent tablets or dipsticks specific for microalbuminuria are 95 percent sens itive and 93 percent specific. However, because testing by reagent tablets or dipsticks is subject to error from alterations in urine concentration, all positive results should be confirmed by one of the three more specific methods mentioned above. Because there is day-to-day variability in albumin excr etion, at least two of three collections done in a three to six month period should show elevated levels before designating a patient as having microalbuminuria. Refer to Fi gure 5 for algorithm of current recommendations for screening for renal disease. Table 12: Categorization of Abnormal ities in Albumin and Protein Excretion Category Spot Collection 24-Hour Collection Timed Collection Normal < 30 ug albumin/mg creatinine < 30 mg albumin/24 hours Microalbuminuria 30 to 299 ug albumin/mg creatinine30 albumin/24 hours 20 albumin/minute Clinical proteinuria* > 300 ug protein/mg *Some nephrologists suggest that onc e clinical proteinuria is detect ed, teasing out that portion of total protein that is albumin adds no useful information. What are treatment options and goals fo r patients with diabetic nephropathy? Facts: \u0099 Achieving normoglycemia will decrease the rate of progression to overt nephropathy. \u0099 Lowering blood pressure will retard the deve lopment of overt nephropathy and decrease its rate of progression. \u0099 Angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or Angiotensin II (ARBs) should decrease the level of albuminuria /proteinuria and the rate of progression to ESRD. Options: \u0099 ACE inhibitors or ARB use has been emphasized for nephropathy screening and treatment by the ADA (2008). Ace inhibitors ar e indicated in all type 1 patients with microalbuminuria even if they are normotens ive. Use of ACE inhibi tors in normotensive type 2 patients with microalbuminuria is less substantiated by studies. If a type 2 patient has progression in the amount of albuminuria or develops hyperten sion, ACE inhibitor or ARB treatment then becomes clearly indicated. \u0099 Protein restriction to < 0.8 grams/kg/day is not recommended. Further restriction can be considered in patients with advancing re nal dysfunction, symptomatic uremia, or in consultation with a physician experienced in the care of patients with renal disease. \u0099 Tobacco cessation is beneficial for renal functi on in diabetic patients. There is substantial evidence for the adverse effect of smoking on re nal functional deterioration in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes . Goals: \u0099 The major goal is to mmHg. \u0099 Serum creatinine and urinary protein excreti on should be measured every three to six months until stable and then annually. (Urinary protein excretion should be measured as an albumin/creatinine ratio in a patient with incipient nephropathy and as a protein/creatinine ratio in a pa tient with overt nephropathy.) Goals have not been established for the amount of albuminuria in patients with incipient nephropathy or the amount of prot einuria in patients with overt nephropathy. Expert opinion is that less albuminuria or proteinuria is bett er. The committee members suggest the following goals: \u0099 For patients with incipient nephropathy (micro albuminuria), the goal of treatment is to stabilize or reduce the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio. \u0099 For patients with overt nephr opathy (clinical proteinuria), the goal of treatment is to maintain or reduce the urinary protein/creatinine ratio to < 1. (Currently available therapy does not necessarily ensure that even these goals can be achieved.) Figure 5 is listed aft er the reference page. References: 1.

Vigorous exercise within 24 hours, infection, fever, congestive heart failure, marked hyperglycem ia, and marked hypertension may elevate urinary albumin excretion over baseline values an d invalidate test results. Lipid Management for Adults \u0099 Obtain an annual fasting lipid profile for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and more often if needed to achieve goals. \u0099 The treatment goal for patients with diabetes is an LDL less than 100 mg/dl. For those patients with known significant high risk, as in macrovascular disease (CVD), the goal is an LDL less than 70 mg/dl. Why is control of lipid abnormalities important? Diabetes is one of the major risk factors for vascular disease, along w ith smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and a family history of premature coronary heart dis ease. In type 2 diabetes there is an increased risk for obesity and lipid abnormalities that is independent of glycemic control. Because of the two to four fold increase in the prevalence of va scular disease in persons with diabetes, it is important to identify and manage all modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. The goal of lipid management is to prevent the de velopment or progression of vascular disease. What is the relationship between blood lipid levels and coronary heart disease risk? Table 13 illustrates risk levels for coronary heart disease (CHD) with varying levels of LDL, HDL, and triglycerides in the gene ral population. No clin ical trial has been done on the effects of lipid-lowering agents on subsequent coronary heart diseas e in a diabetic population, though diabetic subjects have been included in some of the major trials such as the Scandinavian Simvistatin Survival Study (4S study), the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events Study (CARE Study), and the Helsinki Hear t Study. The 4S and CARE st udies provide evidence that pharmacologic therapy with statin drugs (HMG co-A reductase inhibitors) reduce CHD events (and mortality in 4S) in diabet ic subjects with known CHD. Table 13: Risk Levels for CHD and Blood Lipid Levels CHD Risk LDL (men and women) HDL (men) HDL (women) Triglyceride (men and women) High > 130 mg/dl < 35 mg/dl < 45 mg/dl > 400 mg/dl Intermediate 100 to 129 mg/dl 35 to 45 mg/dl 45 to 55 mg/dl 200 to 399 mg/dl Low < 100 mg/dl > 45 mg/dl > 55 mg/dl < 150 mg/dl What diagnostic tests for hyp erlipidemia are appropriate? Adult patients should be evaluate d annually. Testing should include: \u0099 fasting total cholesterol \u0099 fasting triglyceride \u0099 HDL cholesterol \u0099 calculated LDL cholesterol If all values are normal, less fre quent testing may be appropriate. If the lipid profile is abnormal, consideration should be given to correctable secondary causes such as hypothyroidism (which has an increased prevalence in people with diab etes), poor glycemic control, medications (i.e. thiazides, steroids), and alcohol consumption. What are the thresholds for initiati ng treatment for hyperlipidemia? The 2001 Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III) of th e National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recognizes diabetes as a CHD risk e quivalent. The recommendations for people with diabetes mirror those of a patient with either esta blished CHD or a risk factor profile that would confer a 20 percent ten-year ri sk of a CHD event. Tools for the convenient calculation of a patient's risk of CHD on a computer or pers onal digital assistant device may be downloaded from the NCEP2. Consideration is not given to gender b ecause it is felt that women and men with diabetes are at a similarly high risk. What are the treatment goals for hyper lipidemia in persons with diabetes? Table 14 illustrates hyper lipidemia treatment thresholds for people with CHD or a CHD risk equivalent. Table 14: Hyperlipidemia Treatment Th resholds for People with CHD/CHD Risk Equivalent LDL Goal LDL level at which to initiate lifestyle Rx LDL level at which to consider drug Rx CHD or CHD Equivalent < 100 mg/dl > 100 mg/dl > 130 mg/dl (100 to 129 mg/dl)* *Some authorities recommend use of LDL loweri ng drugs if goal LDL < 100 mg/dl cannot be achieved with lifestyle changes. *Some authorities recommend treating to less than 70 mg/d if at high risk. What are the priorities for management of lipid abnormalities in people with diabetes? In general, all people with diabetes who have lipid abnormalities should ha ve a trial of medical nutrition therapy, exercise, and optimization of gly cemic control. Monitor for previous hepatitis history, obtain baseline li ver function studies, and monitor foll ow-up as indicated. Refer to Table 15 for priorities and options for pharmacologic management of dyslipidemia. Table 15: Priorities and Options for Ph armacologic Management of Dyslipidemia Priorities and Options for Pharmacologic Management of Dyslipidemia First priority is to lo wer the LDL cholesterol. \u0099 First choice of pharmacologic treatment is a HMG CoA redu ctase inhibitor (statin). \u0099 Second choice for treatment is a bile acid binding resin (resin), or fenofibrate. \u0099 Improved glycemic control will decrease the LDL level but has a more pronounced effect on lowering elevated triglycerides than on lowering elevated LDL. Second priority is to raise th e level of HDL cholesterol. \u0099 Behavioral interventions such as weight loss, increased physical activity, and tobacco cessation may be useful. \u0099 Pharmacologic treatment is generally not very effective. \u0099 Nicotinic acid may be used, but is relatively contraindicated due to its potential to worsen glycemic control. Third priority is to lower the triglyceride level. \u0099 The best method to lower the triglyceride level is to achieve glycemic control. \u0099 Fibric acid derivative (gemfi brozil or fenofibrate) is the second management option. \u0099 Treatment with statins is m oderately effective at high dos ages in hypertriglyceridemic subjects who also have high LDL cholesterol. Newer statin drugs su ch as atorvastatin may offer advantages for lowering triglycerides and raising HDL. If there is combined hyperlipidemia : First choice of therapy: 1. Improved glycemic control plus high dose statin Second therapy choice: 1. Improved glycemic control plus statin pl us fibric acid derivative (gemfibrozil, fenofibrate) Third therapy choice: 1. Improved glycemic control plus resi n plus fibric acid derivative, or 2. Improved glycemic control plus statin plus nicotinic acid* (glycemic control must be monitored carefully) The combination of statins with nicotinic acid (niacin) and especially with gemfibrozil may carry an increased risk of myositis. *Nicotinic acid must be used with caution b ecause of a tendency to worsen glycemic control.

Immunization Recommendations \u0099 Annual influenza vaccine is recommended for all patients with diabetes > 6 months of age. \u0099 Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for all patients with diabetes. Revaccination is recommended for individuals > 64 years prev iously immunized before age 65 if the vaccine was administered more than 5 years ago. \u0099 Other indications for repeat vaccination include nephrotic syndrome, chronic renal disease, and other immunocompromised states, as following transplantation. \u0099 In 2006, 80.4 percent of BRFSS respondents with diabetes reported receiving a flu shot in the previous 12 months. \u0099 Also in 2006, 78.4 percent of BRFSS responders with diabetes report they had previously received a pneumococcal immunization. \u0099 Healthy People 2010 Objective 14-29 's goal is for 60 percent of adults with diabetes to receive an influenza vaccination yearly, and for 60 percent of adults with diabetes to receive a pneumococcal vaccination. Why are immunizations important for people with diabetes? People with diabetes mellitus are six times more likely to be hospitalized during an influenza outbreak than those without diabetes. Pneumoco ccal infections cause 40,000 deaths annually in the United States; the highest mortality occurs among the elderly and pa tients with underlying medical conditions including diab etes. Many influenza and invasive pneumococcal infections are vaccine preventable. What are the recommendations for receiving the influenza vaccine? Annual vaccination is recommended in all patients with either type 1 or 2 diabetes. Split virus and whole virus vaccine preparations are availabl e. The manufacturer's package insert should be reviewed for current year dose recommendations. The optimal time for vaccination is late October through mid December, but vaccination at any time during the winter offers benefit. Overseas travel plans may necessitate adjusti ng the vaccination schedule. Women with diabetes who will be in at least the 14th week of gestation during influe nza season (December to March in the U.S.) should receive an influenza vaccine. Contraindications Known anaphylactic hyperse nsitivity to eggs or to other components of the influenza vaccine contraindicates vaccination, unless there is a high risk of complica tions from influenza infection and appropriate allergy evaluation and desensitization has occurred. Moderate to severe acute illness is also a contraindication until symptoms ha ve abated. Mild illness with or without fever is not a contraindication. Vaccine manufacturer's package insert should be reviewed for product specific cautions and contraindications. Concomitant administration of other vaccines Influenza vaccine may be administered at the sa me time, at a different site, or with other vaccines without increasing side effects or reducing efficacy. Speci fically, influenza vaccine may be given at the same time as pneumococcal vaccine. Who can use the nasal-spray flu vaccine LAIV (FluMist\u00ae)? LAIV (FluMist\u00ae) is approved for use in hea lthy* people 2 to 49 years of age who are not pregnant. Breastfeeding is not a contraindication for FluMist\u00ae . The nasal-spray flu vaccine LAIV (FluMist\u00ae) can be given to people with minor illnesses (e.g., diarrhea or mild upper respiratory tract infection with or without fever). However, if nasal congestion is present that might limit delivery of the vaccine to the nasal lining, then delaying of vaccination until the nasal congestion is reduced should be considered. FluMis t\u00ae is contraindicated in people less than age 2 or 50 years of age or older, those with medical conditions at high risk for complications from influenza, including those with chronic heart or lung disease (asthma or reactive lung disease), diabetes, kidney failure, weakened immune system s, or those who take medications that can weaken the immune system, in children < 5 year s of age with a history of recurrent wheezing, children or adolescents receiving aspirin therapy, history of Guillain-Barre syndrome, and people who have severe allergy to chicken eggs or nasal spray vaccine components. Please see www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5306a1.htm for a list of contraindications for FluMist\u00ae. *On September 19, 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved use of the nasal influenza vaccine LAIV (FluMist\u00ae) for healthy children ages 2-4 years old (24 to 59 months old) without a history of recurrent wheez ing, as well as for healthy persons ages 5 to 49 years who are not pregnant. Previously, approval was for healthy persons ages 5 to 49 years who were not pregnant. Pneumococcal Vaccine Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended in all patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes at the time of diagnosis. The 23 capsular polysaccharide antigens in the current vaccine represent the pneumococcal serotypes causing 85 to 90 percent of invasive disease and the 6 serotypes most frequently causing invasive dr ug-resistant infection. Consult the manufacture r's package insert for dosage instructions Contraindications to pneumococcal vaccination There is no contraindication to a first dose of pneumococcal vaccine other than moderate or severe acute illness. Vaccine manufacturer's pa ckage insert should be reviewed for product specific cautions and contraindications. The safety of 23 valent polysaccharide vaccine for pregnant women has not been studied. It should generally not be given to healthy pregnant women. Wo men who are at high risk of pneumococcal disease and who are candidates fo r pneumococcal vaccine should be vaccinated before pregnancy. Revaccination Routine revaccination of young, immuno-competent adults is not presently recommended. A single revaccination five or more years after th e initial vaccination shou ld be considered in: 1. The elderly, and 2. For those people with co-morbid conditions that put them at very high risk for invasive infection including asplenia, transplant, immunosuppression, nephrotic syndrome, and chronic renal failure. Pediatric Patients Influenza vaccination Infants with diabetes should not be immunized for influenza until they are > 6 months old. The manufacturer's package insert should be reviewed for current year dose recommendations. See the section on FluMist\u00ae on the previous pa ge for indications fo r pediatric patients. Pneumococcal vaccination The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, PCV7 or Prevnar\u00ae, licensed in late 2000, is the first pneumococcal vaccine that can be used in ch ildren under the age of two years. However, pneumococcal vaccines for the prevention of disease among children and adults who are two years and older have been in use since 1977. Pneumovax\u00ae and Pnu-Immune\u00ae are 23 valent polysaccharide vaccines (PPV23) that are currentl y recommended for use in all adults who are older than 65 years of age and for persons who ar e 2 years and older and at high risk for disease (e.g., sickle cell disease, HIV infection, or other immunocompromising condition). (CDC, 2007) All children with diabetes should receive a pneumococcal vaccine. Children who are < 24 months at the time of diagnosis should complete the initial series of the 7 valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine if the series has not been completed. Children older than 24 months are potential candidates for both the 7 valent conjug ated vaccine and the 23 valent polysaccharide vaccine. However, there is controversy over th e sequencing and dosage for the two vaccines in this age group. Thus, it is advise d that a physician with expertise in pediatri c infectious disease be consulted about the best course of action. The overarching principle is that all children with diabetes should receive some form of pneumococcal vaccine. References: 1. Centers for Disease Control. (2007, July 13).

Pierre, SD: Disease \u0099 Diabetes is a risk factor fo r chronic periodontal disease. \u0099 Periodontal disease is the most preval ent oral complication of diabetes. \u0099 Periodontal infections may aff ect blood glucose control. \u0099 Good blood glucose control is an effective tool in preventing periodontal disease. \u0099 Data obtained from current studies indicat ed a link between periodontal disease and inflammation, and increased the risk factors for atherosclerosis. \u0099 Early intervention with fluorid e may be indicated in communities with un-fluoridated water and may be beneficial in infants and ch ildren. Refer to the most current guidelines at http://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/guidelines/tooth_decay.htm . \u0099 Currently, the ADA offers no guidelines on dent al examination beyond initial oral cavity examination. The Centers for Disease Control recommends individuals that have diabetes should see a dentist every six months and more often if periodontal disease is present. \u0099 Current research shows individuals with diabetes are less likely to seek preventive dentistry than their non- diabetic counterparts. What recommendations should healthca re providers and diabetes educators make to their patients regardi ng oral and dental hygiene? Health care providers and diab etes educators should educat e patients on the importance of maintaining good oral hygiene thr ough regular dental exams every six to twelve months, brush teeth at least twice daily, flo ss regularly, and report any bl eeding or sores on gums. Mouth infections and disorders of the gum are more pr evalent when blood glucos e levels are elevated. Compromised oral conditions relate d to periodontal disease such as missing teeth, dental caries, and oral infection can affect nutrition and glycem ic control. At a minimum, patients and families should receive education on the following: \u0099 Diabetes and oral health \u0099 Maintaining glycemic control \u0099 Cessation of smoking and tobacco use \u0099 Healthy meal planning \u0099 Proper brushing and flossing \u0099 Dental examination, at least annually How does periodonta l disease occur? Periodontal disease occurs when th e periodontal ligament, which joins the root of the tooth to the alveolar bone (tooth socket), is destroyed by bacteria. Infection may develop as the tissue surrounding the tooth recedes. A periodontal pocke t then develops, harb oring an increasingly anaerobic environment. Normal brushing and flo ssing can no longer reach this area and a biofilm or plaque, consisting of commun ities of pathogenic bacteria, develops. These biofilms or plaques are resistant to normal body defenses and chemothera peutics. The cells and molecules within this pocket are inflammatory and play a role in th e pathogenesis of diseases. An increase in C-reactive protein, an inflammatory marker presen t in periodontal inflamma tion, is a risk factor for atherosclerosis. According to the American Heart Association, an elevation of the highly sensitive C-reactive protein can be a predictor for stroke and cardiovascular events. The destruction that occurs with periodontal disease is caused by the body's excessive inflammatory response to the periodontal pathog ens and its inability to properly resolve this response. Diabetes, tobacco use, and genetic risk factors greatly affect how the body responds to the inflammatory response. What is the treatment for periodontal disease? Treatment for periodontal disease consists of debridement, usually with the addition of antibiotics following the procedur e. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) can be used to slow or halt the inflammatory response bu t tend to also slow or ha lt the beneficial effects of the inflammatory response. Aspirin can also be used to modulate the inflammatory response. Prevention of periodontal disease in patients with diabetes requi res an annual dental exam for gum and periodontal disease. Patients with significant periodontal disease require more frequent monitoring and treatment to cont rol the periodontal disease. What is the Scottsdale Project and wh at is its impact on patients with diabetes? The Scottsdale Project Report data was released in Septem ber of 2007, and proposes that providers screen all patients for periodontal di sease and refer as necessary. The report also suggested the following management plan for pati ents with diabetes (Grand Rounds in Oral- Systemic Medicine, 2007): 1. Patients with diabetes should be medically managed as recommended by the American Diabetes Association. 2. Patients with diabetes should ha ve a dental exam at a minimu m of twice a year, or more frequently if advised by the dental provider, and receive appropriate dental/periodontal care. 3. There should be close communication betw een the primary care physician and the dentist. 4. Medical providers should advise patients with periodontal disease th at it is a chronic infection of the gums and a complication of diabetes. 5. Medical providers should also advise pa tients that periodontal disease has been associated with significant health proble ms, including worsening metabolic control and other complications of diabetes, coro nary artery disease, and stroke. 6. Medical providers should advise the patient th at periodontal disease can be treated by the dentist and dental hygienist, and in more severe case, refer to a periodontist (gum specialist). 7. If the patient has not seen a dentist within the last year, or if there are signs of periodontal disease, the patient should be advised to make an appointment to see a dental provider right away.

Self-Management Education \u0099 Diabetes self-management education involves a continuum of services ranging from the teaching of survival skills to comprehensive self-management education programs to intensive management. \u0099 Patients with diabetes must be able to co mprehend, analyze, and apply diabetes self- management education, including self-bl ood glucose monitoring, medical nutrition therapy, and medication administration. \u0099 Educational needs should be assessed at time of diagnosis and whenever there is poor clinical control or a ma jor change in therapy. \u0099 Health literacy and health nu meracy play an important role in the health outcomes of patients with diabetes. \u0099 At a minimum, a team consisting of a regist ered nurse and a regist ered dietitian, with advanced training and education in diabetes management, should pr ovide patient self- management education. \u0099 The individualized patient assessment and ca re plan should be docum ented in the medical record and shared with all member s of the inter-disciplinary team. \u0099 Self-management education enables the patien t to participate in goal setting to normalize glucose levels and improve health outcomes. \u0099 People with diabetes should increase prepare dness by maintaining a waterproof, insulated disaster ready kit which contains items critical to self management, to include glucose testing materials and meter, medications (oral and injectable), syringes, glucose tablets, and glucagon kits. \u0099 As of July 1, 1999, all health insurance carriers in South Da kota, including Medicaid, are required to provide coverage for self-manag ement training and education for individuals with diabetes if prescribed by a health care professional legally authorized to prescribe such items under law. \u0099 In 2006, 66.2 percent of BRFSS respondents with diabetes reported taking a course on how to manage their diabetes. Participati on in self-management education classes has increased from 58.7 percent in 2000 to its current level. What are \"survival skills\"? Survival skills should be offered to all persons with diabetes at the time of diagnosis. In order for patients to recognize the significan ce of diabetes, they should receive a comprehensive self- management education program. Those people unab le to attend a comprehensive program should receive instruction in the following key areas: 1. Disease basics 2. Self-monitoring of blood glucose 3. Exercise and activity and weight control 4. Medication use 5. Hypoglycemia/Hyperglycemia 6. Nutrition Survival skills should be taught by a licensed h ealth care professional wi th specific training in diabetes and the education of people with diabetes . Specific training must be consistent with the prevailing state standards. Why is it important for patients with diab etes to be prepared in the event of a natural or man-made disaster? The 2007 ADA Standards encourage patients with diabetes to increase their preparedness by maintaining a \"to go\" kit in a waterproof, in sulated bag. The bag should contain supplies essential to maintain glycemic control in a di saster situation, includi ng blood glucose meter and testing strips, lancets, containe r for sharps disposal, oral medi cations, insulin, syringes, alcohol preps, glucose tablets, and glucagon kits. Photocopies of relevant health information, medication lists, recent lab tests and procedures, and contact information of health care providers should be included. Pres cription numbers should be noted, as pharmacy chains throughout the country may be able to refill medications based on the number alone in the event of relocation. Disaster kits should be checked and replenished at least twice yearly. What is a comprehensive sel f-management education program? A comprehensive self-management education program is an interactive, collaborative, ongoing process involving the person with diabetes and the educator(s). This process includes assessment of the individual's specific educ ation needs, identification of the individual's personal goals, education, and behavioral interv entions directed toward helpi ng the individual achieve their goals. The National Standards for Diabetes Se lf-Management Education identify ten core educational content areas. Assessed needs of th e individual will determine which areas listed below are delivered. 1. Describing the diabetes disease process and treatment options 2. Incorporating appropriate nutritional management 3. Incorporating physical ac tivity into lifestyle 4. Utilizing medications (if applicable) for therapeutic effectiveness 5. Monitoring blood glucose, urine ketones (whe n appropriate), and using the results to improve control 6. Preventing, detecting, and treating acute co mplications (i.e. periodontal, nephropathy, etc.) 7. Preventing (through risk reduction behavi or), detecting, and treating chronic complications 8. Goal setting to promote health a nd problem solving for daily living 9. Integrating psychosocial adjustment to daily life 10. Promoting preconception care, management dur ing pregnancy, and gestational diabetes management (if applicable) What are the requirements for comp rehensive self-management program coordinators and program instructors? A program coordinator who has familiarity with the lifelong process of managing a chronic disease (i.e. diabetes) and w ho is responsible for program planning, implementation, and evaluation shall be designated to manage the program. The coordinator role is filled by a healthcare professional with a dvanced education on a combination of diabetes management, educational strategies, behavi oral interventions, and counseling skills in accordance with program requirements of the American Diabetes A ssociation, the Indian Health Service, or the SD Department of Health. Requirements amon g these programs vary but are based on the National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education. Program instructors must be licensed health care professionals with recent didactic and experiential preparation in di abetes education and manageme nt. DSME instructors who are collectively qualified to teach the required content areas must consist of at least a registered nurse and a registered dietitian/licensed nutritionist. Instructors must either be a CDE or have completed initial diabetes education and trai ning as outlined in accordance with program requirements of the American Diabetes Associa tion, the Indian Health Service, or the SD Department of Health. All comprehensive program staff mu st obtain at least 6 hours of c ontinuing education related to diabetes yearly. A list of comprehensive self -management education program recognized by the SD Department of Health, the American Diabetes Association and the Indian Health Service as meeting the national standards is at http://doh.sd.gov/Diabetes/SDDERP.aspx . What is health literacy? Health literacy is a person's ability to read, understand, and use health information to make appropriate health care decisions and follow instructions for treatment. According to the National Adult Literacy su rveys conducted in 1993 and 2003, approximately 21 percent of American adults (40 to 44 million) are functionally illiterate and read at or below a 5th grade level and an additional 25 perc ent are marginally illiterate. This is reflected in the 90 million adults w ho have difficulty understanding and using health information. Patients with lower health literacy le vels are less apt to seek out preventive health care and to have a medical home. They are more apt to have increased use of emergency room services and have higher rates of hospitalization. They have more difficulty carrying out medical tests and treatment regimes. Reading and comp rehending consent forms, insurance forms, or written instructions regarding their tr eatment plan may be beyond their reach. How should health literacy be assessed? Every patient should have a health literacy assessment done on admission to any healthcare center or comprehensive self-management education program. A tool that is free of charge and readily accessible is entitled \"The Newe st Vital Sign\" and is available at http://www.newestvitals ign.org/nvs-resources.aspx . It can be administered in a three-minute period and will give the health care provider an es timate of the patient's health literacy level. Information regarding health lit eracy level concerns should be communicated to other inter- disciplinary team members to ensure continuity of care. Why is it necessary to assess cultural beliefs? It is important to assess a patient's cultural belie fs as these beliefs may influence the manner in which the patient interprets and follows through w ith the treatment plan. There must be a mutual understanding between healthcare provider and patient that allows the patient to proceed with the plan from his/her own cultural reference. What interventions can health care providers and educators implement to improve patient's understanding? According to the Clear Health Co mmunication Initiative, there are six steps that can be used to improve patients' understanding: 1. Limit the amount of informa tion provided at each visit 2. Slow down 3. Use \"living room\" language, avoid medical jargon 4. Use pictures or models to explain important concepts 5. Assure understanding with the \"show me\" technique 6. Encourage patients to ask questions Diabetes educators have been using the \"show m e\" or \"teach back\" method for many years. It is the one way that an educator has to ensure th at the patient can simultaneously describe and demonstrate the steps to a procedure such as insulin withdrawal and injection. However, educators must be careful to use pictures that demonstrate the steps to injection, or if written directions are given as take home remi nders, they should be written at a 5th or 6th grade reading level. Readability calculators are available online that can be used to as sess the reading level of printed materials to ensure they are at a level the patient can u nderstand. (Available at http://www/harrymclaughlin.com/SMOG.htm .) The health care provider must be extremel y careful to be non-judgmental and avoid placing blame on the patient for not comprehending in structions. The health care provider can communicate ownership of ensuring that the patien t understands by stating, \"Just to be sure that I have taught you all you need to know, could you repeat back to me the instructions I have given you?\" How frequently should educat ional needs be assessed? Educational needs should be asse ssed at the time of diagnosis and subsequently reassessed at least annually. Reassessment of educational ne eds should also occur whenever there is poor clinical control or a ma jor change in therapy. What is a comprehensive educational assessment ? Diabetes is a complex disease that affects nearly every aspect of a person's life. A comprehensive assessment of a person's educa tional needs is likewise complex. The American Association of Diabetes Educators has id entified the following 12 components of a comprehensive educational assessment: 1. Health history 2. Medical history 3. Previous use of medication 4. Diet history 5. Current mental health status 6. Family and social supports 7. Previous diabetes education, actual knowledge, and skills 8. Current self-care management practices 9. Use of healthcare delivery systems 10. Lifestyle practices 11. Physical and psychosocial factors 12. Factors that influence learning A team consisting of a register ed dietitian and a registered nurse should conduct the initial assessment and all reassessments. Both dietit ian and nurse should be Certified Diabetes Educators (CDEs) or licensed hea lth care professionals with specific training in diabetes and the education of people with diabetes. What is intensive management education? Intensive management education may be either individual or special gr oup sessions designed for patients who are initiating continuous subcutane ous insulin infusion or multiple daily injection therapy combined with carbohydrat e counting. A diabetes treatment team familiar with the use of the insulin pump and intensive management coordinates these sessions. This planned education is an integral component of care. Who is a Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE)? A Certified Diabetes Educator is a health car e professional who is qualified by the National Certification Board for Diabetes Educators to te ach people with diabetes how to manage their condition. To achieve certifica tion, the individual must have accrued 1,000 hours in direct diabetes education and passed th e certification exam of the National Certification Board for Diabetes Educators. What is Board Certified - Advanced Diabetes Management (BC-ADM)? According to the AADE, the Advanced Practitione r in Diabetes Management has an advanced degree and is able to: \u0099 perform complete and/or focused assessments, \u0099 recognize and prioritize complex data in order to identify needs of pa tients with diabetes across the life span; and \u0099 provide therapeutic problem solving, counseling, and regimen adjustments The scope of advanced clinical practice in cludes management skills such as medication adjustment, medical nutrition therapy, exercise planning, counseling for behavior management, and psychosocial issues. Attain ing optimal metabolic control may include treatment and monitoring of acute and chroni c complications. The depth of knowledge and competence in advanced clinical practice and diabetes skills affords an increased complexity of decision- making, which expands the traditional discipline specific practice. Research, publications, mentoring, and continuing professional development are expected skill sets. What is the differentiation between CDE and BC-ADM? BC-ADM certification differs from the CDE in th at it is focused on advanced management of clinical diabetes problems and re quires an advanced de gree before sitting for the examination. A diabetes care professional with a BC-ADM cred ential may or may not be a CDE (a certification in diabetes education is not a pre -requisite). As diabetes education is an integral part of diabetes care and management, the professional with the BC-ADM credential necessarily incorporates aspects of diabetes self-management training (DSMT) into his or her practic e, either directly or through referral to another qualified diabetes educator (AADE, 2008) .

Accessed January 16, 2008, from http://www.diabeteseducator.org/ProfessionalResources/Certification/BC-ADM/ . Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) \u0099 Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) is important in preventing diabetes, managing existing diabetes, and preventing, or at least slowing, the rate of development of diabetes complications. MNT continues to be an integr al component of diabetes management and of diabetes self-management education (ADA, 2008). \u0099 MNT should be individualized, based on the pe rson's metabolic needs, food preferences, and willingness to make lifestyle changes. \u0099 A registered dietitian (RD), licensed in S outh Dakota, who is knowledgeable and skilled in implementing diabetes medical nutrition therapy should be the team member with primary responsibility for nutrition care and education. \u0099 Weight loss is recommended for all overweight and obese individuals and should include structured programs emphasizing lifestyle ch anges, behavior modification, education, reduced energy and fat intake, and exercise. \u0099 The ADA (2008) has revised its recommendations for weight loss to include either low- carbohydrate or low-fat calorie-r estricted diets for short-te rm use of up to one year. \u0099 For patients using low-carbohydrate diets, healthcare providers should monitor lipid profiles, renal function, and protein intake in patients with nephropathy, and adjust hypoglycemic therapy as needed (ADA, 2008). What is Medical Nutrition Therapy? MNT consists of nutrition assessment and the development of an individualized nutrition prescription based on treatment goals. MNT shoul d be customized for each individual, taking into account age, cultural beliefs, weight, li festyle, and other rela ted medical, social, or psychological conditions. Nutrition counseling s hould be sensitive to the personal needs and willingness and abilities of the individual to make healthy lifestyle changes associated with diabetes or pre-diabetes. To achieve nutrition-related goals , a coordinated team effort should include the person with diabetes and involve him or her in the deci sion-making process. A comprehensive assessment should include sensitivity to cultural, ethnic, a nd financial considerations, willingness to change, and ability of the individual to incorporate the lifestyle changes associated with a comprehensive self-management education program. Although it is recommended that a registered dietician be the team member who plays the l eading role in providing nutrition care, it is important that all team members including physicians and nurse s be knowledgeable about MNT and support its implementation. What are the goals of Medical Nutrition Therapy? According to the ADA (2008), the overall goals of MN T apply to individuals at risk for diabetes, those with pre-diabetes, and individuals with existing diabetes. Additionally, specific consideration should be given to the unique nutritional n eeds in the life cycle such as youth with type 1 diabetes, pregnant a nd lactating women, and older adults. The 2008 recommendations strive to make people with diabetes and h ealthcare providers aware of the beneficial interventions of MNT and include the latest scie ntific evidence-based practice recommendations. Prevention and Treatment 1. Delay or halt the development of diabet es (primary prevention interventions). 2. Reduce the prevalence of obesity and pre-diabetes. 3. Decrease the risk of diabetes and cardiova scular disease (CVD) by promoting healthy food choices and physical activity leading to moderate, maintainable weight loss. 4. Manage existing diabetes and prevent or slow the rate of developing the long-term complications of diabetes such as renal disease, neuropathy, re tinopathy, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. 5. Achieve and maintain blood glucose levels in th e normal range or as close to normal as is safely possible. 6. Maintain blood lipid levels that reduce the risk for macrovascular disease. 7. Maintain blood pressure levels in the normal range or as close to normal as is safely possible that reduce the risk for vascular disease. 8. Provide adequate calories for maintaining or attaining body weight goals, and for normal growth and development in children, during pregnancy and lactati on, and older adults. 9. To maintain the pleasure of eating by only limiting food choices when indicated by scientific evidence. 10. Improve health through healthy food choices and physical activity while considering personal and cultural preferences and lifestyle , respectful of the individual's wishes and willingness to make lifestyle changes. 11. For individuals treated with in sulin or insulin secretagogues, to provide self-management training for the safe conduct of exercise, including the prevention and treatment of hypoglycemia, and diabetes treatm ent during acute illness. What are the components of a nutrition prescription/meal plan? 1. Calories based on individual need s and weight management goals. 2. A dietary pattern that includes carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and low-fat milk is recommended.

Self-Monitored Blood Glucose Testing (SMBG) \u0099 SMBG is important for all persons with diabet es in order to achiev e glycemic control. \u0099 SMBG is an essential management strate gy in achieving tight glycemic control. \u0099 The frequency of SMBG is influenced by m ode of treatment, level of control, and treatment goals. \u0099 In 2006, 64.0 percent of BRFSS respondents with diabetes reported checking their blood glucose at least once a day. Why is SMBG important? Self-monitoring of blood glucose allo ws persons with diabetes to ach ieve very specific glycemic goals. Maintenance of normal or near-normal blood glucose levels has major health benefits for persons with diabetes. Results of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) indicate that there is a direct relationship between blood glucose level and the risk of future diabetes related complications (diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy). Both the development and the progression of microvascular complications are slow ed with improved glucose control. How many times a day should SMBG be done? Persons with type 1 diabetes should be encour aged to use SMBG for routine daily monitoring. For most persons with type 1 diabetes, SMBG is recommended three or more times a day; frequency and timing of SMBG should be determined by individual needs and goals. The optimal frequency of SMBG in persons with st able diet-treated type 2 diabetes is not known but should be sufficient to facilitate attaining glycemic control goals. Times may include fasting, preprandial and postprandial. Vary ing the times may give a better picture of overall achievement of goals. The ADA recommends SMBG for all patients being treated with insulin or sulfonylureas, and for all patients who are not ac hieving their glycemic goals. Daily SMBG is especially important for patients treated with insulin or sulfonyl ureas to prevent asymptomatic hypoglycemia. For both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, testing s hould occur more frequently when modifying therapy. It is the ADA's recommendation that efforts should be ma de to substantially increase the appropriate use of SMBG. (For recommendations for gesta tional diabetes see page 23.) How accurate are SMBG measurements? Each patient's ability to use monitoring equipm ent, along with their knowledge of instrument calibration, needs to be evaluated by health practitioners at regular intervals to assure accuracy. It is crucial that people with diabetes know whet her their monitor and strips provide whole blood or plasma results. Plasma glucose values are 10 to 15 percent higher th an whole blood glucose values. It is important that individuals understand what a \"nor mal\" blood glucose range is for them. A recent study found that forearm results we re dramatically different from finger stick results and that finger stick measurements should always be used to confirm a forearm test that is not consistent with how the patient feels. What information do persons using SMBG need to know? Patients using SMBG should be taught how to ad just their medical nutrition regimens, exercise, and pharmacological therapy in response to results of SMBG. Patients also need to know when to call their health care team. References: 1. American Diabetes Association. (2007). Standards of medical care in diabetes.

Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) \u0099 Continuous glucose monitoring is a recent tec hnological advance that provides real-time blood glucose data every one to five minut es, depending upon the model and mode of instrumentation. \u0099 Data from ongoing clinical trials indicates gr eat potential to improve glycemic control in adults and children with diabetes mellitu s by: 1) providing capabilities with the monitoring device to alert th e individual of high or low glucose values, and providing treatment to prevent hypo/hyperglycemia; 2) providing a means for real time insulin adjustments based on glucose values that may be rising, falling, or st able; and 3) allowing a retrospective review of glycemic excursi ons based upon time of day, activity level, and food intake that can be used to refine insulin adjustments. \u0099 CGM technology is part of a futuristic a pproach leading to th e development of an artificial pancreas that w ould provide an automated fully closed-loop insulin delivery system that mimics the way a real pancre as would act, by continuously monitoring blood glucose and constantly adjusting the level of insulin needed to keep glucose in an acceptable range. What is continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)? Continuous glucose monitoring is a recent techno logical advance that utilizes a minimally invasive device connected via a wi re to a subcutaneous sensor that can be worn continuously up to 72 hours to monitor in terstitial glucose levels, with capab ilities to provide real-time blood glucose data every one to five minutes, de pending upon the parameters of the model. Continuous readings obtained cr eate a trend line that can be used to understand how insulin, food, exercise, and other variables affect gl ucose values. Detailed information about blood glucose fluctuations trends the extent, duration, and frequency of elevations or drops in blood sugars. Data obtained during continuous monitoring highlights the re lationships of excursions in blood glucose to certain activitie s or food, and helps predict or possibly prevent episodes of hypo or hyperglycemia. How does the device work? A small sensor is inserted under the skin via a needle mechanism that measures glucose in the interstitial fluid between the body's cells. This means there is no blood involved. The sensor relays the glucose level to a devi ce that displays the glucose reading, displayed with arrows that show upward or downward trends. Th e patient can then make adjustments in the insulin to keep glucose at an acceptable range. When is continuous glucose monitoring used? CGM can be utilized as an adjunct to therapy with certain insulin pumps or as a diagnostic tool device to facilitate adjustments in therapy to im prove control. Health care providers may utilize CGM in either home or clinical settings for up to 72 hours as an assessment tool to obtain detailed information about blood glucose excursions and fluctuations. This is accomplished by utilizi ng the same type of subcutaneous sensor attached to a small computer-like device that downloads and record s information regarding blood glucose patterns over the 72-hour period it is worn. The report generated by the device allows the trained healthcare provider to analyze th e data along with the patient's records of food intake, activity, medication use, and to monitor adve rse events such as hypoglycemia. Data obtained from this test allows the health care provider to make adjustments in drug therapy, support suggested lifestyle modifications, mon itor conditions where tighter control without hypoglycemia is needed (gestationa l diabetes, pediatric patients, and intens ive care), and to diagnose and prevent hypoglycemic unawareness , hypoglycemia during sleep, and observe high or low post-prandial readings. What are the potential advantages of CGM? Recent clinical trials have indicated that use of continuous glucose monitoring has been associated with decreased time spent in hyper/hy poglycemic ranges, and an increased amount of time spent in a euglycemic range. Both adults and children achieved A1C reductions without additional hypoglycemia. In pediatric patients, use of CGM offers families' new management approaches, the potential for improved glycemic c ontrol, and improved quality of life. An added benefit of close monitoring is fewer excursions in glucose levels < 70 mg/dl and > 190 mg/dl, yielding less glycemic instability and fewer swings that necessitate costly visits to the emergency room to treat severe hypoglycemia and DKA. Data can also be used to distinguish between the Dawn and Somogi phenomenons. Patients should confirm high or low monitor alarms with a finger stick before any corrective action is taken regarding additional food or insulin, due to the lag time difference between capillary and interstitial sites. Patients experience better self-management and are able to see a correlation between diet, exercise, and medication and how they affect glucose levels. CGM allows patients to make changes in therapy earlier before pr eventive actions are not possible. In actual practice settings, CGM has been im plemented in the operating room preceding anesthesia induction, duri ng the time of surgery, and in the post-operative period to reduce periods of hypo/hyperglycemia, decreased infecti on rates, and increased recovery time in patients with diabetes. Are there disadvantages to CGM? There are a number of disadvantages to continuo us glucose monitoring and it is not indicated for all patients. Clinical trials are currently ongoing, and at this time clinicians have not yet developed implantation and dissemination tools and algorithms for optimized use and patient selection. Many challenges are involved with how to handle, manage, and trend the voluminous amount of data generated by the monitor withou t overwhelming both patien ts and practitioners. Insulin pump therapy is generally covered by insu rance. Due to its novelty, CGM is not always afforded reimbursement, but diagnostic 72-hour CGM through a healthcare provider may be covered by insurance with appropriate justificat ion at time of submission. Costs incurred for transmitters and glucose sensors may be out-of-pocket expenses for patients. Because of the complex nature of the monitoring device, both provi ders and patients requir e training in sensor use and trend interpretation. What effect will CGM have on the future of diabetes care? Futuristic trends in diabetes technology would be the eventual development of an automated fully closed-loop insulin delivery system than would regulate blood suga r like the beta cells within the pancreas, i.e. an \"artificial pancreas.\" A limitation in the development of the artificial pancreas has been related to the lack of r obust continuous glucose monitoring capabilities and mature control algorithms that are capable of driving the insulin delivery system. Currently, the FDA has approved five continuous gl ucose monitoring devices, and a sixth is in the final stages of clinical trials. Great potentia l exists for improved glyc emic control in adults and children with diabetes to enhance quality of life, increase management flexibility, and reduce the complications related to diabetes mellitus.

Tobacco Use Status and Counseling \u0099 Screen at time of diagnosis. \u0099 Routine and thorough assessment of tobacco use is an important way to prevent smoking/chewing, prevent use relapse, and enco urage cessation in patients of all ages. \u0099 Providers should assess the level of nicotine dependence to assess probability of success in quitting versus relapse. \u0099 Offer every tobacco user assistan ce in obtaining cessation treatment. \u0099 > 20 percent of deaths from CVD can be directly linked to cigarette smoking. \u0099 Smoking cessation can reduce risk of corona ry death by 50 percent within 1 year. \u0099 In 2006, 16.0 percent of BRFSS respondents wi th diabetes reported being current smokers while 5.7 percent reported using chewing/spit tobacco. Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable d eath in the United States, and is responsible for over 430,000 deaths each year. People with diabet es who use tobacco are at increased risk of both macrovascular and microvascular complicat ions. Recent research has suggested that tobacco use may also increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Exposure to secondhand smoke puts non-smokers at risk for developing h eart disease (25 to 30 percent), lung cancer (20 to 30 percent), sudde n infant death syndrome (SIDS), respiratory problems, ear infections, and asthma attacks in infants and childre n. Findings from a recent U.S. Surgeon General's report indicate second-hand smoke exposure is a major public health concern for non-smoking Americans, especially those with diabetes. One of the majo r ways to protect the general non-smoking public from dangerous ch emicals emitted through secondhand smoke is to eliminate smoking in public places. Second-hand smoke is responsible for approximately 50,000 deaths per year, with one out of every eight of those deaths being children. Tobacco cessation is one of the most modifiable li fe style behaviors that patients can incorporate to decrease the risk of premature death. Studi es have established a link between cigarette smoking (tobacco use) and increased morbid ity, premature death, and macrovascular complications What questions should be included in an assessment? All patients should be assessed for tobacco use at the time of diagnosis (Figure 6) by using the five A's from the Guideline for Treatment of Tobacco Use and Dependence from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: \u0099 Ask if the patient uses tobacco \u0099 Advise the patient to quit if they use tobacco \u0099 Assess the willingness of the patient to quit tobacco \u0099 Assist the patient in their quit attempt \u0099 Arrange follow-up for the patient Questions to consider in assessing the patient should include: \u0099 How many cigarettes/dips are used daily? \u0099 How soon after awakening does the patient use tobacco? \u0099 Have attempts been made to quit or to reduce the amount of tobacco used? \u0099 What are triggers for this patient to use tobacco? \u0099 Does this patient have a plan in place for qu itting? And if not, then the patient should be referred to tobacco cessation services for assistance. Patients should be encouraged to quit using tob acco at each visit, and if the patient has quit, should be assessed for relapse or potentia l for relapse at each visit as well. If not using tobacco: \u0099 Assess risk for starting or relapse \u0099 Congratulate and encourag e continued abstinence How can a healthcare provider help patients stop tobacco use? Tobacco dependence is a chronic condition that often requires intervention. However, effective treatments exist that can produce long term or permanent abstinence. Every patient who uses tobacco should be offered one of these treatments, as outlined by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Intervention is based on a patient's willingne ss to quit. Patients willing to try to quit should be provided with assistance and offered effe ctive pharmacotherapy (nicotine replacement therapy, Bupropion SR, or varenicline). (Table 16) http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/tobacco/ What smoking cessation informatio n and programs are available in South Dakota? The South Dakota QuitLine (1-866-SD-QUITS or 1-866-737-8487) offers a range of services, from individual, pro-active telephone counseling to providing referrals to local cessation classes in the community. Tobacco users can also find ou t if they are eligible for cessation medication through the South Dakota Quitline. Information regarding the Quitline is available through the South Dakota Department of Health T obacco Control Program's website at http://doh.sd.gov/tobacco. Figure 6: Screen for Tobacco Use Screen For Tobacco Use If Uses Tobacco Advise to quit Is patient willing to quit? If Not Using Tobacco Assess risk for starting or relapse Congratulate and encourage continued abstinence Willing to Quit Congratulate and assist with quit plan (STAR) or provide appropriate referral. Set a quit date within 2 weeks Tell family, friends and coworkers about quitting and request support Anticipate challenges to planned quit attempt including nicotine withdrawal symptoms Remove tobacco products from home and avoid smoking in places where they spend a lot of time (car, home, work) Recommend appropriate use of effective pharmacotherapy if smokes >10 cig/d and no contraindications Not Willing to Quit Relevance: Ask the patient to identify why quitting is personally relevant Risks: Ask the patient to identify potential negative consequences of tobacco use Rewards: Ask the patient to identify potential benefits of stopping tobacco use Roadblocks: Ask the patient to identify barriers to quitting and note elements of treatment that could address barriers Repetition: Each time an unmotivated patient visits the clinic repeat the motivational interventions Arrange Follow-up No No Yes Yes Table 16: Adverse Effects, Cautions, and In structions on Use of Nicotine Replacement Therapy Type of NRT Cautions All forms of NRT Concomitant tobacco use Less than 18 years old Active coronary artery disease including immediate post MI period, unstable angina Life threatening arrhythmias Pregnancy/nursing Stopping smoking can increase blood levels of medications (e.g. Theophylline, clozapine) Check with pharmacy Adverse Effects Dosing Instructions Nicotine Gum Jaw pain Dyspepsia, nausea Caution if TMJ syndrome or poor dentition Nicotine gum 2mg (pt smokes < 25 cigs/day) 1 piece q1-2 hr prn up to 12 weeks Nicotine gum 4mg (pt smokes 25 cig/day) 1 piece q1-2 hr prn up to 12 weeks Chew slowly Once tingling sensation felt, park gum in between cheek and gum Chew again when tingling goes away No acidic beverages immediately before or after use Nicotine Inhaler Local irritation in mouth and throat Caution if history of asthma 4mg (1 cartridge) 6-16 times a day prn up to 6 months Place plug in two-piece inhaler Pt. inhales on mouthpiece as desired; one plug provides 80 inhalations Use 6 to 16 plugs/day No acidic beverages immediately before or after use Transdermal Nicotine Patch Skin sensitivity Sleep disturbance (remove at night) Nicoderm CQ 21 mg/d x 4 weeks, then 14 mg/d x 2 weeks, then 7 mg/d x 2 weeks Nicotrol 15 mg/16h x 8 wks Apply to area of skin without hair If problems with sleep disturbance, remove at night and replace in morning Nicotine Nasal Spray Initial nasal and throat irritation, rhinitis, sneezing, coughing ?

Dosing should start 1 week before the date. Take after eating with a full glass of water. Recommended dose is 1mg BID following a one week titration: Day 1-3: 0.5mg once daily Day 4-7: 0.5 mg BID Day 8-end of treatment: 1mg BID Treatment is for 12 weeks. An additional 12 week course is recommended to further increase likelihood of long term ab stinence. Patients who do not succeed or relapse can make another attempt once factors contri buting to failure have been identified and addressed. A maximum of 0.5 mg BID should be utilized in patients with reduced kidney function as varenicline is largely excreted through the kidneys. As patients abstain from utilizing tobacco, the provider may need to adjust doses of medication such as warfarin that interacts with the P450 system, as nicotine is a potent P450 inhibitor and reduction or removal of nico tine will affect this system.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Se rvices: Public Health Service. (2000, June). Clinical practice guidelines: Treating tobacco use and dependence. U.S. Government Printing Office: minimum of 30 minutes of moderate-inten sity aerobic physical activity 5 days per week, or vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity for 20 minutes 3 times per week is recommended for healthy adults aged 18 to 65. Physicians are encouraged to modify exercise guidelines to meet individual pati ent's needs according to level of activity tolerated, comorbid conditions which may lim it vigorous physical activity, or diabetes complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, amputation, etc.) which may limit physical activity. \u0099 The goal of physical activity/exercise is to maintain near-normal blood glucose and lipid levels to prevent microvascular, macr ovascular, and neural complications. \u0099 Exercise is Medicine! It can lower blood pressure, decrease blood glucose, reduce weight, improve cholesterol, enhance sleep, maintain bone and heart health, and decrease the risk of cancer. \u0099 Exercise programs should be individualized to maximize benefit and minimize risk. \u0099 The ADA recommends that vigorous activ ity be avoided in the presence of hyperglycemia with ketosis. However, a patient with type 2 diabetes in the postprandial state who is well hydrated and non-ketotic should not have exercise postponed based solely on hyperglycemia. \u0099 Depending on the level and duration, one o ccasion of aerobic exercise can increase insulin sensitivity for 24 to 72 hours. \u0099 To improve glycemic control, assist with weight maintenance, and reduce CVD risk, at least 150 min/week (30 min/day - 5 days/week ) of moderate intensity aerobic physical activity (40-70 percent of Vo2) is recommended. Individual s with type 2 diabetes should strive to achieve a minimum cumulative tota l of 1000 kcal/week from physical activities. \u0099 Examination of the feet, with shoes and sock s off, should be done on a daily basis by the patient and at each clinic visit by the physician. \u0099 Resistance training preserves muscle mass, improves balance, increases functional capacity, increases metabolic rate, decreases ad iposity, and increases in sulin sensitivity at about the same rate as aerobic exercise. \u0099 The benefit of exercise in lowering the hemoglobin A1C level is independent of associated weight loss. \u0099 In 2006, 9.3 percent of BRFSS respondents with di abetes reported having no leisure time physical activity. According to the Surgeon General, physical act ivity can be described as bodily movement produced by the contraction of skeletal muscle that requires energy expenditure in excess of resting energy expenditure. Exercise has been defi ned as physical activity and/or movement that is planned and structured with the intention to keep a person f it and healthy. Current opinion is that regular physical activity is an important therapeutic tool for people with diabetes. However, the benefits and risks for each individual need to be identified and exercise programs need to be individualized. Prior to beginning an exercise program more vi gorous than brisk walking, people with diabetes should be evaluated for the presence of conditions likely to increase CVD risk factors or predisposition to injury, such as uncontrolled hypertension, severe autonomic or peripheral neuropathy, pre-proliferative or proliferative retinopathy, or macular edema. The patient's age and previous physical activity level should be evaluated. Muscular-strengthening training (s trengthening of muscles using equipment such as free weight, resistance bands, and weight machines) has recen tly been added to the activity plan for patients with diabetes based on a Canadian study conduc ted by Sigal et al. Study findings noted a 0.6 percent drop in hemoglobin A1C levels with bo th aerobic and resistance activity individually, but by combining both activities, a 1 percen t absolute reduction in A1C readings was appreciated. This translates in to about a 15 to 20 percent reduction in major cardiovascular events, and a 37 percent decrease in microvascular complications. What are physical activity recommenda tions for people with diabetes? Based on guidelines from the American College of Sports Medicine and American Heart Association, basic exercise recommendations for adults over age 65 (or adults 50 to 64 with chronic conditions such as arthritis ) with diabetes are as follows: 1. Do moderate-intense aerobic activity 30 minut es a day, 5 or more days a week, or 2. Do vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise 20 minutes a day, 3 or more days a week, and 3. Do 8 to 10 strength-training exercises, 10 to 15 repetitions of each exercise twice to three times per week, and 4. If patient is at risk of falli ng, perform balance exercises, and 5. Have a physical activity plan. Both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activ ities are critical for healthy aging. Moderate- intensity aerobic exercise means working hard at about leve l three intensity on a scale of ten. The patient should still be able to carry on a conversation during th is physical acti vity and start to break a sweat. Older adults or adults with ch ronic conditions should develop an activity plan with a health professional to manage risks and take therapeutic needs into account. This will maximize the benefits of physical activ ity and ensure safety. It is recommended that patients who have an impaired glucose tolerance follow a program that includes a healthy diet with wei ght control and at least 150 min/ week of moderate to vigorous physical activity. Evaluating risk and prescribing exercise to minimize risk. Coronary Artery Disease All patients with diabetes part icipating in aerobic exercise should undergo a stress test to assess maximal heart rate, to assist in setting targets for maximum ex ercise intensity, to determine functional capacity, and to assess prognosis. Cu rrently, there is no clinical evidence to guide practitioners on the need for stress testing prior to resistance training. In patients who are sedentary, a graded exercise test with EKG monitoring should be considered before prescribing a physical activity greater than the energy needs of activities of daily living or more intense that brisk walking, or if the patient's ten year risk of having a coronary event is greater than 10 percent. The free UKPDS Risk Engine located at http://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/index.php?maindoc=/riskengine/ can assist in determining a patient's risk factor for non-fatal and fata l coronary heart diseas e, fatal coronary h eart disease, non-fatal and fatal stroke, and fatal stroke based on age, gender, ethnicity, duration of diabetes, smoking status, hemoglobin A1C level, systolic blood pressure, total chol esterol, HDL cholesterol, and absence or presence of atrial fibrillation. Patients who should have the graded exercise test with EKG monitoring include any patient over the age of 30 who is sedentary with a hist ory of tobacco use, hypertension, dyslipidemia, proliferative/preprolif erative retinopathy or nephropathy (i ncluding microalbuminuria) with diabetes greater than 10 years dura tion, and a greater than 10 percen t risk of a coronary event. Others who should have this exam include all patients, regardle ss of age, exhibiting complications of known or susp ected CAD, CVD, advanced nephr opathy with renal failure. Patients with coronary artery disease should undergo an eval uation of exercise tolerance supervised by a physician with expertise in stress testing. Re commendations about appropriate exercise are dependent on the interp retation of exercise stress testing. Peripheral Vascular Disease If peripheral vascular disease (PVD) has been diagnosed through a history and physical exam, a referral for consultation should be made with a physician experienced in the care of patients with significant peripheral vascular disease to design an appr opriate exercise program. Retinopathy Annual dilated retinal exam is su fficient to identify patients with diabetic retinopathy. Since retinopathy is a risk factor fo r coronary artery disease, pa tients with proliferative or preproliferative retinopathy who intend to pursue moderate or intense ex ercise programs should undergo a graded cardiac exercise test with EKG monitoring. Progression of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy and macular edema do not seem to be affected by either resistance or aerobic exerci se. However, if prolif erative or severe non- proliferative retinopathy exists, vigorous aerobic or resistance ac tivities may be contraindicated due to the risk of triggering vitreous hemorrhag e or retinal detachment (e.g. lifting heavy objects or any contact sport). People with diabetes need to be cautioned about engaging in activities that cause blood pressure to increase dramatically, such as head-down or jarr ing activities or those with arms overhead. Nephropathy Annual urine screening for proteinuria and microa lbuminuria is sufficient to identify patients with nephropathy. Currently, there is no clinical evidence to s uggest that vigorous exercise increases the rate of progression of diabetic nephropathy. In fact , some studies have shown that aerobic exercise actually decreased urine pr otein excretion. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that resistance training may have a beneficial affect on muscle mass, nutritional status, functional capacity, and gl omerular filtration rate. Therefore, the American Diabetes Association feels that there is no need to restrict exercise in pa tients with diabetic nephropathy. Due to the fact that microalbuminuria and pr oteinuria are risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease, sedentary patients with th ese findings should have a graded exercise test with EKG monitoring before beginning anything mo re rigorous than their normal activities of daily living. Peripheral Neuropathy Peripheral neuropathy can be dete cted by physical examination. Decr eased pain sensation in the extremities can result in increased risk of skin breakdown, infection, and Charcot joint destruction. Signs of peripheral neuropathy in clude impairments in: deep tendon reflexes, vibratory sense, position sense, and sensation to touch. The main consideration with exercise in patients with peripheral neuropathy is the loss of protective sensation in the legs and feet that can lead to musculoskeletal injuries and infecti on. Reinforce with patients the need for proper footwear and to check their feet after exercise. Significan t peripheral neuropathy is a contraindication to weight bearing exercise. Examples of non-weight be aring activities include swimming, bicycling, rowi ng, and arm exercises. Autonomic Neuropathy History and physical examination can detect autonomic neuropathy. Autonomic neuropathy can increase the risk of exercise-induced injury by decreasing cardiac responsiveness to exercise. Symptoms of autonomic neuropathy include: gastrointestinal symptoms, urinary system capac ity. Signs of autonomic neuropathy include abnormalities of skin color and abnormalities of body temperature. Autonomic neuropathy may limit exercise capacity and may in crease a patient's risk of a car diovascular complication during exercise. Patients may have defective thermoregulat ory capacities, thus they should be advised to avoid exercising in extreme temperatures and be attentive to their hydra tion status. Patients may be predisposed to hypotensive or hypertensive ep isodes following exercise, thus patients should be encouraged to participate in lower intensity ex ercise to avoid dramatic change in heart rate and blood pressure. An active cool-down is import ant in preventing a post -exercise hypotensive response. Signs of cardiac autonomic neuropathy include resting tachycardia (> 100 beats per minute) and orthostasis (> 20 mmHg drop in systolic pressure on standing), thereby making traditional exercise prescriptions based on heart rate inaccurate. Cardiac autonomic neuropathy is associated with sudden death and silent myocardial ischemia. The Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale or %Vo2 Max can be used to determ ine exercise intensity. Patients with cardiac autonomic neuropathy should be evaluated by a ca rdiologist prior to in itiating an exercise program. In fact, some advocate thallium scintig raphy for use in screening patients with this condition. General recommendations about exercise programs. Program intensity Physical activity of low to moderate levels for patients with type 2 diabetes will minimize risks and maximize health benefits. Low to moderate intensity level exercise programs may be easier for patients to follow and maintain. Pre-exercise preparation \u0099 Exercise should be avoided at time of peak insulin activity. \u0099 To prevent increased insulin absorption, inje ctions should be administered in body areas not involved with activity, e.g. abdomen. \u0099 Patients should check their blood glucose leve ls before and after exercise, as well as several hours following completion of exercise until they know the effect of physical activity on their blood glucose levels. \u0099 In type 1 diabetes, vigorous activity should be avoided in the presence of ketosis and caution should be used with any physical activity/exercise for blood glucose levels > 300 mg/dl even if no ketosis is present. However, in type 2 diabetes, if the blood glucose is greater than 300 mg/dl without ketosis and th e patient feels well and is well hydrated, exercise need not be postponed based on hyperglycemia. Pre-exercise carbohydrate should definitely be taken to avoid hypoglycemia if pre-exercise glucose levels are < 100 mg/dl a nd the patient is taking insulin or a secretagogue, or the dosage of medication reduced before se ssions of physical activ ity. However, patients who are not taking either insulin or secretagogue s but are controlling their bl ood glucose levels with diet, metformin, -glucosidase inhibitors, and/or thiazolidin ediones usually will not need additional carbohydrates. \u0099 Carbohydrate-based foods should be readil y available during a nd after exercise. \u0099 Proper warm-up and cool down period will decrease injuries. \u0099 Diabetic ID bracelet or s hoe tag should be worn. Hydration \u0099 Adequate hydration is necessa ry to maintain blood glucos e levels and assure optimal cardiovascular function. \u0099 Exercise in heat requires vigilant attention to hydration status. \u0099 Pre-exercise hydration is part icularly useful. For events lasting up to one hour, plain water is best. If activity is over one hour, fluids containing a 6 to 8 percent carbohydrate solution are best. Foot care \u0099 People with diabetes should be encouraged to take precautions to avoid injury to their feet. \u0099 Silica gel or air mid-soles decrease impact. \u0099 Polyester and cotton-polyester blend socks may be helpful in preventing blisters. \u0099 Patients should be encouraged to change their socks before and after exercise. \u0099 Properly fitting footwear is very important. \u0099 Patients should know to examine their feet clos ely for blisters before and after exercise. Post-exercise routine \u0099 Patients should monitor their blood glucose leve ls after exercise in order to learn their metabolic response to different exercise conditions. \u0099 Post exercise hypoglycemia may occur up to 30 hours later, especia lly after prolonged or vigorous exercise.

Behavioral Changes/Healthy Lifestyle Changes \u0099 Assess key psychosocial factors as part of the medical management of diabetes, including attitudes about diabetes diagnosis, expecta tions for care, affect/mood, quality of life, financial, social, and emo tional support and resources , and psychiatric history. \u0099 Patients should be screened for psychosoc ial problems such as depression, eating disorders, and cognitive impairment when poor adherence to medical regime is noted. \u0099 Set realistic goals through collaboration with the patient. \u0099 Identify community supports and make appropriate referrals What does psychology have to do with diabetes care? One of the biggest struggles for both patients and practitioners is identifying, addressing, and accomplishing the behavioral changes necessary to achieve the best possible diabetes management in their daily lives. Best medical prac tice requires practitioners to incorporate both the \"science\" and \"art\" of behavior change. Ther e is a wealth of research in the behavioral science literature on factors that lead to best outcomes in diabetes management. Diabetes interventions are predominantly \"behav ioral.\" The delivery of successful medical care for individuals with diabetes ultimately depends on their ability to \"self-manage.\" Over time, the behavioral science literature reviews and posit ion statements have c onsistently shown that: \u0099 People of all ages have difficulty following diabetes regimens. \u0099 People can do well with some aspects of thei r care while having extreme difficulty with other aspects. \u0099 Children and adults living with diabetes have the most di fficulty with the following, in order: 1. Diet 2. Exercise \u0099 Timing and adjustment of diabetes medications is difficult and can result in adherence issues. \u0099 Miscommunication between patients and provide rs on important aspects of diabetes care is an ongoing issue. What are the key psychosocial factors affecting chronic care? Best practice looks at assessing the \"whole pe rson\" to assess where potential strengths and weaknesses with the diabetes regime are likely to occur. Assessment should include, but is not limited to, the following areas: In child and adolescent patients: \u0099 Developmental stage \u0099 \u0099 Natural/acquired coping skills/style \u0099 Role of significant others (helpful, hurtful) \u0099 Role of family of origin \u0099 Diabetes at work and play \u0099 Psychological factors/predictors of poor adjustment \u0099 Psychiatric history (patient, family) \u0099 Substance use/abuse \u0099 \u0099 Overall \"quality of \u0099 Weight history/genetics Treatment issues across the ages. \u0099 Depression is more common among people with diabetes than it is in the general public 1. may be more severe for people with diabetes 2. has an adverse effect on diab etes control and self-care 3. is often undiagnosed and untreated 4. can be treated with psychotherapy and/or psychopharmological agents \u0099 Anxiety 1. appears to be more prevalent in people with diabetes than the general population 2. can be treated with psychotherapy and/or psychopharmological agents \u0099 Eating disorders (anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa) 1. appear to be more common in people w ith diabetes than the general public 2. may be more severe for people with diabetes 3. have an adverse effect on diabetes control \u0099 Setting realistic goals: Collaboration is key \u0099 Diabetes team issues: When practitioners disagree on care \u0099 Team-family colla boration/conflict Struggles with \u0099 Exercise \u0099 Peer issues \u0099 Provider and patient burnout \u0099 Economic issues \u0099 Cultural factors What behavioral strategies enhance diabetes management? \u0099 Adopt an educational model of pa tients \u0099 Individualize treatment to fit assessing individual patient Incorporate \"empowerment\" approaches to enha (i.e., patient successfully targeting and acco mplishing a particular goal). \u0099 Motivational interviewing (MI) is a technique that assists the patient in identifying feelings of ambivalence that exist when working to change a behavior. MI relies on the patient's own inner strength and values rath er than external th reats and coercion. The patient assumes responsibility for their ch oices and the subsequent consequences (Rollnick and Miller, 2001). \u0099 Assess readiness for behavior change: 1. Precontemplation - not thinking about change 2. Contemplation - considering chan ge in the foreseeable future 3. Preparation - seriously considering change in the near future 4. Action - in the process of change 5. Maintenance - continued change for an extended period \u0099 Verbally reinforce positive behaviors. \u0099 Avoid \"punishing\" and/or \"shaming\" patients for diabetes mismanagement. Arrange for other provider care when a bad 'fit' between patient and provider exists. \u0099 Practice a \"problem solving\" approach and teach patient and family members this as a strategy. \u0099 Practice good communication sk ills and advocate the same for communication between patient and family members. \u0099 Assess and enhance community supports (m edical, school, work, social, religious) including, but not limited to, formal support groups specific to diabetes patients and families. \u0099 Identify and intervene with depression and other mental health risk behaviors early.
