How will this measure be distinguished from other similar and/or competing measures? This measure is different because it occurs in a different setting How will this measure add value to the CMS program? This measure adds value because it is setting specific to Ambulatory Surgical Centers.

Web interface Stratification Yes (enter here):: The counts are stratified by surgical codes Feasibility of Data Elements ALL data elements are in defined fields in electronic sources Feasibility Assessment Because this is an aggregate account of procedures performed, facilities should be able to readily obtain and submit these counts through QualityNet. Method of Measure Calculation Hybrid;Other (enter here):: This measure strictly counts the volume of procedures performed. Hybrid measure: Methods of measure calculation N/A Evidence of Performance Gap There is evidence that the volume of specific procedures and the overall volume of procedures performed at ASCs is increasing. For example, according to one study, the volume of orthopedic procedures (1) performed at ASCs on Medicare beneficiaries increased by 8.6% between 2012 and 2017. Studies have also found that the volume of otolaryngologic procedures performed on Medicare beneficiaries at ASCs increased by 1.8% between 2010 and 2017 and decreased by 6% at HOPDs. (2) Another study in a smaller set of ASCs in one geographic region in the United States found that between 2016 and 2019 average orthopedic surgical volume increased by about 38% and the average ASC volume PAGE 9 \u00b7 Ambulatory Surgical Center Quality Reporting Program Top of Document | ASC Facility Volume Data on Selected Surgical Procedures (formerly ASC- 7) overall increased by 19% (3). Finally, another study found that ASC volume for anterior cervical discectomy and fusion increased by 185% between 2015 and 2017 (4). In addition, according to a MedPAC analysis, between 2012 and 2017 the number of ASCs increased, and the volume of services per Medicare FFS beneficiary increased on average by 1.2 percent per year and by and 1.7 percent in 2017 (5). Finally, CMS has now allowed some previously high-volume inpatient procedures, such as hip and knee replacement, to be performed in the ASC setting. Elective primary THA and TKA procedures were removed from the inpatient-only (IPO) list and added to the ASC Covered Procedures List (CPL): TKA was removed from the IPO for CY 2018 and added to the ASC CPL in CY2020; THA was removed from the IPO for CY 2020 and added to the ASC CPL in Levine WN, Lehman RA, Lenke LG.

N/A Number of systematic reviews that inform this measure concept 00000 Briefly summarize the peer-reviewed systematic review(s) that inform this measure concept As noted above, procedures that were previously performed on an inpatient or hospital outpatient basis are now migrating to the ASC setting. This underscores the need to address the potential for poorer outcome for beneficiaries who are treated at low volume providers, for procedures that have a volume-outcome relationship. In addition, better understanding the volume of procedures from an all- payer perspective will allow CMS to target and prioritize future quality measure development There are scores of systematic reviews that examine the volume outcome relationship for surgery. Most of the reviews that have been published support a volume-outcome relationship, but the relationship is weak for some procedures, and stronger for others. In addition, most studies have addressed procedures that are performed in the inpatient setting (although in some cases, like for knee replacement surgery those procedures are migrating to the outpatient space); studies differ in if they examined surgeon volume vs. hospital volume. A recent scoping review of the volume/outcome Top of Document PAGE 12 \u00b7 Ambulatory Surgical Center Quality Reporting Program | ASC Facility Volume Data on Selected Surgical Procedures (formerly ASC- 7) relationship examined 403 studies that addressed 90 types of surgery. Study authors found that most (about 87%) of the studies had a significant volume-outcome relationship; there were 61 different types of outcomes that were examined in these studies. About half of the studies addressed cancer-related surgery (6). Below we summarize the one systematic review that has addressed outpatient surgery. One systematic review published in 2020 (7) examined outpatient surgery using international data, analyzed data from eight retrospective studies that addressed seven procedures: anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, cataract surgery, meniscectomy, thyroidectomy, primary hip arthroscopy, open carpal tunnel release, and rotator cuff repair. Study authors found a volume outcome relationship for all but carpal tunnel release and thyroidectomy, however the results did not allow the study authors to recommend clear volume thresholds for these procedures.

The measure includes only the first durable switch that is defined as lasting 30 continues days or longer. Numerator Observed number of switches from in-center hemodialysis to a home dialysis modality (peritoneal dialysis or home hemodialysis) among eligible patients at the facility during the time period. Numerator Exclusions N/A Denominator Expected number of switches from in-center hemodialysis to a home dialysis modality (peritoneal dialysis or home hemodialysis) among eligible patients at the facility during the time period, given the national average of modality switches, and patient case-mix at the facility. Denominator Exclusions Patient's time at risk under hospice care, patient's time at risk when in a nursing home and on home hemodialysis, pediatric patients (less than 18 years of age), patients with no CMS-2728 Medical Evidence form (i.e., AKI patients on dialysis but not designated as ESRD). Patients who are attributed to clinics with fewer than 1 expected modality switch are not excluded from the measure. All patients who meet the denominator inclusion criteria are included and used to model a given facilities expected switch rate to home dialysis. If that switch rate is <1, then the facility is excluded from reporting outcomes.

N/A Number of systematic reviews that inform this measure concept N/A Briefly summarize the peer-reviewed systematic review(s) that inform this measure concept N/A Source of empirical data Published, peer-reviewed original research Summarize the empirical data Home dialysis rates remain low in the United States compared with many other countries, hovering around 12% (Briggs 2019). Because there are not formal randomized controlled trials of modality uptake, the evidence for SMoSR is based on a large body of observational studies in the U.S. as well as outside the U.S. such as Canada, several European countries, and Australia and New Zealand. We evaluated studies that examined the epidemiology and characteristics of home dialysis uptake; educational interventions and processes to support shared-decision making; and studies comparing or assessing outcomes (mortality; hospitalization) between a home dialysis modality (i.e., peritoneal dialysis) and in-center hemodialysis, or the association of home modalities with comorbidities and other health outcomes. Clinical, operational, economic and patient factors have been identified as barriers to uptake of home dialysis modalities (Chan 2019). Clinical factors include lack of physician competency in prescribing home dialysis modalities; operational include lack of clinician and staff training; economic obstacles include lack of sufficient housing or storage space for dialysis supplies; and patient barriers include lack of Top of Document PAGE 26 \u00b7 End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Quality Incentive Program | Standardized Modality Switch Ratio for Incident Dialysis Patients (SMoSR) adequate education. Studies also have identified demographic characteristics of black race, male sex, older age, and comorbidities as predictors of low uptake of home dialysis; while small dialysis facility size and low physician and nurse experience with home dialysis are facility level barriers. Studies that examine the role and impact of education on home modality uptake show that about 30% of chronic dialysis patients have reported their modality selection was not really their choice or did not feel as though they made an informed choice, and that this percentage is higher among in-center hemodialysis Winterbottom 2012). Studies have also found that there is a mismatch between stated preference for dialysis modality (i.e., home dialysis) and the actual modality on which patients start. The preferred modality was a home therapy but in many cases patients started on in-center hemodialysis (Pyart 2018; Keating 2014; Liebman 2012). This suggests existing educational efforts fall short of supporting decision making by the patient. Specifically, decision-making efficacy and satisfaction of modality selection has been reported as greater among PD vs in-center HD patients (Zee 2018) Because of the lack of RCTs comparing dialysis modalities and outcomes, the current evidence is observational in nature. Some studies have shown a survival advantage associated with PD as an initial modality however evidence is mixed about the longer term outcomes and survival benefit for PD versus in-center hemodialysis. As such, in-center and home dialysis are generally considered equivalent with respect to hospitalization rates and mortality. In one meta-review, some differences were observed in physical and mental quality of life domains between patients on PD versus in-center hemodialysis (Budhram 2020) The evidence indicates that persistently low rates of home dialysis use are associated with both patient and facility level factors. Education and shared decision making interventions suggest an opportunity to improve uptake of home dialysis. Moreover, home modalities offer patients potential flexibility and independence. Collectively these studies support the construct of the SMoSR which is an indicator of successful education by the facility to facilitate a decision to switch to a home modality, through on-going educational efforts after a patient starts on in-center hemodialysis.

As noted above, the PIUR (0.606) measures reliability in terms of reflagging rates but is places on the same scale as IUR. A PIUR that is larger than the IUR indicates that the measure has a higher reliability for identifying extreme values. In this case, the IUR and PIUR are nearly the same, so the IUR also is descriptive of the measures usefulness in identifying extreme values.

Spearman's rho Correlations with Quality Outcome Performance Measures: We started by calculating Spearman's rho coefficient to examine the correlation of FYSMR, and SWR. Spearman's correlation coefficient, which is a rank-based correlation metric, was chosen for its robustness against potential extreme providers and tied providers. The peer-reviewed literature is mixed in regard to whether home dialysis compared to in-center dialysis offers better survival or lower hospitalization rates. Therefore, we hypothesized no or weak correlations of SMoSR with SMR, FYSMR, and SHR. However, facility processes of care that support robust modality education should result in higher referral for transplant evaluation and subsequent waitlisting. Therefore, we hypothesized a positive correlation between SMoSR and SWR. Table 1 reports the estimated Spearman's rho correlations. Gamma Tests for Concordance Analysis with Performance Classification: Next, we performed gamma tests to examine the concordance of facility level SMoSR flagging classifications (Better than Expected, \"As Expected\", and \"Worse than Expected\" with 2019 SWR. The choice of gamma tests in the analysis is due to the fact that these performance categories are naturally ordered in a descending order. A positive Gamma coefficient would indicate a concordance in flagging categories between SMoSR and an existing performance measure. In contrast, a negative Gamma signifies a discordant relationship. The null hypothesis of Gamma=0 is set up to test for a significant correlation. The higher a Gamma value the stronger the relationship. We hypothesized that there would be moderate agreement in facility classification of performance between the SMoSR and the first year SWR. The estimated magnitude of concordance is provided in Table 2. Association with patient reported outcomes: ICH-CAHPS \"Providing information to patients\" Top of Document PAGE 32 \u00b7 End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Quality Incentive Program | Standardized Modality Switch Ratio for Incident Dialysis Patients (SMoSR) The In-Center Hemodialysis Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Provider and Systems (ICH-CAHPS)1 is a patient reported experience of care survey to measure in-center hemodialysis patients perspectives on the care they receive at dialysis facilities. This measure is reported on Dialysis Facility Care Compare. We computed a Pearson correlation (rho) to assess the association between the ICH-CAHPS mean scores for the 9 question composite measure on \"providing information to patients\" and SMoSR performance classifications than top box score for \"providing information\" indicates how well the facility is doing providing information on safety as well as all renal replacement modalities, including home dialysis and transplant. Since this facility process of modality education is a critical step for many patients to understand their treatment choices, we expect a higher proportion of patients reporting \"on facilities always providing information\" will be associated with a better performance classification on SMoSR. Please see Table 3 below for this association and the Pearson's correlation r statistic. Association between the percentage of home dialysis patients and performance on SMoSR: We computed a Pearson correlation rho to assess the association between the different SMoSR performance classifications and the percentage of home dialysis patients at a facility. The proportion of home dialysis patients at a facility reflects the processes that are in place to provide effective modality education and then facilitate a transfer from in-center to home dialysis. We expect a better SMoSR performance classification to be associated with a higher percentage of patients on home dialysis at a facility. Table 4 reports these results and the Pearson correlation r statistic. Two-part Semi-continuous Model: A challenge with the analysis for the association between SMoSR and the percentage of home dialysi s patients at a facility is that some facilities have no home program resulting in zero patients on home dialysis. This cluster \"zero-patient\" facilities will distort the correlation calculation due to the significant amount of ties. One option is to delete these facilities from the calculation. However, such an approach would then be based on a selective sub-sample which may introduce bias. To avoid this, we used a two- part semi-continuous regression model that accommodates data that have both a spike at zero and continuous values over the nonzero part (Atchison 1995). In the first part, we used a logistic regression model to predict the propensity of observing facilities with zero (vs. nonzero) percentage of home dialysis patients as a function of the SMoSR, adjusted for a set of facility characteristics. For the second part of the model, a linear regression is fit only among the subset of facilities with non-zero number of home dialysis patients using SMoSR as the predictor for the percentage of home dialysis patients. We adjusted for the same set of facility characteristics as the binary part. The two models are connected formally through a mixture structure, where the mixing proportion is estimated from the data. For the logistic model, we expect a higher SMoSR value to be associated with lower odds of facilities having zero home dialysis patients; whereas for the linear model, we expect a positive association between SMoSR and the percentage of home dialysis patients. These results are presented in Table 5 below. Top of Document PAGE 33 \u00b7 End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Quality Incentive Program | Standardized Modality Switch Ratio for Incident Dialysis Patients (SMoSR) In addition to the above mentioned statistical tests, the validity of the measure is also based on face validity.

This measure was initially endorsed in 2016, but as part of measure maintenance review by the NQF Standing Committee in 2020, concerns were raised about the strength of evidence supporting the prior measure. Namely, recent updates to the KDOQI guidelines downgraded the evidence supporting fistula as the preferred access type and instead focus on catheter avoidance and developing an individualized ESKD Life plan. Numerator The numerator is the adjusted count of adult incident patient-months using an AVF as the sole means of vascular access as of the last hemodialysis treatment session of the month. Numerator Exclusions N/A Denominator All patient-months for patients at least 18 years old as of the first day of the reporting month who are determined to be maintenance hemodialysis patients (in-center and home HD) and became ESRD within the prior 12 months for the entire reporting month at the same facility. Denominator Exclusions Exclusions that are implicit in the denominator definition include: Patient-months after 12 months of starting ESRD Pediatric patients (<18 years old) Patients-months on Peritoneal Dialysis Patient-months with in-center or home hemodialysis for less than a complete reporting month at the same facility In addition, the following exclusions are applied to the denominator: Patients with a catheter that have limited life expectancy: Patients under hospice care in the current reporting month Patients with metastatic cancer in the past 12 months Top of Document PAGE 37 \u00b7 End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Quality Incentive Program\u00b7 | Standardized Fistula Rate for Incident Patients Patients with end stage liver disease in the past 12 months Patients with coma or anoxic brain injury in the past 12 months The denominator is defined at the patient level not facility level. The reason this rule is applied is to comport with how measures are implemented for public reporting. Due to small cell size and potentially identifiable data, facilities with <11 patients do not receive a score. As stated in the measure description and rationale, this is a measure of incident patients only. Dialysis patients in their first 12 months of ESRD are more likely to be using a catheter for vascular access and in turn are at higher risk for CVC related infections. The measure focus is on the first 12 months of dialysis since this is the most active time of vascular access creation and where the potential benefit is greatest relative to treatment with a CVC. Patient attribution to facilities is already described - Patients are required to have been treated by the same facility for the complete month in order to be assigned to that facility for the reporting month. When a patient is not treated in a single facility for a span of 30 days (for instance, if there were two facility transfers within 30 days of each other), we do not attribute that patient to any facility for that month. Therefore, transient treatment at a facility due to either travel or a temporary clinical condition do not impact the fistula rate of that facility. Patients with a catheter (of any duration) AND one or more of the limited life expectancy exclusions are excluded from the denominator.

Claims Data;Registries If applicable, specify the data source N/A Description of parts related to these sources Data are derived from an extensive national ESRD patient database, which is primarily based on the Renal Management Information System (REMIS), EQRS facility-reported clinical and administrative data (including CMS-2728 Medical Evidence Form, CMS-2746 Death Notification Form, and CMS-2744 Annual Facility Survey Form and patient tracking data), the Medicare Enrollment Database (EDB), and Medicare claims data. In addition the database includes transplant data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR), and data from the Nursing Home Minimum Dataset, the Quality Improvement Evaluation System (QIES) Business Intelligence Center (QBIC) (which includes Provider and Survey and Certification data from Automated Survey Processing Environment (ASPEN)), and the Dialysis Facility Compare (DFC). The database is comprehensive for Medicare patients not enrolled in Medicare Advantage. Medicare Advantage patients are included in all sources but their Medicare payment records are limited to inpatient claims. Non-Medicare patients are included in all sources except for the Medicare payment records. Tracking by dialysis provider and treatment modality is available for all patients including those with only partial or no Medicare coverage. Past-year comorbidity data are obtained from multiple claim types (inpatient, outpatient, home health, hospice, skilled nursing facility claims).

In 2015, UM- KECC held a Technical Expert Panel (TEP) to seek input for development of a standardized fistula measure. The TEP agreed that AVF are the preferred access for most patients, and that AVG were still preferred relative to a vascular catheter. The TEP recommended that the AVF measure should be adjusted for conditions where an AVG may be an acceptable alternative such as: older age, diabetes, vascular disease, and BMI. Of note, three of our TEP members went on to author/edit the revised KDOQI Vascular Access Guidelines that were published in 2020. KDOQI Vascular Access Guidelines: In general, the evidence for the guidelines has been rated as either low or moderate, with many of the guidelines relying on expert opinion. The evidence review team focused on 16 studies and noted that bloodstream infections were significantly lower among patients who started HD with an AV fistula or AV graft versus a catheter. The workgroup refrained from recommending AV fistula on the basis of lower mortality compared to catheter use, and instead relied on the evidence indicating lower blood stream infections. The two guidelines that are most directly relevant to this measure are the following: 1. KDOQI suggests that if sufficient time and patient circumstances are favorable for a mature, usable AVF, such a functioning AVF is preferred to an AVG in incident HD patients due to fewer longterm vascular access events (eg, thrombosis, loss of primary patency, interventions) associated with unassisted AVF use. (Conditional Recommendation, Low Quality of Evidence) 2. KDOQI suggests that most incident HD patients starting dialysis with a CVC should convert to either an AVF or AVG, if possible, to reduce their risk of infection/bacteremia, infection-related hospitalizations, and adverse consequences. (Conditional Recommendation, Very Low-Moderate Quality of Evidence) 3. From the peer reviewed literature presented in the revised guidelines, the core evidence that the Workgroup was most compelled by centered around the lower rates of bloodstream infection associated with AVF compared to CVCs. This Top of Document PAGE 43 \u00b7 End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Quality Incentive Program\u00b7 | Standardized Fistula Rate for Incident Patients measure relies on those studies that highlight lower infection risk with AVF that have withstood the enhanced scrutiny of the evidence review team, who noted many vascular access studies were observational in nature and thus had a potential risk of bias. 3. Recent peer-reviewed literature continues to highlight benefits of AVF over CVCs particularly for incident patients who are in their first year of dialysis. Notable recent findings include: AVF associated with lower risk of access-related hospitalizations: One study using USRDS data that focused on elderly patients who started dialysis with a catheter and had an AVF or AVG created within the first 6 months of dialysis noted that AVF creation was associated with a lower risk of access-related hospitalization. AVF has lower rates of blood stream infection and sepsis compared to AVG or CVC: In a study of 2352 incident dialysis patients, after adjusting for confounders, AVF use was associated with 61% lower risk of blood stream infections compared with CVC or AVG use. In a separate study, based on the vascular access used at initiation of dialysis, patients with AVG (HR 1.35) and CVC (HR 1.80) were more likely to develop sepsis (both P < .001). Additionally, in patients who developed sepsis, mortality at 1 year after sepsis was 21% higher in AVG and nearly doubled in CVC when compared to AVF. A third study of patients over the age of 67 who start dialysis with a catheter and went on to have either an AVF or AVG placed in the first 6 months reports that rates of all-cause infection-related hospitalization (RR 0.93, P=0.01) and bacteremia/septicemia-related hospitalization (RR P=0.02) were lower in the AVF group versus AVG group. AVF have lower maintenance interventional requirements compared to AVG: Using USRDS data and accounting for patient characteristics, one study reported that during maturation of the AV access, interventions for both AVFs and AVGs were relatively common and similar between the two types of access. However, once successfully matured, AVFs had lower maintenance interventional requirements. Catheter dependence after AVF or AVG placement among elderly incident dialysis patients is complex: for many younger hemodialysis patients, creation of an AVF, compared with an AVG, is associated with longer initial catheter dependence, but then longer access survival and lower long-term catheter dependence. In patients 67 years of age, similar increased catheter dependence was found at 1 and 3 months after AVF creation, compared to AVG, but lower catheter dependence at 12 and 36 months. However, creation of AVF in the older population was associated with greater cumulative catheter-dependent days (80 vs 55 days per person-year) after 3 years of follow up. From a cost perspective, Hall and colleagues report11 that based on Markov models of hypothetical patients starting dialysis with a CVC, the AVF option was cost effective compared with continued catheter use for all age and life expectancy groups, except for 85-89 year olds in the lowest life expectancy quartile. The AVF option was more cost effective than the AVG option for all quartiles of life expectancy among the 65- to 69-year-old age group. For older age groups, differences in cost- effectiveness between the strategies were attenuated, and the AVF option tended to only be cost effective in patients with life expectancy >2 years. These findings highlights that not all elderly patients will realize the benefit of catheter independence from AVF creation and specific patient characteristics and shared decision making remain critical in appropriate vascular access selection. AVF is associated with higher health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and less depression compared to CVC in the first year of dialysis: A prospective cohort study of 1461 patients who initiated dialysis reported that patients with an AVF had higher KDQOL-36 scores and lower Beck Depression Inventory scores at 3 months and 12 months after the initiation of dialysis compared to those with CVC. Furthermore, in a survey conducted by the American Association of Kidney Patients, satisfaction with current vascular access was 90% with AVF, 79% with AVG, and 67% with CVC. The factors most frequently reported as important in influencing the selection of vascular access modality included infection risk (87%), physician recommendation Top of Document PAGE 44 \u00b7 End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Quality Incentive Program\u00b7 | Standardized Fistula Rate for Incident Patients (84%), vascular access durability (78%), risk of complications involving surgery (76%), and impact on daily activities (73%). As we navigate vascular access decisions that embrace shared decision making and respect patient choice, these two studies highlight that the majority of patients who choose an AVF are satisfied with that decision and may enjoy better health-related quality of life. In summary, the recently revised KDOQI guidelines for vascular access continue to support AV fistula as the preferred vascular access for most patients on dialysis, although with less emphasis than in prior iterations. Long-term catheters are still viewed as the least desirable vascular access, primarily due to the increased risk of blood-stream infections, with increased recognition of certain patient characteristics and scenarios where this access type may be the most appropriate. Given that over 80% of new hemodialysis patients start with a CVC, the additional studies noted above that were published after the updated KDOQI guidelines suggest that attempts to create AVF are still warranted. Summarize the evidence There are three major healthcare processes associated with achieving AVF creation: Patient education interventions: Providing kidney disease education is associated with 1.78 increased odds of starting dialysis with an AVF and a 0.51 odds of starting dialysis with a CVC alone. Patient education can enhance motivation and potentially lead to improved health outcomes. Vascular Access Coordinator/Program: In one study, an organized dialysis access program resulted in a 82% decrease in the number of central venous catheter days which lead to a concurrent reduction in central line-associated bloodstream infection and deaths. As a result of creating an access program, central venous catheter rates decreased from an average rate of 45% to 8%. Surgeon Selection: Several studies have suggested that there is significant variation in likelihood of AVF, as opposed to AVG, creation based on the vascular access surgeon. Using a national claims database to identify patients initiating hemodialysis with a CVC, and adjusting for demographic and comorbi d conditions, the individual surgeon identifier had the greatest magnitude of effect on access type (AVF or AVG) created, with some surgeons more than twice as likely to create AVF as other surgeons. Thus, surgeon selection by the dialysis facility is an important component in efforts to maximize creation of AVF in otherwise eligible patients. Comorbidity adjustment : One frequently cited barrier to successful AVF creation has been the burden of comorbidities at the dialysis facility level. A recent study noted that after adjustment for facility-level comorbidity burden, only small differences in facility rates of AVF use were seen except in the extremes of high or low levels of comorbidity burden. This suggests that dialysis facilities with a relatively high patient comorbidity burden can achieve similar fistula rates as facilities with healthier patients if the above care processes are employed.

Facility-level performance scores were divided into quintiles (Q1 to Q5), and the relative risk (RR) for SMR (and SHR and first year SMR, separately) was calculated for each quintile, using Q5 as the reference group. A RR>1.0 would indicate a higher relative risk of mortality or hospitalization, compared to the lowest performance score quintiles. For the all-cause hospitalization rate and vascular access infection related hospitalization rate, we used linear regression to test the association between the SFR quintiles and the 2018-2019 all-cause hospitalization rate, and 2018-2019 vascular access related infection hospitalization rate, respectively. For all-cause hospitalization and vascular access related infection hospitalization, the respective rate was calculated for each quintile and a trend test of the rates was performed. SMR: We expect a negative association with SMR since successfully creating an AVF is generally seen as representing a robust process to coordinate care outside of the dialysis facility. AVFs are also associated with lower risk of infection which may reduce the risk of a life threatening infection or other poor outcomes that place patients at higher risk of mortality. Higher standardized fistula rates will be negatively associated with SMR. SHR: We expect a negative association with SHR since successfully creating an AVF is generally seen as representing a robust process to coordinate care outside of the dialysis facility, and potentially reduces the risk for patients at such facilities going to hospital due to infections or other acute clinical events. Higher standardized fistula rates will be negatively associated with SHR. First Year SMR: We expect a negative association with the first year SMR as many incident patients begin with a catheter, and therefore face higher risk for infection compared to patients with an AVF. AVFs are associated with lower risk of infection which may reduce the risk of a life threatening infection or other poor outcomes that place patients at higher risk of mortality particularly in their first year of dialysis. Higher standardized fistula rates will be negatively associated with the first year SMR. All-cause hospitalization rate: We expect a negative association between all-cause hospitalization rates and higher AVF rates given the known risk of infection and other complications related to long-term catheter dependence, particularly in incident patients. Vascular access related infection hospitalization rate: We expect a negative association between access related infection hospitalizations and AVF rates because of the higher rates of catheter in patients in the first year of dialysis, which creates a higher risk of a catheter related infection. Cut-points for the quintiles of the performance scores were defined as follows: Top of Document PAGE 49 \u00b7 End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Quality Incentive Program\u00b7 | Standardized Fistula for as Reference Results from the Poisson model indicated that the percent of patient-months with a fistula was significantly associated with the risks of mortality and hospitalization. For the 2018-2019 SMR, the relative risk of mortality increased as the performance measure quintile decreased from the reference group (Q5) with the highest risk in quintile for 2018-2019 SHR, the relative risk of hospitalization increased as the performance measure quintile decreased from the reference group (Q5) with the highest risk in quintile 1. For the 2018 first year SMR, the relative risk of mortality increased as the performance measure quintile decreased from the reference group (Q5)with the highest risk in quintile 1. the 2018-2019 all-cause hospitalization, the hospitalization rate decreased as the performance measure quintile increased.

For the 2018-2019 vascular access related infection hospitalization, the hospitalization rate decreased as the performance measure quintile increased. Hospitalization rates for quintiles 1 to 5 are 0.22, 0.18, 0.17, 0.16, and 0.15 respectively (trend test p<0.001).

N/A Number of systematic reviews that inform this measure concept N/A Briefly summarize the peer-reviewed systematic review(s) that inform this measure concept N/A Source of empirical data Published, peer-reviewed original research Summarize the empirical data Among Medicare beneficiaries, 30% of hospital admissions that originate in the ED are for diagnoses that are often dialysis related such as complications of vascular access, congestive heart failure/fluid overload, septicemia, and hyperkalemia [1]. Recent research points to many additional opportunities to further reduce unnecessary ED use in this population. Programs developed to impact dialysis provider practices have been shown to improve intermediate outcomes (reduced catheter vascular access [3], small solute adequacy, anemia management), hospitalization, and mortality. Cohen and colleagues [9] reported that missed dialysis treatments are associated with an over two-fold higher risk of an ED visit, suggesting an opportunity for dialysis facilities to establish or strengthen Top of Document PAGE 58 \u00b7 End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Quality Incentive Program | Standardized Emergency Department Encounter Ratio (SEDR) for Dialysis Facilities facility practices that can help to reduce skipped treatments through increased communication, care coordination, and patient education. This in turn has the potential to reduce avoidable ED visits. Given the association between missed dialysis treatments and increased risk of an ED visit [4], dialysis facility interventions that improve adhearance to the treatment schedule would be expected to decrease ED utilization. Other interventions, such as telehealth, have been demonstrated to reduce ED utilization in high-risk dialysis patients [5]. Zhang and colleagues [10] reported that rates of ED visits among patients on thrice weekly in-center hemodialysis vary by dialysis schedule (Mon/Weds/Fri; Tues/Thurs/Sat) and by day of week. For example the ED visit rate (without hospital admission) was highest on the day following the longer interdialytic interval over the weekend (Mondays), suggesting an association with facility structure and treatment schedule. In the general population, outpatient ED visits were reported to have increased more slowly for Medicare patients being treated by patient-centered medical home practices when compared to non- patient-centered medical homes[6]. A comparable example that may hold promise of reducing ED use among ESRD dialysis patients is the current CMS Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation Comprehensive End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Care model that emphasizes care coordination as a central feature of care delivery in order to reduce utilization and improve outcomes. During the second performance year, the original Wave 1 cohort of ESCOs (ESRD Seamless Care Organizations) experienced about a 3% reduction in ED use relative to the period before the CEC model was launched [11]. Finally, low health literacy has been associated with increased use of ED services [7] and some studies have indicated that patient education interventions can reduce ED utilization [8]. 1.

Next we calculated mean performance scores for several quality measures: Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR), Standardized Transfusion Ratio (STrR), Standardized Fistula Rate (SFR), Percentage of Prevalent Patients Waitlisted (PPPW), Standardized Hospitalization Ratio (SHR), and Emergency Department Visit within 30 days of discharge (ED30). We then compared mean performance scores across the two strata of better than/as expected and worse than expected categories for SEDR. Top of Document PAGE 63 \u00b7 End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Quality Incentive Program | Standardized Emergency Department Encounter Ratio (SEDR) for Dialysis Facilities Statistically significant outliers (i.e., better and worse than expected) were determined using the method described in section 2b4.1 to flag facilities as better than expected and worse than expected based on the national average, at the p<0.05 level. We expect better mean performance on the above quality measures for facilities classified as better than/as expected for SEDR compared to facilities classified as worse than expected. Compared to facilities that perform worse than expected, facilities that perform better than/as expected on SEDR are likely to have more successful care coordination and other processes of care in place that may help patients avoid an ED visit: SMR: We expect to observe a lower mean standardized mortality ratio for facilities in the better than/as expected category for SEDR compared to facilities classified as worse than expected. Facilities with a higher rate of ED utilization may not have care processes in place to support management of acute care. STrR: We expect to observe a lower mean standardized transfusion event ratio for facilities in the better than/as expected category for SEDR compared to facilities classified as worse than expected. Facilities that have a lower STrR likely have processes of care in place to support robust anemia management and other care processes compared to facilities with a higher STrR. Standardized Fistula Rate (SFR): We expect to observe a higher mean standardized fistula rate for facilities in the better than/as expected category for SEDR compared to facilities classified as worse than expected. AVFs are typically considered to be the preferred vascular access due to lower risk of infection and potential need for hospitalization or other acute care. Higher standardized fistula rates suggests facilities are successful at creating AVFs due to more robust processes to coordinate care outside of the dialysis facility. Facilities that do a better job at care coordination reduce the likelihood that patients will experience a preventable and unscheduled acute event resulting in an ED visit. PPPW: We expect to observe a higher mean standardized percentage of prevalent patients on the waitlist for facilities in the better than/as expected category for SEDR compared to facilities classified as worse than expected. Facilities that have a higher standardized percentage of patients on the transplant waitlist suggest they may have more robust processes to coordinate care outside of the dialysis facility with other providers and the transplant center, compared to facilities with lower percentages. This includes the facility taking steps to ensure patients maintain sufficient health status in order to be placed on the waitlist. Therefore, facilities that have higher standardized waitlist percentages are likely deploying effective care coordination and other care processes that may reduce the likelihood of patients getting preventable and unscheduled acute care from the ED. SHR: We expect that facilities classified as worse than expected for SEDR will have a standardized hospitalization ratio that is close to the national norm. SEDR only captures outpatient ED visits that do not result in an admission which, by definition, is a different patient subpopulation than SHR. Patients that require acute care from the ED without an admission likely have lower acuity medical needs that can be handled in an outpatient setting without admission. Therefore we do not expect SEDR flagging to be related to how facilities perform on SHR. ED30: We expect to observe a lower mean ED30 ratio for facilities classified as better than/as expected for SEDR compared to facilities classified as worse than expected since both measures are a reflection of Top of Document PAGE 64 \u00b7 End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Quality Incentive Program | Standardized Emergency Department Encounter Ratio (SEDR) for Dialysis Facilities outpatient ED use. However the measures represent two different aspects of dialysis patients emergency department use that assess complementary elements of facility care. A low SEDR, corresponding to low overall emergency department encounter rates, indicates that the facility has processes (e.g. patient/staff education, assistance with primary care, frequent evaluation of target weight) in place to avoid the need for unscheduled acute care. A low ED30 indicates that a facility is successful in managing the transition of care (e.g. medication reconciliation, evaluation of target weight, assistance with follow up appointments) that occurs after a hospital discharge.

It is expressed as a percentage of eligible CT exams that are out- of-range based on having either excessive radiation dose or inadequate image quality, relative to evidence-based thresholds based on the clinical indication for the exam. All diagnostic CT exams of specified anatomic sites performed in inpatient hospital care settings are eligible. Numerator Diagnostic CT exams that have a size-adjusted radiation dose value greater than the threshold specific to the CT category (reflecting the body region imaged and the radiation dose and image quality required for that exam given the reason for the exam), or a noise value greater than a threshold specific to the CT Category. Numerator Exclusions None Denominator All diagnostic CT exams performed on adults (aged 18 years and older) during the measurement period of one year that have an assigned CT category, a size-adjusted radiation dose value, and a global noise value. Denominator Exclusions Denominator exclusions are CT exams that simultaneously include multiple body regions outside of four commonly encountered multiple region groupings (specified as LOINC code 96914-7, CT Dose and Image Quality Category, Full Body). Denominator exclusions are also CT exams with missing patient age, missing size- adjusted radiation dose, or missing noise. These are technical exclusions (\"missing data\") from the initial population. Technical exclusions will be flagged, corrected whenever possible, and tracked at the level of the accountable entity.

Not a composite or component of a composite measure If Other, Please Specify N/A What data sources are used for the measure? Electronic Clinical Data (non-EHR);Electronic Health Record If applicable, specify the data source N/A Description of parts related to these sources (1) The measure derives standardized data elements from structured fields within the EHR and the radiology electronic clinical data systems, including the Radiology Information System (RIS) and the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). These re labeled A and B below. (2) Primary imaging data stored in structured fields in the radiology electronic clinical data systems have been historically inaccessible using the existing eCQM framework. (3) Thus, the eCQM cannot consume CT images and Radiation Dose Structured Reports (RDSR, which contain the radiation dose) in their original DICOM formats. These primary data, listed below, must be transformed into calculated data elements that can then be ingested by the eCQM. (4) This is described in the feasibility attachment. The measure developers have created software (available for free to reporting entities) to transform primary data elements from these electronic systems to generate variables that the eCQM uses to calculate the measure score. These electronic systems include (A) EHR: The measure characterizes CT exams based on the type of exam performed (derived from procedure (CPT) codes associated with the exam bill), and the reason for study (derived from diagnosis (ICD- 10-CM) codes associated with the exam order and bill). (Data element Diagnostic study, performed: CT Studies) During transformation, a validated algorithm uses combinations of CPT and ICD- 10-CM codes to generate the CT Dose and Image Quality Category (CT category, LOINC code 96914-7) that specifies the radiation dose and image quality thresholds for each CT exam. The measure also derives birth date to calculate age at the start of the measurement period, and supplemental data elements including payer, race, ethnicity, and sex. (B) RADIOLOGY ELECTRONIC CLINICAL DATA SYSTEMS (NON-EHR): The PACS stores CT exam data generated by CT machines during the ordinary course of care, including image pixel data (data element Diagnostic Study Performed: CT Studies Result attribute: Image Pixel Data) and Radiation Dose Structured Reports Top of Document PAGE 70 \u00b7 Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program | Excessive Radiation Dose or Inadequate Image Quality for Diagnostic Computed Tomography (CT) in Adults (Hospital Level - Inpatient) (RDSR) (data element Diagnostic Study Performed: CT Studies Result attribute: Radiation Dose Structured Report (RDSR)) Both of these data are formatted and stored as DICOM structured data. These primary data elements are used for calculating inputs to the eCQM, including the Calculated CT Size- Adjusted Dose (size-adjusted dose, LOINC code 96913-9) and Calculated CT Global Noise (noise, LOINC code (96912-1), respectively.

There are no Hospital IQR measures addressing CT or radiation doses.

Three existing MIPS measures are related (not competing) in that they address patient safety related to radiation exposure in CT imaging: (1) Optimizing Patient Exposure Top of Document PAGE 72 \u00b7 Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program | Excessive Radiation Dose or Inadequate Image Quality for Diagnostic Computed Tomography (CT) in Adults (Hospital Level - Inpatient) to Ionizing Radiation: Count of Potential High Dose Radiation Imaging Studies: Computed Tomography (CT) and Cardiac Nuclear Medicine Studies (CMIT 2286); (2) Radiation Consideration for Adult CT: Utilization of Dose Lowering Techniques (CMIT 2570); and (3) Multi-strata weighted average for 3 CT Exam Types: Overall Percent of CT exams for which Dose Length Product is at or below the size-specific diagnostic reference level (for CT Abdomen-pelvis with contrast/single phase scan, CT Chest without contrast/single scan and CT Head/Brain without contrast/single phase scan) (ACRAD34). How will this measure be distinguished from other similar and/or competing measures? See related measures attachment. How will this measure add value to the CMS program? (1) IT WOULD BE THE ONLY RADIOLOGY ECQM IN THE CMS MEASURES INVENTORY, aligning with CMS's goal of transitioning to all digital quality measures by 2025. Our measure is designed using both QDM and FHIR specifications, supporting CMS's stated intention of encouraging heal thcare information interoperability based on standard APIs, specifically FHIR. (2) IT IS THE FIRST AND ONLY MEASURE TO ASSESS IMAGE QUALITY as a means of protecting the diagnostic value of CT imaging from unintended consequences of excessive radiation dose reduction. (3) IT ASSESSES RADIATION DOSE AND IMAGE QUALITY BASED ON THE UNDERLYING CLINICAL INDICATION - in other words, the reason the patient was imaged - and not based simply on the exam that was performed, which often results in doses higher than needed for diagnosis. The measure covers the two key process of care components that determine the radiation doses, including: (a) the choice of imaging protocol (i.e. the type of CT exam - for example, whether a patient is imaged with a single- or double- phase CT exam); and (b) decisions regarding the technical settings used for that type of CT exam, which are usually at the discretion of the technologist or medical physicist who oversees and operates the machines. Both components contribute to radiation dose, and as a result, a comprehensive quality measure must encompass both of these decision-making processes. This measure is uniquely able to encompass both components. (4) THE DENOMINATOR INCLUDES MOST DIAGNOSTIC CT EXAMS in adults, including multiphase high dose examination types. And (5) THE MEASURE ADJUSTS FOR PATIENT SIZE, an important contributor to dose.

All data elements were found to be available and accessible, accurate, and structured in standardized vocabularies. Generating and collecting the data elements had no impact on clinician workflow. Please see feasibility attachment for more details on how feasibility was evaluated, as well as how the measure will be operationalized. Method of Measure Calculation eCQM Hybrid measure: Methods of measure calculation N/A Evidence of Performance Gap The measure was developed to address a considerable performance gap in the use of excessive and highly variable radiation dose in CT imaging. Doses used for CT vary substantially across imaging facilities for patients imaged for the same clinical indication. For example, (1) In a prior study of 151 imaging facilities and hospitals, even after adjusting for patient characteristics, abdominal CT exams had a four- fold range in mean effective radiation dose and a 17-fold range in the proportion of high dose exams (Smith-Bindman 2019). (2) EVIDENCE IN THE UCSF REGISTRY: When we applied the proposed measure to the UCSF International CT Dose Registry - a repository of CT data containing over 8 million exams from 161 hospitals and imaging facilities - overall 33% of CT exams were out- of-range based on radiation dose criteria. Overall, 135 facilities (84%) had out- of-range scores over 10%. (3) EVIDENCE IN THE FIELD-TESTING DATA: In the field-testing performed at 15 inpatient hospital sites - the rates of out- of-range exams varied 16%-43% by site. Virtually all of this was driven by excessive radiation doses, as extremely few CT exams were assessed as out- of-range based on noise: on average <1% across all reporting entities. (4) SUMMARY: This variation in radiation dose underscores the performance gap that the measure addresses, and these outcomes indicate a considerable opportunity to reduce doses without impacting quality. Unintended Consequences There is a relationship between image quality and radiation dose such that, as radiation dose increases, image quality increases until a threshold is reached, at which point no further diagnostic benefit from image quality occurs. Conversely, too little radiation dose can produce inadequate image quality. Thus, image quality must remain diagnostically sufficient as excessive doses are lowered. The actual risk for this is low, as research suggests doses may be lowered between 50-90% without impacting image diagnostic utility (den Harder 2018, Rob 2017, Konda 2016, Huppertz 2015). In our field-testing data, out-of-range measure scores due to inadequate image quality (i.e. excessive noise) were exceedingly rare, with less than 1% of exams, on average, across all reporting entities. This was to some degree expected, given the results of an Image Quality Study - performed as part of measure development - in which radiologists graded 3% and 8% of exams as \"poor\" or \"marginally acceptable\" image quality, respectively (manuscript in preparation). These findings support a considerable opportunity to reduce radiation doses without impacting quality. Given the evidence of harm from excessive radiation, and the low likelihood of deteriorating image quality to the point of rendering exams unacceptable, there is little Top of Document PAGE 74 \u00b7 Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program | Excessive Radiation Dose or Inadequate Image Quality for Diagnostic Computed Tomography (CT) in Adults (Hospital Level - Inpatient) question that the benefit outweighs the cost of dose optimization. Nevertheless, the measure steward will monitor out- of-range rates annually to determine if image quality is worsening due to declining radiation doses and determine if thresholds should be adjusted or if a subsequent radiologist satisfaction study should be repeated. Number of clinical guidelines, including USPSTF guidelines, that address this measure topic 7 Outline the clinical guidelines supporting this measure The proposed measure aligns with numerous consensus-based clinical recommendations and guidelines asking radiologists to track, optimize, and lower the radiation doses they use for CT. These guidelines are based on evidence that radiation doses are highly variable across institutions, higher than needed for diagnosis, and can lead to excessive patient harm. These recommendations and guidelines have been written by: the American College of Radiology (Kanal 2017); a collaboration of the American College of Radiology, The American Association of Physicists in Medicine, and the Society for Pediatric Radiology (ACR-AAPM-SPR 2018); the Radiological Society of North America (Hricak 2010); the Society of Interventional Radiology (Stecker 2009); the Society of Cardiovascular CT (Halliburton 2011); Image Gently, an initiative of the American College of Radiology, the Radiological Society of North America, American Society of Radiologic Technologists, and American Association of Physicists in Medicine (Goske 2008); and the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration 2019). The most common approach advised is for physicians to collect and compare their doses to benchmarks and to reduce their doses if they are found to routinely exceed these benchmarks. Name the guideline developer/entity The guideline was jointly developed by the American College of Radiology (ACR), the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM), and the Society of Pediatric Radiology (SPR).

Number of systematic reviews that inform this measure concept 3 Briefly summarize the peer-reviewed systematic review(s) that inform this measure concept Please see systematic reviews evidence attachment. Source of empirical data Published, peer-reviewed original research Top of Document PAGE 76 \u00b7 Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program | Excessive Radiation Dose or Inadequate Image Quality for Diagnostic Computed Tomography (CT) in Adults (Hospital Level - Inpatient) Summarize the empirical data (1) THERE IS EVIDENCE OF A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROCESS INTERVENTIONS (SPECIFICALLY, EDUCATIONAL FEEDBACK SIMILAR TO THAT PROVIDED BY THIS MEASURE) AND THE INTERMEDIATE OUTCOME OF THIS MEASURE, RADIATION DOSE. In a randomized controlled trial involving roughly 1 million CT exams from 100 imaging facilities across 6 countries, Smith-Bindman et al. observed that multicomponent educational feedback achieved a 23-58% reductions in the proportion of high-dose exams, based on organ dose, with no observed change in image quality. (Smith-Bindman 2020) Another interventional study across the University of California system deployed radiation dose audits and best practice sharing, resulting in considerable dose reductions: a 19% and 25% decrease in mean effective dose for chest and abdomen exams, respectively, and a reduction in the number of exams exceeding allowable benchmarks by 48% and 54% for chest and abdomen, respectively. (Demb 2017). (2) THERE IS EXTENSIVE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND BIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE THAT SUGGESTS EXPOSURE TO RADIATION IN THE SAME RANGE AS THAT ROUTINELY DELIVERED BY CT (10-100 MILLI-SIEVERTS, MSV) INCREASES A PERSON'S RISK OF DEVELOPING CANCER (Board of Radiation Effects 2006, Pearce 2012, Pierce 2000, Preston 2007, Brenner 2003, Hong 2019). In a case-control study of over 3 million adult patients imaged between 2000-2013 in Taiwan, Shao et al. found that exposure to CT imaging was associated with elevated risk of thyroid cancer (OR = 2.55, 95% CI = 2.36 to 2.75) and leukemia (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.42 to 1.68) for all patients, with higher risk in women, and for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in patients aged 45 or younger. (Shao 2019) A clear dose-response relationship was observed in patients 45 years or younger for all three cancers. (3) DESPITE THE KNOWN RISKS OF CT, ITS USE HAS GROWN SUBSTANTIALLY over the last few decades (Harvey L Neiman 2017), with 91.4 million CT exams performed in the United States in 2019 (IMV 2020), including 428 exams per 1000 patients aged 65 years and older (Smith-Bindman 2019). It was estimated in 2009 that 2% of cancers diagnosed annually are the result of CT; in 2019 that would amount to 36,000 cancers diagnosed each year due to the use of CT.

The adequacy of the resulting size-adjusted dose- length product was assessed using the same model, but with the outcome of (raw) dose-length product replaced with the size-adjusted dose-length product. Prior to size adjustment, the marginal R-squared relating patient diameter to dose was 0.08 for the average CT category, increasing to as high as 0.29 for the CT category (Low Dose Abdomen) with the strongest relationship between patient diameter and dose-length product. After size adjustment, the marginal R-squared relating patient diameter to dose is uniformly <0.01 for all CT categories. This suggests that the adjustment mechanism has adequately removed bias from patient diameter, a potential confounder of the relationship between dose-length product and quality of care. Please see the risk adjustment methodology attachment for further details. Rationale for not using risk adjustment N/A Cost estimate completed Yes Cost estimate methods and results COST IMPACT: The measure is expected to result in cost savings to Medicare of $1,859,606,000 to $5,206,896,800 annually, based on an estimate of $133,000 - $372,400 per cancer avoided. Implementation costs to reporting entities are expected to be around $ 3250 per hospital annually. ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND COST SAVINGS ESTIMATE: Based on the current estimated number of CT exams Top of Document PAGE 78 \u00b7 Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program | Excessive Radiation Dose or Inadequate Image Quality for Diagnostic Computed Tomography (CT) in Adults (Hospital Level - Inpatient) performed annually in the U.S. [IMV 2020], distribution in exam types and observed doses [Demb 2017, Smith-Bindman 2019], and modelling of the with CT [Berrington de Gonzalez 2009], 18,643 cancers could be prevented annually by reducing doses to the median measure score from our testing data. The majority of these cancers will be prevented among elderly adults because imaging rates are nearly five times higher in that population [Smith-Bindman 2019], and because absolute and excess cancer rates are higher among older adults compared with non-elderly adults or children [Berrington de Gonzalez 2009, Shuryak 2010]. We estimate that 75% of all cancers prevented annually (13,982) will occur among Medicare beneficiaries who undergo CT, and that approximately 3 cancers would be prevented per 10,000 Medicare patients who undergo CT (or 1 cancer per 3,254 patients). The cost avoided by the measure reflects the cost of cancer cases prevented. The cost of care for breast, colorectal, and lung cancer during the 4 years after diagnosis in 2011 was estimated at $100,000-$280,000 per case [Dieguez 2017]. This estimate was based on actual costs incurred between 2011 -2014 and was not adjusted for inflation, though cancer care costs were projected to rise 27-39% between 2011 and 2020 (Mariotto 2011). Using a mean inflation rate of 33% between 2011 and 2020, this reflects a 4-year cost per cancer ranging from $133,000 to $372,400 per case avoided. Using this average cost of cancer care ($133,000-$372,400) and the number of cancers prevented annually among Medicare beneficiaries (13,982). This results in $1.86 billion to $5.21 billion annual cost savings. Furthermore, cancer patients who survive beyond the first 4 years may continue to incur high costs, especially in the last year of life. Thus, these estimates could be lower than actual savings. ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND IMPLEMENTATION/REPORTING COST ESTIMATE: We estimate the implementation costs at $3250 per hospital based on the time and costs reported by our field-testing sites (see feasibility attachment for more information). This estimate is likely conservative, as our testing partners noted that the work of assembling the relevant data decreased over time. For hospitals that are part of large health systems, the cost may be incurred at the health system level rather than at the level of the individual hospital.

We used randomly split samples for each accountable entity with 1,000 repetitions, applying a one-way random effects model, assuming that both entity effects and residual effects are random, independent, and normally distributed with mean 0. This approach corresponds to Case 1 or the ICC(1) in McGraw and Wong's seminal description of ICC reliability methods. (McGraw 1996) The Spearman-Brown prophecy formula was applied, in the usual manner, to adjust reliability from one-month test samples to the anticipated 12-month sample (i.e., (12*r)/(1 + (11*r)). (Frey 2018) These ICC(1) estimates (bounded between 0 and 1) were then logit-transformed and used to model the linear relationship between entity volume and logit reliability. By ranking predicted reliabilities across the complete range of potential volumes, we estimated the volume threshold that would correspond to ICC(1)=0.9 for an accountable entity. Random Split-Half Correlation: Sample size 15 Random Split-Half Correlation: Statistical result 0.99 Random Split-Half Correlation: Interpretation of results According to the scale developed by Koo and Li, an ICC estimate greater than 0.90 may be interpreted as excellent reliability. (Koo 2016) Based on the mean ICC of 0.99, after Spearman-Brown adjustment to a 12-month reporting period, the measure is reliable at the hospital level. Given the high volume of CT, virtually no hospitals would fall below the minimum denominator to achieve ICC >0.90.

Our measure fills this quality gap and is aligned with clinical recommendations, grounded in extensive epidemiologic evidence, and tested in diverse settings. The measure also supports CMS in moving from process or QCDR measures to intermediate outcome measures that focus on radiation-related risk reduction for exposed patients and populations. This measure is also the first radiology digital quality measure. Using electronic and standardized data already collected as part of routine clinical care, our measure assesses the radiation dose for every exam, taking into consideration the reason for the exam and patient size, and is coupled with an assessment of imaging quality to ensure that efforts to reduce radiation dose do not result in poor image quality. The measure will improve patient safety, reduce population-level cancer risks, and reduce associated cancer-related morbidity, mortality, and cost. 100% of the diverse technical expert panel (TEP) members assembled for this measure's development a greed that performance on the measure as specified is a representation of quality, differentiating good from poor performance. 100% of TEP members agreed that the measure, if implemented, is likely or very likely to improve quality. The measure is also undergoing endorsement review by the National Quality Forum in the Fall 2021 cycle. The reliability and validity of the measure were considered acceptable for endorsement by the NQF Scientific Methods Panel in October 2021. Subsequently, the Patient Safety Standing Committee evaluated the measure in February 2022 and recommended NQF endorsement. In the related public commenting period, over 20 messages of support were submitted from various notable stakeholders and testing site partners. A final endorsement will be issued in July 2022.

To achieve this objective and set the program standards, key benchmarks were established/achieved: 1.1.) Gather Literature and Develop Preliminary Standards: The CQGS CDT completed a comprehensive literature review in February 2016 and released the preliminary standards to stakeholders in April 2016. 1.2.) Conduct Preliminary Field Visits: Between December 2015 and April 2016, the CDT conducted 11 field visits in 7 cities across the country to measure the current state of surgery in older adults, evaluate scalability of the program, identify best practices already in place serving older adult surgery patients and gain perspectives/opinions from frontline staff. CDT reported on the field visit findings to CQGS stakeholders in May 2016. 1.3.) Refine and Vet Standards w/ Stakeholders: Top of Document PAGE 95 \u00b7 Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program | Geriatrics Surgical Measure 1.3.1.) CQGS Preliminary Standards written in 2016 by the CDT, and based on ratings analysis, standards were repackaged from 308 standards into 92 Alpha Standards in 2017 [using a modified version of the RAND-UCLA Appropriateness Methodology, 44 of the 58 CQGS stakeholders performed two ratings on the validity and feasibility of the standards. Based on the ratings analysis, became 92 Alpha Standards and implemented into Alpha Pilot]. 1.3.2.) The CQGS invited 15 hospitals to participate in a survey to determine which of the standards were already implemented, understand how easy or difficult the standards would be to implement if not already in practice, and identify and record standards that were confusing or difficult to interpret. 1.3.3.) From the results of Alpha Pilot, the 92 Alpha Standards were further condensed to 30 Beta Standards, categorized into 6 chapters: Program management, Goals and Decision-Making, Preoperative Optimization, Immediate Preoperative and Intraoperative Clinical Care, Postoperative Clinical Care, and Transitions of Care. The Beta Standards were released in November 2017. 1.3.4.) 8 hospitals participated in the Beta Pilot in December 2017 to determine the feasibility of implementation for each beta standard, collect \"best practices\" for standards implementation, learn barriers to implementation in hospitals of varying size, facility-type, and location, identify issues in the wording of the standards leading to misinterpretation, continue to record rationale for or against the standards, and resolve difficulties in the verification process. Beginning in June of 2018, site visits to each pilot hospital were performed and report was released end of 2018. 2.) Using the data from the Beta Pilot, the CQGS team finalized the standards and developed educational and supportive materials to aid in the official GSV Program launch in July 2019 with release of Optimal Resources for Geriatric Surgery 2019 Standards. 3.) GSV Program began accepting applications for enrollment in October 2019. To date: 53 hospitals enrolled in the program in various stages of implementation. 3 hospitals have completed verification process. 4.) In 2021, ACS conveyed a team of experts in geriatric surgical care to evaluate the GSV standards to determine feasibility as a measure that collectively improves care for older adults. 5.) In January 2022, 9 unique hospitals committed to providing optimal geriatric surgical care (as demonstrated through their established centers for geriatrics, participation in age-friendly health initiatives, or enrollment in the GSV Program, or any combination of these elements), were surveyed to evaluate implementation of key measures that collectively improve care for older adults. The key measure domains were determined through the combination of both the established ACS quality framework, and the processes, resources, and infrastructures necessary for the optimal care of the older adult surgical patient as determined by JAHF grant work.

The US population is rapidly aging and is one of the fastest-growing demographics in the country. Based on 2019 US Census data, the 65-and-older population grew by over a third since 2010, and by 2030 this population is estimated to grow to 72 million (20% of the total population). (1-3) Currently, over 4 million high risk operations (procedures with a mortality rate over 1%) are performed on adults over 65 annually. (3) Hospitals are increasingly faced with older patients who have complex medical, physiological, and psychosocial needs that are often inadequately addressed by the current healthcare infrastructure. Despite this growing need, our healthcare system has not comprehensively rethought care for the complex geriatric population since the creation of Medicare more than 50 years ago. Part of what is needed in rethinking care for the older adult population is programmatic facility-level geriatric measurement. This solution is different from the current types of CMS measures, this programmatic measure incentivizes team-based care organized around the geriatric surgical patient to meet the challenges unique to geriatric surgical patients. Although existing quality metrics have improved both the rate and reporting of clinical outcomes (falls, appropriate use of anticoagulants, etc.) that are important to older individuals, these measures can be narrow in scope and may have limited long term effectiveness due to ceiling effects. Rather than simply addressing individual clinical issues in isolation, optimizing care for older patients with multifaceted vulnerability profiles will require a holistic approach with the goal of reframing the entire care pathway to better serve the needs of this unique population. The Geriatric Surgery Measure was developed with the Modified Delphi method, receiving input from more than 50 organizations, including the ACS. The multistakeholder group identified clinical frameworks based on evidence and best practices that provide goal-centered, clinically effective care for older patients. As a result, this programmatic measure consists of structural and process measures which address all 6 Institute of Medicine domains (safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, equitable), and is comprehensive across the full spectrum of geriatric surgical care. This programmatic measure differs from the classical NQF structural measures or process measures which are usually singular structural components, or a simple process tied to a transaction/patient visit. The challenge with classical structure or processes measures is that care is not a single structural element or process. It is the collection of all these components orchestrated across the continuum of care for the entire team in a patient-centered manner. Together, these become a patient-centered program of care. When the components are properly tied together, care becomes well-coordinated, complex aspects of care are more reliably delivered, harms are minimized, and outcomes are optimized. The elements in the program are focused around care delivery, coordination, data, and data-driven improvement activities. When CMS and NQF consider what we know as traditional structural and process measures, we agree that singular elements within one or another transaction as part of a series of transactions in health are \"check-the-box\" measures. These have limited impact on quality or improvement. However, within clinical domains of care such as geriatric surgical care, there are crucial structures and processes of care that reach across multiple transactions and link the care team's efforts together. The Geriatric Surgery Hospital Measure is based on key standards within the ACS Geriatric Surgical Verification Program (GSV) program, which follows the ACS Quality Model --the framework used across all ACS Quality programs, Top of Document PAGE 99 \u00b7 Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program | Geriatrics Surgical Measure including the Trauma Center Verification Program, the Commission on Cancer (CoC), and the Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Verification program, and so on. Orchestrating all these elements result in better outcomes and improving their implementation would be an essential first step in surgical outcomes. (4- 10) Currently, CMS quality programs consist of a large, extremely costly universe of measures in multiple different payment programs. They often lack the consideration for focusing a surgical team in a patient- centered way. Such sporadic measurement creates a massive amount of burden and overhead but has a limited impact on improving the quality of overall care --this is especially evident in the MIPS program. (11-12) As a result, these efforts fail to create accountability to patients for the care they receive. Measuring a surgeon with sporadic metrics and disjointedly measuring anesthesia services, pathology, radiology and facility care with disparate measure sets does not create the alignment needed. The development of individual measures and the subsequent combination of these measures into payment incentive programs may be useful for fee-for-service payment. However, value-based payments need a more condition, patient-type approach. This proposed approach is programmatic within a clinical domain. Its implementation will create a team-based approach to optimizing the patient's chance at achieving their desired outcome. While this measure may appear long in its specification, it is a yearly attestation measure, and therefore the reporting burden is less burdensome on the surgical team and facility when compared to most CMS measures that require regular reporting of individual events included in the numerator. This programmatic approach also offers useful information that patients will find beneficial when deciding where to seek care. An important standard to apply in evaluating payment quality incentives is their effectiveness in providing patients with knowledge of where to find high quality care in their community. Twenty years of NQF and payer actions in quality have not produced reliable public knowledge or a public-facing website that informs patients about where to get the care they need for the condition they have. Information on the comprehensiveness of a quality program, along with comparable information on the price of that care, are the prerequisites for a valid depiction of the value of care. In assessing the effectiveness of our measures, we wonder if the patient had this information, would it enable them to easily find information on a website for the types of care they seek, for a safety and equitability profile and for personal goal attainment. This programmatic measure is the first step needed to build the foundation to care for the rapidly aging Medicare population. At this time, this effort does not meet all of the goals toward value-based care, but it is designed to be added to appropriate condition or procedure specific cost measures, which would help patients determine the affordability of the care they desire. Combining quality and price for care is a key step in establishing value.

The measure, based on NQF #2879, uses enrollment data, inpatient claims, and electronic health record data. Hospitals receive a single summary RSRR, derived from the volume-weighted results of five specialty cohorts. Conditionally supported by the MAP pending NQF endorsement and currently in the IQR Program (voluntary reporting 7/1/2021, mandatory reporting beginning 7/1/2023). This MUC submission expands the cohort from Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) patients to include Medicare Advantage patients age 65 & older. Numerator The outcome for this measure is 30-day unplanned readmission. We define readmission as an inpatient admission for any cause, except for certain planned readmissions, within 30 days from the date of discharge from an eligible index admission. If a patient has more than one unplanned admission (for any reason) within 30 days after discharge from the index admission, only one is counted as a readmission. The measure looks for a dichotomous yes or no outcome of whether each admitted patient has an unplanned readmission within 30 days. Numerator Exclusions N/A Denominator The measure includes admissions for beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare FFS and/or Medicare Advantage for the 12 months prior to the date of index admission, on the date of the index admission, and the 30 days following discharge of the index admission; aged 65 or over; discharged alive from a non-federal short-term acute care hospital; and not transferred to another acute care facility. Denominator Exclusions The measure excludes index admissions for patients: 1. Admitted to a Prospective Payment System (PPS)-exempt cancer hospital; 2. Without at least 30 days post-discharge enrollment in FFS Medicare or Medicare Advantage; 3. Discharged against medical advice (AMA); 4. Admitted for primary psychiatric diagnoses; Top of Document PAGE 101 \u00b7 Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program | Hybrid Hospital-Wide All-Cause Risk Standardized Readmission Measure 5. Admitted for rehabilitation; or 6. Admitted for medical treatment of cancer. Note: Patients who do not have a full 30 days of post-discharge enrollment in Medicare FFS or Medicare Advantage due to death are eligible for inclusion in the cohort. Thus, if a patient had an unplanned readmission and later died, all within 30 days of discharge from the index admission, the case would be captured in the outcome, assuming they met all inclusion/exclusion criteria.

The MAP supported continued development of this measure, noting the potential to improve the measure risk adjustment model by including available clinical data. Further, members highlighted the need to review the conceptual and empirical relationship between SDS factors and this outcome and include such variables if appropriate. Further, MAP noted that CMS should review the empirical and conceptual relationship between SDS factors and hospital-wide readmissions and seek endorsement on this version of the measure by the relevant NQF standing committee.

This Hybrid measure utilizes EHR clinical data for risk adjustment in addition to claims data. The Hybrid measure is identical to the claims-only HWR measure, except for the addition of the important clinical data added for use in risk adjustment. The cohort expansion of the Hybrid HWR measure to include MA Top of Document PAGE 105 \u00b7 Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program | Hybrid Hospital-Wide All-Cause Risk Standardized Readmission Measure admissions is the only material change to the Hybrid HWR measure (currently in voluntary reporting) being considered How will this measure add value to the CMS program? Specifically, this Hybrid HWR measure will complement the existing CMS Hospital-Wide All-Cause Risk- Standardized Mortality Measure to allow assessment of trends in hospital performance for both outcomes, similar to other complementary pairs of readmission and mortality measures for specific conditions and procedures. Further, the Hybrid HWR measure will provide annually updated performance estimates for a larger proportion of the nations hospitals, allowing significant performance outliers to be identified. We would also like to note that the hospital-wide readmission measures cannot be adopted into the HRRP program as measures in HRRP must be condition- or procedure-specific. The existing Hybrid HWR measure is scheduled to replace the currently implemented claims-only HWR measure in 2025 reporting, with the addition of Medicare Advantage patients pending pre-rulemaking and rulemaking. If this measure is being proposed to meet a statutory requirement, please list the corresponding statute N/A Section 2: Measure Evidence How is the measure expected to be reported to the program? eCQM;Claims Stratification No Feasibility of Data Elements Some data elements are in defined fields in electronic sources Feasibility Assessment This measure uses data from claims and the EHR. We tested the feasibility and validity of electronic extraction of these critical data elements as part of a more comprehensive evaluation of a larger set of core clinical data elements (CCDEs). The CCDE are a set of 21 EHR data elements that are captured on most adults admitted to acute care hospitals, are easily extracted from EHRs, and can be used to risk adjust hospital outcome measures for a variety of conditions and procedures. All of the critical data elements used in the Hybrid HWR measure are included in the CCDE. Testing of the CCDE involved three phases: 1) identification of potentially feasible clinical data through qualitative assessment, 2) empirical feasibility testing of several clinical data elements electronically extracted from two large multi-facility health systems, and 3) validity testing of the CCDE at an additional health system. Data capture criteria for defining the 21 CCDE included: obtained consistently under current practice; captured in a standard definition; entered in a structured field; encoded consistently; extractable from the EHR; and exported with metadata. Scores from the data element feasibility scorecard were 3 for Data Availability; 3 for Data Accuracy; 3 for Data Standards and 3 for Workflow, with 3 indicating the highest level of feasibility. This feasibility testing was Top of Document PAGE 106 \u00b7 Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program | Hybrid Hospital-Wide All-Cause Risk Standardized Readmission Measure conducted in hospitals with both Medicare FFS and MA patients. See attached Data Element Feasibility Scorecard for additional detail. Administrative claims data used in this measure are routinely captured as part of the billing process and there are no fees associated with collecting the data. Method of Measure Calculation Hybrid Hybrid measure: Methods of measure calculation Hybrid: Claims;Hybrid: eCQM Evidence of Performance Gap Studies have estimated the rate of preventable readmissions to be as low as 12% and as high as 76%. Given that studies have shown readmissions to be related to quality of care, and that interventions have been able to reduce 30-day readmission rates, it is reasonable to consider an all-condition readmission rate as a quality measure. Please see the supplemental file and evidence attachment for additional details.

Successful randomized trials have reduced 30-day readmission rates by 20-40%. Since 2008, 14 Medicare Quality Improvement Organizations have been funded to focus on care transitions, applying lessons learned from clinical trials. Several have been notably successful in reducing readmissions. The strongest evidence supporting the efficacy of improved discharge processes and enhanced care at transitions is a randomized controlled trial by the Project RED (Re-Engineered Discharge) intervention, in which a nurse was assigned to each patient as a discharge advocate, responsible for patient education, follow-up, medication reconciliation, and preparing individualized discharge instructions sent to the patients Top of Document PAGE 108 \u00b7 Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program Top of Document | Hybrid Hospital-Wide All-Cause Risk Standardized Readmission Measure primary care provider and there was a follow-up phone call from a pharmacist within four days of discharge, which demonstrated a 30% reduction in 30-day readmissions.

Rationale for not using risk adjustment N/A Cost estimate completed Yes Cost estimate methods and results We expect the burden associated with reporting of the Hybrid HWR measure to 10 minutes per measure, per quarter. Therefore, using the estimate of 10 minutes per measure per quarter (10 minutes, one measure, four quarters = 40 minutes), we estimate a burden increase of 40 minutes (0.67 hours) per hospital per year. We estimate that the impact of this proposed change is a total collection of information burden increase of 2,211 hours and a total cost increase of approximately $83,266 for all participating IPPS hospitals (3,300) annually. We do not anticipate any increases in hospital burden as a result of increasing the cohort size to include MA admissions Section 3: Patient and Provider Perspective Meaningful to Patients.

Median reliability for the total cohort was 0.700 for combined FFS and MA admissions, as compared to 0.602 for FFS only. We have not yet tested CCDE elements in the combined MA+FFS cohort, but we do expect the pattern of increased reliability for the combined FFS and MA cohort will be similar for the hybrid measure. The signal- to- noise analyses to compare the measure-score reliability of the HWR measure with combined FFS and MA patients indicates strong agreement. For the hospital event rate based on the patient binomial outcomes like readmission (Yes/No), a value of 0-0.2 indicates agreement; agreement; 0.7-0.8 indicates strong agreement; and >0.8 indicates almost perfect agreement. The value of 0.70 is strong (Landis & Koch, 1977). Random Split-Half Correlation: Name of statistic Random Split-Half Split-Half Sample size result results N/A Validity Yes Empiric Validity: Statistic name Pearson correlation coefficients, measuring the strength of relationship between two measure scores. Empiric Validity: Sample size 4767 Empiric Validity: Statistical result -0.656 Top of Document PAGE 112 \u00b7 Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program | Hybrid Hospital-Wide All-Cause Risk Standardized Readmission Measure Empiric Validity: Methods and findings We have not tested empirical validity in the combined Medicare FFS + MA population. However, correlation analysis was performed between the claims-only HWR measure and three external measures of hospital quality, assessed on a national public reporting sample of almost 7 million patients and 4,767 hospitals. The hybrid HWR measure uses the same concept, cohort, outcome, and claims-only risk adjustment variables as the claims-only measure. The only difference between the hybrid HWR and claims-only HWR measures is that CCDE data are added as risk adjustment variables in addition to the claims-only risk adjustment variables for the hybrid measure. There is no conceptual reason to believe that the results from the claims-only measure would be significantly dissimilar to results from the hybrid measure. Empiric validity testing was completed by examining the relationship of performance the claims-only HWR measure scores (RSRRs) with each of these external measures of hospital quality as measured by Pearson correlation coefficients: Hospital Star Rating readmission group score, Overall Hospital Star Rating summary score, and HCAHPS. There is no reason to expect that the addition of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries to the cohort would impact these validity results. As expected, the claims-only HWR measure score was moderately, negatively correlated with both the Star Rating Standardized Readmission Group Score (-0.656), and the Summary Score (-0.486), meaning that higher scores (better performance) on the comparator measures was associated with lower scores (better performance) on the HWR measure. This is expected because the star ratings quality measures focus on, or contain a portion of, the same domain of quality as the HWR measure (readmission). The HCAHPS measures related to transitions of care, communication about medications, doctor and nurse communication, and discharge instructions, were also correlated with HWR in the expected direction. For example, the HCAHPS discharge information linear mean score had a Pearson correlation coefficient of -0.305, indicating that better performance on the discharge measure was correlated with lower measure scores (better performance) on the HWR measure. Likewise, the HCAHPS score for No, staff did not give patients information about help after discharge was positively correlated with HWR, meaning that worse performance on the discharge measure was associated with worse performance on HWR or higher rates of readmission. The results showed the expected correlation between the claims-only HWR measure score and the three external measures of quality, which provides external support for measure score validity.

How will this measure add value to the CMS program? Death is a finite event, easy to measure accurately, and easily understood by patients and providers. For the majority of Medicare beneficiaries admitted to acute care hospitals in the US, the goal is to avoid short-term mortality. By measuring Hospital-Wide Mortality (HWM), CMS can ensure that efforts to reduce other outcomes, such as readmissions and resource utilization, are not resulting in unintended consequences. Specifically, this HWM measure will complement the existing CMS Hospital-Wide All- Cause Risk-Standardized Readmission Measure (NQF #1789) to allow assessment of trends in hospital performance for both outcomes, similar to other complementary pairs of readmission and mortality measures for specific conditions and procedures. Further, the HWM measure will provide CMS with annually updated performance estimates for a larger proportion of the nation's hospitals, allowing significant performance outliers to be identified. If this measure is being proposed to meet a statutory requirement, please list the corresponding statute N/A To p of Document PAGE 120 \u00b7 Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program | Hybrid Hospital-Wide All-Cause Risk Standardized Mortality Measure Section 2: Measure Evidence How is the measure expected to be reported to the program? eCQM;Claims Stratification No Feasibility of Data Elements Some data elements are in defined fields in electronic sources Feasibility Assessment This measure uses beneficiary enrollment data, claims data, and the EHR data. We tested the feasibility and validity of electronic extraction of these critical data elements as part of a more comprehensive evaluation of a larger set of core clinical data elements (CCDEs). The CCDE are a set of 21 EHR data elements that are captured on most adults admitted to acute care hospitals, are easily extracted from EHRs, and can be used to risk adjust hospital outcome measures for a variety of conditions and procedures. All of the critical data elements used in the measure are included in the CCDE. Testing of the CCDE involved three phases: 1) identification of potentially feasible clinical data through qualitative assessment, 2) empirical feasibility testing of several clinical data elements electronically extracted from two large multi-facility health systems, and 3) validity testing of the CCDE at an additional health system. Data capture criteria for defining the 21 CCDE included: obtained consistently under current practice; captured in a standard definition; entered in a structured field; encoded consistently; extractable from the EHR; and exported with metadata. Scores from the data element feasibility scorecard were 3 for Data Availability; 3 for Data Accuracy; 3 for Data Standards and 3 for Workflow, with 3 indicating the highest level of feasibility. This feasibility testing was conducted in hospitals with both Medicare FFS and MA patients. See attached Data Element Feasibility Scorecard for additional detail. Administrative claims data used in this measure are routinely captured as part of the billing process and there are no fees associated with collecting the data. Method of Measure Calculation Hybrid Hybrid measure: Methods of measure calculation Hybrid: Claims;Hybrid: eCQM Evidence of Performance Gap The variation in performance between the lowest-performing hospitals (RSMR of 3.95%) and the highest performing hospitals (RSMR of 8.7%) in the claims-only data, which we estimate will be similar to the Hybrid results on a national sample, shows there is a clear quality gap. In terms of performance compared to the median (6.93%), some hospitals can achieve substantially lower overall risk-standardized mortality rates than the average-performing hospital, while other hospitals are performing substantially worse than an average performer. Top of Document PAGE 121 \u00b7 Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program | Hybrid Hospital-Wide All-Cause Risk Standardized Mortality Measure Specifically, the best performing hospital (RSMR of 3.95%) is performing 43% better than an average performer (or has about 30 fewer deaths per 1000 patients compared to the average performer), while the worst performing hospital (8.70%) is performing 25% worse than an average performer (or has 18 more deaths per 1000 patients). Note that the average performer refers to hospital with the same case and service-line mix, performing at the average (median). Unintended Consequences We have not identified any unintended consequences during measure development, testing and use. We are committed to monitoring this measures use and assessing potential unintended consequences over time, such as the inappropriate shifting of care or coding/billing practices, increased patient morbidity and mortality, and other negative unintended consequences for patients.

N/A Number of systematic reviews that inform this measure concept N/A Briefly summarize the peer-reviewed systematic review(s) that inform this measure concept N/A Source of empirical data Published and publicly available reports (e.g., from agencies);Internal data analysis Summarize the empirical data Mortality is an unwanted outcome for the overwhelming majority of patients admitted to US hospitals. Measurement of patient outcomes allows for a broad view of quality of care that encompasses more than what can be captured by individual process- of-care measures. Complex and critical aspects of care, such as communication between providers, prevention of and response to, complications, patient safety, and coordinated transitions to the outpatient environment, all contribute to patient outcomes but are difficult to measure by individual process measures. The goal of outcomes measurement is to risk-adjust for patients conditions at the time of hospital admission and then evaluate patient outcomes. This mortality measure identifies institutions whose performance is better or worse than would be expected based on their patient case-mix, and therefore can both promote hospital quality improvement, and better inform consumers about care quality. According to internal analyses, from July 2016 to June 2017, there were about 10 million inpatient admissions among Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries between the age of 65 and 94, at 4,700 US hospitals. The observed 30-day mortality rate was 8.17%. This is especially relevant as, while the current condition- and procedure-specific mortality measures address the most common and morbid healthcare conditions as identified by MedPAC (1) in the most recent three-year public reporting period, together they captured only 4.8 million Medicare FFS beneficiary admissions; a HWM measure is likely to capture about 6.5 million admissions across 4,700 hospitals. Using acute myocardial infarction as an example, which has seen the greatest declines in mortality, the median hospital risk-standardized mortality rate (RSMR) following admission for acute myocardial infarction has declined from 16.4% in 2006 to 13.1% in 2016 (July 2015- July 2016 data). (2,3) If development and reporting of this HWM measures produces even a tenth as much impact, this would translate into nearly 14,000 deaths averted in a one-year period. Furthermore, if all hospitals performed as well as hospitals in the 10th percentile for RSMR, about 100,000 deaths Top of Document PAGE 123 \u00b7 Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program | Hybrid Hospital-Wide All-Cause Risk Standardized Mortality Measure would be averted, compared to if all hospitals were performing at the median. For some conditions and diagnoses, evidence supports that optimal medical care reduces mortality. (4,5) We know from ongoing improvements in condition- and procedure-specific mortality rates that interventions to improve these outcomes are feasible. (2) Multiple organizations, including the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), promote a range of evidence-based strategies to reduce hospital mortality. (6) These strategies include: 1. Adoption of strategies shown to reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia (7-9) 2. Delivery of reliable, evidence-based care for acute myocardial infarction (10,11) 3. Prevention of adverse drug events though medication reconciliation (12) 4. Prevention of central line infections through evidence- based guideline-concordant care (13) 5. Prevention of surgical site infections through evidence-based guideline-concordant care (14,15) To reduce mortality, the IHI further encourages hospitals to use multidisciplinary rounds to improve communication, employ Rapid Response Teams to attend to patients at the first sign of clinical decline, identify high-risk patients on admission and increase nursing care and physician contact accordingly, standardize patient handoffs to avoid miscommunication or gaps in care, and establish partnerships with community providers to promote evidenced-based practices to reduce hospitalizations before patients become critically ill. (16) The IHIs 100,000 Lives Campaign, which was created to enlist hospitals in a coordinated effort to adopt the above interventions, led to an estimated more than 120,000 lives saved over the first 18 months of the campaign.

The range of c-statistic results is 0.8228 to 0.9587 across 15 divisions which is consistent with or better than results we have seen for other 30-day mortality measures. Rationale for not using risk adjustment N/A Cost estimate completed Yes Cost estimate methods and results We expect the burden associated with reporting of the Hybrid HWM measure to be similar to our estimates for reporting the Hybrid HWR measure, that is, 10 minutes per measure, per quarter. Therefore, using the estimate of 10 minutes per measure per quarter . Therefore, using the estimate of 10 minutes per measure per quarter (10 minutes one measure four quarters = 40 minutes), we estimate a burden increase of 40 minutes (0.67hours) per hospital per year. Beginning with the 2022 through 2023 reporting period, we estimate an annual burden increase of 2,200 hours across participating IPPS hospitals (0.67 hours 3,300 IPPS hospitals). We estimate this to represent a cost increase of $90,200 Top of Document PAGE 126 \u00b7 Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program | Hybrid Hospital-Wide All-Cause Risk Standardized Mortality Measure across IPPS hospitals ($41 2,200 hours).

To calculate the ICC, we used 84,825 admissions across 21 hospitals, using 15 months of data. The agreement between the two independent assessments of the RSMR for each hospital was 0.6826, and the adjusted ICC (which estimates the ICC if we had been able to use one full year of data in each split sample) [3,4], is 0.7748. This adjusted ICC is considered substantial reliability, according to conventional standards [1]. To note, the datasets used for Top of Document PAGE 128 \u00b7 Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program | Hybrid Hospital-Wide All-Cause Risk Standardized Mortality Measure development and testing of the original Hybrid HWM measure and for these analyses were from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) health system. The dataset includes matched administrative claims and electronic health record (EHR) data for index acute care admission. The KPNC dataset includes both Medicare Advantage and Medicare FFS patients. 1. Landis J, Koch G. The measurement of observer agreement for categorical data, Biometrics 1977;33:159-174. 2.

Empiric Validity: Sample size 4581 Empiric Validity: Statistical result 00000 Empiric Validity: Methods and findings The external empiric validity was not directly tested in the Hybrid HWM measure due to lack of availability of EHR data from a nationally representative set of hospitals. Instead, we report results of testing done in the claims-only HWM measure. Because of the homology between the two measures, there is no reason to suspect that the results of analyses done for the claims-only measure would differ in any significant way from results of analyses for a nationally representative hybrid measure. Based on our discussions with our Technical Workgroup and with other experts, we concluded that there is no single analysis that is sufficient to validate the measure because there is no gold standard exists for the validation of a hospital-wide quality measure. With this limitation in mind, we used the three empiric external analyses to demonstrate a trend of validity using different metrics: 1. Nurse to bed ratio. 2. Hospital Star Rating mortality group score. 3. Overall Hospital Star Rating. Our approach was to select three separate assessments against which we could compare the measure score with the hypothesis Top of Document PAGE 129 \u00b7 Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program | Hybrid Hospital-Wide All-Cause Risk Standardized Mortality Measure that a trend toward correlation with these external assessments would support a conclusion of high measure score validity. For each external measure of quality, the comparison showed a trend toward better performance on the HWM measure with better performance on the comparator measure, as expected. For example, when comparing the claims-only HWM measure to the nurse to bed ratio, as the number of nurses per bed increases (more nurses in the hospital) across quartiles of nur se-to-bed ratio, the median overall HWM mortality rate is lower (better). Likewise, better performance on the HWM measure is associated with better Star Rating mortality group scores across quartiles of mortality group score performance. Finally, HWM performance improves across the Star Rating category in the expected direction: HWM scores are better (lower) as the Star Rating category improves (increases from 1, to 5 Stars).

This score will summarize existing results of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Disparity Methods (stratified measure results) across a range of measures and social and demographic risk factors, to provide more accessible information about variations in healthcare disparity across hospitals. Numerator The HDI is a composite score and does not have a typical numerator. We are using this field to describe those hospitals that will obtain a score. The HDI includes hospitals that have patient populations which allow for calculation of both Within and Across Disparity Method for dual enrollment in Medicare and Medicaid (DE) and Within and Across Disparity Method results for at least one race and ethnicity group (Black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander patients). This is operationalized as including at least one patient with the risk factor and one without. Numerator Exclusions Hospitals without at least one patient with the risk factor and one patient without the risk factor will not be eligible for disparity evaluation because we cannot examine disparities. Denominator The HDI does not have a traditional numerator and denominator. We use this field to define currently included measures for which Within and Across Disparity Method results are calculated and combined for an overall HDI score. Currently CMS reports Within and Across Disparity Methods for dual enrollment in Medicare and Medicaid (DE) for seven measures. All are readmission measures, including six condition specific measures and one hospital wide readmission measure: Hospital 30- Day, All-Cause, Risk-Standardized Readmission Document PAGE 133 \u00b7 Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program | Hospital Disparity Index (HDI) Hospital 30-Day, All-Cause, Risk-Standardization Readmission Rate Rate (RSRR) Following Elective Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) and/or Total Knee Arthroplasty CMIT ID# 2710.

Stratification No Feasibility of Data Elements ALL data elements are in defined fields in electronic sources Feasibility Assessment As described above, the HDI is a prototype method for a single score that summarizes several measurements of disparity in care at a hospital that will already be reported. Select measures will be reported stratified by dual enrollment status confidentially beginning in Fall 2022. Codes included in measure stratification, as well as in individual measures in the HDI methodology, are the same as they appear in the original measure, and which have been reviewed by the MUC and recommended by the MAP previously. The variables identified for stratification as part of the HDI method are available through claims and public sources. Dual enrollment status is available through claims data, race and ethnicity is imputed via the Medicare Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (MBISG) method which relies on claims data, and data from the US Census, and ASI score is calculated using American Community Survey data linked to patient zip code. Method of Measure Calculation Claims Hybrid measure: Methods of measure calculation N/A Evidence of Performance Gap The goal of all facilities is to minimize disparities in health care. With strong variation between the best and worst performing hospitals, there is evidence many facilities can improve how equitable their care is across patients of differences races, SES, and dual enrollment status. Unintended Consequences Composite measures, like the HDI, are beneficial in that they summarize detailed information to give a high-level picture of multiple and intersecting variables at play; however, they can be confusing for facilities to interpret in the absence of more explanation. CMS will take this into account in providing feedback reports to hospitals and aims to be responsive to any other issues that arise in use of such a measure.

Unintended Consequences Potential known unintended consequences in the geriatric population would be due to efforts around function/mobility. An anticipated increase in falls might occur as patients are encouraged to ambulate and/or management plans focus on efforts to mitigate deconditioning. If/when patients fall, ambulation efforts might be halted, which can then have the unintended consequences of deconditioning, restraint use, and/or pressure ulcers.

JAHF grant awarded to ACS to develop the Geriatric Surgery Verification and Quality Improvement Program (now known as the Geriatric Surgery Verification (GSV) Program). CQGS Core Development Team (CDT), Advisory Panel and multidisciplinary stakeholder groups convened to set the standards for geriatric surgical care. To achieve this objective and set the program standards, key benchmarks were established/achieved: 1.1.) Gather Literature and Develop Preliminary Standards: The CQGS CDT completed a comprehensive literature review in February 2016 and released the preliminary standards to stakeholders in April 2016. 1.2.) Conduct Preliminary Field Visits: Between December 2015 and April 2016, the CDT conducted 11 field visits in 7 cities across the country to measure the current state of surgery in older adults, evaluate scalability of the program, identify best practices already in place serving older adult surgery patients and gain perspectives/opinions from frontline staff. CDT reported on the field visit findings to CQGS stakeholders in May 2016. 1.3.) Refine and Vet Standards w/ Stakeholders: 1.3.1.) CQGS Preliminary Standards written in 2016 by the CDT, and based on ratings analysis, standards were repackaged from 308 standards into 92 Alpha Standards in 2017 [using a modified version of the RAND-UCLA Appropriateness Methodology, 44 of the 58 CQGS stakeholders performed two ratings on the validity and feasibility of the standards. Based on the ratings analysis, became 92 Alpha Standards and implemented into Alpha Pilot]. 1.3.2.) The CQGS invited 15 hospitals to participate in a survey to determine which of the standards were already implemented, understand how easy or difficult the standards would be to implement if not already in practice, and identify and record standards that were confusing or difficult to interpret. 1.3.3.) From the results of Alpha Pilot, the 92 Alpha Standards were further condensed to 30 Beta Standards, categorized into 6 chapters: Program management, Goals and Decision-Making, Preoperative Optimization, Immediate Preoperative and Intraoperative Clinical Care, Postoperative Clinical Care, and Transitions of Care. The Beta Standards were released in November 2017. 1.3.4.) 8 hospitals participated in the Beta Pilot in December 2017 to determine the feasibility of implementation for each beta standard, collect \"best practices\" for standards implementation, learn barriers to implementation in hospitals of varying size, facility-type, and location, identify issues in the wording of the standards leading to misinterpretation, continue to record rationale for or against the standards, and resolve difficulties in the verification process. Beginning in June of 2018, site visits to each pilot hospital were performed and report was released end of 2018 2.) Using the data from the Beta Pilot, the CQGS team finalized the standards and developed educational and supportive materials to aid in the official GSV Program launch in July 2019 with release of Optimal Resources for Geriatric Surgery 2019 Standards. Top of Document PAGE 158 \u00b7 Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program | Geriatrics Hospital Measure 3.) GSV Program began accepting applications for enrollment in October 2019. To date: 53 hospitals enrolled in the program in various stages of implementation. 3 hospitals have completed verification process. 4.) In 2021, ACS conveyed a team of experts in geriatric surgical care to evaluate the GSV standards to determine feasibility as a measure that collectively improves care for older adults. 5.) In January 2022, 9 unique hospitals committed to providing optimal geriatric surgical care (as demonstrated through their established centers for geriatrics, participation in age-friendly health initiatives, or enrollment in the GSV Program, or any combination of these elements), were surveyed to evaluate implementation of key measures that collectively improve care for older adults. The key measure domains were determined through the combination of both the established ACS quality framework, and the processes, resources, and infrastructures necessary for the optimal care of the older adult surgical patient as determined by JAHF grant work.

The US population is rapidly aging and across the country, hospitals are increasingly faced with older patients who have complex medical, physiological, and psychosocial needs that are often inadequately addressed by the current healthcare infrastructure. Although existing quality metrics have improved both the rate and reporting of clinical outcomes (falls, appropriate use of anticoagulants, etc.) that are important to older individuals, these measures can be narrow in scope and may have limited long term effectiveness due to ceiling effects. Rather than simply addressing individual clinical issues in isolation, optimizing care for older patients with multifaceted vulnerability profiles will require a holistic approach with the goal of reframing the entire care pathway to better serve the needs of this unique population. Despite this growing need, our healthcare system has not comprehensively rethought care for the complex geriatric population since the creation of Medicare more than 50 years ago. To this end, multiple organizations including the American College of Surgeons (ACS), the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI), and the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) have identified clinical frameworks based on evidence-based best practices that provide goal-centered, clinically effective care for older patients. Part of what is needed in rethinking care for the older adult population is programmatic facility-level geriatric measurement. This solution is different from the current types of CMS measures, this programmatic measure incentivizes team-based care organized around the geriatric patient to meet the challenges unique to their needs. The measure differs from the classical NQF structural measures or process measures that are usually singular structural components or a simple process tied to a transaction/visit. The challenge is care is not a single structural element or process. It is the collection of all these components orchestrated across the continuum of care for the entire team in a patient centered manner. Together, these become a patient-centered programs of care. When the components are properly tied together, care becomes well-coordinated, complex aspects of care are more reliably delivered, harms are minimized, and outcomes are optimized. The elements in the program are focused around care delivery, coordination, data, and data-driven improvement activities. When CMS and NQF consider traditional structural and process measures, we agree that singular elements within one or another transaction as part of a series of transactions in health are check-the- box measures. These have limited impact on quality or improvement. However, within clinical domains Top of Document PAGE 161 \u00b7 Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program | Geriatrics Hospital Measure of care such as geriatric care, there are crucial structures and processes of care that reach across multiple transactions and link the care team's efforts together. Orchestrating all these elements result in better outcomes and improving their implementation would be an essential first step to improve geriatric outcomes. CMS quality programs currently consist of a large, extremely costly universe of measures in multiple different payment programs. They often lack the consideration for focusing a care team in a patient- centered way. Such sporadic measurement creates a massive amount of burden and overhead but has a limited impact on improving the quality of overall care and fails to create accountability to patients for the care they receive. The development of individual measures and the subsequent combination of these measures into payment incentive programs may be useful for fee-for-service payment. Value- based payments need a more condition, patient-type approach. This proposed approach is programmatic within a clinical domain. Its implementation will create a team-based approach to optimizing the patient's chances to achieve their desired outcome. Disjointedly measuring members of a care team with disparate measure sets does not create the alignment needed. Another benefit of this programmatic approach is the usefulness of this information for patients deciding where to seek care. Twenty years of NQF and payer actions in quality have not produced reliable public knowledge or a public-facing website that informs patients about where to get the care they need for the condition they have. This information, along with comparable information on the price of that care, are the prerequisites for a valid depiction of the value of care. An important standard to apply in evaluating payment quality incentives is their effectiveness in providing patients with knowledge of where to find high quality care in their community. In assessing the effectiveness of our measures, we wonder if the patient had this information, would it enable them to easily find information on a website for the types of care they seek, for a safety and equitability profile and for personal goal attainment. Our measures do not meet all these objectives since these are the initial steps. They are also designed to be added to appropriate condition or procedure specific cost measures which would help patients determine the affordability of the care they desire. Combing quality and price for care is a key step in establishing value.

It is expressed as a percentage of eligible CT exams that are out- of-range based on having either excessive radiation dose or inadequate image quality, relative to evidence-based thresholds based on the clinical indication for the exam. All diagnostic CT exams of specified anatomic sites performed in hospital outpatient care settings (including emergency settings) are eligible. Numerator Diagnostic CT exams that have a size-adjusted radiation dose value greater than the threshold specific to the CT category (reflecting the body region imaged and the radiation dose and image quality required for that exam given the reason for the exam), or a noise value greater than a threshold specific to the CT Category. Numerator Exclusions None Denominator All diagnostic CT exams performed on adults (aged 18 years and older) during the measurement period of one year that have an assigned CT category, a size-adjusted radiation dose value, and a global noise value. Denominator Exclusions Denominator exclusions are CT exams that simultaneously include multiple body regions outside of four commonly encountered multiple region groupings (specified as LOINC code 96914-7, CT Dose and Image Quality Category, Full Body). Denominator exclusions are also CT exams with missing patient age, missing size- adjusted radiation dose, or missing noise. These are technical exclusions (\"missing data\") from the initial population. Technical exclusions will be flagged, corrected whenever possible, and tracked at the level of the accountable entity.

Not a composite or component of a composite measure If Other, Please Specify N/A What data sources are used for the measure? Electronic Clinical Data (non-EHR);Electronic Health Record If applicable, specify the data source N/A Description of parts related to these sources (1) The measure derives standardized data elements from structured fields within the EHR and the radiology electronic clinical data systems, including the Radiology Information System (RIS) and the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). These are labeled A and B below. (2) Primary imaging data stored in structured fields in the radiology electronic clinical data systems have been historically inaccessible using the existing eCQM framework. (3) Thus, the eCQM cannot consume CT images and Radiation Dose Structured Reports (RDSR, which contain the radiation dose) in their original DICOM formats. These primary data, listed below, must be transformed into calculated data elements that can then be ingested by the eCQM. (4) This is described in the feasibility attachment. The measure developers have created software (available for free to reporting entities) to transform primary data elements from these electronic systems to generate variables that the eCQM uses to calculate the measure score. These electronic systems include (A) EHR: The measure characterizes CT exams based on the type of exam performed (derived from procedure (CPT) codes associated with the exam bill), and the reason for study (derived from diagnosis (ICD- 10-CM) codes associated with the exam order and bill). (Data element Diagnostic study, performed: CT Studies) During transformation, a validated algorithm uses combinations of CPT and ICD- 10-CM codes to generate the CT Dose and Image Quality Category (CT category, LOINC code 96914-7) that specifies the radiation dose and image quality thresholds for each CT exam. The measure also derives birth date to calculate age at the start of the measurement period, and supplemental data elements including payer, race, ethnicity, and sex. (B) RADIOLOGY ELECTRONIC CLINICAL DATA SYSTEMS (NON-EHR): The PACS stores CT exam data generated by CT machines during the ordinary course of care, including image pixel data (data element Diagnostic Study Performed: CT Studies Result attribute: Image Pixel Data) and Radiation Dose Structured Reports Top of Document PAGE 165 \u00b7 Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting Program | Excessive Radiation Dose or Inadequate Image Quality for Diagnostic Computed Tomography (CT) in Adults (Hospital Level - Outpatient) (RDSR) (data element Diagnostic Study Performed: CT Studies Result attribute: Radiation Dose Structured Report (RDSR)) Both of these data are formatted and stored as DICOM structured data. These primary data elements are used for calculating inputs to the eCQM, including the Calculated CT Size- Adjusted Dose (size-adjusted dose, LOINC code 96913-9) and Calculated CT Global Noise (noise, LOINC code (96912-1), respectively.

There are no measures addressing CT or radiation doses in the hospital inpatient reporting program. Three existing MIPS measures are related (not competing) in that they address patient safety related to radiation exposure Top of Document PAGE 167 \u00b7 Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting Program | Excessive Radiation Dose or Inadequate Image Quality for Diagnostic Computed Tomography (CT) in Adults (Hospital Level - Outpatient) in CT imaging: (1) Optimizing Patient Exposure to Ionizing Radiation: Count of Potential High Dose Radiation Imaging Studies: Computed Tomography (CT) and Cardiac Nuclear Medicine Studies (CMIT 2286); (2) Radiation Consideration for Adult CT: Utilization of Dose Lowering Techniques (CMIT 2570); and (3) Multi-strata weighted average for 3 CT Exam Types: Overall Percent of CT exams for which Dose Length Product is at or below the size-specific diagnostic reference level (for CT Abdomen-pelvis with contrast/single phase scan, CT Chest without contrast/single scan and CT Head/Brain without contrast/single phase scan) (ACRAD34). How will this measure be distinguished from other similar and/or competing measures? See related measures attachment. How will this measure add value to the CMS program? (1) IT WOULD BE THE ONLY RADIOLOGY ECQM IN THE CMS MEASURES INVENTO RY, aligning with CMS's goal of transitioning to all digital quality measures by 2025. Our measure is designed using both QDM and FHIR specifications, supporting CMS's stated intention of encouraging healthcare information interoperability based on standard APIs, specifically FHIR. (2) IT IS THE FIRST AND ONLY MEASURE TO ASSESS IMAGE QUALITY as a means of protecting the diagnostic value of CT imaging from unintended consequences of excessive radiation dose reduction. (3) IT ASSESSES RADIATION DOSE AND IMAGE QUALITY BASED ON THE UNDERLYING CLINICAL INDICATION - in other words, the reason the patient was imaged - and not based simply on the exam that was performed, which often results in doses higher than needed for diagnosis. The measure covers the two key process of care components that determine the radiation doses, including: (a) the choice of imaging protocol (i.e. the type of CT exam - for example, whether a patient is imaged with a single- or double-phase CT exam); and (b) decisions regarding the technical settings used for that type of CT exam, which are usually at the discretion of the technologist or medical physicist who oversees and operates the machines. Both components contribute to radiation dose, and as a result, a comprehensive quality measure must encompass both of these decision-making processes. This measure is uniquely able to encompass both components. (4) THE DENOMINATOR INCLUDES MOST DIAGNOSTIC CT EXAMS in adults, including multiphase high dose examination types. And (5) THE MEASURE ADJUSTS FOR PATIENT SIZE, an important contributor to dose.

All data elements were found to be available and accessible, accurate, and structured in standardized vocabularies. Generating and collecting the data elements had no impact on clinician workflow. Please see feasibility attachment for more details on how feasibility was evaluated, as well as how the measure will be operationalized. Method of Measure Calculation eCQM Hybrid measure: Methods of measure calculation N/A Evidence of Performance Gap The measure was developed to address a considerable performance gap in the use of excessive and highly variable radiation dose in CT imaging. Doses used for CT vary substantially across imaging facilities for patients imaged for the same clinical indication. For example, (1) In a prior study of 151 imaging facilities and hospitals, even after adjusting for patient characteristics, abdominal CT exams had a four- fold range in mean effective radiation dose and a 17-fold range in the proportion of high dose exams (Smith-Bindman 2019). (2) EVIDENCE IN THE UCSF REGISTRY: When we applied the proposed measure to the UCSF International CT Dose Registry - a repository of CT data containing over 8 million exams from 161 hospitals and imaging facilities - overall 33% of CT exams were out- of-range based on radiation dose criteria. Overall, 135 facilities (84%) had out- of-range scores over 10%. (3) EVIDENCE IN THE FIELD-TESTING DATA: In the field-testing performed across 16 outpatient hospital sites (including emergency settings), the rates of out- of-range exams varied 20%-45% by site. Virtually all of this was driven by excessive radiation doses, as extremely few CT exams were assessed as out- of-range based on noise: on average <1% across all reporting entities. (4) SUMMARY: This variation in radiation dose underscores the performance gap that the measure addresses, and these outcomes indicate a considerable opportunity to reduce doses without impacting quality. Unintended Consequences There is a relationship between image quality and radiation dose such that, as radiation dos e increases, image quality increases until a threshold is reached, at which point no further diagnostic benefit from image quality occurs. Conversely, too little radiation dose can produce inadequate image quality. Thus, image quality must remain diagnostically sufficient as excessive doses are lowered. The actual risk for this is low, as research suggests doses may be lowered between 50-90% without impacting image diagnostic utility (den Harder 2018, Rob 2017, Konda 2016, Huppertz 2015). In our field-testing data, out-of-range measure scores due to inadequate image quality (i.e. excessive noise) were exceedingly rare, with less than 1% of exams, on average, across all reporting entities. This was to some degree expected, given the results of an Image Quality Study - performed as part of measure development - in which radiologists graded 3% and 8% of exams as \"poor\" or \"marginally acceptable\" image quality, respectively (manuscript in preparation). These findings support a considerable opportunity to reduce radiation doses without impacting quality. Given the evidence of harm from excessive radiation, and the Top of Document PAGE 169 \u00b7 Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting Program | Excessive Radiation Dose or Inadequate Image Quality for Diagnostic Computed Tomography (CT) in Adults (Hospital Level - Outpatient) low likelihood of deteriorating image quality to the point of rendering exams unacceptable, there is little question that the benefit outweighs the cost of dose optimization. Nevertheless, the measure steward will monitor out- of-range rates annually to determine if image quality is worsening due to declining radiation doses and determine if thresholds should be adjusted or if a subsequent radiologist satisfaction study should be repeated. Number of clinical guidelines, including USPSTF guidelines, that address this measure topic 7 Outline the clinical guidelines supporting this measure The proposed measure aligns with numerous consensus-based clinical recommendations and guidelines asking radiologists to track, optimize, and lower the radiation doses they use for CT. These guidelines are based on evidence that radiation doses are highly variable across institutions, higher than needed for diagnosis, and can lead to excessive patient harm. These recommendations and guidelines have been written by: the American College of Radiology (Kanal 2017); a collaboration of the American College of Radiology, The American Association of Physicists in Medicine, and the Society for Pediatric Radiology (ACR-AAPM-SPR 2018); the Radiological Society of North America (Hricak 2010); the Society of Interventional Radiology (Stecker 2009); the Society of Cardiovascular CT (Halliburton 2011); Image Gently, an initiative of the American College of Radiology, the Radiological Society of North America, American Society of Radiologic Technologists, and American Association of Physicists in Medicine (Goske 2008); and the FDA (US Food and Drug Administration 2019). The most common approach advised is for physicians to collect and compare their doses to benchmarks and to reduce their doses if they are found to routinely exceed these benchmarks.

Number of systematic reviews that inform this measure concept 3 Briefly summarize the peer-reviewed systematic review(s) that inform this measure concept Please see systematic reviews evidence attachment. Source of empirical data Published, peer-reviewed original research Top of Document PAGE 171 \u00b7 Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting Program | Excessive Radiation Dose or Inadequate Image Quality for Diagnostic Computed Tomography (CT) in Adults (Hospital Level - Outpatient) Summarize the empirical data (1) THERE IS EVIDENCE OF A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROCESS INTERVENTIONS (SPECIFICALLY, EDUCATIONAL FEEDBACK SIMILAR TO THAT PROVIDED BY THIS MEASURE) AND THE INTERMEDIATE OUTCOME OF THIS MEASURE, RADIATION DOSE. In a randomized controlled trial involving roughly 1 million CT exams from 100 imaging facilities across 6 countries, Smith-Bindman et al. observed that multicomponent educational feedback achieved a 23-58% reductions in the proportion of high-dose exams, based on organ dose, with no observed change in image quality. (Smith-Bindman 2020) Another interventional study across the University of California system deployed radiation dose audits and best practice sharing, resulting in considerable dose reductions: a 19% and 25% decrease in mean effective dose for chest and abdomen exams, respectively, and a reduction in the number of exams exceeding allowable benchmarks by 48% and 54% for chest and abdomen, respectively. (Demb 2017). (2) THERE IS EXTENSIVE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL AND BIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE THAT SUGGESTS EXPOSURE TO RADIATION IN THE SAME RANGE AS THAT ROUTINELY DELIVERED BY CT (10-100 MILLI-SIEVERTS, MSV) INCREASES A PERSON'S RISK OF DEVELOPING CANCER (Board of Radiation Effects 2006, Pearce 2012, Pierce 2000, Preston 2007, Brenner 2003, Hong 2019). In a case-control study of over 3 million adult patients imaged between 2000-2013 in Taiwan, Shao et al. found that exposure to CT imaging was associated with elevated risk of thyroid cancer (OR = 2.55, 95% CI = 2.36 to 2.75) and leukemia (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.42 to 1.68) for all patients, with higher risk in women, and for non-Hodgkin lymphoma in patients aged 45 or younger. (Shao 2019) A clear dose-response relationship was observed in patients 45?years or younger for all three cancers. (3) DESPITE THE KNOWN RISKS OF CT, ITS USE HAS GROWN SUBSTANTIALLY over the last few decades (Harvey L Neiman 2017), with 91.4 million CT exams performed in the United States in 2019 (IMV 2020), including 428 exams per 1000 patients aged 65 years and older (Smith-Bindman 2019). It was estimated in 2009 that 2% of cancers diagnosed annually are the result of CT; in 2019 that would amount to 36,000 cancers diagnosed each year due to the use of CT.

The adequacy of the resulting size-adjusted dose- length product was assessed using the same model, but with the outcome of (raw) dose-length product replaced with the size-adjusted dose-length product. Prior to size adjustment, the marginal R-squared relating patient diameter to dose was 0.08 for the average CT category, increasing to as high as 0.29 for the CT category (Low Dose Abdomen) with the strongest relationship between patient diameter and dose-length product. After size adjustment, the marginal R-squared relating patient diameter to dose is uniformly <0.01 for all CT categories. This suggests that the adjustment mechanism has adequately removed bias from patient diameter, a potential confounder of the relationship between dose-length product and quality of care. Please see the risk adjustment methodology attachment for further details. Rationale for not using risk adjustment N/A Cost estimate completed Yes Cost estimate methods and results COST IMPACT: The measure is expected to result in cost savings to Medicare of $1,859,606,000 to $5,206,896,800 annually, based on an estimate of $133,000 - $372,400 per cancer avoided. Implementation costs to reporting entities are expected to be $3250 per hospital annually. ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND COST SAVINGS ESTIMATE: Based on the current estimated number of CT exams Top of Document PAGE 173 \u00b7 Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting Program | Excessive Radiation Dose or Inadequate Image Quality for Diagnostic Computed Tomography (CT) in Adults (Hospital Level - Outpatient) performed annually in the U.S. [IMV 2020], distribution in exam types and observed doses [Demb 2017, Smith-Bindman 2019], and modelling of the with CT [Berrington de Gonzalez 2009], 18,643 cancers could be prevented annually by reducing doses to the median measure score from our testing data. The majority of these cancers will be prevented among elderly adults because imaging rates are nearly five times higher in that population [Smith-Bindman 2019], and because absolute and excess cancer rates are higher among older adults compared with non-elderly adults or children [Berrington de Gonzalez 2009, Shuryak 2010]. We estimate that 75% of all cancers prevented annually (13,982) will occur among Medicare beneficiaries who undergo CT, and that approximately 3 cancers would be prevented per 10,000 Medicare patients who undergo CT (or 1 cancer per 3,254 patients). The cost avoided by the measure reflects the cost of cancer cases prevented. The cost of care for breast, colorectal, and lung cancer during the 4 years after diagnosis in 2011 was estimated at $100,000-$280,000 per case [Dieguez 2017]. This estimate was based on actual costs incurred between 2011 -2014 and was not adjusted for inflation, though cancer care costs were projected to rise 27-39% between 2011 and 2020 (Mariotto 2011). Using a mean inflation rate of 33% between 2011 and 2020, this reflects a 4-year cost per cancer ranging from $133,000 to $372,400 per case avoided. Using this average cost of cancer care ($133,000-$372,400) and the number of cancers prevented annually among Medicare beneficiaries (13,982). This results in $1.86 billion to $5.21 billion annual cost savings. Furthermore, cancer patients who survive beyond the first 4 years may continue to incur high costs, especially in the last year of life. Thus, these estimates could be lower than actual savings. ASSUMPTIONS BEHIND IMPLEMENTATION/REPORTING COST ESTIMATE: We estimate the implementation costs at $3250 per hospital based on the time and costs reported by our field-testing sites (see feasibility attachment for more information). This estimate is likely conservative, as our testing partners noted that the work of assembling the relevant data decreased over time. For hospitals that are part of large health systems, the cost may be incurred at the health system level rather than at the level of the individual hospital.

We used randomly split samples for each accountable entity with 1,000 repetitions, applying a one-way random effects model, assuming that both entity effects and residual effects are random, independent, and normally distributed with mean 0. This approach corresponds to Case 1 or the ICC(1) in McGraw and Wong's seminal description of ICC reliability methods. (McGraw 1996) The Spearman-Brown prophecy formula was applied, in the usual manner, to adjust reliability from one-month test samples to the anticipated 12-month sample (i.e., (12*r)/(1 + (11*r)). (Frey 2018) These ICC(1) estimates (bounded between 0 and 1) were then logit-transformed and used to model the linear relationship between entity volume and logit reliability. By ranking predicted reliabilities across the complete range of potential volumes, we estimated the volume threshold that would correspond to ICC(1)=0.9 for an accountable entity. Random Split-Half Correlation: Sample size 16 Random Split-Half Correlation: Statistical result 0.99 Random Split-Half Correlation: Interpretation of results According to the scale developed by Koo and Li, an ICC estimate greater than 0.90 may be interpreted as excellent reliability. (Koo 2016) Based on the mean ICC of 0.99, after Spearman-Brown adjustment to a 12-month reporting period, the measure is reliable at the hospital level. Given the high volume of CT, virtually no hospitals would fall below the minimum denominator to achieve ICC >0.90.

Our measure fills this quality gap and is aligned with clinical recommendations, grounded in extensive epidemiologic evidence, and tested in diverse settings. The measure also supports CMS in moving from process or QCDR measures to intermediate outcome measures that focus on radiation-related risk reduction for exposed patients and populations. This measure is also the first radiology digital quality measure. Using electronic and standardized data already collected as part of routine clinical care, our measure assesses the radiation dose for every exam, taking into consideration the reason for the exam and patient size, and is coupled with an assessment of imaging quality to ensure that efforts to reduce radiation dose do not result in poor image quality. The measure will improve patient safety, reduce population-level cancer risks, and reduce associated cancer-related morbidity, mortality, and cost. 100% of the diverse technical expert panel (TEP) members assembled for this measure's development agreed that performance on the measure as specified is a representation of quality, differentiating good from poor performance. 100% of TEP members agreed that the measure, if implemented, is likely or very likely to improve quality. The measure is also undergoing endorsement review by the National Quality Forum in the Fall 2021 cycle. The reliability and validity of the measure were considered acceptable for endorsement by the NQF Scientific Methods Panel in October 2021. Subsequently, the Patient Safety Standing Committee evaluated the measure in February 2022 and recommended NQF endorsement. In the related public commenting period, over 20 messages of support were submitted from various notable stakeholders and testing site partners. A final endorsement will be issued in July 2022.

The increase in the volume of outpatient services is in part due to the continued shift of complex surgical procedures from the inpatient setting to the outpatient setting. Examples of these procedures include: knee replacement; endovascular procedures; and removal, replacement, or insertion of defibrillator systems or pulse generators.

N/A Number of systematic reviews that inform this measure concept 000000 Briefly summarize the peer-reviewed systematic review(s) that inform this measure concept As noted above, more complex procedures have been moving from the inpatient setting to the outpatient setting [1]. This underscores the need to address the potential for poorer outcome for beneficiaries who are treated at low volume providers, for procedures that have a volume-outcome relationship. In addition, better understanding the volume of procedures from an all-payer perspective will allow CMS to target and prioritize future quality measure development. There are scores of systematic reviews that examine the volume outcome relationship for surgery. Most of the reviews that have been published support a volume-outcome relationship, but the relationship is weak for some procedures, and stronger for others. In addition, most studies have addressed procedures that are performed in the inpatient setting (although in some cases, like for knee replacement surgery those procedures are migrating to the outpatient space); studies differ in if they examined surgeon volume vs. hospital volume. A recent scoping review of the volume/outcome relationship examined 403 studies that addressed 90 types of surgery. Study authors found that most (about 87%) of the studies had a significant volume-outcome relationship; there were 61 different types of outcomes that were examined in these studies. About half of the studies addressed cancer-related surgery [2]. Below we summarize the one systematic review that has addressed outpatient surgery. One systematic review published in 2020 [3] examined outpatient surgery using international data, analyzed data from eight retrospective studies that addressed seven procedures: anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction, cataract surgery, meniscectomy, thyroidectomy, primary hip arthroscopy, open carpal tunnel release, and rotator cuff repair. Study authors found a volume outcome relationship for all but carpal tunnel release and thyroidectomy, however the results did not allow the study authors to recommend clear volume thresholds for these procedures.

Method of Measure Calculation Manual abstraction Hybrid measure: Methods of measure calculation N/A Evidence of Performance Gap See section 2b4. \"Identification of Statistically Significant & Meaningful Differences in Performance\", starting on page 23 of the attached NQF Testing Attachment for full details. First, we calculated the mean; standard deviation; median; and 5th, 10th, 25th, 75th, 90th, and 95th percentile of the performance scores for each quarter. Next, we grouped hospitals by deciles and assessed whether the difference in mean measure score between each adjacent decile was statistically significant. Our goal was to determine whether there are significant differences in performance across hospitals. Finally, we compared whether there is a statistically significant difference in mean measure score by age, gender, race, ethnicity, and payer using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) analysis. Table 1.

The facility measure scores ranged from 0.0% to 100.0%, with a mean performance of 57% and a standard deviation of 21%. Our analysis showed a statistically significant difference in performance between each decile of hospitals, suggesting consistent performance gaps across facilities. We identified statistically significant differences in mean measure scores depending on age, payer, ethnicity, gender, and payer. The disparities across these groups highlight the importance of continuing to track sepsis care quality. Unintended Consequences None were reported. We have not found evidence in the published literature that clearly demonstrates unintended consequences from implementation of the measure. Number of clinical guidelines, including USPSTF guidelines, that address this measure topic 1 Outline the clinical guidelines supporting this measure The following presents six SEP-1 elements of care as they relate to the recommendations and quality evidence ratings in the 2016 SSC guidelines and updated in 2021. The following also notes the implications of the recommendations for patients and providers, which reflects the importance of the SEP-1 measure. 1) SEP-1 element of care: Measure lactate levels remeasure lactate 2 mmol/L. SSC guideline recommendation: Obtain initial lactate levels as a marker of tissue hypoperfusion and normalize lactate in patients with elevated lactate levels. Strength of recommendation, quality of evidence: Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence (no change from 2016 to 2021) Implications of recommendation: The desirable effects of adherence to this recommendation probably will outweigh the undesirable effects. Consider therapy tailored to patient circumstances. 2) SEP-1 element of care: Obtain blood cultures prior to antibiotics. SSC guideline recommendation: Obtain blood cultures before starting antimicrobial therapy in patients with suspected sepsis or septic shock. Strength of recommendation, quality of evidence: Best practice statement (no change from 2016 to 2021) Implications of recommendation: The desirable effects of adherence to this recommendation clearly outweigh the undesirable effects. Most patients should receive the recommended course of action. 3) SEP-1 element of care: Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics. Top of Document PAGE 200 \u00b7 Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program | Severe Sepsis an d Septic Shock: Management Bundle SSC guideline recommendation: Administer IV antibiotics as soon as possible after recognition of sepsis. Strength of recommendation, quality of evidence: Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence (overall similar from 2016 to 2021 still a strong recommendation; evidence identified as low in 2021 and expanded on in 2021) Implications of recommendation: The desirable effects of adherence to this recommendation clearly outweigh the undesirable effects. Most patients should receive the recommended course of action. 4) SEP-1 element of care: Administer crystalloid fluids for hypotension or lactate SSC guideline recommendation: Administer crystalloid fluid within the first three hours of sepsis -induced hypoperfusion. Strength of recommendation, quality of evidence: Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence (strength of recommendation for a 30 mL/kg crystalloid fluid volume downgraded from strong in 2016 to weak in 2021, primarily related to shifting to a fluid volume approach based on patient response instead of a set volume) Implications of recommendation: The desirable effects of adherence to this recommendation clearly outweigh the undesirable effects. Most patients should receive the recommended course of action. 5) SEP-1 element of care: Vasopressors for hypotension that does not respond to initial resuscitation SSC guideline recommendation: Administer vasopressors for refractory hypotension.

Yes Is the guideline graded? Yes List the guideline statement that most closely aligns with the measure concept. Sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies, and we recommend that treatment and resuscitation begin immediately. What evidence grading system did the guideline use to describe strength of recommendation? GRADE method List all categories and corresponding definitions for the evidence grading system used to describe strength of recommendation in the guideline? The GRADE methodology is based on the assessment of evidence based on six categories: 1) risk of bias, 2) inconsistency, 3) indirectness, 4) imprecision, 5) publication bias, and 6) other criteria. In addition, assessment of the balance between the benefit and harm, patient values and preferences, cost and resources, and feasibility and acceptability of the intervention are considered. The guideline panel final recommendations are based on the assessment of these factors. GRADE methodology classifies recommendations as strong or weak. A strong recommendation reflects that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation will clearly outweigh the undesirable effects. A weak recommendation means that the desirable effects of adherence to a recommendation probably will outweigh the undesirable effects, but the trade-offs are not clear, either because some of the evidence is low quality or the benefits and potential harms are closely balanced. Top of Document PAGE 202 \u00b7 Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program | Severe Sepsis an d Septic Shock: Management Bundle Some interventions carry best practice statements (BPSs), which are ungraded strong recommendations applied under strict criteria.

Across all facilities, the mean and 25th percentile of reliability for each quarter exceeded the 0.70 threshold for acceptable reliability. We also found acceptable reliability scores (> 0.70) across all deciles of hospitals by denominator size, indicating that reliability is high for hospitals regardless of denominator size. These results indicate that the measure can identify true differences in performance between individual facilities.

We hypothesized that measure performance and mortality should be associated. To test the hypothesis of whether SEP-1 is associated with mortality rates, we conducted a Chi-square of Association and Equal Proportions test between the two categorical variables: measure outcome (failed or passed) and mortality result (died or survived). To assess the direction and strength of the association between SEP-1 compliance and mortality, we calculated the risk ratio with a two-sided 95% confidence interval. If the risk ratio is above 1.0, indicating that cases that fail the measure have a higher risk of mortality compared to cases that pass the measure, and the confidence interval does not span 1.0, this would support the validity of the measure. Next, we calculated pass rates for hospitals and plotted by the facilities measure performance versus mortality rates using two approaches. In the first approach, we calculated pass rate deciles based on the distribution of hospitals pass rates and assigned each hospital into a percentile grouping based on their respective pass rates. We calculated the overall pass rates for each of the ten percentile groups along with the calculated mortality rates for each percentile group and plotted mortality for each of the ten pass rate percentile groups. The second approach was to group hospitals into ten pass rate buckets. We defined these buckets based on hard cut-offs in measure performance (e.g. hospitals with measure performance of 0%-10% would be in one bucket, hospitals with measure performance of 10.01%-20% would be in the next bucket, and so on). We calculated the overall pass rates each of the ten hard cut- off pass rate buckets along with the calculated mortality rates for each bucket and plotted mortality rates for each of the ten pass rate buckets. We also calculated two-proportion z-tests for each of the pass rate deciles and mortality deciles in order to distinguish whether there are meaningful difference s across the measure population. We used a p-value cut-off of 0.05 to define statistically significant differences between deciles. Empiric Validity: See section 2b1. \"Validity Testing\", starting on page 9, of the attached NQF Testing Attachment for full details of empiric validity. Top of Document PAGE 207 \u00b7 Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program | Severe Sepsis an d Septic Shock: Management Bundle The risk ratio of 1.84, indicates that cases that fail the measure have 1.84 times the risk of dying compared to cases that pass the measure. On average there is a 95% chance that the true mortality risk for cases that fail the measure compared to cases that pass the measure is captured in the interval 1.79 to 1.88. The graphs displaying mortality by both pass rate percentile groups and pass rate buckets show an inverse relationship between pass rates and mortality rates, suggesting that SEP-1 compliance is associated with a reduction in mortality. We also found that seven out of ten percentiles comparisons have a statistically significant difference between mortality rates at a significance level of 0.05; all adjacent percentile comparisons for measure performance have statistically significant differences. Empiric Validity: Interpretation of results Yes Face Validity No Face Validity: Number of voting experts and patients/caregivers N/A Face Validity: Result N/A Patient/Encounter Level Testing Yes Type of Analysis Agreement between other gold standard and manual reviewer Sample Size 916 Statistic Name Kappa Statistical Results 0.22 Interpretation of results See section 2b1. \"Validity Testing\", on pages 9 to 20 of the attached NQF Testing Attachment for full details. According to McHugh, a kappa value of less than 0 to 0.20 indicates no agreement, 0.21 to 0.39 indicates minimal agreement, 0.40 to 0.59 indicates weak agreement, 0.60 to 0.79 indicates moderate agreement, 0.80 to 0.90 indicates strong agreement, and a value above 0.9 indicates almost perfect agreement. Fifteen of the 19 critical categorical data elements with a defined kappa had a kappa value in the moderate to high range (> 0.60). One element with lower percent agreement and kappa (Blood Culture Acceptable Delay) is based on a small number of cases. This data element pertains to only 2.0 percent of cases for the overall CDAC sample, as shown in Table 2b1.3.1 in NQF Testing Form, and thus Top of Document PAGE 208 \u00b7 Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program | Severe Sepsis an d Septic Shock: Management Bundle is not likely to affect the validity of the overall measure. In some cases, we observed the Kappa paradox, in which the kappa value is low, and the percent agreement is high. This can occur if the variable values are highly imbalanced and observations tend to fall into one particular outcome category. For example, the percent agreement is high (98 percent) for the Documentation of Septic Shock data element. However, 142 of the 146 eligible cases have a value of '2' (No); this imbalance in value distribution potentially contributed to the lower kappa value (0.39) for this variable. Likewise, the data elements Repeat Lactate Level Collection and Repeat Volume Status and Tissue Perfusion Assessment Performed had high percent agreement (over 80 percent) and lower kappa values (less than 0.60). These variables were based on a small number of eligible cases (less than 25 percent of the sample). A frequently cited reference suggests that for medical literature, correlations of 0.7 to 0.9 are high and greater than 0.9 are very high. Of the 24 continuous variables, all correlations were statistically significant and were over 0.80, indicating a high correlation between the CDAC- and CDW-abstracted data. We found acceptable percent agreement between the CDAC and CDW cases for numerator and denominator calculations (over 0.7) , along with kappa values in the moderate range (over 0.6). This supports the validity of the data elements and measure construction.

The survey measures four key domains of patient experience for inpatient psychiatric care settings, including Relationship with the Treatment Team, Nursing Presence, Treatment Effectiveness, and the Healing Environment. Numerator The YPIX survey measures are calculated using top-box scoring. The top-box score refers to the percentage of patient respondents that provide the most positive response option Strongly Agree on each given question. For domain level scores, the top box scores are totaled for all questions within a given domain. Numerator Exclusions None Denominator The top box denominator is the number of respondents who have answered a given question. For domain level scoring, the question responses are totaled within a given domain. Denominator Exclusions Omitted questions or responses of Does Not Apply are excluded from the calculation. Patients who are younger than age 13. Patients who are unable to complete the survey due to cognitive or intellectual limitations.

Surveys were offered and collected prior to patient discharge from an inpatient facility. An additional pilot was performed using email and paper-based surveys that were distributed post-discharge. Data availability: In-person survey collection sites received survey responses from approximately 50% of total discharges over a two-year period. The post-discharge email and paper-based surveys returned < 3% of the total surveys distributed. Missing data: Uncollected surveys occurred because a patient refused, or the unit was unable to offer the survey due to operational reasons. Among completed surveys, less than approximately 5% of total items were missing. Barriers: In-person survey collection requires human resources. We estimate that 30 minutes per day by unit clerical staff were required to locate and distribute the survey prior to discharge. Unexpected discharges with a short lead-time also inhibit survey collection. Sampling bias: There may be a systematic difference between the patients who elect to complete a survey vs. those who do not. Overall, the magnitude of this bias is arguably less in in-person surveys vs mail/email collection. Unintended consequences: in-person distribution of surveys creates the potential for gaming or falsification of results. Feasibility of transferring: Data transfers would occur with third-party vendors in the same way HCAHPS surveys are currently transferred. Method of Measure Calculation Other digital method Hybrid measure: Methods of measure calculation N/A Evidence of Performance Gap Top box performance across all questions at the facility level of analysis was as follows: Avg: 64% Median: 64% Min: 55% Top of Document PAGE 216 \u00b7 Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Quality Reporting Program | Psychiatric Inpatient Experience Measurement Max: 72% Std Dev: 6.9% Top Box performance across all questions at the hospital unit level of analysis was as the attached analysis of the performance gap for full question and domain scores. Evidence of a performance gap is demonstrated by comparing these scores to the national average HCAHPS top box scores. Among the nationally reported HCAHPS questions, the average top box scores range from 54% to 80%, with an overall average of 70%. The current measure's top box results are similar to those from the HCAHPS. Unintended Consequences Implementation of a survey tool that is collected prior to patient discharge may have several unintended consequences: 1) There may be a small cost associated with technology or human capital resources; 2) There may be less focus on improving care processes that are not measured by the survey; 3) Pre-discharge surveys are potentially gamed or falsified; 4) Survey results may be subject to misinterpretation due to measurement error or bias.

N/A Number of systematic reviews that inform this measure concept 1 Briefly summarize the peer-reviewed systematic review(s) that inform this measure concept This systematic review identifies the methodological quality of the psychometric properties of instruments measuring quality and satisfaction with care from the perspective of mental health patients and professionals. In the 34 studies selected, a total of 22 instruments that measure quality and satisfaction with care provided, according to patients and/or professionals, were identified. Most are instruments with sound and contemporary theoretical foundations. They vary to the extent to which they have been used in empirical studies and with respect to the evaluation of their validity and reliability, although five instruments stand out as yielding good to excellent values in quality criteria. The psychometric review found that five of the instruments met valid psychometric criteria. Future reviews Top of Document PAGE 218 \u00b7 Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Quality Reporting Program | Psychiatric Inpatient Experience Measurement should include an analysis of the usefulness of instruments based on cost-effectiveness, acceptability, and educational impact. Sanches-Balcells et al, Psychometric properties of instruments measuring quality and satisfaction in mental health: a systematic review, J Adv Nurs. 2018;74:2497- 2510. Source of empirical data Published, peer-reviewed original research;Internal data analysis Summarize the empirical data The purpose of this study was to develop a psychometrically valid survey using rigorous measurement development and validation processes. A 23-item, four-domain survey with two additional open-ended prompts for narrative feedback was developed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses on a sample of 2,438 individuals receiving care in inpatient psychiatric units. Factor analyses produced four factors (treatment team relationships, nursing team presence, treatment effectiveness, and healing environment). A thematic analysis was performed based on the open-ended items to elucidate the primary themes of patient feedback. Results from both analyses were used to further inform a conceptual framework for the measurement of patient experience. The Yale Psychiatric Inpatient Experience survey integrates patient experience theory as well as aspects of patient-centered care that are important to psychiatric inpatients. Limitations include: Opportunities to fully assess construct validity, including discriminant and convergent validity, were limited due to the burdensome nature of administering multiple surveys to an inpatient psychiatric population. Additional research may be useful to further establish internal and construct validity. Additionally, because data were collected for quality improvement purposes, a test- retest procedure was not performed, therefore limiting the conclusiveness of internal validity. Finally, results relied on self-report, which is vulnerable to social response bias. Nonetheless, this was partially mitigated by administering the survey approximately 24 hours prior to discharge.

Post-discharge response rates for psychiatric hospital patients are typically low (e.g., the post- discharge response rate in our pilot sample was < 5% for both paper- and email-based survey collection modalities), we, therefore, recommend that surveys be offered prior to discharge. 2. Although the use of top-box scores is recommended, it may be useful for the distribution of total Likert-scale responses to be made available during initial implementation.

Oncologists are responsible for ensuring documentation of these discussions. Documentation of goals in structured fields prompts discussions, enhances their quality and efficiency, and promotes accessibility. This measure assesses goals of care discussion documentation among patients with cancer who die while receiving care at the reporting hospital. In this process measure, reported annually, hospitals will report the percent of cancer patients who died during the reporting period and had the patient's goals of care documented prior to death. Numerator The numerator for this measure is the number of individual deceased patients (decedents) in the measurement period for whom a Goals of Care (GOC) conversation was documented in a structured field in the medical record. Goals of care reflect the patient's values, preferences, and wishes. The measure requires any documentation in patient goals field(s) (including that the patient opted not to have the discussion) to report a yes for the numerator. Numerator Exclusions There are no numerator exclusions. Denominator The denominator is the number of patients who died in the measurement period. This population is defined as: 1: Patients with a diagnosis of cancer, AND 2: Had a least 2 eligible contacts at the reporting hospital within the 6 months prior to death. Eligible contacts are inpatient admissions and/or hematology/oncology ambulatory visits at the reporting hospital. Definitions and codes will be provided in the associated data dictionary (in revision pending testing results).

Web interface Stratification No Feasibility of Data Elements Some data elements are in defined fields in electronic sources Top of Document PAGE 230 \u00b7 Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Quality Reporting Program | Documentation of Goals of Care Discussions Among Cancer Patients Feasibility Assessment The measure was alpha tested in April 2022. Eight hospitals were provided the specifications and performed a feasibility analysis. The findings of this alpha testing were shared with the IGCC Measure Technical Expert Panel. The primary challenges at this phase of developed identified were: 1. For the denominator, reliably identifying patients who died external to the reporting hospital 2. For the numerator, the participating hospitals are at different stages of a. provider use of structured documentation to capture patient goals and b. ability to generate reports of the presence of documentation in the \"patient goals\" field of the medical record (i.e., to completely remove the need for manual medical record abstraction). This is expected to be resolved through continued maturation of the electronic health records and education. Method of Measure Calculation Other digital method Hybrid measure: Methods of measure calculation N/A Evidence of Performance Gap Goals of care discussions can be difficult for patients, families and providers, and substantial published evidence demonstrates that these discussions do not occur/are not documented (see Evidence). Among 10 cancer hospitals participating in testing, goals of care notes were documented for fewer than 40% of all decedents (range: 3% - 100%), including that died as inpatients (range: 0% - 100%). Goals of care are distinct from end of life planning, and should occur earlier and amongst a broader patient population. There is clear room for improvement in eliciting and documenting patient goals of care. Unintended Consequences None Number of clinical guidelines, including USPSTF guidelines, that address this measure topic 1 Outline the clinical guidelines supporting this measure Patient-Clinician Communication: American Society of Clinical Oncology Consensus Guideline. Purpose: To provide guidance to oncology clinicians on how to use effective communication to optimize the patient-clinician relationship, patient and clinician well-being, and family well-being. Methods: ASCO convened a of medical oncology, psychiatry, nursing, hospice and palliative medicine, communication skills, health disparities, and advocacy experts to produce recommendations. Guideline development involved a systematic review of the literature and a formal consensus process. The systematic review focused on guidelines, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials published from 2006 through October 1, 2016. Top of Document PAGE 231 \u00b7 Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Quality Reporting Program | Documentation of Goals of Care Discussions Among Cancer Patients Results: The systematic review included 47 publications. With the exception of clinician training in communication skills, evidence for many of the clinical questions was limited. Draft recommendations underwent two rounds of consensus voting before being finalized. Recommendations: In addition to providing guidance regarding core communication skills and tasks that apply across the continuum of cancer care, recommendations address specific topics, such as discussion of goals of care and prognosis, treatment selection, end- of-life care, facilitating family involvement in care, and clinician training in communication skills. Recommendations are accompanied by suggested strategies for implementation.

Automated reports reduce reporting burden but may introduce validity and reliability concerns. Sites performed chart reviews to assess reliability. Sample Size 40 Statistic Name Percent agreement Statistical Results 90 Interpretation of results Identification of deceased patients requires time (for data maturity) and defined processes. During Alpha testing, we compared numbers of identified decedents by quarter to identify the most proximal time period in which hospitals could report the numerator. We selected the most recent time period in which quarterly data reflected normal variation vs artificially low numbers due to incomplete data capture. This measure should be reported with a 6 month delay before the denominator window begins. Reports that automatically pull data from structured EHR fields are crucial to reducing reporting burden, but can introduce reliability and validity issues. Further, hospitals appropriately customize the exact words and phrases used for structured goals of care documentation. Experts ensured that hospitals that To p of Document PAGE 239 \u00b7 Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Quality Reporting Program | Documentation of Goals of Care Discussions Among Cancer Patients had goals of care fields could identify them appropriately using the measure instructions. This was found to be the case. Abstractors compared automated reports with actual chart documentation using a defined audit process. Reports correctly identified that there was goals of care field documentation 90% of the time. Results of the audit allowed hospitals to begin addressing EHR report inconsistencies when those were found.

The measure is calculated using chart abstracted data, on a rolling quarterly basis, and is publicly reported in aggregate for one calendar year. The measure has been publicly reported since 2013 as part of the ED Throughput measure set of the CMS Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR) Program. Numerator N/A: This is a continuous variable measure. Numerator Exclusions N/A: This is a continuous variable measure. Denominator Continuous Variable measure: Time (in minutes) from ED arrival to ED departure for patients discharged from the ED. Denominator Exclusions Patients who expired in the ED, left against medical advice (AMA), or whose discharge was not documented or unable to be determined (UTD) are excluded from the target population. Denominator Exceptions N/A: This is a continuous variable measure. State of development Field (Beta) Testing State of Development Details The Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Discharged Patients measure has been in the hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR) program for at least 10 years and has been publicly reported since 2015. The most recent testing for this measure, performed in 2020, included empirical reliability testing and critical data element validity testing consistent with the NQF testing requirements at the time, which did not require validity testing for both critical data elements and empiric validity testing of the measure score. We are submitting this existing and tested measure based on a request from CMS that it be added to the new outpatient Rural Emergency Hospital (REH) program. Although the most recent level of testing does not meet the current MUC list definition for a fully developed measure, this measure has been previously tested, is currently in use, and is being publicly reported, Top of Document PAGE 243 \u00b7 Rural Emergency Hospital Program | Median Time from emergency department (ED) Arrival to ED Departure for Discharged ED Patients which reflects that it is fully developed. This measure is recommended by CCSQ leadership for adoption in the REH program based upon previous reliability and validity testing and its long-term utility in the OQR program, all of which speaks to its validity.

Feasibility of Data Elements ALL data elements are in defined fields in electronic sources Feasibility Assessment Median time from ED arrival to time of departure is a chart abstracted measure that has been in the Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting Program (OQR) Program since 2011 and is publicly reported on Care Compare. Based on the volume and content of question received from abstractors, the information is available in medical records and can be consistently located. Most questions are related to the presence of conflicting documentation and unique facility-specific or patient-specific workflows. Nine expert work group (EWG) members, with backgrounds in healthcare administration, management, and clinical expertise in emergency medicine, pediatric emergency medicine, and clinical pharmacy, provided feedback on the feasibility of this measure through an online survey. Most respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the practical aspects of reporting median time from ED arrival to time of departure as a chart abstracted measure do not place undue burden on hospitals for its data. However, one respondent commented that the degree of burden may vary depending on the programming structure of different electronic health records (EHRs). Most respondents also indicated that the data elements are currently available in an electronic health record EHR structured field. Overall, the Top of Document PAGE 247 \u00b7 Rural Emergency Hospital Program | Median Time from emergency department (ED) Arrival to ED Departure for Discharged ED Patients respondents generally supported the feasibility of measuring median time from ED arrival to time of departure. Method of Measure Calculation Claims;Manual abstraction Hybrid measure: Methods of measure calculation N/A Evidence of Performance Gap Analysis of facility-level data from the Hospital Compare downloadable files indicates that there is variation in the median time from ED arrival to time of departure. During the January 2014 to December 2014 data collection periods, median facility-level throughput times ranged from 46 minutes to 424 minutes, with a median of 140 minutes. During the January 2016 to December 2016 data collection periods, median facility-level throughput times ranged from 45 minutes to 440 minutes, with a median of 136 minutes. During the January 2014 to December 2016 data collection periods, there is documentation of substantial variation in facility performance. The interquartile range is consistently wide, ranging from 51 minutes in 2014 to 53 minutes in 2016. Additionally, the maximum time for ED discharge increased between 2014 and 2016 from 424 to 440 minutes. While median performance is improving, decreasing from 140 minutes in 2014 to 136 minutes in 2016, there is ongoing opportunity for improvement in performance at the facility level.

Method of Measure Calculation Claims Hybrid measure: Methods of measure calculation N/A Evidence of Performance Gap We include performance data for all HOPDs captured by the colonoscopy measure, which includes but is not limited to entities that will convert to REHs. For the performance period between January 1, 2016-December 31, 2018, risk-standardized hospital visit rates (RSHVRs) per 1000 colonoscopies, for all facilities (n = 4034) were as follows: minimum, 11.67, Top of Document PAGE 260 \u00b7 Rural Emergency Hospital Program | Facility 7-Day Risk-Standardized Hospital Visit Rate after Outpatient Colonoscopy maximum,24.27; mean (SD), 16.47 (1.32). The distribution of measure scores indicates that there is substantial variation in performance among HOPDs. Among HOPDs, the median RSHVR is 16.4 hospital visits per 1,000 colonoscopies, which indicates that patients undergoing colonoscopy at a facility performing at the median are expected to have an ED visit, observation stay, or admission to the hospital within 7 days 1.64% of the time. The 10th and 90th percentiles (14.9 and 18.1 hospital visits per 1,000 colonoscopies, respectively) represent meaningful deviations from the median: a facility performing at the 10th percentile is performing about 9% better than an average performer, and a facility performing at the 90th percentile is performing about 11% worse than an average performer. Furthermore, the best performing facilities (11.7 hospital visits per 1,000 colonoscopies) are performing 29% better than the median performer, while the worst (24.3 hospital visits per 1,000 colonoscopies) are performing 48% worse than the median performer.

Method of Measure Calculation Claims Hybrid measure: Methods of measure calculation N/A Top of Document PAGE 273 \u00b7 Rural Emergency Hospital Program | Risk-standardized hospital visits within 7 days after hospital outpatient surgery Evidence of Performance Gap We have performance information showing a quality gap for all HOPDs with qualifying procedures; this includes facilities but is not limited to facilities that may opt to become Rural Emergency Hospitals. Overall, our results suggest that there is substantial need to both reduce the expected rate and the variation in rates across HOPDs, and that this improvement goal is achievable. We characterize the degree of variation by: 1) Providing the median odds ratio (MOR) [1]. The MOR represents the median increase in odds of a hospital visit if a procedure on a single patient was performed at a higher risk HOPD compared to a lower risk HOPD. It is calculated by taking all possible combinations of HOPDs, always comparing the higher risk HOPD to the lower risk HOPD. The MOR is interpreted as a traditional odds ratio would be. The median odds ratio is 1.28 which indicates that a patient has a 28% increase in the odds of a hospital visit if the same procedure was performed at higher risk HOPD compared to a lower risk HOPD indicating the impact of quality on the outcome rate is substantial. 2) Reporting the distribution of the RSHVR. Of the 3,974 facilities (representing data from January 1, 2018-December 31, 2018), the range of RSHVRs was 0.54-2.39 (IQR 0.93-1.07). The range of performance on the HOPD Surgery measure demonstrates that there is a significant quality gap. Specifically, the best-performing HOPD (RSHVR of 0.54) is performing 46% better than average, whereas the worst- performing HOPD (RSHVR of 2.39) is performing 139% worse than the average. Furthermore, our outlier analysis identified about 300 or about 8 percent of HOPDs as outliers (3.77% significantly better and 3.98% significantly worse than expected). Note that the that average performer refers to an HOPD with the same case and service-line mix, performing at the average. 3) Presenting performance categories. Because the measure score is a complex function of parameter estimates, we use re-sampling and simulation techniques to derive an interval estimate to determine if a HOPD is performing better than, worse than, or no different than expected. A HOPD is considered as better than expected if their entire confidence interval falls below 1, and considered worse if the entire confidence interval falls above 1. They are considered no different if the confidence interval overlaps 1. A total of 150 facilities (3.77%) performed Better than Expected, 2,671 facilities (67.21%) performed No Different than Expected, and the remaining 158 facilities (3.98%) performed Worse than Expected. Unintended Consequences During public comment period when the measure was first proposed in 2017 OPPS rule, concern was raised about the potential unintended consequence of providers avoiding certain patients and procedures depending on the inclusion criteria and robustness of the risk adjustment. But the measure was adopted, implemented, and CMS also routinely monitors for unintended consequences of quality measures. We have encountered no unexpected findings during implementation, including unintended impacts on patients.

Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting Program Is this measure similar to and/or competing with a measure(s) already in a program? Yes Which measure(s) already in a program is your measure similar to and/or competing with? This measure is identical to the Abdomen CT Use of Contrast Material implemented in CMS's Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting program since 2011. How will this measure be distinguished from other similar and/or competing measures? The measure specifications will remain similar to those for Abdomen CT Use of Contrast Material implemented in CMS's Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting program. However, the application of this measure to the Rural Emergency Health program will allow CMS to measure a new care setting where these imaging studies are performed. How will this measure add value to the CMS program? A CT abdomen study is a very common imaging procedure in the Medicare population. Implementing the measure for Rural Emergency Hospitals promotes the use of CT abdomen imaging aligned with current clinical guidance, while avoiding the potentially harmful effects of unnecessary radiation and contrast exposure. A CT study performed with and without contrast doubles the radiation dose to the beneficiary and exposes the beneficiary to the potential harmful side effects of the contrast material itself. Reducing the unnecessary use of combined CT abdomen studies-defined as those that are performed both with and without contrast agents for the evaluation of solid organs and body cavities - represents an important opportunity to improve practice and patient safety. If this measure is being proposed to meet a statutory requirement, please list the corresponding statute N/A Section 2: Measure Evidence How is the measure expected to be reported to the program? Claims Stratification No Feasibility of Data Elements ALL data elements are in defined fields in electronic sources Feasibility Assessment The measure is calculated using data from final claims that facilities submit for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in fee for service Medicare. The codes included in the measure specifications appear on the claims used to calculate the measure. Top of Document PAGE 285 \u00b7 Rural Emergency Hospital Program | Abdomen Computed Tomography (CT) Use of Contrast Material Method of Measure Calculation Claims Hybrid measure: Methods of measure calculation N/A Evidence of Performance Gap Since the first public reporting of the measure in 2011 for the HOQR program, there have been large improvements in facility performance at Hospital Outpatient Departments\u00e2?the measure median dropped from 9.5% in 2011 to 1.4% in 2021, with a much larger downward trend in performance for facilities falling in or above the 75th percentile originally. Overall, the downward trend suggests that the quality of the performance of abdomen CT studies improved nationally across each score stratum during public reporting. Though we cannot calculate the performance gap for REHs, we anticipate the measure would similarly help facilities address any variation in performance. In public reporting year 2020, rural, small (0-50 beds), and government-owned facilities account for a disproportionally high percentage of outlier facilities (45.1%, 37.6%, and 0.9%, respectively), indicating any opportunity for performance improvement.

AKI is encompassed in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) Patient Safety Indicator (PSI) 90 composite, under the provider-level PSI 10: Postoperative Acute Kidney Injury Requiring Dialysis Rate (CMIT Ref No. 05021) measure. PSI 10 is used to measure Postoperative physiologic and metabolic derangements (secondary diagnosis) or acute renal failures (secondary diagnosis) with dialysis per 1,000 elective surgical discharges for patients ages 18 years and older. PSI 10 is available on Hospital Compare. Reference: AHRQ. (2020). Patient Safety Indicator 10 (PSI 10) Postoperative Acute Kidney Injury Requiring Dialysis Rate ICD- 10-CM/PCS Specification v2020 Top of Document PAGE 298 \u00b7 Cross-Program Measures | Hospital Harm - Acute Kidney Injury How will this measure be distinguished from other similar and/or competing measures? PSI 10 measures how often hospitalized patients had renal failure requiring dialysis after having an operation. Additionally, PSI 10 utilizes claims data and is not National Quality Forum (NQF) endorsed (though the composite PSI 90 (CMIT Ref No.03282/05537), of which it is a component, is endorsed). In comparison, this measure measures how often AKI occurs in the inpatient hospital setting and will be developed as an eCQM. Reference: AHRQ. (2020). Patient Safety Indicator 10 (PSI 10) Postoperative Acute Kidney Injury Requiring Dialysis Rate ICD- 10-CM/PCS Specification v2020 How will this measure add value to the CMS program? Although there are many occurrences of AKI in hospital settings, many of which are preventable, there is currently no measure in a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) quality reporting program or public reporting that quantifies how AKI occurs in hospitalized patients. If this measure is being proposed to meet a statutory requirement, please list the corresponding statute N/A Section 2: Measure Evidence How is the measure expected to be reported to the program? eCQM Stratification No Feasibility of Data Elements ALL data elements are in defined fields in electronic sources Feasibility Assessment To better understand if critical data elements used in the measure are available in a structured format and if the form in which they exist aligns with measure intent, we designed a web-based questionnaire and distributed the survey to 34 hospitals (17 Meditech and 17 Cerner). The survey began with an inquiry into the measure's critical data elements (concepts) and ended with questions on the overall measure. The goal of the survey was to determine, within each hospital's EHR system, if critical data elements are: readily available in a structured format, from an authoritative source and/or highly likely to be correct, coded in a nationally accepted terminology standard or can be mapped to that terminology standard, and routinely collected as part of clinical care and require no or limited additional data entry from a clinician or other providers, and no EHR interface changes needed. Top of Document PAGE 299 \u00b7 Cross-Program Measures | Hospital Harm - Acute Kidney Injury All 34 hospitals confirmed that the following data elements are captured in the EHR in a structured and codified manner: Birthdate, Ethnicity, Payer, Race, Sex. Encounter Inpatient, Emergency Department Visit, Observation Services, Serum Creatinine Lab Test., and Procedure Performed (all denominator exclusion procedures). For the data element, Procedure, Performed: Hospital based Dialysis Services, we encountered some inconsistencies in workflow and ability to capture the data across the 34 sites. Only 29 of the sites offer dialysis services onsite, and most of these sites utilize a contracted service provider to complete the procedure. Roughly 24% of the sites offering dialysis services only maintain dialysis performed documentation in unstructured fields, which prompted us to look at the feasibility of using a union of dialysis performed and dialysis ordered. All 29 sites reported the ability to structurally capture Procedure, Ordered: Hospital based Dialysis Services with some variability in provider workflows; some hospitals extract orders through the contracted dialysis provider while others extract orders through the EHR system. For the data element Diagnosis, used in the measure exclusions, there were challenges in retrieving the attribute \"present on admission\" (POA) from 15 sites. The documentation was available in the EHR; however, the location of that data was not accessible for extract at the time of initial testing, although it became available later. Since POA status is a mandated element in hospital billing, we do not have concerns about the availability, accuracy and use of standards. Technical glitches and/or workflow modifications may be required for some organizations to ensure that all POA indicators pushed into the EHR from other systems can be extracted. Upon collecting responses, we held debrief meetings with participants to resolve ambiguities. We then translated final responses to numeric values used in the NQF scorecard. Method of Measure Calculation eCQM Hybrid measure: Methods of measure calculation N/A Evidence of Performance Gap This safety eCQM captures the number of patients who had acute kidney injury (AKI), as evidenced by a substantial increase in serum creatinine, or the initiation of renal dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) during the hospitalization. Published literature suggests that the incidence of AKI in general hospitalized patients is 10% - 20%, in ICU patients ranges from 10-20%, and in cardiac surgery patients ranges from 30%-50% (Thongprayoon, 2020). Using the EHR data from 20 hospitals and in year 2020, we found that hospital-level measure performance rates ranged from 0.76% (for every 1,000 qualified hospital admissions there are 7.6 inpatient encounters where patients suffered AKI) to 4.43% (for every 1,000 qualified hospital admissions there are 44 inpatient encounters where patients suffered AKI), with a system-wide, weighted average rate equal to 1.52%. While AKI may be due to natural progression of underlying illness or a complication of a necessary treatment such as chemotherapy, a proportion of AKI cases are preventable and treatable (KDIGO, Top of Document PAGE 300 \u00b7 Cross-Program Measures | Hospital Harm - Acute Kidney Injury 2012). The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines suggest careful management of hemodynamic status, fluids, and vasoactive medications for the prevention of AKI (Wilson et al., 2015). Both worsening renal function and injury requiring dialysis have lasting negative impact including loss of kidney function, uremic complications, and symptoms associated with drug toxicity and volume overload (Hoste & De Corte., 2011; Levey & James., 2017; Liborio et. al., 2015). Literature also suggests early AKI treatment such as nephrotoxic avoidance, drug dose adjustment, and attention to fluid balance are also effective preventive measures (Perazella, 2012; Onuigbo et al., 2017). The KDIGO guidelines also suggest careful management of hemodynamic status, fluids, and vasoactive medications for the prevention of AKI (KDIGO, 2012). Clinical consensus continues to support the KDIGO recommendations following a recent conference review (Ostermann et al., 2019). This measure will fill a gap in measurement and provide incentives for hospital quality improvement, as there is no current inpatient AKI measure in a CMS program. Systematically measuring the rates of AKI in the hospital setting will provide hospitals with a reliable and timely assessment and will allow for hospitals to improve quality and reduce AKI harm rates.

However, CMS is committed to monitoring this eCQM's use and assessing potential unintended consequences over time, such as the inappropriate shifting of care, and other negative unintended consequences for patients. It is possible that by measuring AKI in the hospital setting, some hospital clinicians may be less likely to provide aminoglycoside antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or other medications that are thought to contribute to the occurrence of AKI in some patients. Increased incentives to avoid these medications could lead to higher pain burden in some patients, although alternative medications are always available. Number of clinical guidelines, including USPSTF guidelines, that address this measure topic 1 Outline the clinical guidelines supporting this measure One evidence-based guideline directly supports the measure as follows: Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO). (2012). KDIGO 2012 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease. Kidney international, Suppl. 2, 1- 138. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease provides the most modern and accepted definition and staging system for AKI (KDIGO, 2012). This guideline is evidence based and recommends that serum creatinine is an accepted proxy for acute kidney disease (KDIGO, 2012). Realizing that there is an increasing prevalence of acute (and chronic) kidney disease worldwide and that the complications and problems of patients with kidney disease are universal, KDIGO, a nonprofit foundation, was established in 2003 \"to improve the care and outcomes of kidney disease patients worldwide through promoting coordination, collaboration, and integration of initiatives to develop and implement clinical practice guidelines,\" (Ekinoyan et al., 2004). The Board of Directors of KDIGO quickly realized that there is room for improving international cooperation in the development, dissemination, and implementation of clinical practice guidelines in the field of AKI. At its meeting in December of 2006, the KDIGO Board of Directors determined that the topic of AKI meets the criteria for developing clinical practice guidelines. These criteria were formulated as follows: AKI is common. AKI imposes a heavy burden of illness (morbidity and mortality). The cost per person of managing AKI is high. AKI is amenable to early detection and potential prevention. There is considerable variability in practice to prevent, diagnose, treat, and achieve outcomes of AKI. Top of Document PAGE 302 \u00b7 Cross-Program Measures | Hospital Harm - Acute Kidney Injury Clinical practice guidelines in the field have the potential to reduce variations, improve outcomes, and reduce costs. Formal guidelines do not exist on this topic. This guideline was published in 2012 and uses the GRADE system to rate the strength of evidence and the strength of recommendations. In all, there were only 11 (18%) recommendations in this guideline for which the overall quality of evidence was graded 'A,' whereas 20 (32.8%) were graded 'B,' 23 (37.7%) were graded 'C,' and 7 (11.5%) were graded 'D.' Although there are reasons other than quality of evidence to make a grade 1 or 2 recommendation, in general, there is a correlation between the quality of overall evidence and the strength of the recommendation. Thus, there were 22 (36.1%) recommendations graded '1' and 39 (63.9%) graded '2.' There were 9 (14.8%) recommendations graded '1A,' 10 (16.4%) were '1B,' 3 (4.9%) were '1C,' and (0%) '1D.' were (3.3%) '2A,' 10 were 20 (32.8%) were and 7 (11.5%) were '2D.' There were 26 (29.9%) statements that were not graded. These recommendations have been assessed for quality and the guidelines have been deemed appropriate to meet our criteria. KDIGO defines AKI Stage 1 as the sudden decrease (in 48 h) of renal function, defined by an increase in absolute serum creatinine (SCr) of at least 26.5 \u00c2\u00b5mol/L (0.3 mg/dL) from baseline or by a percentage increase in SCr greater or equal to greater than 1.5-1.9 times the baseline value, or by a decrease in the urinary output (UO) (documented oliguria less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for more than 6 h). Stage 2 is defined as an increase of absolute serum creatinine SCr greater than 2-2.9 times the baseline value, or by a decrease in UO less than 0.5 mL/kg/h for more than 12 h.

We are confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect. Grade B- Moderate quality of evidence. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different. Grade C- Low quality of evidence. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect. Grade D- Very low quality of evidence. The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often will be far from the truth.

Number of systematic reviews that inform this measure concept N/A Briefly summarize the peer-reviewed systematic review(s) that inform this measure concept N/A Source of empirical data Published, peer-reviewed original research Summarize the empirical data On average, AKI affects up to 10% of hospitalized patients, which is comparable to the rates of severe sepsis and acute lung injury (McCoy et al., 2010; Hoste & Schurgers., 2008; Chertow et al., 2005; Perzazella, 2012). AKI requiring dialyses and less severe AKI affects approximately 200-300 and 2,000- 3,000 per million population per year, respectively (Chertow et al., 2005). Accurately monitoring the rate at which AKI occurs in the hospital setting allows for hospitals to improve quality and reduce AKI harm rates. This AKI eCQM uses a seven-day rolling window to examine a rise in serum creatinine to 2.0 times or greater is based on the KDIGO definition established in the 2012 KDIGO AKI clinical practice guidelines (KDIGO, 2012). A rise in serum creatinine is associated with an increased risk of mortality, even if values are within a 'normal' range. (KDIGO, 2012). One enhancement that was made to this measure specification was based on recent evidence on the calculation of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The GFR is estimated from the serum creatine levels from serum concentrations of endogenous filtration markers such as creatinine or cystatin C (the equation is known as eGFR) (Inker et al., 2021). Based on a study from the Chronic Kidney Disease and Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI), the study found that eGFR equations that incorporate creatinine and cystatin C but omit race are more accurate and led to smaller differences between Black participants and non-Black participants than new equations without race with either creatinine or cystatin C alone (Inker et al., 2021). As a result, a new race-neutral eGFR equation that that measures serum creatinine or cystatin C incorporate age, sex, and race to estimate measured GFR has been developed and is recommended by the Task Force from the National Kidney Foundation and American Society of Nephrology (Inker et al., 2021; Diao et al., 2021; Delgado et al., 2022). It was recommended by the task force to use within the measure a CKD-EPI creatinine equation refit without the race variable. This functionality has been available to all laboratories in the United States (Delgado et al., 2021; Delgado et al.,2022), and has acceptable performance characteristics and potential consequences that do not disproportionately affect any one group of individuals. This eCQM will utilize this change in algorithm. References (Alphabetical): Chertow, G. M., Burdick, E., Honour, M., Bonventre, J. V., & Bates, D. W. (2005).

Name evidence type Conclusions from the KDIGO AKI conference (2019) Summarize the evidence KDIGO held a conference in 2019 to determine best practices for prevention of AKI and areas of uncertainty in treating AKI; review key relevant literature published since the 2012 KDIGO AKI guideline;; identify new topics or issues to be revisited for the next iteration of the KDIGO AKI guideline; and outline research needed to improve AKI management (Ostermann et al., 2020). The effectiveness of the 2012 KDIGO recommendations in preventing AKI was also noted to have been confirmed in small single- Top of Document PAGE 307 \u00b7 Cross-Program Measures | Hospital Harm - Acute Kidney Injury center randomized controlled trials (RCTs), such as the Prevention of AKI (PrevAKI) and the Biomarker Guided Intervention for Prevention of AKI (BigpAK) studies (Meersh 2017, Gocze 2018). In addition, results of RCTs have provided new data relevant to several facets of preventing and managing AKI, including early resuscitation, fluid therapy, prevention of contrast-associated AKI, and timing of acute renal replacement therapy (RRT) (Kellum 2016, Nijssen 2017, Self 2018, Semler 2018, Zarbock 2016, Gaudry 2016, Barbar 2018). Much of the focus of the conference focused on prevention and early treatment to prevent progression of AKI. The overall findings from the conference suggest that since publication of the KDIGO guidelines in 2012, consensus of clinical opinion and several recent trials support fluid management and drug stewardship to reduce the occurrence of AKI.

(Section 2) of the 2022 MUC List Attachment - Acute Kidney Injury shows ROC and PR curves for the baseline risk model on the holdout set using coefficient estimates derived from the training set. We note that data points in the holdout set are not used for model training or parameter tuning and hence, they provide an unbiased assessment of the model's performance. AUROC and AUPRC are shown on the bottom of the graph, and the dashed lines (reference lines) serve as a benchmark classifier, implying what the model performance would be for a completely uninformative model. Testing results suggest strong model performance. In particular, C- statistic is larger than 0.8, which is a benchmark frequently cited for demonstrating excellent model performance. Similarly, AUPRC indicates that the baseline risk model is close to 15 times better than a random prediction. We caution against the interpretation of AUPRC based on its absolute value, as by construction AUPRC is affected by the base rate and inversely related to data imbalance. That is, as data become more balanced and as base rate rises, the absolute value of AUPRC rises. To alleviate the concern that our testing sample may not be large enough to yield a reliable performance metric, we conducted a simulation exercise. Specifically, we generated 100 random holdout sets and calculated 100 AUROC and AUPRC using coefficient estimates previously derived from the training set, and the Exhibit 3 (Section 2) of the 2022 MUC List Attachment - Acute Kidney Injury shows that the odds of strong model performance occurring by chance are very small.

Known groups validity can be viewed as measuring the relative scores between groups - in this case, comparing teaching hospitals with non-teaching hospitals.

In terms of hospital quality and patient safety, prior research has shown several known groups that are identifiable using information collected: Hospital teaching/academic status Hospital bed size (<25, 25-99, 100-199, 200-499, and >499) Hospital urban/rural location Prior to analyses, we hypothesized that the rate of AKI will be lower at teaching, large-sized, and urban hospitals (in general, better resourced hospitals) than non-teaching, small-sized, and rural hospitals, respectively. Testing results showed that teaching hospitals performed (27%) better than non-teaching hospitals, with the average risk-adjusted measure performance rate equal to 1.37 and 1.87 per 100 qualified admissions, respectively (risk ratio = 0.73). Urban hospitals performed (22%) better than rural hospitals, with the average risk-adjusted measure performance rate equal to 1.63 and 2.08 per 100 qualified admissions, respectively (risk ratio = 0.78). Large-sized hospitals performed better than small-sized hospitals. Note that lower measure rate denotes better quality of care, as the measured outcome is a harm event.

The relatively lower sensitivity value was due to cases meeting denominator exclusion per clinical abstractors that weren't correctly classified by the EHR. We investigated the root cause and found that the discrepancy was caused by the EHR-exported data showing blank POA information, even though valid values (e.g., Yes) were visible upon inspection of the EHR. The POA information in the affected sites exists in an external data environment and only partial POA information (e.g., ICD- 10-CM diagnoses) flows into the EHR in a structured format. As a result, the technical difficulty led to disagreements between the EHR and clinical abstractors. However, we note that POA status is a mandatory data element in hospital billing and hence, we have no concerns about this issue in the longer term. As a follow-up, we conducted further analyses with the affected sites and confirmed the electronic retrievability of POA status for all their inpatient discharges in year 2020. Across the 20 test sites, measure denominator ranged from 151 to 7,948 qualified inpatient encounters and measure rate ranged from a low of 0.76 to a high of 4.43 per 100 qualified inpatient encounters. The wide variability indicates ample room for quality improvement in hospital inpatient setting. Exhibit 4 (Section 4) of the 2022 MUC List Attachment - Acute Kidney Injury translates the distribution of observed measure rate and its 95% confidence interval into a histogram and further displays the system- wide, weighted average measure rate (green dashed horizontal line). Testing data showed that several hospitals' performance rates are consistently below the overall mean while a few others are above that mean. Comparing to the variability in measure performance rates, variation in Kappa, PPV, and sensitivity across test sites is more limited. The minimum Kappa equals 0.92, but all other kappas were 1.0, which denotes perfect concordance. The minimum PPV equals 0.91 and the second smallest PPV equals 0.96. The median and mode of PPV are both 1.0. The minimum sensitivity equals 0.79 and the second smallest sensitivity equals 0.96. The median and mode of sensitivity are both 1.0.

Substantial clinical benefit (SCB) improvement will be measured by the change in score on the joint-specific patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) instruments, measuring hip or knee pain and functioning, from the preoperative assessment (data collected 90 to 0 days before surgery) to the postoperative assessment (data collected 275 to 425 days following surgery). Numerator The numerator is the risk-adjusted proportion of patients undergoing an elective primary THA/TKA who meet or exceed a SCB threshold of improvement between preoperative and postoperative assessments on joint-specific PROMs as follows: For THA patients, meeting or exceeding a 22-point increase in score on the Hip dysfunction and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (HOOS, JR)1,) and For TKA patients, meeting or exceeding a 20-point increase in score on the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (KOOS, JR)2. ). Numerator Exclusions None Denominator The cohort (target population) includes Medicare FFS patients 65 years of age and older undergoing elective primary THA/TKA procedures in an HOPD or ASC setting. The measure includes patients who are enrolled in Medicare FFS Part A and Part B for the 12 months prior to the date of the procedure, who are alive 10 months after the procedure and who do not have more than two THA or TKA procedure codes on the same claim. The cohort does not include patients with revision THAs/TKAs, and bone metastases. The rationale for each is outlined below: A concurrent partial hip or knee arthroplasty procedure Rationale: Partial arthroplasty procedures are primarily done for hip and knee fractures and are typically performed on patients who are older, frailer, and have more comorbid conditions. A concurrent revision, resurfacing, or implanted device/prosthesis removal procedure Rationale: Revision procedures may be performed at a disproportionately small number of hospitals and are associated with higher mortality, complication, and readmission rates. Resurfacing procedures are a different type of procedure involving only the joints articular surface and are typically performed on younger, healthier Top of Document PAGE 317 \u00b7 Cross-Program Measures | Risk-Standardized Patient-Reported Outcomes Following Elective Primary Total Hip and/or Total Knee Arthroplasty (THA/TKA PRO-PM) in the HOPD or ASC Setting patients. Elective procedures performed on patients undergoing removal of implanted device/prostheses procedures may be more complicated. Malignant neoplasm of the pelvis, sacrum, coccyx, lower limbs, or bone/bone marrow or a disseminated malignant neoplasm coded in the principal discharge diagnosis field on the index admission claim Rationale: Patients with these malignant neoplasms are at increased risk for complication, and the procedure may not be elective. Denominator Exclusions The measure has two denominator exclusions, listed below. 1. Staged Procedures Patients with staged procedures, defined as more than one elective primary THA or TKA performed on the same patient during distinct time periods during the measurement period, are excluded. All THA/TKA procedures for patients with staged procedures during the measurement period are removed from the measure cohort. 2. Patients who die within 10 months of the procedure This exclusion is to remove patients who die prior to the postoperative window and are not \"available\" to provide PROs during postop assessment. With the updated postoperative window, this should align.

NQF 3559 and NQF 3639: Outcomes from procedures performed in the outpatient setting are currently not captured by these measures for Medicare Fee For Service patients. Other than attribution, these measures are exactly the same as the measure at the HOPD/ASC level. Top of Document PAGE 321 \u00b7 Cross-Program Measures | Risk-Standardized Patient-Reported Outcomes Following Elective Primary Total Hip and/or Total Knee Arthroplasty (THA/TKA PRO-PM) in the HOPD or ASC Setting NQF 2653: This measure does capture outpatient procedures but is reported at the clinician/clinician group level and therefore does not hold facilities accountable for their performance on this measure. The measure proposed in this submission differs from NQF 2653 in important ways out lined below: 1. This PRO-PM reflects outcomes for both THA and TKA recipients (rather than TKA recipients only), allowing for measurement of a greater number of patients and providers to provide CMS with broader influence on quality improvement. This approach aligns with the typical provision of orthopedic care, delivered to patients undergoing THA/TKA procedures by the same providers and staff. 2. This PRO-PM assesses improvement in patient-reported pain and function using a binary outcome that elucidates for providers and patients the risk-adjusted proportion of patients with and without improvement (a clear, understandable metric that patients support); this is preferable to measuring an average change score, as NQF #2653 does, which cannot distinguish between providers with mostly average outcomes from providers whose patients either did very well or very poorly. In addition, using a SCB to define the measure outcome ensures that the measure does not penalize clinicians who operate on those patients with the worst baseline pain and function (often those with higher social risk or n on-white race). 3. NQF Measure #2653 uses an average change score adjusted for the baseline PROM score this fundamentally equates to measuring post-operative PROM scores, which may incentivize surgeons to operate on those with the least severe symptoms at baseline and potentially avoid patients with the most severe pain and functional limitations at baseline. This would likely result in worsening disparities over time. 4. This PRO-PM uses a more robust and stakeholder-driven risk model and methodology to address non-response bias, anticipated to produce a measure with greater face validity with stakeholders. Specifically, this measure includes key clinical risk variables for a PRO-PM identified by clinical experts and supported by orthopedic professional societies, such as health literacy, back pain, and contralateral leg pain. These ensure accurate assessment of the index THA/TKA procedure and account for concomitant comorbidities such as chronic back or contralateral joint disease that can interfere with PROM interpretation. In addition, this measure accounts for non-response bias. We have seen no evidence of NQF #2653 analytically addressing non-response bias. Non-response bias is a critical potential threat to the validity of PRO-PMs and failure to account for it may lead to worsening disparities. How will this measure add value to the CMS program? CMS has recently allowed elective primary THA and TKA procedures to be performed in both the HOP D and ASC setting; CMS removed both procedures from the inpatient-only (IPO) list and added them to the ASC Covered Procedures List (CPL): TKA was removed from the IPO for CY 2018 and added to the ASC CPL in CY2020; THA was removed from the IPO for CY 2020 and added to the ASC CPL in CY2021. Between April 1, 2018 and March 30, 2021, there were about 330,000 THA and TKA procedures performed in the outpatient (HOPD setting). In addition, after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, outpatient procedures for both THA and TKA procedures outnumbered inpatient procedures; as of September 2021, inpatient THA/TKA volume was about 30 percent lower than in April of 2020. These trends are expected to continue. Given the proportion of THA/TKA procedures that are moving the Top of Document PAGE 322 \u00b7 Cross-Program Measures | Risk-Standardized Patient-Reported Outcomes Following Elective Primary Total Hip and/or Total Knee Arthroplasty (THA/TKA PRO-PM) in the HOPD or ASC Setting outpatient setting, this measure fills a gap by measuring performance at the HOPD/ASC facility level (in the HOQR and ASCQR programs, respectively.

Claims;Other: Hospital Quality Reporting (HQR) tool Stratification No Feasibility of Data Elements Some data elements are in defined fields in electronic sources Feasibility Assessment The primary data source for development and testing of this measure was patient-reported outcome data collected with PROM instruments and additional patient and provider-reported risk variable data collected through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) payment model. This model is an ongoing proof of concept among participating hospitals for broad, prospective collection of PRO data, implementing real-world data collection and data submission for centralization, risk adjustment and measure calculation. Feasibility is an NQF criteria; there are two other versions of this measure (both capture inpatient procedures) one at the hospital level which is NQF endorsed (NQF 3559), and one at the clinician level (NQF 3639) which has been recommended for endorsement by NQFs Surgery Standing Committee (the measure is currently in public comment). NQF 3559 received a moderate rating for feasibility; NQF 3639 received a high rating. In addition, during data collection for CJR, some hospitals inadvertently submitted data on procedures for HOPDs, therefore demonstrating the feasibility of implementing this measure in HOQR. The same data fields would be collected from ASC facilities.

We also provide preliminary results for HOPDs in the form of pre-procedural PROM results which are predictive of meeting the threshold of improvement. We note that the hospital-level measure is NQF endorsed, and passed the evaluation criteria of performance gap this is also true of the clinician group/clinician level measure. The distribution of performance for the clinician level measure is provided in Attachment 1. Inpatient Top of Document PAGE 323 \u00b7 Cross-Program Measures | Risk-Standardized Patient-Reported Outcomes Following Elective Primary Total Hip and/or Total Knee Arthroplasty (THA/TKA PRO-PM) in the HOPD or ASC Setting Procedure Results (hospital-level): In 123 hospitals with at differences least 25 THA/TKA patients with complete PRO data in the measurement period, we found variation in RSIRs suggesting meaningful in performance measure scores across hospitals. The mean risk-standardized improvement rate (representing the risk-standardized percentage of patients achieving substantial clinical benefit improvement) across hospitals was 60.16% with a standard deviation of 19.58. The minimum hospital RSIR was 6.65% and the maximum hospital RSIR was 86.84%. The interquartile range (54.36, 72.51%) represents a difference of 18 percentage points, and the difference between the 10th and 90th percentiles (20.94% and 78.85%, respectively) is just shy of 58 percentage points. This variation indicates an important quality gap among hospitals measured. Variation in hospital performance was also evaluated by calculating the median odds ratio (OR) for all hospitals in the dataset (n=238). The median OR represents the median increase in odds of the patient outcome (substantial clinical benefit improvement in PROM score from preoperative to postoperative assessment) if a procedure on a single patient was performed by a higher performing hospital compared to a lower performing hospital. It is calculated by taking all possible combinations of hospitals always comparing the higher performing hospitals to the lower performing hospitals. The median OR is interpreted as a traditional odds ratio would be. Results suggest significant and substantial increases in the likelihood of substantial clinical benefit improvement by higher performing hospitals compared to lower performing hospitals. At the hospital level, the median OR value indicates that a patient is 3.44 times more likely to achieve substantial clinical benefit improvement if their elective primary THA/TKA procedure was performed by a higher performing hospital than by a lower performing hospital. Pre-procedure results (HOPD- performed procedures): In the Performance Year 5 reporting for CMMIs Comprehensive Joint Replacement (CJR) model, 82 facilities reported 1,351 procedures (matched to claims) performed in the HOPD setting; 21 of the 82 HOPDs have >=25 cases. At the patient level, mean pre-procedure PROM scores were 47.9 (SD, 14.1); the median was 47.5 (IQR: 39.9-57.1). This suggests that about 50%-60% of the patients in this dataset will experience an improvement in PROM scores that meet the current criteria for substantial clinical benefit improvement. Among the 82 facilities, the range of pre-procedure PROM scores was 28.1-86.7 with a mean of 49.0 (SD 9.34); the median was 49.0 (IQR: 44.1-53.5). We note that this is preliminary (pre-procedure) data on a limited set of facilities. We expect a wider distribution when data is collected more broadly.

THAs and TKAs are common surgeries among Medicare beneficiaries, with Medicare direct payments to hospitals for THA/TKA exceeding $15 billion annually (Miller et al., 2011). Between April 1, 2017 to October 2, 2019, there were 786,830 THA and TKA procedures performed in the inpatient setting for Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries 65 years and older (DeBuhr et al., 2021). For the US population as a whole, some project that annual THA and TKA procedures performed will reach nearly 2 million by 2030 (Lopez et al., 2020). CMS has recently allowed elective primary THA and TKA procedures to be performed in both the HOPD and ASC setting; CMS removed both procedures from the inpatient- only (IPO) list and added them to the ASC Covered Procedures List (CPL): TKA was removed from the IPO for CY 2018 and added to the ASC CPL in CY2020; THA was removed from the IPO for CY 2020 and added to the ASC CPL in CY2021. Based on claims analyses performed by the developer (Yale/CORE) on Medicare Fee For Service claims, between April 1, 2018 and March 30, 2021 , there were about 330,000 THA and TKA procedures performed in the outpatient (HOPD setting). In addition, after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, outpatient procedures for both THA and TKA procedures outnumbered inpatient procedures; as of September 2021, inpatient THA/TKA volume was about 30 percent lower than in April of 2020. These trends are expected to continue. Given the proportion of THA/TKA procedures that are moving the outpatient setting, this measure fills a gap by measuring performance at the HOPD/ASC facility level. THA/TKAs are important, effective procedures performed on a broad population, and the patient- reported outcomes for these procedures (for example, pain, mobility, and quality of life) can be measured in a scientifically sound way (Alviar et al., 2011 [a]; Alviar et al., 2011 [b]; Bauman et al., 2007; Collins & Roos, 2012; Jones et al., 2007; al., 2011; Thorborg et al., 2010; White & Master, 2016) and are influenced by a range of improvements across the full spectrum of care. THA/TKA provides a suitable environment for optimizing care, as there are many studies indicating how providers can improve outcomes of the patients by addressing aspects of pre-, peri-, and postoperative care (Brown et al., 2012; Choong et al., 2009; Galea et al., 2008; et Moffet et al., 2004; Monticone et al., 2013; Walters, 2016). Optimal clinical outcomes depend not just on the surgeon performing the procedure, but also on: the entirety of the team's efforts in the care of the patient; care coordination across provider groups and specialties; and the patients' engagement in their recovery (Feng et al, 2018; Saufl et al, 2007). Even the best surgeon will not get outstanding results if there are gaps in the quality of care provided by others caring for the patient before, during, and/or after surgery. The goal of facility-level outcome measurement is to capture the full spectrum of care to incentivize collaboration and shared responsibility for improving patients' health and reducing the burden of their disease. Name evidence type Patient Workgroup feedback Top of Document PAGE 326 \u00b7 Cross-Program Measures | Risk-Standardized Patient-Reported Outcomes Following Elective Primary Total Hip and/or Total Knee Arthroplasty (THA/TKA PRO-PM) in the HOPD or ASC Setting Summarize the evidence Patients who have undergone a THA or TKA have been engaged for input on measure development through participation on the Technical Expert Panel (TEP) and through a Patient Working Group assembled with assistance from the National Partnership for Women and Families in 2018. Overall, five patients (two males and three females) have provided input through TEP participation: two patients participated in four TEP meetings in 2013 and 2014; they were unavailable to continue participation when the TEP was reconvened in 2018, and two new patients participated in two TEP meetings in 2018 and 2019; and a fifth patient participated in the final TEP meeting in 2020 when one of two prior patients could not continue. The Patient Working Group consisted of five females and one male who have undergone at least one hip and/or knee replacement and were distinct from those who participated in the TEP. These patients were convened for three meetings, one in July 2018, one in February 2019, and one in February 2020. Additional input was sought from both the TEP and the Patient Working Group through online surveys following some of their meetings. Feedback from patients on both the TEP and the Patient Working Group indicate strong support for a patient reported outcomes-based performance measure following primary elective THA and TKA. Patients stated that they expect a significant amount of improvement in both pain level and functional status following a THA/TKA procedure and felt this was an extremely important aspect of care to be captured in this measure. Patients also noted that their surgical experience positively impacted not only their physical health, but their quality of life as well. Patients in the Patient Working Group supported a measure cohort that combined THA and TKA patients, while two patients on the TEP expressed some concern about differing postoperative recovery for hips and knees. All patients supported the risk model and accounting for social risk factors in an analytic approach to non-response bias. Patients expressed a desire to see measure results that reflect physician-level performance but agreed that a hospital-level measure is a good way to encourage communication across providers to improve coordination of care at a facility overall.

Because the risk model was developed based on clinical input (and not empirically) and because patients undergoing joint replacement in the outpatient settings are known to have the same risk factors, the model is expected to perform similarly on patients who undergo procedures in the outpatient setting. We note that CMS will have the opportunity to re-evaluate the model during a likely period of voluntary reporting, however we expect the model to work as robustly for procedures performed in the outpatient setting. Discrimination statistics: The calculated c-statistic was 0.68 using the Development Dataset and 0.69 using the Validation Dataset and indicates adequate model discrimination across the cohort models. With both the Development and Validation Datasets, the model indicated a wide range between the lowest decile and highest decile, indicating the ability to distinguish high-risk subjects from low-risk subjects. Calibration statistics (\u00ce\u00b30, \u00ce\u00b31): The calibration values which are consistently close to 0 at one end and close to 1 at the other end indicates good calibration of the model. If the \u00ce\u00b30 in the model performance using Validation data is substantially far from zero and the \u00ce\u00b31 is substantially far from 1, there is potential evidence of overfitting. The calibration values of close to zero at one end and close to 1 on the other end indicates good calibration of the model between the Development and Validation Datasets. Risk Decile Plots : Higher deciles of the predicted outcomes are associated with higher observed outcomes, which Top of Document PAGE 328 \u00b7 Cross-Program Measures | Risk-Standardized Patient-Reported Outcomes Following Elective Primary Total Hip and/or Total Knee Arthroplasty (THA/TKA PRO-PM) in the HOPD or ASC Setting show a good calibration of the model. This plot indicates good discrimination of the model and good predictive ability Response Bias Analysis: Potential non-response bias due to non-response of PROs was addressed using stabilized inverse probability weighting, created with a multinomial logistic regression to calculate stabilized inverse probability weights. Due to the voluntary nature of PRO data and because PRO data are unlikely to be missing at random, we understand that accounting for potential non-response bias is important for this measure. All eligible THA/TKA procedures performed during the measurement period at the 238 hospitals submitting complete PRO and risk variable data during the measurement period among 1,254 clinicians and 526 clinician groups with at least one of these procedures were identified via CMS claims data. These were categorized into one of three PRO response groups (complete PRO submission, incomplete PRO submission, and no response). Variables associated with unit non-response were identified in the data and through a literature review. Propensity scores were calculated using a multinomial logistic regression where the outcome was 1) complete PRO submission, 2) incomplete PRO submission, and 3) no response. Stabilized Inverse Probability Weights (IPW) were calculated for each of the three groups and incorporated into the hierarchical risk-adjustment model for SCB improvement following elective primary THA/TKA and used in calculation of the risk-adjusted and bias-adjusted RSIRs. Incorporating the stabilized weights in the calculation of the RSIRs helps to reduce bias due to non-response by giving higher weight to patients who were less likely to respond and deflating the weight of patients who were more likely to respond based on patient characteristics. Weighting the responders based on their likelihood of response, given their patient characteristics, helps reduce non-response bias in our RSIR measure. The comparison of RSIRs for risk-adjusted model of SCB improvement with stabilized inverse probability weighting and without stabilized inverse probability weighting revealed only a small impact on the measure results of adjusting for potential non-response. However, we expect that non-response bias will be a factor for the THA/TKA PRO-PM, due to associations with non-response including socioeconomic status and health status. We therefore retained response bias adjustment within the measure specifications.

Empiric Validity: Sample size 123 Empiric Validity: Statistical result 00000 Empiric Validity: Methods and findings To assess empirical measure score validity, we compared the THA/TKA PRO-PM risk-standardized improvement rates (RSIRs) (NQF #1550: level rate (RSCR) following elective primary THA/TKA.) The THA/TKA Complications measure estimates the risk-adjusted rate that patients who have experienced an elective primary THA/TKA experience at least one of eight complications within 90 days of the procedure. The RSCR is categorized into 3 groups: worse than national average, same as national average, and better than national average. We hypothesized that hospitals in the worse than national average category would have lower mean performance on the THA/TKA PRO-PM measure compared with hospitals in the average or better than national average performance categories. Data for the hospital RSCRs from April 1, 2015 to March 31, 2018 were compared to RSIRs for procedures performed July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017. We examined the distribution of THA/TKA PRO-PM RSIRs by THA/TKA RSCR national categories within hospitals submitting complete PRO data for at least 25 THA/TKA procedures: Hospitals worse than national average (those with higher complication rates), Hospitals the same as national average, and Hospitals better than national average (those with lower complication rates). Comparison of THA/TKA PRO-PM RSIRs to RSCR categories indicated an increasing monotonic trend. Those hospitals in the RSCR Worse than National Average category had lower median RSIRs (51.87%) than the median RSIR (66.49%) of hospitals in the \"RSCR Same as National Average\" category, which is lower than that of hospitals in the \"RSCR Better than National Average\" category (71.13%). The hospitals with lower risk- Top of Document PAGE 332 \u00b7 Cross-Program Measures | Risk-Standardized Patient-Reported Outcomes Following Elective Primary Total Hip and/or Total Knee Arthroplasty (THA/TKA PRO-PM) in the HOPD or ASC Setting adjusted complication rates had higher risk-adjusted THA/TKA improvement rates. As these outcomes are not clinically expected to be perfectly correlated but do reflect hospital-level care and processes impacting quality of care for patients experiencing elective primary THA/TKA surgery, we interpret the increasing monotonic trend between RSIRs and RSCR national categories as reflective of empiric measure validity.

Sample Size 2291 Statistic Name Other (enter here):: Pearson separation reliability Statistical Results .84 Interpretation of results The reliability results from the literature demonstrate that the HOOS, JR and the KOOS, JR PROM instruments are sufficiently reliable and exceed accepted norms for reliability testing. The results assessing internal consistency indicated person separation reliability of 0.86 - 0.87 for the HOOS, JR (Lyman et al., 2016a) and 0.84-0.85 for the KOOS, JR (Lyman et al., 2016b). Values above 0.7 indicate the ability of the instruments to differentiate patients with varying levels of pain and functioning, which in turn provides evidence of good internal consistency. Test-retest reliability was not tested by developers of the HOOS, JR as it had already been tested in the Hip dysfunction and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS) in several validation studies (Klassbo et al, 2003; 2011). (ICCs) were used to determine test- retest reproducibility and ranged from 0.75 to 0.97 in the validation studies. Specifically, the Pain and Activity of Daily Living domains, from which HOOS, JR pain and functioning questions are drawn, had ICCs of 0.83 - 0.89 (Pain sub-scale) and 0.86 - 0.94 (Activity of Daily Living sub-scale). Test-retest To p of Document PAGE 333 \u00b7 Cross-Program Measures | Risk-Standardized Patient-Reported Outcomes Following Elective Primary Total Hip and/or Total Knee Arthroplasty (THA/TKA PRO-PM) in the HOPD or ASC Setting reliability was also not tested by developers of the KOOS, JR as it had already been tested in the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) (Roos et al, 1998). Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to determine test-retest reproducibility and ranged from 0.75 to 0.93. Specifically, the Pain, Activity of Daily Living and Symptom domains, from which KOOS, JR pain, functioning and stiffness questions are drawn, had ICCs of 0.85 (Pain sub- scale), 0.75 (Activity of Daily Living sub-scale), and 0.93 (Symptoms). The validity results from the literature demonstrate that the HOOS, JR and the KOOS, JR PROM instruments are valid and meaningful measures for assessing PROs following THA/TKA procedures. The HOOS, JR and the KOOS, JR showed very high responsiveness, well beyond the 0.8 standardized response mean value considered very large (Steiner et al., 2003). Spearman correlation values between the HOOS, JR and the HOOS domains from which the HOOS, JR questions were drawn (Pain and Activity of Daily Living domains) were high; likewise, Spearman correlation values between the KOOS, JR and the KOOS Pain and Activity of Daily Living domains were high, and were moderate between the KOOS, JR and the Symptom domain. Floor effects were small; ceiling effects for the HOOS, JR were 37% 46%, but were comparable to or better than HOOS domains and the WOMAC (Lyman et al., 2016a).

N/A Number of systematic reviews that inform this measure concept 99999 Briefly summarize the peer-reviewed systematic review(s) that inform this measure concept Significant and persistent inequities in health care outcomes exist in the United States. Belonging to a racial or ethnic minority group, living with a disability, being a member of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) community, living in a rural area, or being near or below the poverty level, is often associated with worse health outcomes.[1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8] Numerous studies have shown that among Medicare beneficiaries, racial and ethnic minority individuals often receive lower quality of hospital care, report lower experiences of care, and experience more frequent hospital readmissions and procedural complications. [9],[10],[11],[12],[13],[14] Readmission rates for the most common conditions in the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program are higher for black Medicare beneficiaries and higher for Hispanic Medicare beneficiaries with Congestive Heart Failure and Acute Myocardial Infarction.[15],[16],[17],[18],[19] To ensure that all patients receive excellent care when hospitalized regardless of their individual characteristics, strong and committed leadership from hospital executives and board members is essential. Publications from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and The Joint Commission identify the important role of hospital leadership in promoting a culture of quality and safety.[20],[21] Studies have shown that interventions taken by hospital leadership can positively influence culture[22] and that health care organizational culture can translate into better quality outcomes and experience of care. [23] ,[24],[25] A 2013 systematic review of 122 published studies found an association between hospital board composition and processes and high- performance.[26] Health disparities are evidence that high quality care has not been delivered equally to all patients. Studies from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement identified five core features of health care organizations that make health equity a core strategy, including making health equity a leader-driven priority and developing structures and processes that support equity.[27] This measure aligns with the National Quality Forum strategic goal of advancing health equity and addressing disparities.[28] The five questions of the structural measures are adapted from the CMS Office of Minority Health, Building an Organizational Response to Health Disparities[29] framework for helping health care organizations build a response to health disparities through focus on data collection, data analysis, culture of equity, and quality improvement. 1.

Numerator The numerator consists of the number of patients admitted for an inpatient facility stay or that have received established care in the case of dialysis facilities, who are 18 years or older on the date of admission, who were screened for all five HSRNs, and who screen positive for having a need in one or more of the following five HRSNs (calculated separately): Food insecurity, housing instability, transportation needs, utility difficulties or interpersonal safety. Numerator Exclusions N/A Denominator The denominator consists of the number of patients admitted for an inpatient facility stay or that have received established care in the case of dialysis facilities who are 18 years or older on the date of admission and are screened for all five HSRNs (food insecurity, housing instability, transportation needs, utility difficulties and interpersonal safety). Denominator Exclusions The following patients would be excluded from the denominator: (1) Patients who opt-out of screening; and (2) patients who are themselves unable to complete the screening during their inpatient stay or during established care in the case of dialysis facilities and have no legal guardian or caregiver able to do so on the patient's behalf during their inpatient stay or during established care in the case of dialysis facilities.

The screening tool data can be electronically collected and recorded; therefore all of these data points should be available to providers for reporting. The screening tool has been in use in 21 states across the US, with nearly one million patients screened. Some data elements are in defined fields in electronic sources; Patient/family-reported information: electronic; Patient/family-reported information: paper SDOH screening and data collection is already occurring at scale throughout the sector: Pre-COVID JAMA study found that 24% of hospitals and 16% of physician practices are already screening for all 5 SDOH domains and 92% of hospitals and 66% of physician practices are screening for one or more of the 5 SDOH domains specified in the measures.

Other public and private organizations such as ASPE, NQF and NCQA have identified this A potential unintended consequence of the measure is that health systems and facilities will not be equipped to act on it due, in part, to the lack of community resources. This challenge was noted as a primary barrier to connecting beneficiaries to resources in the AHC Year 1 evaluation. There is a well- documented and well-tested catalog of additional tools, infrastructure, and investments that can be implemented to support practices in acting on this measure.

Reviews have collected numerous studies identifying a causal relationship between poor health outcomes and homelessness (2) food insecurity (3), and other needs screened for by the tool cited in this measure (4). The process of screening itself is consistent with guidance promulgated by the American Academy of Pediatrics (5), The American Academy of Family Practitioners (6), and guidance by the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) (7) as well as a recommendation/clinical guideline from USPSTF. USPSTF concludes that screening for intimate partner violence (IPV) in women of reproductive age and providing or referring women who screen positive to ongoing support services has a moderate net benefit. The USPSTF notes there is evidence that available tools accurately identify interpersonal violence experienced by women. This recommendation is based on a systematic review of the evidence, including 3 randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing IPV screening with brief intervention and information on referral options with no screening and 2 RCTs that reported no harm in screening. The review also examined 15 studies assessing the accuracy of screening tools. (8) This clinical guideline supports screening for interpersonal safety, which is one of five social domains included in this measure.

What evidence grading system did the guideline use to describe strength of recommendation? USPSTF List all categories and corresponding definitions for the evidence grading system used to describe strength of recommendation in the guideline? A: The USPSTF recommends the service. There is high certainty that the net benefit is substantial. B: The USPSTF recommends the service. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate and there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial. C: The USPSTF recommends selectively offering or providing this service to individual patients based on professional judgment and patient preferences. There is at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small. D:The USPSTF recommends against the service. There is moderate to high certainty that the service has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits. I: The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is Top of Document PAGE 358 \u00b7 Cross-Program Measures | Screen Positive Rate for Social Drivers of Health insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. For the guideline statement that most closely aligns with the measure concept, what is the associated strength of recommendation? USPSTF Grade B or D, Moderate recommendation or similar What evidence grading system did the guideline use to describe level of evidence or level of certainty in the evidence? USPSTF List all categories and corresponding definitions for the evidence grading system used to describe level of evidence or level of certainty in the evidence? High: The available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative primary care populations. These studies assess the effects of the prevention service on health outcomes. This conclusion is therefore likely to be strongly affected by the results of future studies. Moderate: The available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate is constrained by such factors as: - The number, size, and quality of individual studies. - Inconsistency of findings across individual studies. - Limited generalizability of findings to routine primary care practice. - Lack of coherence in the chain of evidence. As more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large enough to alter the conclusion. Low: The available evidence is insufficient to assess the effects on health outcomes. Evidence is insufficient because of: - The limited number of size of studies. - Important flaws in study design or methods. - Inconsistency of findings across individual studies. - Gaps in the chain of evidence. - Findings not generalizable to routine primary care practice. - Lack of information on important health outcomes. More information may allow estimation of effects on health outcomes. For the guideline statement that most closely aligns with the measure concept, what is the associated level of evidence or level of certainty in the evidence? Moderate or similar List the guideline statement that most closely aligns with the measure concept.

Using a standard, validated screening tool, AHC has screened nearly 1 million beneficiaries for HRSN in 21 states, with 33% of beneficiaries screened having at least one HRSN. AHC used screening, referral, and navigation data files extracted by NewWave (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services [CMS] Enterprise Portal contractor) and generated by Mathematica Policy Research (the AHC implementation contractor) using data submitted by bridge organizations.

CMMI's Comprehensive Primary Care Plus (CPC+) model reported in 2020 that 86% of ~1,500 Track 1 practices and 99% of ~1,500 Track 2 practices (together serving ~2.4M beneficiaries) are implementing DOH screening. CMMI required that by Program Year 3, Track 2 practices would use an electronic screening tool to assess patients' health-related social needs and store an inventory of resources to meet patients' needs; notably, by Program Year 2, Track 1 practices were as likely as Track 2 practices to report implementing these DOH functions, even absent a requirement that they do so. Source: https://innovation.cms.gov/data-and-reports/2020/cpc-evaluation-annual-report-2 Likewise, annual evaluations of other current CMMI models, including the State Innovation Model and Next Generation ACOs, report that participants are investing in staffing and infrastructure to conduct DOH screening and navigation. The 2021 Comprehensive End-Stage Renal Disease Care Model evaluation, for example, reported that [m]any beneficiaries are protein malnourished and don't eat enough fresh produce. Some beneficiaries go to the hospital to get meals. ESRD Seamless Care Organizations have begun to monitor food insecurity and provide food gift cards to both low-income beneficiaries and those above the poverty level, to address beneficiaries' non-adherence to nutritional guidelines and reduce the risk of increased utilization and costs.

See https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/ahcm-screening- tool-citation . Due to variability across facility settings and the populations they serve, we are proposing to allow facilities flexibility with selection of tools to screen patients for food insecurity, housing instability, transportation needs, utility difficulties, and interpersonal safety. Potential sources of these data could include, for example, administrative claims data, electronic clinical data, standardized patient assessments, or patient-reported data and surveys. Multiple screening tools exist, and many facilities already have screening tools integrated into their electronic health records (EHRs). We suggest facilities refer to the Social Interventions Research and Evaluation Network (SIREN) website, for example, for comprehensive information about the most widely used HRSN screening tools.1,2 SIREN contains descriptions of the content and characteristics of various tools, including information about intended populations, completion time, and number of questions.

In 2021, 21% of Black individuals are projected to experience food insecurity experience food insecurity, compared to 11% of white individuals. Likewise, 22% of Asian, 22% of Black, and 20% of Latino renters are not caught up on rent, compared to 9% of white renters. Secretary Becerra has pledged to take a department-wide approach to the advancement of equity, consistent with President Biden's charge to federal departments and agencies, and this would include examination of ways to address the social determinants of health. In particular, he has noted the importance of collecting more robust DOH data to address the disparities exposed by COVID-19 and leveraging the data and experience from the CMMI Accountable Health Community (AHC) model, which has screened nearly one million beneficiaries. CMS has recognized the importance of making DOH measures standard across programs, identifying the development and implementation of measures that reflect social and economic determinants as a key priority and measurement gap to be addressed through Meaningful Measures 2.0. A growing set of constituencies have called on CMS to provide leadership in measuring and addressing DOH, citing various rationales for doing so. Healthcare experts have increasingly recognized that equity is unachievable without addressing DOH, calling for CMS to require program participants to uniformly screen for and document drivers of health and build DOH measures into MIPS and all APMs. The Health Care Payment Learning & Action Network (LAN), a group of public and private health care leaders providing thought leadership, strategic direction, and ongoing support to accelerate adoption of APMs has identified promoting equity and addressing DOH as key facets of APM resiliency. Likewise, physicians and other providers have called on CMS to create standard patient-level DOH measures beyond socioeconomic status (SES), hierarchical condition category (HCC) score, or duals status, recognizing that these risk factors transcend Top of Document PAGE 368 \u00b7 Cross-Program Measures | Screen Positive Rate for Social Drivers of Health specific subpopulations; drive demand for healthcare services; escalate physician burnout; and penalize physicians caring for those patients via worse Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) scores. 369 \u00b7 Cross-Program Measures | Screening for Social Drivers of Health MUC2022- 053 Screening for Social Drivers of Health Program End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Quality Incentive Program; Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Quality Reporting Program; Prospective Payment System-Exempt Cancer Hospital Quality Reporting Program Section 1: Measure Information Measure Specifications and Endorsement Status Measure Description The Screening for Social Drivers of Health measure assesses the total number of patients, aged 18 years and older, screened for social risk factors (specifically, food insecurity, housing instability, transportation needs, utility difficulties, and interpersonal safety) during an inpatient facility stay, or during established care in the case of dialysis facilities. The measure cohort includes patients who are admitted to an inpatient facility or who have established care in the case of dialysis facilities and are 18 years or older on the date of admission or on the date of established care in the case of dialysis facilities. Numerator Number of patients admitted to an inpatient facility stay or who have established care in the case of dialysis facilities, who are 18 years or older on the date of admission or date of established care in the case of dialysis facilities and are screened for all of the following five HRSNs: Food insecurity, housing instability, transportation needs, utility difficulties, and interpersonal safety during their facility stay or during established care in the case of dialysis facilities.

Web interface Stratification No Feasibility of Data Elements Some data elements are in defined fields in electronic sources Feasibility Assessment To report the measure, providers must collect the total number of patients and the number of patients who were screened for all five elements; the only demographic information needed is patient age. The screening tool data can be electronically collected and recorded; therefore all of these data points should be available to providers for reporting. The screening tool has been in use in 21 states across the US, with nearly one million patients screened. Some data elements are in defined fields in electronic sources; Patient/family-reported information: electronic; Patient/family-reported information: paper SDOH screening and data collection is already occurring at scale throughout the sector: Pre-COVID JAMA study found that 24% of hospitals and 16% of physician practices are already screening for all 5 SDOH domains and 92% of hospitals and 66% of physician practices are screening for one or more of the 5 SDOH domains specified in the measures.

Other public and private organizations such as ASPE, NQF and NCQA have identified this A potential unintended consequence of the measure is that health systems and facilities will not be equipped to act on it due, in part, to the lack of community resources. This challenge was noted as a primary barrier to connecting beneficiaries to resources in the AHC Year 1 evaluation. There is a well- documented and well-tested catalog of additional tools, infrastructure, and investments that can be implemented to support practices in acting on this measure.

Reviews have collected numerous studies identifying a causal relationship between poor health outcomes and homelessness (2) food insecurity (3), and other needs screened for by the tool cited in this measure (4). The process of screening itself is consistent with guidance promulgated by the American Academy of Pediatrics (5), The American Academy of Family Practitioners (6), and guidance by the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) (7) as well as a recommendation/clinical guideline from USPSTF. USPSTF concludes that screening for intimate partner violence (IPV) in women of reproductive age and providing or referring women who screen positive to ongoing support services has a moderate net benefit. The USPSTF notes there is evidence that available tools accurately identify interpersonal violence experienced by women. This recommendation is based on a systematic review of the evidence, including 3 randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing IPV screening with brief intervention and information on referral options with no screening and 2 RCTs that reported no harm in screening. The review also examined 15 studies assessing the accuracy of screening tools. (8) This clinical guideline supports screening for interpersonal safety, which is one of five social domains included in this measure.(9) Sources: (1)(2) Hood, Carlyn M et al., County Health Rankings: Relationships Between Determinant Factors and Health Outcomes.

Yes List the guideline statement that most closely aligns with the measure concept. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen for interpersonal violence (IPV) in women of reproductive age and provide or refer women who screen positive to ongoing support services. What evidence grading system did the guideline use to describe strength of recommendation?

There is high certainty that the net benefit is substantial. B:The USPSTF recommends the service. There is high certainty that the net benefit is moderate and there is moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial. C:The USPSTF recommends selectively offering or providing this service to individual patients based on professional judgment and patient preferences. There is at least moderate certainty that the net benefit is small. D:The USPSTF recommends against the service. There is moderate to high certainty that the service has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh the benefits. I:The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined. For the guideline statement that most closely aligns with the measure concept, what is the associated strength of recommendation? USPSTF Grade B or D, Moderate recommendation or similar What evidence grading system did the guideline use to describe level of evidence or level of certainty in the evidence? USPSTF Top of Document PAGE 377 \u00b7 Cross-Program Measures | Screening for Social Drivers of Health List all categories and corresponding definitions for the evidence grading system used to describe level of evidence or level of certainty in the evidence? High: The available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative primary care populations. These studies assess the effects of the prevention service on health outcomes. This conclusion is therefore likely to be strongly affected by the results of future studies. Moderate: The available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate is constrained by such factors as: - The number, size, and quality of individual studies. - Inconsistency of findings across individual studies. - Limited generalizability of findings to routine primary care practice. - Lack of coherence in the chain of evidence. As more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large enough to alter the conclusion. Low: The available evidence is insufficient to assess the effects on health outcomes. Evidence is insufficient because of: - The limited number of size of studies. - Important flaws in study design or methods. - Inconsistency of findings across individual studies. - Gaps in the chain of evidence. - Findings not generalizable to routine primary care practice. - Lack of information on important health outcomes. More information may allow estimation of effects on health outcomes. For the guideline statement that most closely aligns with the measure concept, what is the associated level of evidence or level of certainty in the evidence? Moderate or similar List the guideline statement that most closely aligns with the measure concept. The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen for interpersonal violence (IPV) in women of reproductive age and provide or refer women who screen positive to ongoing support services.

Source of empirical data Published, peer-reviewed original research;Published and publicly available reports (e.g., from agencies);Internal data analysis Summarize the empirical data CMS has the opportunity to leverage and apply CMMI's 5+ years of data and experience with AHC. Using a standard, validated screening tool, AHC has screened nearly 1 million beneficiaries for HRSN in 21 states, with 33% of beneficiaries screened having at least one HRSN. AHC used screening, referral, and navigation data files extracted by NewWave (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services [CMS] Enterprise Portal contractor) and generated by Mathematica Policy Research (the AHC implementation contractor) using data submitted by bridge organizations.

CMMI's Comprehensive Primary Care Plus (CPC+) model reported in 2020 that 86% of ~1,500 Track 1 practices and 99% of ~1,500 Track 2 practices (together serving ~2.4M beneficiaries) are implementing DOH screening. CMMI required that by Program Year 3, Track 2 practices would use an electronic screening tool to assess patients' health-related social needs and store an inventory of resources to meet patients' needs; notably, by Program Year 2, Track 1 practices were as likely as Track 2 practices to report implementing these DOH functions, even absent a requirement that they do so. Source: https://innovation.cms.gov/data-and-reports/2020/cpc-evaluation-annual- report-2 Likewise, annual evaluations of other current CMMI models, including the State Innovation Model and Next Generation ACOs, report that participants are investing in staffing and infrastructure to conduct DOH screening and navigation. The 2021 Comprehensive End-Stage Renal Disease Care Model evaluation, for example, reported that \"many beneficiaries are protein malnourished and don't eat enough fresh produce. Some beneficiaries go to the hospital to get meals.\" ESRD Seamless Care Organizations have begun to monitor food insecurity and provide food gift cards to both low-income beneficiaries and those above the poverty level, to address beneficiaries' non-adherence to nutritional guidelines and reduce the risk of increased utilization and costs.

CMS has recognized the importance of making DOH measures standard across programs, identifying the development and implementation of \"measures that reflect social and economic determinants\" as a key priority and measurement gap to be addressed through Meaningful Measures 2.0. A growing set of constituencies have called on CMS to provide leadership in measuring and addressing DOH, citing various rationales for doing so. Healthcare experts have increasingly recognized that equity is unachievable without addressing DOH, calling for CMS to require program \"participants to uniformly screen for and document drivers of health\" and \"build DOH measures into MIPS and all APMs.\" The Health Care Payment Learning & Action Network, a group of public and private health care leaders providing thought leadership, strategic direction, and ongoing support to accelerate adoption of APMs, has identified promoting equity and addressing DOH as key facets of APM resiliency. Likewise, physicians and other providers have called on CMS to create standard patient-level DOH measure, beyond socioeconomic status (SES), hierarchical condition category (HCC) score, or duals status, recognizing that these risk factors transcend specific subpopulations; drive demand for healthcare services; escalate physician burnout; and penalize physicians caring for those patients via worse Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) 387 \u00b7 Cross-Program Measures | Hospital Harm - Pressure Injury MUC2022- 064 Hospital Harm - Pressure Injury Program Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program; Medicare Promoting Interoperability Program for Eligible Hospitals and Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) Section 1: Measure Information Measure Specifications and Endorsement Status Measure Description The proportion of inpatient hospitalizations for patients 18 years of age or older at the start of the encounter, who suffer the harm of developing a new stage 2, stage 3, stage 4, deep tissue, or unstageable pressure injury.

Yes Which measure(s) already in a program is your measure similar to and/or competing with? Patient Safety Indicator 03: Pressure Ulcer Rate (PSI 03) (CMS # 00885) is used in the Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction Program (HACRP) as a component of the NQF #0531: Patient Safety Indicator composite (PSI 90) (CMS # 03282/05537). A recalibrated version of this measure is also used in the Hospital Compare program. NQF #0679 Percent of High-Risk Residents with Pressure Ulcers (Long Stay) (CMS # 04057) and NQF #0678 Percent of Residents or Patients with Pressure Ulcers that are New or Worsened (Short-Stay) (CMS # 04056) are used in the Nursing Home Compare and Nursing Home quality initiative programs. Changes in Skin Integrity Post-Acute Care: Pressure Ulcer/Injury (CMS # 05852/05740/05737/05741) is additionally used in the Nursing Home Compare, Long-Term Care Hospital Compare, Long-Term Care Hospital Quality Reporting, Skilled Nursing Facility Quality Reporting, Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Quality Reporting, Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Compare, Home Health Services Compare, and Home Health Quality Reporting programs. How will this measure be distinguished from other similar and/or competing measures? PSI-03 does not include stage 2 pressure injuries in the outcome, has additional exclusions to the cohort, and uses ICD- 10-CM codes via claims as a data source. Hospital Harm-Pressure Injury measure is an eCQM (EHR data-only), which stakeholders and TEP have noted as a more desirable data source with more face validity for measuring pressure injuries. While there are several measures that target the reduction of hospital-acquired pressure injuries in use in various patient populations, there are no eCQMs intended for use to compare quality across acute care hospitals. The measures NQF# 0679 and #0678 (of the same name) target different post-acute care patient populations and use chart review data from the following sources: Minimum Data Set (MDS)(SNF); Long Term Care Hospitals Continuity Assessment Record and Evaluation (LTCH-CARE) Data set (LTCH); and the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Patient Assessment Instrument (IRF-PAI) Data set (IRF). Additionally, NQF# 0678 measure includes worsening pressure injuries and NQF#0679 population consists of only high-risk patients defined as those who are impaired in bed mobility, comatose, or suffering malnutrition. The new Hospital Harm -Pressure Injury eCQM identifies pressure injuries using direct extraction of structured data from the EHR and will provide hospitals with reliable and timely measurement of their pressure injury rates. As these measures do not apply to the same measured entities, it should not impact data collection burden. Changes in Skin Integrity Post-Acute Care: Pressure Ulcer/Injury only includes specific populations in the denominator (SNF residents/LTCH patients/nursing home residents/home health patients). The method for identifying patients/residents into the numerator is also different than for the other measures and our eCQM. This measure follows the same patients longitudinally to track pressure ulcer development over time, while the proposed measure would use EHR data to retrospectively track pressure injury during hospitalization. Top of Document PAGE 392 \u00b7 Cross Program Measures | Hospital Harm - Pressure Injury How will this measure add value to the CMS program? The Hospital Harm Pressure Injury measure is an eCQM. Therefore, unlike similar measures in use in CMS programs, this measure can be applied to a broader population than Medicare beneficiaries. This Hospital Harm - Pressure Injury measure is an eCQM (EHR data-only), which stakeholders and TEP have noted as a more desirable data source with more face validity for measuring pressure injuries. If this measure is being proposed to meet a statutory requirement, please list the corresponding statute N/A Section 2: Measure Evidence How is the measure expected to be reported to the program? eCQM Stratification No Feasibility of Data Elements ALL data elements are in defined fields in electronic sources Feasibility Assessment To better understand if critical data elements used in the measure are available in a structured format and if the form in which they exist align with measure intent, we designed a web-based questionnaire and distributed the survey to 20 hospitals (3 Epic and 17 Cerner). The survey began with an inquiry into the measure's critical data elements (concepts) and ended with questions on the measure overall. The goal of the survey was to determine, within each hospital's EHR system, if critical data elements are: readily available in a structured format, from an authoritative source and/or highly likely to be correct, coded in a nationally accepted terminology standard or can be mapped to that terminology standard, and routinely collected as part of clinical care and require no or limited additional data entry from a clinician or other providers, and no EHR interface changes are needed. Upon collecting responses, we held debrief meetings with participants to resolve ambiguities. We then conducted an EHR walkthrough with the hospitals to identify the most authoritative location within the record for each data element used within the measure to ensure that their programmed query extracted accordingly. We then translated final responses to numeric values used in the NQF scorecard. Feasibility results were favorable with 18 of 20 hospitals reporting the ability to capture the structured data for all 10 critical measure elements and 5 supplemental data elements. For the data elements Physical Exam, Performed: Pressure Injury Deep Tissue; Physical Exam, Performed: Pressure Injury Stage 2, 3, 4 or Unstageable, we encountered some inconsistencies in workflow and ability to capture the data across the 20 hospitals. 18 of 20 hospitals captured the necessary data in structured fields and required no workflow modifications to obtain staging information. The remaining two hospitals (Epic) captured Top of Document PAGE 393 \u00b7 Cross Program Measures | Hospital Harm - Pressure Injury documentation of PIs in a structured field; however, the staging information required for the measure was only captured in unstructured notes, which precluded those sites from participating in reliability and validity testing. Given that one of 3 Epic hospitals was able to capture PI staging documentation in structured fields, there are no concerns with the vendor system's ability to capture the required data. Modifications to clinical workflow and documentation practices would enable capture of data required to report the eCQM. Method of Measure Calculation eCQM Hybrid measure: Methods of measure calculation N/A Evidence of Performance Gap This safety eCQM captures the number of patients who experience harm in the form of a pressure injury, during their inpatient hospitalization. The incidence of pressure injuries in hospitalized patients has been estimated at 5.4 per 10,000 patient-days and the rate of hospital-acquired pressure injuries has been estimated at 8.4% (Li et al., 2020). Over 50% of reported pressure injuries in hospitals were Stage 2 or higher (Li et al., 2020). Pressure injuries commonly cause local infection, osteomyelitis, anemia, and sepsis (Brem et al., 2010), in addition to causing significant depression, pain, and discomfort to patients (Gunningberg et al., 2011). Pressure injury (defined as any Stage 3, Stage 4, and unstageable pressure ulcers acquired after admission/presentation to a healthcare setting) is considered a serious reportable event by the National Quality Forum (NQF) (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2015). Using the EHR data from 18 hospitals and in year 2020, we found that hospital-level measure performance rates ranged from 0.0% to 2.02% (for every 1,000 qualified hospital admissions there are 20 inpatient encounters where patients suffered Pressure Injury), with a system-wide, weighted average rate equal to 1.06%. Prior studies confirm that significant variation in rates of HAPI exists between hospitals (Rondinelli et al., 2018). It is widely accepted that the risk of developing a pressure injury can be reduced through best practices. Hospital controlled factors that have been found to be significantly associated with an increase in pressure ulcer risk include infrequent repositioning (p=0.005) and number of days to bed change (OR, 2.89 [95% CI, 1.26-6.63]) (Tayyib, Coyer, and Lewis, 2016; Bly et al., 2016). High nursing workload has additionally been found to reduce risk of pressure ulcers (OR, 0.916 [95% CI, 0.855-0.980]; p=0.011) (Cremasco et al., 2013). Systematically measuring patients who develop new pressure injuries while in the hospital setting will provide hospitals with a reliable and timely measurement, to more reliably assess harm reduction efforts and modify thei r improvement efforts in near real-time. This eCQM will fill a gap in measurement and provide incentives for hospital quality improvement. Although several pressure injury measures are currently in use, there are no electronic health record (EHR)-based measures intended for use in acute care hospitals. In addition, the intent of this measure is to incentivize greater achievements in reducing harms and enhance hospital performance on patient safety outcomes.

However, CMS is committed to monitoring this eCQM's use and assessing potential unintended consequences over time, such as the inappropriate shifting of care, and other negative unintended consequences for patients. Potential unintended consequences of the Hospital Harm Pressure Injury measure include efforts that hospitals may undertake to improve performance on the measure that may create other adverse outcomes for patients. One potential unintended consequence of the measure is increased turning of certain high-risk patients in order to reduce risk of pressure injury. Increasing incentives to increase turning of patients who are at a greater risk for complications (e.g., respiratory complications, ventilator management, dislodged lines) could increase the risk of these complications. Number of clinical guidelines, including USPSTF guidelines, that address this measure topic 2 Outline the clinical guidelines supporting this measure Two recent evidence-based guidelines directly support the measure as follows: Top of Document PAGE 395 \u00b7 Cross Program Measures | Hospital Harm - Pressure Injury The European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel, National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel and Pan Pacific Pressure Injury Alliance (Prevention and Treatment of Pressure Ulcers/Injuries: Clinical Practice Guideline. The International Guideline. EPUAP/NPIAP/PPPIA:2019) The American College of Physicians (ACP) (Risk Assessment and Prevention of Pressure Ulcers: A Clinical Practice Guideline From the American College of Physicians. ACP: 2015) The EPUAP/NPIAP/PPPIA Clinical Practice Guideline (2019 edition) was developed as a collaboration between the Partner Organizations European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP), National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel (NPIAP) and the Pan Pacific Pressure Injury Alliance (PPPIA). It provides 114 evidence-based recommendations supported by a thorough review of the relevant research. The guideline is intended to apply to all clinical settings, including acute care, rehabilitation care, long term care, assisted living at home, and unless specifically stated, can be considered appropriate for all individuals with or at risk of pressure injuries. It focuses on specific evidence-based recommendations for prevention of pressure injuries through risk assessment, assessment of skin and tissue, preventive skin care, reducing progression through treatment of pressure injuries including nutrition, repositioning and early mobilization, heel pressure injuries, support surfaces and device related pressure injuries, pressure injury classification and treatment modalities. In order to develop this guideline, a comprehensive literature review was conducted on pressure injury prevention and treatment and a rigorous methodology was used to appraise the research and make evidence-based recommendations. The research evidence was summarized and evaluated using evidence- to-decision frameworks. Where sufficient research evidence was available, recommendations to guide clinical practice were developed. In areas without sufficient research, good practice statements were developed to promote comprehensive care. There were 699 health professionals, industry representatives, peak body organizations, researchers, policy makers, patient consumers, and informal caregivers who reviewed and/or commented on the document. The guideline includes discussion of the science, followed by 114 recommendations and 62 good practice statements to guide practice in risk assessment, pressure injury prevention and treatment, and issues in implementing best practice. This is the most recent set of clinical practice guidelines applicable to the measure topic and developed by American national and international healthcare professional organizations. They were graded as described in sections 110 through 112. The primary clinical guideline described in section 108 below was based on 21 cited studies. Two studies provided evidence to support a recommendation to implement structured skin care regimen that includes regular cleansing (particularly after episodes of incontinence). A low quality Level 2 study found that a structured hygiene program was associated with a lower incidence of pressure injuries than standard care. A low quality level 4 observational study noted that skin was assessed as being healed or healing when a structured skin care regimen was implemented. A moderate quality Level 1 study reported significant reductions in erythema and broken skin when a pH-balanced (pH 5.5) foam cleanser was used, as compared to standard hospital soap. The structured skin care regimen reported in the low quality level 2 study also included replacing soap with a pH balanced (pH not reported) foam cleanser.

By correlating hospital performance in PI with their performance in the independently collected and NQF-endorsed measures that share a similar conceptual framework regarding how safe care is produced and defined, we assessed measure score level validity using the correlation coefficient that ranges from 0 to 1. Empiric Validity: Sample size 18 Empiric Validity: Statistical result -0.68 Empiric Validity: Methods and findings Convergent validity is a concept that refers to if multiple measures of an underlying same concept are positively correlated. For this exercise, we collected pilot sites' patient safety outcome from a set of related measures (e.g., healthcare associated infections and nursing care) in Hospital Care Compare (data.cms.gov) and estimated the Spearman's rank correlation coefficients between HH PI and each of the related measures at the hospital level. Positive (or negative, pending context) correlations then To p of Document PAGE 404 \u00b7 Cross Program Measures | Hospital Harm - Pressure Injury provide support for the score level validity as they document a similar quality construct of patient safety. Given that PI is nursing care sensitive, we hypothesized that there will be an inverse relationship between hospital performance in PI and patients' rating of hospital care around nursing (e.g., nurse communication, staff responsiveness, etc.) Using Hospital Compare Data from data.cms.gov, the Spearman rank correlation between pilot sites' PI scores and 12 quality measures reflecting patients' perspectives of hospital care provide evidence for moderate measure construct validity. For example, higher rate of PI is inversely related to patients' perspective of hospital care, such as nurse communications, staff responsiveness, discharge information, and overall rating of hospital care. In row 41 (Empiric Validity: Statistical result), we report the rank correlation between our PI measure and the HCAHPS measure about staff responsiveness (H-COMP-3- STAR- RATING extracted from Hospital Compare at data.cms.gov). We provide a full list of measures for which we calculated Spearman's rank correlation coefficients in Tables 7-8 (Section 3) of the 2022 MUC List Attachment: Pressure Injury.

Top of Document PAGE 405 \u00b7 Cross Program Measures | Hospital Harm - Pressure Injury The minimum Kappa (0.8) occurred to one measure critical data element and the disagreement happened in one pilot site. Kappas for the remaining critical data elements are no less than 0.9 and generally equal to 1.0. The modes of PPV and sensitivity are 1.0 (or 100%) even if the lowest value is 0.97 and 0.98, respectively. Across the 18 pilot sites, measure denominator ranged from 553 to 38,476 qualified inpatient encounters and measure rate ranged from zero to a high of 2.02 per 100 qualified inpatient encounters. The wide variability indicates ample room for quality improvement in hospital inpatient setting. Exhibit 1 (Section 3) 2022 MUC List Attachment: Pressure Injury translates the distribution of observed measure rate and its 95% confidence interval into a histogram and further displays the overall weighted average measure rate (green dashed horizontal line). Testing data showed that several hospitals' performance rates are consistently below the overall mean, while a few others are above that mean. Comparing to the variation in measure performance rates, variation in Kappa, PPV, and sensitivity is much more limited. The minimum Kappa equals 0.8, but the second smallest Kappa has reached 0.91, which denotes very strong concordance. The minimum PPV equals 0.97 and the second smallest PPV equals 0.98. The median and mode of PPV are both 1.0. The minimum sensitivity equals 0.98 and the second smallest sensitivity equals 1.0. The median and mode of sensitivity are both 1.0. Limited variation substantiates the conclusion that the measure has strong data element-level reliability and validity. In Tables 9-14 (Section 3) of the 2022 MUC List Attachment: Pressure Injury we provide the list of data elements tested, along with their percent agreement, Kappa, or PPV and sensitivity.

Numerator The numerator for this measure consists of the cumulative number of HCP in the denominator population who are considered up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines. Facilities should refer to the definition of up to date as of the first day of the quarter. https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/pdfs/hps/covidvax/UpToDateGuidance-May2022-508.pdf As of April 1, 2022, up to date includes: 1. Individuals who received their second dose in a two-shot primary vaccination series, (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines) less than 5 months ago 2. Individuals who received a J&J/Janssen as their primary vaccination less than 2 months ago 3. Individuals who have received a primary series and one booster dose when recommended. Numerator Exclusions None Denominator The target population is the number of healthcare personnel (HCP) eligible to work in the healthcare facility for at least one day during the one-week data collection reporting period, excluding persons with contraindications to COVID-19 vaccination. This measure includes at least one week of data collection a month for each of the 3 months in a quarter. Top of Document PAGE 408 \u00b7 Cross-Program Measures | COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage among Healthcare Personnel (HCP) (2022 revision) The denominators are reported by aggregating the categories below: There are four categories of HCP: 1. Employees: includes all persons who receive a direct paycheck from the reporting facility (i.e., on the facility's payroll). 2. Licensed independent practitioners (LIPs): This includes physicians (MD, DO), advanced practice nurses, and physician assistants only who are affiliated with the reporting facility who do not receive a direct paycheck from the reporting facility. 3. Adult students/trainees and volunteers: This includes all students/trainees and volunteers aged 18 or over who do not receive a direct paycheck from the reporting facility. 4. Other contract personnel: Facilities may also report on individuals who are contract personnel. However, reporting for this category is optional. Contract personnel are defined as persons providing care, treatment, or services at the facility through contract who do not fall into any of the above-mentioned denominator categories. Denominator Exclusions Denominator-eligible individuals with contraindications to COVID-19 vaccination. Medical contraindications are listed in a vaccine's FDA authorization or labeling and include severe allergic reaction. The current list of contraindications as well as exclusions may be found at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid- 19-vaccines-us.html and includes: 1.

Other: National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) Stratification No Feasibility of Data Elements Some data elements are in defined fields in electronic sources Feasibility Assessment CMS quality reporting programs have already required facilities to report data on COVID-19 vaccination coverage among healthcare personnel (HCP) for primary vaccination. Feasibility of reporting additional/booster doses of vaccine is evident by the proportion of facilities nationwide that have Top of Document PAGE 413 \u00b7 Cross-Program Measures | COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage among Healthcare Personnel (HCP) (2022 revision) already reported vaccination additional/booster coverage data to CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). Even though the deadline to report vaccination coverage data for the first quarter of 2022 is not until August 2022 (except for dialysis and nursing homes which have additional reporting requirements), the proportions of facilities already reporting vaccine coverage data including additional/booster coverage as of May 2022 are: Long Term (LTACs): 90.3 % Skilled Nursing Facilities (SNFs): 99.2% These high reporting rates indicate reporting the measure is feasible. Method of Measure Calculation Other (enter here):: Data Collection: 1. Identify all healthcare personnel (HCP) eligible to work during the selected week. The week always begins on a Monday at 12:00 midnight and ends on Sunday at 11:59 PM. 2. Categorize all eligible HCP into one of four HCP categories (see \"Measure Information\" #012) 3. Among eligible HCP, identify those who are considered up to date with recommended COVID- 19 vaccines. 4. Among eligible HCP who are not considered up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines, identify those who have a contraindication to COVID-19 vaccination. 5. Among eligible HCP who are not considered up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines, and who do not have a contraindication to COVID-19 vaccination, identify those who have refused or declined vaccination. 6. Among eligible HCP are not considered up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines, identify those whose COVID-19 vaccination status cannot be determined. Measure Calculation: The weekly coverage rate is the numerator divided by the denominator (minus exclusions) for a particular week: 1. For each one-week period, tabulate the denominator by summing the number of HCP in each of the categories of HCP minus the number of HCP with contraindications to COVID-19 vaccination. 2. Calculate the weekly COVID-19 up to date vaccination coverage percentage by dividing the number of HCP in the denominator who are considered up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccines by the Top of Document PAGE 414 \u00b7 Cross-Program Measures | COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage among Healthcare Personnel (HCP) (2022 revision) number of HCP in the denominator and multiplying by 100. The measure is reported for a quarter (3-month period). Quarterly up to date COVID-19 vaccination coverage is determined by selecting one weekly coverage rate per month, then averaging 3 weekly coverage rates (one week from each of the 3 months in the quarter). For facilities that report more than one week per month, the latest week of data for the reporting month will be used.

It is now recommended that individuals stay up to date with COVID- 19 vaccination (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay- up-to-date.html ). This revision of measure to include reporting of up to date vaccination is informed by a search of the published literature. There are no published data on the impact of reporting up to date COVID- 19 coverage reporting among healthcare workers; however, the following real-world observational data support the positive impact of COVID-19 vaccination, healthcare personnel vaccination, and additional/booster COVID-19 vaccine. 1. COVID-19 vaccine uptake in the U.S. is associated with reduced COVID-19 incidence and mortality: -Suthar AB, Wang J, Seffren V, et al. Public health impact of covid-19 vaccines in the US: observational study. cross-sectional analysis of US county level surveillance and vaccine administration data from 48 states. It was observed that 10% improvement in vaccination coverage was associated with an 8% reduction in mortality rates and a 7% reduction in incidence. 2. Among U.S. healthcare workers, COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness has been found to be high: Pilishvili T, Gierke R, Fleming-Dutra KE, et al. Effectiveness of mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine among U.S. Health Care Personnel. N Engl J Med 2021 Dec 16;385(25):e90. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa2106599. This was a test-negative case-control study of US healthcare personnel from 25 states conducted from December 2020-May 2021. Vaccine effectiveness against infection was 88.8% (95% 91.8) CI, 91.3 to 98.4) for the mRNA-1273 vaccine. 3. U.S. Healthcare worker COVID-19 vaccination was associated with reduced patient COVID- 19 infections and deaths: McGarry BE, Barnett ML, Grabowski DC, et al. Nursing Home Staff Vaccination and Covid- 19 Outcomes. N Engl J Med 2022 Jan 27;386(4):397-398. doi: 10.1056/NEJMc211 5674. This study was a cross-sectional analysis of US nursing home staff vaccination and resident infection data reported to the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services from June 2021- August 2021. In the presence of high community prevalence of Covid-19, nursing homes with low staff vaccination coverage had COVID-19 infection and death rates 132% and 195% higher, respectively, than those with high staff vaccination coverage. Top of Document PAGE 417 \u00b7 Cross-Program Measures | COVID-19 Vaccination Coverage among Healthcare Personnel (HCP) (2022 revision) 4. With the COVID-19 Omicron variant, despite continued protection against invasive mechanical ventilation and death, a decrement in COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness has been observed for Emergency Department visits and hospitalizations: Tenforde MW, Self WH, Gaglani M, et al. Effectiveness of mRNA Vaccination in Preventing COV ID-19-Associated Invasive Mechanical Ventilation and Death - United States, March 2021- January 2022. study was a case-control study of mRNA vaccine effectiveness (VE) against COVID- 19 associated invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and in-hospital death among adults hospitalized at 21 US hospitals from March 2021-January 2022. VE against IMV or in-hospital death was 90% overall; 88% for 2 doses and 94% for 3 doses, and 94% for 3 doses during the Omicron-predominant period. Ferdinands JM, Rao S, Dixon BE, et al. Waning 2-Dose and 3-Dose Effectiveness of mRNA Vaccines Against COVID-19Associated Emergency Department and Urgent Care Encounters and Hospitalizations Among Adults During Periods of Delta and Omicron Variant Predominance VISION Network, 10 States, August 2021- study was a test-negative case-control study evaluating VE against COVID-19 emergency department/urgent care (ED/UC) visits and hospitalizations among adults at sites across 10 states from August 2021-January 2022. During the Omicron period, VE against ED/UC visits was 87% in the first two months after a 3rd dose and decreased to 66% among those vaccinated 4-5 months prior; VE against hospitalizations was 91% during the first two months following a 3rd dose and decreased to 78% >= months after a 3rd dose. 5. Additional or booster dosing has been associated with reduced infections in both patients and healthcare workers: Prasad N, Derado G, Nanduri SA, et al. Effectiveness of a COVID-19 Additional Primary or Booster Vaccine Dose in Preventing SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Nursing Home Residents During Widespread Circulation of the Omicron Variant -United States, February 14- March 6;71(18):633-637. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm7118a4. This report is a cross-sectional analysis of data reported to CMS from 15,000 nursing homes from January-March 2022. Compared with primary series vaccination only, an additional or booster dose provided greater protection (relative VE = 46.9%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection during Omicron variant predominance.

The measure assesses individuals on a 0 -100 scale that converts to one of four levels of activation, from low (1) to high (4). The PAM performance measure (PAM -PM) is the change in score on the PAM fro m baseline to follow -up measurement. A positive change would mean the patient is gaining in their ability to manage their health. The measure is not disease specific but has been successfully used with a wide variety of chronic conditions, as well as with people with no medical diagnosis. Numerator The numerator is the summary change score for the aggregate of eligible patients in that unit (e.g., patients in a primary care provider's panel, or in a clinic), expressed as the differe nce between the Baseline PAM score and then a second score taken within 12 months of the baseline (but not less than 6 months). In addition to the summary change score, the reporting entity should provide the proportion of eligible patients who achieved a net increase in PAM score of at least 3 points in a 6 -12 month period (passing) and the proportion of eligible patients who achieved a net increase in PAM score of at least 6 points in a 6 -12 month period (excellent). Numerator Exclusions Patients who are at PAM level 4 at baseline. Patients who are flagged with outlier scores on the PAM. Denominator Patients aged 14 and older with two PAM scores no less than 6 months and not more than 12 months apart who were seen for a qualifying visit at least once during the performance period.

While we are aware of two current measures that assess activation, they do so using estimates of patient's ability to self -manage their health and participate in care activities that are not nearly as well researched as the PAM -based measure we are proposing. The PAM has added appeal in that it is a disease -agnostic measure, applicable and meaningful to a wide set of patients, unlike the existing measures. Please also see attachment that shows other measures that claim to measure patient activation (Attachment I, Activation Measure Comparisons) How will this measure add value to the CMS program?

Clinical Quality Measure (CQM) Registry Stratification No Feasibility of Data Elements ALL data elements are in defined fields in electron ic sources Top of Document | Gains in Patient Activation Measure (PAM) Scores at 12 Months PAGE 432 \u00b7 Cross -Program Measures Feasibility Assessment All data elements to compute a PAM score and activation level can be delivered electronically. Data can be collected at the point of care in -person. Data can also be collected via IVR, through the patient portal, or via the US mail. Most EHRs can make a place for PAM data, if one is not already specified. PAM questions and scoring have been integrated into a number of electronic medical records (e.g., Epic, eClinicalWorks), and care man agement software (e.g. CaseTrakker, McKesson CCR/Vitals). The technical structure also exists to provide real time scoring through a web service API for PAM questions integrated into any software application. Users of this Web service receive a PAM score a nd activation level for each completed assessment. PAM operationalized: Today more than 125 organizations in 40+ states, as well as national organizations, are using PAM as an outcome measure, as well as a tool to help target resources and tailor support t o a person's level of activation of self -management ability. For example, in New York state, PAM has been mandated for use in Medicaid reform as part of the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) Program, which seeks to achieve a 25 percent reduc tion in avoidable hospital use over five years for state Medicaid participants. Scoring adjustments: Over time Insignia has been able to improve the scoring of PAM with the collection of both larger amounts of data, and data richer in demographic, socioeco nomic and health condition insights. For example, at the end of 2013, PAM level scoring cut points were adjusted based upon data collected over the previous three years. This adjustment had the effect of slightly increasing the range of Level 3 and raising the starting point for the highest level of activation, level 4. Missing data: PAM was constructed and is scored using Rasch measurement model analysis. This is a stochastic, not deterministic, model, and thus missing data has no influence. In every analy sis missing responses to an item are calibrated so that one can see if nonresponse to an item is biasing results. The calibrated difficulty structure of missing responses is universally between \"disagree\" and \"agree\". This is what we would expect if nonres ponse to an item is indicating something other than nonresponse. The average (mean across thirteen items) percent of people not responding to an item, or missing data, is 3.73%. 0 & 100 Scores: Scores at either extreme are dropped from evaluation as indica tors that PAM was not taken truthfully. These two scores extremes tend to account for 2% to 4% of responses Frequency of data collection: Organizations typically strive to administer PAM at least two times over 12 months. The cadence of repeat administrati on depends on the population (Medicare, Medicaid, Medicare), and the design of the program (frequency of interaction, modes of interaction). Typically repeat PAM administration occurs within months three and six following the baseline administration. Even a single point change in activation (there are 10 to 12 points between activation levels) has proven significant. Time to complete: Most individuals will complete PAM in 3 to 5 minutes. Method of Measure Calculation Other digital method Hybrid measure: Methods of measure calculation N/A Evidence of Performance Gap As summarized in the NQF endorsement, patient self -management and life style behaviors are important determinant of health outcomes and influence other quality metrics. Patient activation is a predictor of these self -management behaviors. Supporting patien t's ability to self -manage is critical for improving outcomes. Measuring activation is a way for clinicians to know where to start with a patient, and help them move forward. Patient activation can also be increased with targeted support. There is a Top of Document | Gains in Patient Activation Measure (PAM) Scores at 12 Months PAGE 433 \u00b7 Cross -Program Measures growin g list of peer -reviewed studies (over 700 published studies using PAM as a key variable) showing it is possible to support greater activation in patients. Intervention studies show that targeted interventions can increase activation and improve outcomes (s ee list below). High quality medical care should result in improvements in patient's ability to self -manage. The PAM score (and changes in PAM scores) can indicate the degree to which this is occurring. A 3 -point increase in PAM score is associated with i mprovements in health -related behaviors. (Fowles et al 2009; Hibbard et al 2009) The logic model is as follows: Assess Patient Activation >> Coaching and Support by Clinical Team >> Increased Patient Activation >> Improved Health Behaviors Improved Health Outcomes >> Reduction in Utilization and Costs Unintended Consequences No unintended consequences have been observed.

For adults with CNCHCs [t]he literature review revealed that differing measures of self -management can be influenced using patient activation measure and HRQOL, Cuevas H, Heitkemper E, Huang YC, Jang DE, G A, Z J. A systematic review and meta -analysis of patient activation in people living with on patient activation; a meta -analysis was conducted on 7 RCTs. The quality of included studies was assessed with the Critical Appraisals Skills Programme (CASP), which includes eight unique appraisal tools to address the most common research study designs. For this study, all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were evaluated using the CASP RCT checklist, and other intervention studies were assessed using the CASP cohort study checklist for quasi -experimental studies. For both CASP checklists, it is advised that each item be scored as \"Yes,\" \"Cannot tell,\" or \"No,\" with decisions about the final scoring schema left up to the individual research team. For this study , it was decided that any study receiving a \"No\" on 6 or more items would be removed. Increased patient activation is associated with appropriate use of the health care system and improved self -management. Kinney RL, Lemon SC, Person SD, Pagoto SL, Saczyns ki JS.

For each study reviewed, a quality score was calculated by di viding the number of points received by the 18 eligible points. Higher quality was designated by a higher score. Downs and Black does not specify a cut -off threshold indicative of quality studies, however, the mid -point score of 9 has been used to distingu ish between those studies of adequate vs. inadequate quality [32,33]. For this review, studies which fell below 9 points (50%) of the total score were deemed of inadequate quality and were excluded. Patients who scored in the lower PAM stages (Stages 1 and 2) were more likely to have been hospitalized. Patients who scored in the lowest stage were also more likely to utilize the emergency room. The relationship between PAM stage and medication adherence was inconclusive in this review. Almutairi N, Hosseinza deh H, Gopaldasani V.

The two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of the included randomiz ed controlled trials using the Cochrane Handbook for assessing the risk of bias (Higgins et al., 2011). We evaluated random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outc ome data, and selective reporting. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and by consultation with the third reviewer. Patient activation interventions produced significant effects on outcomes related to physiological, psychological, behavioral, an d health - related quality of life in the context of chronic diseases. The following effect sizes were obtained: (a) physiological, namely, glycated hemoglobin = -0.31 (p < .01), systolic blood pressure = -0.20 (p < .01), diastolic blood pressure = -0.80 (p = .02), body weight = -0.12 (p = .03), and low -density lipoprotein = - 0.21 (p = .01); (b) psychological, namely, depression = -0.16 (p < .01) and anxiety = -0.25 (p = .01); (c) behavioral, namely, patient activation = 0.33 (p < .01) and self -efficacy = 0.5 7 (p < .01); and (d) health - related quality of life = 0.25 (p = .01). Source of empirical data Published, peer -reviewed original research Summarize the empirical data Stud ies show that targeted interventions can increase activation and improve a wide range of health outcomes. At least 20 randomized clinical trials have tested interventions that seek to increase activation as measured by PAM (see list below), and at least 29 studies have used a quasi -experimental design. Most, although not all, of the interventions tested increase activation as measured by PAM. Activation interventions have been associated with increases in PAM across different population groups including Me dicaid and Medicare populations, and a wide range of conditions, including schizophrenia, diabetes, asthma, COPD, depression, arthritis and others. A 3-point increase in PAM score is associated with improvements in health -related behaviors. (Fowles et al 2009; Hibbard et al 2009). Improvements in PAM Top of Document | Gains in Patient Activation Measure (PAM) Scores at 12 Months PAGE 436 \u00b7 Cross -Program Measures are also linked with better clinical outcomes and lower health care costs. Research has found that that the clinicians of patients with improved PAM scores tend to use a set of strategies that support patient behavior change (Greene, Hibbard, Alvarez et al 2016).

Lower activation is predicative of poor self -management, higher healthcare utilization, and higher costs. T he PAM is validated on construct validity. No risk adjustment is used. When gains in activation are used as a performance metric, then it is clear that any individual or groups of individuals can gain in activation over time. Clinicians whose patients meas ure low in activation are not at a disadvantage, as the outcome is measured in gains from where they started. Cost estimate completed Yes Cost estimate methods and results Research through Stanford in evaluation of CMMI grant support provides perspective as to the relationship between activation and cost for the most complex patients.

The inverse was shown as well, with a decline in PAM level associating to an 8% increase in cost. The published paper can be found here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30291 604/ . An Health Affairs published research with a more general patient population has also documented the relationship between activation and cost. In this health system study of 33,000 patients, patient activation was a significant predicto r of cost even after adjustment for a commonly used \"risk score\" specifically designed to predict future costs. Patient costs were 21% higher for PAM level one patients as compared to level four patients in the evaluated follow up period. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23381513/ In follow research with these patients the shift between PAM levels were further evaluated.

The measure is not disease specific; it has been successfully used with a wide variety of chronic conditions, as wel l as with people with no medical diagnoses. As demonstrated by over 750 peer -reviewed studies, the PAM has been shown to be reliable, valid, and the de facto gold standard for measuring patient activation. The PAM is predictive of many health outcomes, inc luding such diverse outcomes as how a patient fares after orthopedic surgery; remission of depression over time; the likelihood of hospital re -admission or ambulatory care sensitive (ACS) utilization; the trajectory of a chronic disease over time; and even the likelihood of a new chronic disease diagnosis in the coming year. A recent study indicated that PAM score changes can be used as a proxy for changes in health care costs. The study showed an inverse relationship between PAM scores and overall costs: a s PAM scores increase, overall costs decrease. PAM has also been successfully used, in its entirety, as a performance metric (PAM -PM), endorsed by the National Quality Forum (see Attachment D). Health care organizations use PAM -PM to evaluate health care s ystems and health teams on how well they support gains in patient self -management. The change in score from baseline measurement to follow -up measurement, or the change in activation score over time, is the performance score.

Please see Attachment A, \"CMMI Memo PAM Overview (April 2022),\" and Attachment B, \"PAM Reliability and Validity Summary \" for more details. Per the NQF endorsement application, Cronbach's alpha internal consistency reliability coefficients were computed for the 13 items of the PAM13 across a wide range of subsamples. Standard inter -item reliability in the form of Cronbach's alpha is the method used. This approach to reliability testing evaluates this core question: Are the PAM items (questions) all measuring the same construct and do they do so across different subsamples of respondents? Cronbach's alpha for the PAM, across numerous populations ranges from the high 0.8s to low 0.9s. Top of Document | Gains in Patient Activation Measure (PAM) Scores at 12 Months PAGE 441 \u00b7 Cross -Program Measures Appendix K summarizes these data for the ESRD population, including the availability of facility level data.

Empiric Validity model fit Empiric Validity: Sample size Numerous, please see Attachments A, B, and D (MIF for NQF -endorsed PAM -PM) Empiric Validity: Statistical result Per the NQF endorsement application, PAM was constructed with, and is scored using the Rasch measurement model. The model is a mathematical statement of measurement, as it is known in the physical and natural sciences. The key question is: Do the data fit the model? When the data fit the model the result is a measure having the same properties as weight scale, thermometer, speedometer, etc. The measure is thus an equal interval yardstick with the \"inch marks\" corresponding to the item - response category c ombinations. The first test of validity of measurement is item fit. Do all items fall on the single real number line representing the activation scale? All 13 items have very good fit. This has been replicated hundreds of times, see also Attachment E - PAM Validity - Rasch Const Valid Infit Outfit Samples attachment. Several differential item function analysis (e.g., Do items have the same location on the yardstick?) fail to show any DIF by subsample. The principal reason for this is that calibrations w ith the stochastic Rasch model are sample free (i.e., the distribution of activation scores in a sample has no effect on the calibration or fit of the PAM 13 items). Empiric Validity: Methods and findings Per the NQF endorsement application, construct validity is tested by examining the extent to which PAM scores or levels are related to theoretically relevant outcomes, behaviors, and underpinnings of the activation construct. Activation scores are true equa l interval scores on a 0 -100 scale where higher represents more activation. Using CHAIF segmentation analysis as well as Rasch variable maps we have long ago identified four distinct levels of activation. Persons falling in each level have empirically iden tified characteristics and each level is distinguished by different outcomes and health -related behaviors. In the construct validity testing 0 -100 scores are used when the criterion variable is categorical. When the criterion variable is continuous (e.g., health care cost) activation levels are used. Each test is described below. Validity results using a sample of key studies are shown in the Attachment A, B, and D. PAM score and activation level relationships are shown for: *Lifestyle behaviors: Nutrition (consuming fruits and vegetables), regular exercise *BMI *Disposition/Attitudes: Health as a priority, Top of Document | Gains in Patient Activation Measure (PAM) Scores at 12 Months PAGE 442 \u00b7 Cross -Program Measures feeling overwhelmed, goal setting ability *Hospitalization: Allowed costs, admits, length of stay * Physician visits * Medication: Filled prescriptions, prescription cost There is very strong evidence for the construct validity of the PAM 13 measure. We have also included a new Appendix K that descries validity data in patients with ESRD and the availability of facility level data. July 6 addendum - We pre viously conducted a signal -to-noise reliability analysis for two clinic systems (summary provided in Attachment L, Signal -to-Noise Analysis). Data is shown at the clinic level and rolled up for the two systems, showing good results with acceptable signal s trength for more than 90% of PAM data captured. We are also attaching two relevant publications (Attachment M, Greene et al 2016 Annals of Family Medicine and Attachment N, Alvarez et al 2017 BMD Health Services Research). Of note, in the Greene et al pape r, top-performing clinicians (i.e. those who evidenced the most change in patient PAM scores over time and higher PAM -PM scores) were more likely to use 5 key strategies that had been hypothesized based on expert consensus to increase patient activation. B ottom -performing clinicians reported using far fewer of these strategies, suggesting that PAM -PM is valid at the clinician level because measure scores can distinguish between clinicians who are more effectively promoting activation and their peers who are not. (Previous studies have demonstrated the link between increased activation and positive health and non -health outcomes.) Similarly, in the Alvarez et al analysis, primary care providers with high CS - PAM scores (a measuring indicating how much the prov ider sees the importance of patient self - management and patient participation in care) were significantly more likely to have patients with increased PAM scores than were primary care providers with lower CS -PAM scores. In both of these analyses patient PA M score changes linked to an individual provider were tracked over time. The data used in the articles are the same as the PAM -PM proposed here (PAM score changes over time), with one exception: The patient PAM score changes associated with each provider w ere continuous variables, performance was then dichotomized into \"top\" (average pam score change 7.5 points) and \"bottom\" performers (average PAM score change 3 points). Since submitting PAM -PM for consideration for inclusion in MIPS, we have collected dat a at a single site that we are analyzing for signal -to-noise information, at the individual provider level. That analysis will be sent as soon as possible after its completion.

In a large ACO where PAM was used, we found that 7,144 patients had PAM scores at two points in time and were also linked with their individual clinicians. These clinicians were all primary care providers and incl uded physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants. We examined the degree of change in PAM scores for each clinician. The clinicians who had the patients with the highest average PAM score gains showed an average increase in scores of 7.5 for their patients; clinicians whose patients had the least gains still averaged gains of 3.1 points on the 0 -100 scale 5. In a follow up study, we found that the PAM -PM was significantly linked with clinician behaviors with regard to supporting the pati ent role and clinician beliefs about the importance of the patient role in the care process (r=.28 ,p,<.05)6. For example, clinicians whose patients were making gains in PAM scores were more likely to problem solve with patients about overcoming obstacles , they were more likely to partner with patients in finding small steps changes, and more likely to show support for patient progress. The findings indicate that when clinicians are more supportive of the patient role, their patients are more likely to have greater gains in PAM score over time. These studies together provide evidence that the PAM - PM is valid at the individual clinician level. The findings also suggest that clinicians can learn the skills and behaviors that support gains in patient ac tivation.

Yes Surveys or patient -reported outcome tools The performance measure is based on the Patient Activation Measure (PAM) , used as originally specified. A copy of the PAM is included as an attachment to the application, as Attachment F - PAM -13 and Attachment G - PAM -10 . We recommend the 13 -item PAM with populations that are economically or educationally disadvantaged. Reliabilities are somewhat lower with these populations, so the PAM -13 is better with those groups. The Patient Activation Measure (PAM) is a 10 - or 13 - item questionnaire that assesses an individual's knowledge, skills and confidence for managing their health and health care. It is a patient/consumer survey tha t can be administered by any entity (health plan, health system, hospital or clinic, researcher) across modes (paper, IVR, online, phone, online, pad/smart phone) and over 35 languages. The measure assesses individuals on a 0 -100 scale that converts to one of four levels of activation, from low (1) to high (4). The PAM performance measure (PAM -PM) is the change in score on the PAM from baseline to follow -up measurement. A positive change would mean the patient is gaining in their ability to manage their hea lth. The measure is not disease specific but has been successfully used with a wide variety of chronic conditions, as well as with people with no medical diagnosis, see attachments A, B, D, and H (PAM Score Descriptives). The PAM is a proprietary measure; its survey and tools, including training and data quality and integrity supports, are available for use with a valid license. We are committed to ensuring broad and equitable access to the PAM and welcome the opportunity to collaborate with CMS to ensure t he PAM can be readily adopted by MIPS participants.

The NQF PAM -PM measure is scheduled for maintenance review in 2022, reass igned from original review dates in 2021. We have attached an e -mail from NQF summarizing this change, Attachment J - PAM -PM NQF Maintenance Review schedule - e-mail. More detailed review of Measure Performance is available in Attachment D For some of the Measure Score Level queries, we were unable to input a summary response because more than one estimate available, but we provide more info on those analyses in Attachments A, B, and D. For the Empiric Validity: Statistical Result, while unable to provide a single numeric response, per the NQF endorsement application, PAM was constructed with, and is scored using the Rasch measurement model. The model is a mathematical statement of measurement, as it is known in the physical and natural sciences. The key que stion is: Do the data fit the model? When the data fit the model the result is a measure having the same properties as weight scale, thermometer, speedometer, etc. The measure is thus an equal interval yardstick with the \"inch marks\" corresponding to the i tem-response category combinations. The first test of validity of measurement is item fit. Do all items fall on the single real number line representing the activation scale? All 13 items have very good fit. This has been replicated hundreds of times, see also Attachment E - PAM Validity - Rasch Const Valid Infit Outfit Samples attachment. Several differential item function analysis (e.g., Do items have the same location on the yardstick?) fail to show any DIF by subsample. The principal reason for this is that calibrations with the stochastic Rasch model are sample free (i.e., the distribution of activation scores in a sample has no effect on the calibration or fit of the PAM 13 items). On 6 -3-2022, in response to a reviewer request, we attempted to add inf ormation related to facility level findings to support review under the ESRD program, which was accidentally left out of the original submission; however, we were unable to add an additional Appendix with that information. We are attempting to include that information within the existing fields but would welcome the opportunity to upload the file in its entirety.
