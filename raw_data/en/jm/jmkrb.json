Methods 666 patients with ADIHF from 37 clinical research centers in China were randomly allocated to the treatment group (n=332) and the control group (n=334). The control group was treated with standardized western medicine. The treatment group received intravenously 5.2g Yiqi Fumai lyophilized injection based on standardized western medicine for 7 days. Results There was no statistically signi\u0000cant difference in baseline characteristics between the two groups (P> 0.05). After treatment, the BNP level in the treatment group was signi\u0000cantly lower than that in the control group of BNP level reduced by more than 30% compared to baseline was signi\u0000cantly higher in the treatment group than that in the control group (P<0.01). And the improvement of LVEF, NYHA cardiac functional classi\u0000cation, MLHFQ score, and TCM four diagnosis information score were better in the treatment group than those in the control group at 60\u00b13 days after enrollment (P<0.05 or P<0.01). There were no statistically signi\u0000cant differences in the incidence of composite endpoint events and adverse events (P>0.05). Conclusion Based on standardized western medicine, using Yiqi Fumai lyophilized injection can further reduce the plasma BNP level, improve cardiac function, alleviate clinical symptoms, improve the quality of life in patients with ADIHF, and it is safe. 1 Introduction With the advancement in the treatment of coronary heart disease, the survival time of patients has been prolonged, and the number of ischemic heart failure (IHF) patients has been accumulating and increasing (Fox et al., 2001; Lala et al., 2014). Compared with patients in the stable stage of chronic heart failure (HF), patients in acute decompensation have worse cardiac function and quality of life, more severe clinical symptoms, and often require emergency treatment or hospitalization. The inpatient mortality rate is 3%, and the 1-year mortality rate is as high as 25-40% (Heart Failure Group of Chinese Society ofPage 5/17Cardiology of Chinese Medical Association et al., 2018; Parikh et al., 2019). Previous experience has shown the unique advantages of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in improving the clinical condition of patients with acute decompensated ischemic heart failure (ADIHF) (Wang et al., 2019). The Chinese patent medicine Yiqi Fumai lyophilized injection is an innovative TCM preparation developed according to modern technology with materials, which has the characteristics of supplementing Qi and restoring pulse, nourishing Yin, and generating \u0000uid. It is often widely used in the treatment of ADIHF. Meta-analysis has suggested that based on standardized western medicine, using Yiqi Fumai lyophilized injection may further improve cardiac function, improve clinical e\u0000cacy, increase left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and reduce N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide level in HF patients (Wang et al., 2016a). However, the reliability of the results was affected by the overall low quality of the included literature. This study was conducted with a standardized multicenter, randomized, controlled study design to evaluate the e\u0000cacy and safety of Yiqi Fumai lyophilized injection in treating patients with ADIHF (Qi and Yin de\u0000ciency syndrome) and to provide higher-quality clinical evidence. 2 Methods 2.1 Study Design This study is a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, including subjects from 37 clinical research centers in China from October 2015 to October 2018.

(11) Suspected or diagnosed with allergy to intervention drug. (12) Participated in other research within 2 months. 2.3 Randomization and Intervention The subjects were divided into the treatment group and the control group according to the ratio of 1:1. Two groups received standardized western medication. Antiplatelet agents, -blockers, and aldosterone receptor antagonists were used as long as there were no contraindicated. Based on standardized western medicine, the treatment group was given intravenously 5.2 g Yiqi Fumai lyophilized injection (speci\u0000cation: 0.65g per bottle, Tasly Pharmaceutical Tianjin, China. Product batch number: 20150303/20150604)+250 ml 5% glucose/sodium injection at a rate of 60 ml/h (infusion pump recommended) once daily. The main ingredients of Yiqi Fumai lyophilized are meglumine and mannitol. The patients received the intervention for 7 days without any other TCM preparations. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 8 days, 30\u00b13 days, and 60\u00b13 days after randomization. 2.4 Outcomes The primary e\u0000cacy outcome was plasma BNP level. Secondary e\u0000cacy outcomes included NYHA cardiac function classi\u0000cation, LVEF (The modi\u0000ed Simpson method was used for measurement by a specialist in each center.), Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) score, TCM four diagnosis information score, and composite endpoint events (all-cause death, HF emergency/readmission, acute coronary syndrome, revascularization, malignant arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock, stroke, and pulmonary embolism). The safety outcome was the incidence of adverse events. 2.5 Sample Size Estimation The sample size was calculated based on the rate of a 30% decrease in BNP levels after treatment. The subjects were arranged in a ratio of 1:1 into the treatment group or the control group. It is assumed that standardized western medicine can reduce the BNP level by >30-60%, and integrated traditional ChinesePage 7/17and western medicine intervention can reduce the BNP level by >30-70%. The signi\u0000cance level is 0.05, and the power (1- ) is 0.80 in the one-sided test. In addition, the incomplete rate is considered to be no more than 20%, the sample size of each group was 333. The calculation formula is as follows: 2.6 Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was independently completed by a third-party institution, the Medical Statistics O\u0000ce of the First Teaching Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. All statistical tests were performed using SAS 9.4 software, and the full analysis set (FAS) was used to evaluate e\u0000cacy. When the measurement data conform to the normal distribution, the mean\u00b1standard deviation (m\u00b1SD) was used for statistical description; otherwise, the median (interquartile range) [Med (Q1, Q3)] was used. The paired t-test or nonparametric test was used in comparison within groups; the group t-test or nonparametric test was used in the comparison between groups. The number of cases (percentage) [n (%)] was used for the statistical description of enumeration data; 2 test or Fisher's exact test was used for comparison of categorical data between groups; Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for comparison of hierarchical data between groups. All statistical tests were two-sided, and P<0.05 was considered statistically signi\u0000cant. 3 Results 3.1 Baseline Characteristics Six hundred sixty-six subjects were enrolled, including 332 in the treatment group and 334 in the control group. The FAS included 317 cases in the treatment group and 322 cases in the control group; the per- protocol set included 294 cases in the treatment group and 296 cases in the control group; the safety set included 327 cases in the treatment group and 330 cases in the control group (Figure 1). There was no signi\u0000cant difference between the two groups in terms of demographic characteristics, disease history, basic medication situation, and the plasma BNP level, NYHA cardiac function classi\u0000cation, LVEF, MLHFQ scores, TCM four diagnosis information score, and groups were comparable (P > 0.05) (Table 1). 3.2 Primary outcome Compared with the baseline level, the plasma BNP level was signi\u0000cantly lower at 8 days, and 60 \u00b1 3 days after enrollment, the plasma BNP level in the treatment group was lower than that in the control group (8 days: 465.0 pg/ml vs. vs. 464.0 pg/ml, P < 0.01) (Table 2). At 8 days and 60 \u00b1 3 days after enrollment, the rate of patients with BNP decreased by morePage 8/17than 30% in treatment group was higher than that in control group (8 days: 55.21% vs. 41.93%, P < 0.001; 60 \u00b1 3 days: 62.46% vs. 51.24%, P < 0.01). 3.3 Secondary Outcomes 3.3.1 NYHA cardiac function classi\u0000cation The NYHA cardiac function classi\u0000cations of two groups were improved at 8 days and 60 \u00b1 3 days after enrollment, and the improvement in the treatment group was signi\u0000cantly better than that in the control group (8 days: P < 0.01; 60 \u00b1 3 days: P < 0.001) (Table 3). 3.3.2 LVEF After 60 \u00b1 3 days after enrollment, the LVEF of the two groups increased compared with the baseline level, and the LVEF in the treatment group was higher than that in the control group at 60 \u00b1 3 days (P < 0.01) (Table 4). 3.3.3 MLHFQ scores After 60 \u00b1 3 days after enrollment, the MLHFQ scores of the two groups decreased compared with the baseline level, and the MLHFQ scores in the treatment group were lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05) (Table 4). 3.3.4 TCM four diagnostic information score At 8 days and 60 \u00b1 3 days after enrollment, the TCM four diagnostic information scores of the two groups decreased compared with baseline level, and the TCM four diagnostic information scores in the treatment group were lower than those in the control group (8 days: P < 0.05; 60 \u00b1 3 days: P < 0.01) (Table 5). 3.3.5 Compound endpoint events The compound endpoint events were 22.71% in the treatment group and 25.16% in the control group. All- cause death was 3.47% in the treatment group and 4.35% in the control group. The incidence of HF readmission was 8.83% in the treatment group and 9.32% in the control group, and the incidence of cardiovascular events was 19.24% in the treatment group and 20.81% in the control group, respectively. There was no signi\u0000cant difference between groups (P > 0.05). 3.4 Safety evaluation There were 18 cases (5.50%) and 14 cases (4.24%) of adverse events in the treatment and control groups, respectively. There was no signi\u0000cant difference between the two groups (P= 0.4524). Among them, there was one serious adverse event in the treatment group and the control group, which was duodenal perforation and cholelithiasis with biliary colic. In the treatment group, 2 cases were judged to be drug-Page 9/17related adverse reactions (aversion to cold, fever, tremor of limbs, chest tightness, shortness of breath in 1 case; chills in 1 case), and there was no signi\u0000cant difference between groups (P > 0.05) (Table 6). 4 Discussion At present, the standardized western medicine treatment of HF is diuretic, vasodilator and positive inotropic drugs, which can improve the symptoms of patients in the short term, but long-term application may have adverse reactions such as electrolyte disturbance and malignant arrhythmia. The combined use of TCM on the basis of standardized standardized western medication has potential advantages in optimizing the treatment of HF. Qi and Yin de\u0000ciency syndrome is one of the primary TCM syndromes in acute decompensated chronic HF (Zhao et al., 2013). The Chinese patent medicine Yiqi Fumai lyophilized injection is materials, which has the characteristics of supplementing Qi and restoring pulse, nourishing Yin, and generating \u0000uid. Modern pharmacological studies have shown that ginsenoside in Yiqi Fumai lyophilized injection could inhibit the activity of Na+-K+-ATPase, and promote the in\u0000ux of Ca2+, thus enhancing myocardial contractility and improving cardiac function (Wang et al., 2016b). Ginsenoside Rb1 can protect endothelial cells by inhibiting apoptosis, thus delaying vascular injury (Zhou et al., 2005), and ginsenoside Rb2 can signi\u0000cantly alleviate a malignant chain reaction such as oxidative stress and in\u0000ammation in ischemia-reperfusion models (Xue et al., 2020). The polysaccharide of Ophiopogonis Radix has the role of protecting myocardial cells, improving blood \u0000ow, inhibiting the increase of free radicals caused by myocardial ischemia and clearing oxygen free radicals, and can expand coronary arteries and increasing coronary blood \u0000ow (Xu et al., 2004). Schisandrae Chinensis Fructus can obviously improve the common hypoxia tolerance of animals and has a strong protective effect on acute myocardial ischemia injury in animals (Qi et al., 2011). Basic studies have shown that Yiqi Fumai lyophilized injection could improve the cardiac function of ischemic HF rats by increasing plasma levels of omentin, PI3K/Akt, AMPK, and inhibiting MAPKs levels (Li et al., 2019), suggesting that it has a reliable mechanism for improving IHF. In addition, Yiqi Fumai lyophilized injection can improve mitochondrial function by regulating ROS production and the CaMKII signal pathway. Thus, the cardiac contractile function, cardiac structural damage, cardiac histological characteristics, and \u0000brosis of mice with HF induced by coronary artery ligation can be alleviated (Zhang et al., 2019). BNP mainly originates from ventricles and is a member of the diuretic natriuretic peptide family generated and secreted by cardiac myocytes, which have the effects of diuresis, vasodilator, and inhibition of the sympathetic nervous system. During acute decompensated heart failure, ventricular pressure is overloaded, and blood volume increases, stimulating cardiomyocytes to synthesize BNP and release it into the blood, resulting in increased plasma BNP levels. Studies have shown that BNP is an important prognostic marker for HF patients, and its concentration is closely correlated with patient survival rates. A BNP reduction of more than 30% indicates a reduced risk of readmission and death (Ruocco et al., 2016). This study showed that the standardized western medicine combined with YiqiPage 10/17Fumai lyophilized injection for 7 days could signi\u0000cantly reduce BNP level, improve cardiac function, alleviate clinical symptoms and improve quality of life in IHF patients. The improvement of LVEF appeared at 60\u00b13 days after enrollment, which might be related to the long-term effect of Yiqi Fumai lyophilized injection. At 60\u00b13 days after enrollment, the incidence of composite endpoint events in the treatment group was lower than that in the control group. Still, no statistical difference was observed, indicating that the improvement of LVEF was not synchronized with the amelioration of long-term endpoint events. Regarding safety evaluation, this study showed that there were 3 cases of adverse reactions in the treatment group, all of which were known adverse reactions in the instructions of Yiqi Fumai lyophilized injection. Adverse reactions may be related to patients' complex underlying diseases and individual differences. There were no statistically signi\u0000cant differences in adverse events and laboratory indicators between the two groups. In addition, as a traditional Chinese medicine freeze-dried powder preparation, the use and preservation of Yiqi Fumai lyophilized injection should strictly follow the standards to avoid iatrogenic adverse reactions. In this study, a multicenter, randomized, controlled study design was used to carry out a large sample clinical trial. The results can provide high-quality evidence for clinical decision making. However, this study has some limitations: there were no statistical differences in HF readmission, cardiovascular events, all-cause death, and other endpoint events due to the relatively short follow-up time. Further studies with longer follow-ups and more focus on endpoint events may provide more evidence of prognosis. 5 Conclusion Based on standardized western medicine, Yiqi Fumai lyophilized injection can further reduce plasma BNP level, improve cardiac function, alleviate clinical symptoms and improve quality of life in patients with ADIHF and has good safety.
