InfiniChi Energy Healing uses Qigong Meditations and Qi flowing techniques that have been studied and developed for 5,000 years by the ancient masters of the Taoist tradition and transmitted by Hua-Ching Ni and Dr. Mao Shing Ni. It serves as the energetic foundation for all modalities of Chinese Medicine, including acupuncture, herbal medicine, and Tuina (body work). The power of the body's healing systems can be accessed and strengthened by a transfer of (Qi) energy. This is often done with an acupuncture needle, a food, or an herb. InfiniChi focuses solely on that transfer of energy without the use of a physical medium. InfiniChi Energy Healing is sometimes called, \"Acupuncture without Needles\" and is a non-touch therapy where a practitioner assesses and manipulates the internal and external energies of a patient to enhance healing and balance. There may also be the use of light palpation, acupressure, or guided visualization to further direct the flow of energy. InfiniChi Energy Healing Level 1 is the first in a series of 4 course levels that leads eligibility to be Certified as an InfiniChi Energy Healing Practitioner. However, if you only desire to strengthening your Qi and Immune system, then InfiniChi Level 1 course can be taken as a stand-alone class without continuing with the whole InfiniChi program. WHAT HAPPENS DURING AN INFINICHI ENERGY HEALING SESSION First, a consultation to focus the healing session. Then, either lying down or sitting, the patient is instructed to breathe calmly and relaxed. The practitioner takes an initial energetic assessment of areas of imbalance. From this point, a host of Qi manipulation techniques are performed while making the necessary energetic adjustments. There may also be the use of light palpation, acupressure, or guided visualization to further direct the flow of energy. The patient may experience deep relaxation, temperature changes, numbness, tingling, light-headedness, emotions, or body movement. The InfiniChi practitioner customizes the 30-45-minute session and the treatment frequency to meet the unique needs of the patient. In Chinese medicine, the power of the body's healing systems is accessed by a transfer of energy. This is often done with an acupuncture needle, a food, or an herb. InfiniChi is the Ni family practice of medical energy healing that focuses solely on the transfer of energy without the use of a physical medium. It is a non-touch therapy where a practitioner reads and manipulates the internal and external energies of a patient to bring about healing and balance. Areas of weakness are strengthened and areas too excessive are gently purged. This is done by reception and emission of qi (energy) from the practitioner's hands. You can feel the invisible energy yourself when you hold your hand over an ice cube or a lit candle. InfiniChi shares the same scope of practice as acupuncture and herbal medicine but works especially well for the irritable bowel syndrome](http://www.taoofwellness.com.php53-8.dfw1-2.websitetestlink.com/digestive-disorders/) [pre-menstrual disorder, moodiness, cramps](http://www.taoofwellness.com.php53-8.dfw1-2.websitetestlink.com/womens-health/) \"A lovely experience. I felt lifted in every way.\" The InfiniChi Program In order to fulfill Master Ni's vision of training a new generation of Chi Healers to cleanse the world of poor health, unhappiness and spiritual devolution, InfiniChi Institute International (III) was founded as an affiliate institute of the College of Tao. III will offer professional level training in chi healing leading to certification as a Certified InfiniChi Therapist (C.I.T.). Master Ni's Advanced Traditional Practices will be an integral part of this program. This program is designed to develop your energetic healing abilities as professional Chi Therapist utilizing the teachings of the Integral Way and the Advanced Traditional Practices as a foundation. Additionally, other classical Chinese healing methods and training will be taught. This program is designed for bright and highly self-motivated individuals able to meet the challenges of becoming a Chi Healer. It features a progressive systematic program that nurtures understanding, facilitates skill development, and promotes self-growth. The residential intensives are designed to allow for students to experience the energy.
