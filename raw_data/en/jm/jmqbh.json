According to NBC News, the mother posted in [Stop Mandatory Vaccination\u2014one of the largest anti-vaxx groups on Facebook](https://www.thedailybeast.com/anti-vaxxer-larry-cook-has-weaponized-facebook-ads-in-war-against-science)\u2014stating that her son was running a fever and had a seizure. Two of her other children were diagnosed with the flu, and a doctor prescribed Tamiflu for everyone in the household. \"The doc prescribed tamiflu I did not pick it up,\" she wrote, adding that her typical \"natural cures\" like peppermint oil and Vitamin C were not working. Forty-five people commented on the mother's post, but none suggested she seek medical attention.

A Facebook spokesperson called the situation a \"tragedy.\" \"We don't want vaccine misinformation on Facebook, which is why we're working hard to reduce it everywhere on the platform, including in private groups,\" the company said.

The mother did not respond to NBC's requests for comment. [Read "}
