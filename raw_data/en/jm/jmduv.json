TARGET-NASH is a research registry of patients with NAFL or NASH within academic and community real-world practices maintained in order to assess the safety and effectiveness of current and future therapies. - Phase 4 Study of Obeticholic Acid Evaluating Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Primary Biliary Cholangitis Recruiting Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) is a serious, life-threatening, bile acid related liver disease of unknown cause. Without treatment, it frequently progresses to liver fibrosis and eventual cirrhosis requiring liver transplantation or resulting in death. The investigational drug, Obeticholic Acid (OCA) is a modified bile acid and FXR agonist that is derived from the primary human bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid. The key mechanisms of action of OCA, including its choleretic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic properties, underlie its hepatoprotective effects and result in attenuation of injury and improved liver function in a cholestatic liver disease such as PBC. The study will assess the effect of OCA compared to placebo, combined with stable standard care, on clinical outcomes in PBC participants. - Randomized Global Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Impact on NASH With Fibrosis of Obeticholic Acid Treatment Recruiting The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect of Obeticholic Acid treatment compared to placebo on 1) histological improvement and 2) liver-related clinical outcomes in patients with non-cirrhotic nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with liver fibrosis. - Study Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety of Obeticholic Acid in Subjects With Compensated Cirrhosis Due to Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Recruiting The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether obeticholic acid (OCA; INT-747) can lead to histological improvement in fibrosis with no worsening of NASH in adults with compensated cirrhosis due to NASH. - Phase II SBRT & Chemo for Unresectable Cholangiocarcinoma Followed by Liver Transplantation Not Recruiting The purpose of this study is to determine progression-free survival at 12 months for stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and chemotherapy for unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma (CCA).

Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver 2023 Abstract We studied the trends in liver cancer-related mortality before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Quarterly age-standardized mortality and quarterly percentage change (QPC) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) were estimated using the US national mortality database 2017-2021. Quarterly age-standardized mortality from HCC decreased steadily with an average QPC of -0.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.6% to -0.2%). A decrease in hepatitis C virus and hepatitis B virus-related HCC mortality liver 0.8%-1.9%) demonstrated a linear increase. There was a linear increase in the quarterly age-standardized ICC-related mortality (0.8%, 95% CI: 0.5%-1.0%). While ICC-related mortality continued to increase, HCC-related mortality tended to decline mainly due to a decline in mortality due to viral hepatitis.

Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics 2023 Abstract Patients with pre-existing cirrhosis and exposure to coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) may portend a poor prognosis. We evaluated the temporal trends in aetiology-based hospitalisations and potential predictors of in-hospital mortality in hospitalisation with cirrhosis before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.Based on the US National Inpatient Sample 2019-2020, we determined quarterly trends in aetiology-based hospitalisations cirrhosis and decompensated cirrhosis cirrhosis increased at a relatively higher rate during the COVID-19 era. Hospitalisation rates for alcohol-related liver disease (ALD)-related cirrhosis percentage change [QPC]: 3.6%, 95% CI: 2.2%-5.1%), with a notably higher rate during the COVID-19 era. In contrast, hospitalisation rates for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis decreased steadily with a trend of -1.4% of QPC (95% CI: -2.5% to increased significantly but declined steadily for viral hepatitis. The COVID-19 era and COVID-19 infection were independent predictors of in-hospital mortality during hospitalisation 40% higher risk of in-hospital mortality.In-hospital mortality in cirrhosis was higher in the COVID-19 era than in the pre-COVID-19 era. ALD is the leading aetiology-specific cause of in-hospital mortality in cirrhosis with an independent detrimental impact of the COVID-19 infection.

American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons 2023 Abstract Livers from donors with positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg+) have been used to expand the donor pool, but outcome data are limited. We aim to evaluate survival following liver transplant (LT) from HBsAg+ donors. Using the United Network for Organ Sharing registry, we identified HBsAg+ donors utilized for LT from 2009 to 2020. We used Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox proportional hazards regression to compare post-LT survival in HBV- recipients who utilized HBsAg+ donors to propensity-matched cohorts who utilized other types of donors. From 2009-2020, 70 patients received HBsAg+ livers, and 58 of them did not carry a diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B (HBV-). The 1 and 3-year post-LT survival for HBV- patients who received livers from HBsAg+ donors were 96.6% and 91.4%, respectively, with no statistical differences compared to patients received livers from HCV viremic donors (96.5%/93.0%, P=0.961/0.427), donation after cardiac (93.0%/86.0%, p=0.651/0.598), average risk donors (89.5%/86.0%, P=0.264/0.617), and combination of extended criteria donors, including DCD, donor age over 70, and graft with greater than 30% steatosis (93.0%/91.2%, P=0.621/0.785). Recipients of HBsAg+ livers have similar post-LT survival compared to those received other types of grafts. Increase utilization of HBsAg+ livers could safely expand the donor pool.

The American journal of medicine 2023 Abstract BACKGROUND: A leading cause of mortality in fatty liver disease is cardiovascular disease. Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is new terminology that classifies fatty liver due to metabolic dysfunction attributable to obesity and associated complications. We evaluated atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and statin use in adults with MAFLD.METHODS: Retrospective study of 2011-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Adults with MAFLD were identified using established criteria: presence of hepatic steatosis (US Fatty Liver Index>30) plus 1 of the following: (1) body mass index >25 kg/m2 in non-Asians or >23 kg/m2 in Asians, (2) diabetes mellitus, or (3) 2 metabolic risk factors. cardiovascular disease risk was estimated using the validated 10-year ASCVD risk score. Statin use was assessed in intermediate and high 10-year ASCVD risk groups.RESULTS: Prevalence of men, 27.9% non-Hispanic white. Among adults with MAFLD, 23.3% and 23.0% had intermediate and high 10-year ASCVD risk, respectively. Compared to women, men were more likely to have high 10-year ASCVD risk (28.7% 3.87-7.10, In intermediate and groups, overall statin use was 48.3% (95% CI 46.1-51.3).CONCLUSIONS: Over 46% of adults with MAFLD had intermediate or high 10-year ASCVD risk. Statin use was underutilized at 48.3% in those meeting statin criteria. These findings are alarming given high cardiovascular disease risk and low statin use in this cohort.

Journal of clinical medicine 2023; 12 (5) Abstract The impact of different types of physical activity (PA) on mortality in the context of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is not clearly defined and was investigated. This prospective study was performed using the 2007-2014 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey with mortality follow-up through 2019. Over a median follow-up of 8.6 years, leisure-time and transportation-related PA that fulfilled the criteria outlined in the PA guidelines (150 min/week) in NAFLD were associated with a risk reduction in all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: in NAFLD were inversely associated with all-cause mortality in a dose-dependent manner (p for trends <0.01). Furthermore, the risk for cardiovascular mortality was lower in those meeting the PA guidelines for leisure-time PA (HR: behavior was linked to an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (p for trend <0.01). Meeting PA guidelines (150 min/week) for leisure-time and transportation-related PA has beneficial health effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among individuals with NAFLD. Sedentary behavior in NAFLD showed harmful effects on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

Journal of affective disorders BACKGROUND: An association between depression and metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) appears logical on the basis of previous observations linking depression to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. We aim to investigate the association between depression and MAFLD and significant fibrosis.METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2017 to March 2020 Pre-pandemic dataset. Depression and depression-related functional impairment were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). MAFLD, based on the criteria proposed by an international expert panel, and significant fibrosis were defined by transient elastography.RESULTS: Of the 3327 individuals (mean age: 46.9 years, 50.2 % men), the prevalence of depression and functional impairment due to depression was higher among individuals with MAFLD or significant fibrosis than among those without. Individuals with depression were approximately 70 % more likely to have MAFLD than those without. In multivariable analyses, depression was associated with an increased risk of MAFLD (odds ratio [OR]: 1.77, 95 % confidence interval [CI]:1.33-2.36 for 263 dB/m and OR: 1.70, 95 % CI: 1.20-2.41 for 285 dB/m). These associations were more pronounced in postmenopausal women than premenopausal women. In terms of significant fibrosis, depression remained an independent predictor of significant fibrosis; however, it attenuated after adjustment for body mass index.LIMITATIONS: Temporal causality and residual confounders could not be entirely investigated due to the study design.CONCLUSIONS: Depression was independently associated with MAFLD and significant fibrosis in a nationally representative sample of adults in the US.

Journal of viral hepatitis 2023 Abstract Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection is one of the most common causes of cirrhosis and liver cancer worldwide. Our aim was to assess clinical and patient-reported outcome (PRO) profile of CHB patients from different regions of the world using the Global Liver Registry. The CHB patients seen in real-world practices are being enrolled in the Global Liver Registry. Clinical and PRO (FACIT-F, CLDQ, WPAI) data were collected and compared to baseline data from CHB controls from clinical trials. The study included 1818 HBV subjects (48\u00b113 years, 58% male, 14% advanced fibrosis, 7% cirrhosis) from 15 countries in 6/7 Global Burden of Disease super-regions. The rates of advanced fibrosis varied (3-24%). The lowest PRO scores across multiple domains were in HBV subjects from the Middle East/North Africa (MENA), the highest - Southeast/East and South Asia. Subjects with advanced fibrosis had PRO impairment in 3 CLDQ domains, Activity of WPAI (p<0.05). HBV subjects with superimposed fatty liver had more PRO impairments. In multivariate analysis adjusted for location, predictors of PRO impairment in CHB included female sex, advanced fibrosis, and non-hepatic comorbidities (p<0.05). In comparison to Global Liver Registry patients, 242 controls from clinical trials had better PRO scores (Abdominal, Emotional, and Systemic scores of CLDQ, all domains of WPAI) (p<0.05). In multivariate analysis with adjustment for location and clinicodemographic parameters, the associations of PROs with the enrollment setting (real-life Global Liver Registry vs. clinical trials) were no longer significant (all p>0.10). The clinico-demographic portrait of CHB patients varies across regions of the world and enrollment settings. Advanced fibrosis and non-hepatic comorbidities are independently associated with PRO impairment in CHB patients.

Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association 2022 Abstract BACKGROUND & AIMS: Black patients with hepatocellular cancer (HCC), often attributed to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, have suboptimal survival following liver transplant (LT). We evaluated the impact of direct acting antivirals (DAA) availability on racial and ethnic disparities in wait list burden post-LT survival for HCC candidates.METHODS: Using the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry, we identified HCC patients who were listed and/or underwent LT from 2009 to 2020. Based on date of LT, patients were categorized into two era-based cohorts: the pre-DAA era (LT between 2009-2011) and DAA era (LT between 2015-2017, with follow-up through 2020). Kaplan Meir and Cox proportional hazards analyses were used to compare post-LT survival, stratified by era and race and ethnicity.RESULTS: Annual wait list additions for HCV-related HCC decreased significantly in White and Hispanic patients during the DAA era, with no change (P=0.14) in Black patients. Black patients had lower 3-year survival than White patients in the pre-DAA era (70.6% vs.80.1%, respectively, P<0.001) but comparable survival in (82.1%, vs. 85.5%, respectively, P= 0.16). 0n multivariable analysis, Black patients in the pre-DAA era had a 53% higher risk (adjusted HR, 1.53, 95% CI:1.28-1.84), for mortality than White patients, but mortality was comparable in the DAA era (aHR, 1.23, 95% CI:0.99-1.52). In a stratified analysis in Black patients, HCV-related HCC carried more than a two-fold higher risk of mortality in the pre-DAA era (aHR 2.86, 95% CI:1.50-5.43) which was reduced in DAA era (aHR 1.34, 95%CI:0.78-2.30).CONCLUSIONS: With the availability of DAA therapy, racial disparities in post-LT survival have improved.

Adherence to HCC surveillance guidelines and appropriate treatment triage of liver lesions may improve receipt of curative-intent treatment and improved survival. Late-stage HCC diagnosis reflects sub-optimal implementation of effective HCC surveillance, whereas inappropriate treatment triage or linkage to care accounts for the non-receipt of curative-intent in close to half of early-stage HCC in the USA. A free, open-access decision-support tool for liver lesions that incorporates current guideline recommendations in a user-friendly interface could improve appropriate and timely triage of patients to appropriate care. This review provides a summary of gaps and disparities in linkage to HCC care and introduces a free, internet-based, interactive decision-support tool for managing liver lesions. This tool has been developed by the HCC Steering Committee of the Chronic Liver Disease Foundation and is targeted toward clinicians across specialties who may encounter liver lesions during routine care or as part of dedicated HCC surveillance.

Clinical and molecular hepatology 2022 Abstract Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States and worldwide. Though nonalcoholic fatty liver per se may not be independently associated with an increased risk for all-cause mortality, it is associated with a number of harmful metabolic risk factors, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, and an unhealthy diet. The fibrosis stage is a predictor of all-cause mortality in NAFLD. Mortality in individuals with NAFLD has been steadily increasing, and the most common cause-specific mortality for NAFLD is cardiovascular disease, followed by extra-hepatic cancer, liver-related mortality, and diabetes. High-risk profiles for mortality in NAFLD include PNPLA3 I148M polymorphism, low thyroid function and hypothyroidism, and sarcopenia. Achieving weight loss through adherence to a high-quality diet and sufficient physical activity is the most important predictor of improvement in NAFLD severity and the benefit of survival. Given the increasing health burden of NAFLD, future studies with more long-term mortality data may demonstrate an independent association between NAFLD and mortality.

The Journal of clinical investigation 2022; 132 (21) Abstract BACKGROUNDA pilot, single-center study showed that first-degree relatives of probands with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) cirrhosis have a high risk of advanced fibrosis. We aimed to validate these findings using 2 independent cohorts from the US and Europe.METHODSThis prospective study included probands with NAFLD with advanced fibrosis, NAFLD without advanced fibrosis, and non-NAFLD, with at least 1 first-degree relative. A total of 396 first-degree relatives - 220 in a derivation cohort and 176 in a validation cohort - were enrolled in the study, and liver fibrosis was evaluated using magnetic resonance elastography and other noninvasive imaging modalities. The primary outcome was prevalence of advanced fibrosis in first-degree relatives.RESULTSPrevalence of advanced fibrosis in with 15.6%, 5.9%, and 1.3%, respectively (P = 0.002), in the derivation cohort, and 14.0%, 2.6%, and 1.3%, respectively (P = 0.004), in the validation cohort. In multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models, age of 50 years (adjusted OR [aOR]: 2.63, 95% CI 1.0-6.7), fibrosis (aOR: 11.8, 95% CI 2.5-57) were significant predictors of presence of advanced fibrosis (all P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONFirst-degree relatives of probands with NAFLD with advanced fibrosis have significantly increased risk of advanced fibrosis.

Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America 2022 Abstract BACKGROUND: Patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with and without hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection had poor outcomes after liver transplant (LT). Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI) and direct-acting antivirals (DAA) changed the treatment landscape for HIV and HCV, respectively; their impact on LT outcomes remains unclear.METHODS: This retrospective analysis of adults with HIV monoinfection (n=246) and HIV/HCV coinfection (n=286) who received LT compared mortality in patients with HIV who received LT before vs. after approval of INSTI and in patients with HIV/HCV coinfection who received LT before vs after approval of DAA. In secondary analysis, we compared the outcomes in the different eras with those of propensity score (PS) matched control cohorts of LT recipients without HIV or HCV infection.RESULTS: HIV monoinfected LT recipients did not experience a significant improvement in survival between the pre-INSTI and INSTI recipients with HIV (aHR 0.70 [0.36-1.34). However, recipients with HIV/HCV coinfection in the DAA era had a 47% reduction (aHR 0.53 [0.31-9.2] in one-year mortality than co-infected recipients in the pre-DAA era. Compared to non-HIV or HCV recipients, HIV monoinfected recipients had higher mortality during the pre-INSTI era (aHR, ), but survival was comparable between groups during the INSTI era (aHR, ). HIV/HCV coinfected recipients also experienced comparable survival during the DAA era compared to non-HIV or HCV recipients (aHR, ).CONCLUSIONS: Post-LT survival for patients with HIV monoinfection and HIV/HCV coinfection has improved with the introduction of INSTI and DAA therapy, suggesting that LT has become safer in these populations.

Digestive and liver disease : official journal of the Italian Society of Gastroenterology and the Italian Association for the Study of the Liver 2022 Abstract BACKGROUND: Global pandemic of COVID-19 represents an unprecedented challenge. COVID-19 has predominantly targeted vulnerable populations with pre-existing chronic medical diseases, such as diabetes and chronic liver disease.AIMS: We estimated chronic liver disease-related mortality trends among individuals with diabetes before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.METHODS: Utilizing the US national mortality database and Census, we determined the quarterly age-standardized chronic liver disease-related mortality and quarterly percentage change (QPC) among individuals with diabetes.RESULTS: The quarterly age-standardized mortality for chronic liver disease and/or cirrhosis among individuals with diabetes remained stable before the COVID-19 pandemic and sharply increased during the COIVD-19 pandemic at a QPC of 8.5%. The quarterly mortality from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) increased markedly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mortality for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection declined with a quarterly rate of -3.3% before the COVID-19 pandemic and remained stable during the COVID-19 pandemic. While ALD- and HCV-related mortality was higher in men than in women, NAFLD-related mortality in women was higher than in men.CONCLUSIONS: The sharp increase in mortality for chronic liver disease and/or cirrhosis among individuals with diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased mortality from NAFLD and ALD.

Our AIM was to characterize the ascites fluid and correlate clinical outcomes in those with extrahepatic malignancy and ascites.METHODS: 241 subjects with extrahepatic solid tumors and ascites were reviewed from 1/1/2000 to 12/31/2019, 119 without liver metastasis and 122 with liver metastasis.RESULTS: Ascites fluid consistent with peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) was most common, 150/241 (62%), followed by fluid reflecting the presence of portal hypertension (PH), 69/241 (29%). 22/241 (9%) had low SAAG and low ascites fluid total protein, with evidence of PC on cytology and or imaging in 20/22. Lung cancer was the most common malignancy in subjects with ascites due to PC at 36/150 (24%), pancreatic cancer was the most common in subjects with ascites with features of PH at 16/69 (23%). Chemotherapy or immunotherapy alone was the most common management approach. Significantly higher 5-year, 3-year and 1-year mortality rate were noted in subjects with evidence of PC on cytology/imaging versus subjects with no evidence of PC, and in subjects with liver metastasis compared to subjects without liver metastasis. Subjects with pancreatic cancer and evidence of PC on cytology/imaging had higher 1 and 5-year mortality rates compared to subjects without PC.CONCLUSIONS: Ascites in solid tumor malignancy is most commonly due to PC. We also observed ascites fluid with characteristics of PH in 29% of subjects. Higher mortality rates in subjects with peritoneal carcinomatosis and liver metastasis were noted. These findings may help inform prognosis and treatment strategies.

Hepatology communications 2022 Abstract Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the leading risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to explore the incidence of HCC in a cohort of subjects with HBV and correlate with HBV treatment current guidance. We identified 2846 subjects with HBV over the study period. HCC was diagnosed in 386 of 2846 (14%) subjects; 209 of 386 (54%) were on nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) therapy at time of HCC diagnosis, and 177 of 386 (46%) were not on NA therapy. Of the 177 subjects not on NAs who developed HCC during follow-up, 153 of 177 (86%) had cirrhosis. Within the 177 subjects not on NAs, 158 of 177 (89%) had undetectable HBV DNA, 10 of 177 (6%) had detectable HBV DNA < 2000 IU/L, and 9 of 177 (5%) had HBV DNA > 2000 IU/L. Of those with cirrhosis and undetectable HBV DNA, 115 of 141 had compensated cirrhosis, and 26 of 141 had decompensated cirrhosis. Significant predictors of HCC on time to event analysis included cirrhosis (hazard ratio [HR] 10, 95% confidence interval age (HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.06; p < 0.001), 1.9, 95% CI 1.2-3.1; p 0.007), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.8; p 0.02). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated the cumulative incidence of HCC in subjects with compensated cirrhosis receiving NA therapy was significantly lower compared to subjects with compensated cirrhosis outside current HBV treatment practice guidance (undetectable HBV DNA) (32% vs. 51%; p < with untreated compensated cirrhosis with undetectable HBV DNA who do not meet current guidance for treatment had higher rates of HCC than those with compensated cirrhosis and suppressed HBV DNA by NA therapy. This study highlights the need for earlier diagnosis and treatment of HBV.

Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver 2022 Abstract BACKGROUNDS AND AIMS: A potent and safe antiviral agent may impact chronic hepatitis C (HCV)-related end-stage liver disease (ESLD). We assess etiology-based hospitalizations for ESLD in the United States, 2016-2019.METHODS: We utilized the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2016 to 2019. We defined ESLD as either decompensated cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, criteria obtained from the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision.RESULTS: National hospitalization rates for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) increased significantly from 67.1/100,000 persons in 2016 to 93.6 in 2019 with an average annual percentage change (AAPC) of 12.1%, while chronic hepatitis C (HCV) decreased significantly from 71.2/100,000 persons in 2016 to 58.5 in 2019 (-6.5% AAPC). Hospitalizations for ESLD in alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) increased as well.CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization rates for NAFLD-and ALD-related ESLD increased steadily, while those for HCV-related ESLD decreased during the direct-acting antivirals era.

Translational gastroenterology and hepatology 2022; 7: 25 Abstract The obesity epidemic has profoundly impacted the epidemiology and trends of liver disease. In the current era, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) progressing to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has emerged as the second leading indication for liver transplant (LT) and has been associated with the rising rates of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with and without underlying cirrhosis. Obesity has been associated with poor post-transplant outcomes including lower patient and graft survival; higher risk of post-operative metabolic complications; poor wound healing; and higher infection rates. Bariatric surgery is currently the most effective management of morbid obesity and has been offered to patients both in the pre and post LT setting. The techniques attempted in LT recipients most commonly include sleeve gastrectomy (SG), gastric bypass surgery with few cases of gastric banding and biliopancreatic diversion. However, there is lack of evidence-based data on the optimal management for patients with obesity and who are liver transplant candidates and/or recipients. In the following discussion, we present the highlights from a review of the literature.

Translational gastroenterology and hepatology 2022; 7: 26 Abstract In the past decade, alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) has become the leading indication for liver transplantation (LT) in the United States. Despite this major development, there still remains some controversy in a distinct subset of this patient population, those presenting with alcoholic hepatitis (AH). There is significant debate within the transplant community regarding acceptance criteria for patients with AH requiring LT, especially those with less than 6 months of sobriety. With that being said, LT in the setting of ALD and AH has shown an improvement in survival rates; additionally, many studies have reported that careful selection of patients with ALD has produced excellent post-transplant outcomes even if transplant occurred with less than 6 months of sobriety. In this review, we aim to discuss the ethical and allocation-associated issues that arise when considering ALD and/or AH for LT; furthermore, we delve into the history, controversies, current guidelines, and future directions of LT in this subgroup.

Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association 2022 Abstract BACKGROUND AIMS: During the global coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, patients with pre-existing chronic liver disease may represent a vulnerable population. We studied the etiology-based temporal trends in mortality of chronic liver disease and the underlying cause of death in the United States before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.METHODS: Population-based analyses were performed on US national mortality records (2017- 2020). Temporal trends in quarterly age-standardized mortality were obtained by joinpoint analysis with estimates of quarterly percentage change (QPC).RESULTS: Quarterly age-standardized all-cause mortality due to alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) initially increased at a quarterly rate of 1.1% before the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by a sharp increase during the COVID-19 pandemic at a quarterly rate of 11.2%. Likewise, steady increase in mortality of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) before the COVID-19 pandemic (QPC: 1.9%) accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic (QPC: 6.6%). While ALD-related mortality increased steeply compared to viral hepatitis-related mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of mortality due to COVID-19 among individuals with ALD was the lowest at 2.5%; more than 50% lower than viral hepatitis. The significant decline in all-cause mortality due to viral hepatitis before the COVID-19 pandemic plateaued during the COVID-19 pandemic due to increase in COVID-19-related mortality in individuals with viral hepatitis. Mortality due to cirrhosis increased markedly during the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly attributable to ALD.CONCLUSION: All-cause mortality for ALD and NAFLD rapidly accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the pre-COVID-19 era. There has been a significant decline in viral hepatitis; however, a significant increase in COVID-related death in this population.

Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association 2022 Abstract BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Presence of gallstone disease may influence outcomes in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We studied the impact of gallstone disease on mortality in individuals with and without NAFLD.METHODS: Prospective cohort study using the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994) with mortality data through 2015. Gallstone disease was defined as ultrasonographic evidence of gallstones or absence of the gallbladder (prior cholecystectomy). NAFLD was defined using standardized ultrasonographic criteria.RESULTS: Gallstone disease and cholecystectomy were independently associated with NAFLD (odds ratio [OR]: 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI]: OR: 2.77, 95% CI: 2.01-3.83 for cholecystectomy compared to no gallstone disease). During the median follow-up of 23 years, gallstone disease was associated with a higher risk of overall all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.05-1.37) and cause-specific mortality. Gallstone disease was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality in non-NAFLD sub-cohort (HR: 1.42, 1.03, 95% CI: 0.87-1.22). Gallstone disease was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular (HR: 1.40, 95% CI 1.10-1.78) mortality in non-NAFLD sub-cohort. Gallstone disease was with increased cardiovascular mortality (HR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.05-1.77) in NAFLD.CONCLUSION: Gallstone disease is an independent risk factor for NAFLD, but gallstone disease is not associated with all-cause mortality in individuals with NAFLD. Screening for gallstone disease in individuals at risk for developing NAFLD may help with risk stratification for all-cause mortality related to gallstone disease.

Transplantation direct 2022; 8 (5): e1313 Abstract To reduce the disparity in access to liver transplant (LT), United Network for Organ Sharing implemented an exception policy in May 2019, which capped hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) exception score to the median Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) at transplant within the donor service area minus 3 points (MMaT-3) after the 6-mo wait period. We aimed to evaluate how this policy affected HCC waitlist outcomes.Methods: Using United Network for Organ Sharing data, we analyzed waitlist outcomes in HCC patients at the time they received exception points from in the pre-MMaT era (August 15, 2017, to November 15, 2018) and MMaT era (June 1, 2019, to August 30, 2020). Comparisons were made within the HCC group and HCC versus non-HCC (at time of listing) groups in the pre-MMaT and MMaT eras and regions were grouped as low, medium, and high MELD based on MMaT.Results: HCC group: LT probability within the eras by 41% MELD regions (sHR, 0.59; 95% CI, 1.71-1.99) than non-HCC patients in the pre-MMaT era; which decreased to a 14% higher LT probability in MMaT era. In low and medium regions, HCC patients had over twofold higher LT probability in the pre-MMaT era, which decreased to a ~20% higher probability (sHR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.06-1.23) in the MMaT era. After implementation of the acuity circle policy, HCC patients had lower LT probability (sHR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74-0.94) than non-HCC patients.Conclusions: The geographic disparity between HCC and non-HCC patients has improved with the MMaT-3 policy. Despite lower LT probability for HCC patients, waitlist dropout was not adversely impacted.

Annals of gastroenterology 2022; 35 (2): 194-202 Abstract Studies have reported the association between weight gain and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in the Asian population. We investigated the association between weight gain, NAFLD and significant fibrosis measured by transient elastography in a representative Unites States sample.A cross-sectional study of 2849 participants was performed using the 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We defined NAFLD by controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) scores and significant fibrosis (F2) by liver stiffness measurements using transient elastography, in the absence of other causes of chronic liver disease. A questionnaire that assessed weight change over 1 (short term) and 10 years (long term) was utilized.Age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios (OR) for NAFLD, comparing the third and fourth quartiles (weight-gain group) with the second quartile (weight-stable group, and 3.58 (95%CI 2.19-5.86), respectively. The association between weight gain and NAFLD remained significant after adjustment for demographic and metabolic risk factors (OR 1.87, 95%CI 1.19-2.95 for CAP score 263 dB/m; OR 2.23, 95%CI 1.48-3.35 for CAP 285 dB/m). In terms of significant multivariate-adjusted OR for significant fibrosis were 1.99 the third quartile) and 3.12 (95%CI 1.46-6.65 for the fourth quartile), respectively. A statistically significant association between weight gain over 1 year and NAFLD was noted, whereas no such association was found between weight gain and significant fibrosis.Weight gain over 10 years was associated with increased odds of NAFLD and significant fibrosis.

While sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors have been established to improve glycaemic control in type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), evidence of the beneficial effects in diabetics with coexisting NAFLD has yet to be quantitatively summarized.Material and methods: We searched the PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases and ClinicalTrial.gov from database inception to July 2020. We included randomized controlled trials assessing the impact of SGLT2 inhibitors on liver enzymes among patients with NAFLD. Our primary outcome included liver inflammation as measured using liver transaminase. Secondary outcomes included drug efficacy on hepatic steatosis and body mass index. Risk differences were calculated using a random model.Results: A total of 10,555 patients were included in this meta-analysis (SGLT2 inhibitor group: n = 7125; control group: n = 3430). The treatment duration ranged from 8 to 52 weeks. Patients with T2DM, who were treated with SGLT2 inhibitor had decrease (SMD = -0.08). The 95% to controls.Conclusions: The SGLT2 inhibitor treatment may improve liver function, as demonstrated in the statistically significant reduction in transaminase levels. There were also notable trends in improved liver fibrosis and steatosis across the study periods.

Hepatology communications 2022 Abstract Genetic predisposition and unhealthy lifestyle are risk factors for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We investigated whether the genetic risk of NAFLD is modified by physical activity, muscular fitness, and/or adiposity. In up to 242,524 UK Biobank participants without excessive alcohol intake or known liver disease, we examined cross-sectional interactions and joint associations of physical activity, muscular fitness, body mass index (BMI), and a genetic risk score (GRS) with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and the proxy definition for suspected NAFLD of ALT levels > 30 U/L in women and >40 U/L in men. Genetic predisposition to NAFLD was quantified using a GRS consisting of 68 loci known to be associated with chronically elevated ALT. Physical activity was assessed using accelerometry, and muscular fitness was estimated by measuring handgrip strength. We found that increased physical activity and grip strength modestly attenuate genetic predisposition to elevation in ALT levels, whereas higher BMI markedly amplifies it (all p values < 0.001). Among those with normal weight and high level of physical activity, the odds of suspected NAFLD were 1.6-fold higher in those with high versus low genetic risk (reference group). In those with high genetic risk, the odds of suspected NAFLD were 12-fold higher in obese participants with low physical activity versus those with normal weight and high physical activity (odds ratio for NAFLD = 19.2 and 1.6, respectively, vs. reference group). Conclusion: In individuals with high genetic predisposition for NAFLD, maintaining a normal body weight and increased physical activity may reduce the risk of NAFLD.

Annals of hepatology 2021: 100565 Abstract INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Cirrhosis- related mortality is underestimated and is increasing; extrahepatic factors may contribute. We examined trends in cirrhosis mortality from 1999-2017 in the United States (varices, syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatocellular carcinoma sepsis) or extrahepatic (cardiovascular disease, influenza and pneumonia, diabetes, malignancy) causes, and compared mortality trends with congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) populations.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A national mortality database was used. Changes in age-standardized mortality over time were determined by joinpoint analysis. Average annual percentage change (AAPC) vs other chronic disease cohorts: changes in all-cause mortality were higher 0.1%, 95% CI -0.2- 0.4). Extrahepatic mortality was higher among women, rural populations, and individuals >65 years with cirrhosis.CONCLUSIONS: Extrahepatic causes of death are important drivers of mortality and differentially impact cirrhosis compared to other chronic diseases.

In this review, we focus on the clinical significance of gastrointestinal manifestations.The global pandemic, a result of the widespread implications of SARS-CoV-2, remains a significant burden to current healthcare systems. Fever, dyspnea, and tussive symptoms have primarily been recognized as the most common presenting signs/symptoms. During the past one year our scope of practice has transcended beyond the management of the respiratory system to incorporate other varying systemic manifestations such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. The outcomes reported by recent studies suggest an association between the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms and important clinical factors such as delay in presentation, disease severity, and mortality.We provide a summarization of the most recent in-depth investigations of coronavirus disease 2019 with gastrointestinal manifestations and their conclusions. Although the pathophysiology remains an area of evolving interest, a better understanding of this disease process may allow for early recognition, efficient triage, and improved prognostication for those presenting with gastrointestinal manifestations of SARS-CoV-2.

Journal of clinical gastroenterology 2021; 55 (9): 747-756 Abstract Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) comprises a spectrum of liver conditions characterized by significant lipid deposition within hepatocytes. As an overarching diagnosis, NAFLD contains a continuum of progressive liver diseases ranging from isolated liver steatosis to necroinflammatory states leading to end-stage liver disease. Nonalcoholic fatty liver and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis are distinguished by their histologic patterns, with the former exhibiting steatosis without fibrosis or inflammation. This important distinction provides clinicians a timeline within the NAFLD staging to target appropriate interventions against modifiable risk factors. NAFLD is likely formed in response to metabolic imbalances that damage the livers adaptive capacity. Metabolic conditions leading to steatosis mirror common cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and obesity. Acknowledging the common risk factors for development and progression of NAFLD, it is unsurprising the first-line management focuses on the treatment of metabolic syndrome with an emphasis on weight reduction in obese populations. The purpose of this review is to provide a detailed summary of the literature as well as outline the current treatment recommendations for patients with NAFLD with a detailed focus on pharmacologic antiobesity interventions.

World journal of gastroenterology 2021; 27 (29): 4818-4830 Abstract Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a global health concern associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Before the approval of second-generation direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), interferon therapy and liver transplantation constituted the mainstay of treatment. The introduction of well-tolerated oral DAAs in late 2013 has revolutionized HCV management with over 95% cure rates. The predominance of HCV-related liver transplantations has declined following the widespread approval of DAAs. Despite the unparallel efficacy observed among these novel therapies, pharmaceutical costs continue to limit equitable access to healthcare and likely contribute to the differential HCV infection rates observed globally. To reduce the burden of disease worldwide, essential agenda items for all countries must include the prioritization of integrated care models and access to DAAs therapies. Through transparent negotiations with the pharmaceutical industry, the consideration for compassionate release of medications to promote equitable division of care is paramount. Here we provide a literature review of HCV, changes in epidemiologic trends, access issues for current therapies, and global inequities in disease burden.

Clinics in liver disease 2021; 25 (3): 625-634 Abstract Liver transplantation (LT) for alcohol-related or alcoholic hepatitis (AH) remains a controversial treatment option. However, recent studies have shown promising outcomes for LT in a subgroup of patients with AH. Considering these emerging data, LT as definitive therapy for severe AH refractory to medical management is gaining recognition. However, concerns of alcohol recidivism pose a significant barrier to perform LT for this indication. Predictive models can be utilized to develop a selection criterion to identify suitable candidates for LT. Hence, carefully selected patients with severe AH and low risk of alcohol relapse can be considered for LT.

Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.) 2021 Abstract BACKGROUND & AIMS: The surge in unhealthy alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic may have detrimental effects on the rising burden of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) on liver transplantation (LT) in the US. We evaluated the impact of the pandemic on temporal trends for LT including ALD.APPROACH & RESULTS: Utilizing data from United Network for Organ Sharing, we analyzed waitlist outcomes in the US through March 1, 2021. In a short-period analysis, patients listed or transplanted between June 1, 2019 and February 29, 2020 were defined as the \"pre-COVID\" era and after April 1, 2020 were defined as the \"COVID\" era. Interrupted time-series analyses utilizing monthly count data from 2016-2020 were constructed to evaluate rate change for listing and LT prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rates for listings (P=0.19) and LT (P=0.14) were unchanged during the pandemic despite a significant reduction in the monthly listing rates for HCV (-21.69%, P <0.001) and NASH (-13.18%; P <0.001). There was a significant increase in ALD listing (+7.26%; P <0.001) and LT (10.67%; P <0.001) during the pandemic. In the COVID era, ALD (40.1%) accounted for more listings than those due to HCV (12.4%) and NASH (23.4%) combined. The greatest increase in ALD occurred in young adults (+33%) and patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis (+50%). ALD patients presented with a higher acuity of illness, with 30.8% of listings and 44.8% of LT having a MELD-Na 30.CONCLUSIONS: Since the start of COVID-19 pandemic, ALD has become the most common indication for listing and the fastest increasing cause for LT. Collective efforts are urgently needed to stem the rising tide of ALD on healthcare resources.

Current opinion in infectious diseases 2021 Abstract PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We have increasing evidence that alterations of the intestinal microbiome have a strong influence on human health. Previous work has demonstrated the association between changes in the microbiome and metabolic risk factors. One related area of interest is the relationship between dysbiosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), as the global prevalence of NAFLD, and its resultant complications, increases.RECENT FINDINGS: In this review, we summarize the hypothesized pathophysiology of dysbiosis-mediated progression of NAFLD, including promotion of an inflammatory intestinal environment, increased intestinal permeability, endogenous ethanol production, short-chain fatty acid production, secondary bile acid metabolism, and choline depletion. We also review potential therapeutic interventions of the microbiome to slow or prevent NAFLD progression, including antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplant, and farnesoid * receptor agonism.SUMMARY: Much of the evidence supporting dysbiosis-mediated NAFLD progression has been gathered in high-quality animal trials. There remains a need for additional observational and randomized controlled trials in humans to establish causality between the suspected factors and pathogenesis of NAFLD.

We evaluated the association of meeting PA Guidelines with NAFLD and significant fibrosis/cirrhosis by transient elastography in the US.METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was performed using the 2017-2018 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. NAFLD and significant fibrosis/cirrhosis were defined by transient elastography in the absence of other causes of chronic liver disease. The detailed PA questionnaire assessed the leisure-time, occupation, and transportation-related PA. PA was categorized based on the PA Guidelines.RESULTS: Of the 4,304 subjects, leisure-time PA, which met the PA Guidelines (150 minutes/week), was associated with 44% lower risk of NAFLD (odds ratio [OR]: 0.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.46-0.67). Subjects who reported 1-2 times (150-299 minutes/week) or over 2 times (300 minutes/week) the recommended amount of PA Guidelines had of NAFLD, respectively. Over 8 hours of sitting time had a 44% higher risk of NAFLD (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.01-2.05), when we considered leisure-time PA and sitting time simultaneously. Over 2 times (300 minutes/week) recommended amount of PA Guidelines for leisure-time PA had 59% (OR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.21-0.64) lower odds of cirrhosis.CONCLUSIONS: Meeting PA Guidelines for leisure-time PA has beneficial effects on NAFLD and over two times recommended amount of PA Guidelines had lower risk for significant fibrosis or cirrhosis.

Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD 2021 Abstract BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and sarcopenic obesity share several pathophysiologic backgrounds. No prior studies have determined a plausible association between sarcopenic obesity and NAFLD and NAFLD-associated fibrosis. We aim to investigate the association between sarcopenic obesity and NAFLD, and NAFLD-associated fibrosis detected by transient elastography.METHODS: In a cross-sectional study from the 2017-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1,925 participants were identified. NAFLD was defined by controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) scores and significant fibrosis (F2)/cirrhosis by liver stiffness measurements on transient elastography. Sarcopenic obesity was defined by appendicular lean mass and body fat.RESULTS: Individuals with sarcopenic obesity had a significantly higher odds of having NAFLD [CAP score 263 dB/m, odds ratio (OR): 2.88, 95% CAP score 285, OR: 3.71, 95%CI: 2.24-6.14] after adjusting for age, gender, and race/ethnicity. The association remained statistically significant after adjustment for socioeconomic status, lifestyle and behavioral risk factors, and metabolic conditions (CAP score 263, OR: 2.61, 95%CI: 1.51-4.50, and CAP score 285, OR: 3.31, 95%CI: 1.85-5.96). Sarcopenic obesity was also associated with higher odds of having NAFLD-associated significant fibrosis (OR 2.22, 95% CI: 1.03-4.80) in the multivariate model. While those with sarcopenic obesity had a higher prevalence of NAFLD-associated cirrhosis, this association did not reach statistical significance.CONCLUSIONS: Sarcopenic obesity was independently associated with an increased risk of NAFLD and NAFLD- associated significant fibrosis independent of well-defined risk factors. Targeted interventions to improve sarcopenic obesity may reduce the risk of NAFLD and NAFLD-associated siginificant fibrosis.

The American journal of gastroenterology 2021; 116 (5): 1053-62 Abstract INTRODUCTION: Recent trends in the incidence and mortality of biliary tract cancers are unknown. We estimated the trends in biliary tract cancers-related incidence and mortality stratified by anatomical site, age, sex, and race/ethnicity in the US adults.METHODS: We performed a population-based trend analysis using the US national incidence (2009-2017) and mortality records (2009-2018). We identified age-standardized incidence and mortality from intrahepatic extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, cancer, and ampulla of Vater cancer using appropriate ICD-10 code. Temporal mortality was calculated by joinpoint trend analysis with estimates of annual percentage change (APC) described as each trend segment.RESULTS: The incidence rates of ICC increased linearly (APC 8.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 7.8%-10.0%) while gallbladder cancer-related incidence rates remained stable early and decreased significantly later in the study (APC -2.8%, 95% CI -5.5% to -0.0% [2014-2017]). Age-standardized mortality from biliary tract cancers steadily increased with an annual increase of 2.0% (95% CI 1.6%-2.3%). Although there was a linear increase ICC-related mortality (APC 3.5%, 95% CI 3.1%-3.8%), extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma-related mortality and increased later (APC 7.0%, 95% CI 4.6%-9.5% [2013-2018]). By contrast, years (APC -1.6%, 95% CI -2.1% to -1.1%). Significant differences in mortality and changes in trends over time were observed in non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic Asians.DISCUSSION: In this analysis of nationally representative data, changing mortality trends in various biliary tract cancers was noted with a disproportionately higher burden of fatality in minorities.

Hepatology communications 2021; 5 (3): 516-525 Abstract Liver transplantation (LT) is definitive treatment for end-stage liver disease. This study evaluated factors predicting successful evaluation in patients transferred for urgent inpatient LT evaluation. Eighty-two patients with cirrhosis were transferred for urgent LT evaluation from January 2016 to December 2018. Alcohol-associated liver disease was the common etiology of liver disease (42/82). Of these 82 patients, 35 (43%) were declined for LT, 27 (33%) were wait-listed for LT, 5 (6%) improved, and 15 (18%) died. Psychosocial factors were the most common reasons for being declined for LT (49%). Predictors for listing and receiving LT on multivariate analysis included Hispanic race (odds ratio [OR], 1.89; P = 0.003), Asian race (OR, 1.52; P = 0.02), non-Hispanic ethnicity (OR, 1.49; P = 0.04), hyponatremia (OR, 1.38; P = 0.04), serum albumin (OR, 1.13; P = 0.01), and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD)-Na (OR, 1.02; P = 0.003). Public insurance (i.e., Medicaid) was a predictor of not being listed for LT on multivariate analysis (OR, 0.77; P = 0.02). Excluding patients declined for psychosocial reasons, predictors of being declined for LT on multivariate analysis included Chronic Liver Failure Consortium (CLIF-C) score >51.5 (OR, 1.26; P = 0.03), acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) grade 3 (OR, 1.41; P = 0.01), hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) (OR, 1.38; P = 0.01), and respiratory failure (OR, 1.51; P = 0.01). Predictors of 3-month mortality included CLIF-C score >51.5 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.52; P = 0.04) and intensive care unit P < 0.001). Conclusion: MELD-Na, albumin, hyponatremia, ACLF grade 3, HRS, respiratory failure, public insurance, Hispanic race, Asian race, and non-Hispanic ethnicity predicted liver transplant outcome. Lack of psychosocial support was a major reason for being declined for LT. The CLIF-C score predicted being declined for LT and mortality.

Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver 2021 Abstract BACKGROUND & AIMS: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been associated with sarcopenia. However, mortality in the setting of NAFLD-related sarcopenia remains undefined. We aim to determine the all-cause and cause-specific mortality from sarcopenia among adults with NAFLD in the United States (US).METHODS: 11,065 individuals in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were studied and linked mortality through 2015 was analyzed. NAFLD was diagnosed based on presence of ultrasonographic hepatic steatosis without other known liver diseases. Sarcopenia was defined as skeletal muscle index determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality, and hazard ratio (HR) adjusted for known risk factors.RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 23 years or more, sarcopenia was associated with increased all-cause mortality (HR 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11-1.44). Only in individuals with NAFLD, sarcopenia was associated with a higher risk for all-cause mortality, while this association was absent in those without NAFLD. Individuals with both sarcopenia and NAFLD had a higher risk for all-cause mortality (HR 1.28 95% CI 1.06-1.55) compared with those without sarcopenia and NAFLD. Furthermore, sarcopenia was associated with a higher risk for cancer- and diabetes-related mortality among those with NAFLD. This association was not noted in those without NAFLD.CONCLUSION: In this nationally representative sample of US adults, sarcopenia was associated with a higher risk for all-cause, cancer- and diabetes-related mortality in individuals with NAFLD.

Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 2021; 118 (14) Abstract Chronic inflammation is thought to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in aging, but whether similar mechanisms underlie dysfunction in infection-associated chronic inflammation is unclear. Here, we profiled the immune proteome, and cellular composition and signaling states in a cohort of aging individuals versus a set of HIV patients on long-term antiretroviral therapy therapy or hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients before and after sofosbuvir treatment. We found shared alterations in aging-associated and infection-associated chronic inflammation including T cell memory inflation, up-regulation of intracellular signaling pathways of inflammation, and diminished sensitivity to cytokines in lymphocytes and myeloid cells. In the HIV cohort, these dysregulations were evident despite viral suppression for over 10 y. Viral clearance in the HCV cohort partially restored cellular sensitivity to interferon-, but many immune system alterations persisted for at least 1 y posttreatment. Our findings indicate that in the HIV and HCV cohorts, a broad remodeling and degradation of the immune system can persist for a year or more, even after the removal or drastic reduction of the pathogen load and that this shares some features of chronic inflammation in aging.

Journal of addiction medicine 2021 Abstract The incidence of opioid-related fatality has reached unparalleled levels across North America. Patients with comorbid hepatitis C virus (HCV) remain the most vulnerable and difficult to treat. Considering the unique challenges associated with this population, we aimed to re-examine the impact of HCV on response to medication assistant treatment for opioid use disorder and establish sex-specific risk factors affecting care.This study employs a multi-center prospective cohort design, with 1-year follow-up. Patients aged 18, receiving methadone for opioid use disorder were recruited from a network of out-patient opioid addiction treatment centers across Southern Ontario, Canada. Patients with 50% positive opioid urine screens over 1 year of follow-up were classified as poor responders. The prognostic impact of HCV on response was established using a propensity score matched analysis. Sex-specific regression models were constructed to evaluate risk factors for treatment response.Among participants eligible for inclusion (n = 1234), HCV was prevalent in 25% (n = 307). HCV patients exhibited significantly higher rates of high-risk opioid consumption patterns 35.29% (standard deviation 0.478). Sex-specific examination revealed females with HCV incur a 2 times increased risk for high-risk opioid consumption behaviors (female odds ratio: 1.95, 95% confidence interval 1.23, 3.10; P = 0.01).Findings from this study establish the link between HCV and poor treatment response, with differentially higher risk among female patients. In light of the high potential for overdose among this population, concerted efforts are required for distinguishing the source for sex-based disparities, in addition to establishing trauma and gender informed treatment protocols.

Clinical and experimental gastroenterology 2021; 14: 457-465 Abstract Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and chronic kidney disease are both chronic conditions with rapidly increasing prevalence and incidence worldwide that haveled to a significant burden on health-care systems. The association between these two disease entities is partly attributed to shared cardiometabolic comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. However, independent of these overlapping risks, there are increased rates and more severe CKD in NAFLD patients. Conversely, more progressive NAFLD is seen with advanced stages of kidney injury. In addition to overlapping risk factors, shared pathogenic mechanisms suggest these two disease entities may resemble different manifestations of a single underlying disease process.

Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology 2021 Abstract IntroductionHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer and the third-leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the world.Areas coveredThis review will discuss risk factors, demographic differences, global trends, and the economic burden of HCC. Viral hepatitis, particularly hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, is the most common underlying liver disease leading to HCC in those with cirrhosis. Other important risk factors include alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, metabolic syndrome, etc. With the introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents for hepatitis C virus infection, routine vaccination against HBV, and increasing support for robust public screening programs, the incidence rates for HCC due to viral hepatitis is falling in many countries. Meanwhile, the prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome are on the rise, as is NAFLD-related HCC incidence. Asia and Africa have the highest incidence rates of HCC. In multiethnic countries, racial and ethnic minorities experience disparities in HCC incidence as well as mortality, representing an essential area for improvement in terms of healthcare inequity.Expert opinionInterventions to minimize the global burden of HCC aim to reduce rates of the most common risk factors and implement effective treatment of underlying etiology and comprehensive screening programs for HCC.

Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver 2021 Abstract With the recent improvement in the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a better understanding of the infection burden is needed. We aimed to (1) estimate the trends in the national prevalence of HCV infection based on the type of health insurance coverage and (2) identify at-risk populations for HCV infection in the United States (US) general population.Population-based analyses using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2013-2018) were performed with a focus on HCV infection. We analyzed the prevalence of HCV infection based on the health insurance status before the direct-acting antiviral (DAA) era (2013-2014) and during the DAA era age-adjusted HCV (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71%-1.19%) in the US non-institutionalized civilian population. While the prevalence of active HCV infection has remained stable, the prevalence of resolved HCV infection has increased after the introduction of DAA. In terms of health insurance coverage, the prevalence of active HCV infection decreased, and the prevalence of resolved HCV infection increased among individuals who had health insurance, especially private health insurance. The independent risk factors of active HCV infection were 40-69 years group, male, less than high school education, unmarried, below poverty status, being born in the US, history of blood transfusion, and not having private health insurance.The burden of active HCV infection has decreased among individuals who had health insurance, especially private health insurance, during the DAA era.

Journal of hepatology 2021 Abstract Recently, international experts have put forward a modified criterion to redefine nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) as metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). It is suspected that outcomes such as mortality may differ for these clinical entities. We studied the impact of MAFLD and NAFLD on the all-cause and cause-specific mortality in US adults.We analyzed data from 7,761 participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and their linked mortality through 2015. NAFLD was diagnosed by ultrasonographic evidence of hepatic steatosis without other known liver diseases. MAFLD was defined based on the criteria proposed by an international expert panel. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to study all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality between MAFLD and NAFLD with adjustments for known risk factors.During a median follow-up of 23 years, individuals with MAFLD had a 17% higher risk for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.32). Furthermore, MAFLD was associated with a higher risk for cardiovascular mortality. NAFLD per se did not increase the risk of all-cause deaths. Individuals who met both definitions were noted to have a higher risk for all-cause mortality (HR: 1.13, 95% and MAFLD had higher estimates for all-cause mortality than those with advanced fibrosis and NAFLD.In this US population-based study, MAFLD was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality, while NAFLD demonstrated no association with all-cause mortality after adjusting for metabolic risk factors.Our findings provide further support to the idea that nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a part of a broader multi-system disease that also includes obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. Therefore, re-defining NAFLD as metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) may provide a better understanding of predictors that may increase the risk of death.

The lancet. Gastroenterology & hepatology 2021 Abstract With the global epidemics of obesity and associated conditions, including type 2 diabetes, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, stroke, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, cancer, and cognitive changes, the prevalence of multimorbidity is rapidly increasing worldwide. In this Review, a panel of international experts from across the spectrum of metabolic diseases come together to identify the challenges and provide perspectives on building a framework for a virtual primary care-driven, patient-centred, multidisciplinary model to deliver holistic care for patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease and associated metabolic diseases. We focus on clinical care and innovative trial design for metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease and associated metabolic diseases. This work represents a call to action to promote collaboration and partnerships between stakeholders for improving the lives of people with, or at risk of, metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease and associated metabolic diseases.

Inflammatory bowel diseases 2020 Abstract BACKGROUND: Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are at increased risk of developing acute cholangitis. The majority of patients with PSC have comorbid inflammatory bowel disease, and many take immunosuppressive medications. The epidemiological risks for the development of acute cholangitis in patients with PSC, including the impact of immunosuppressive therapy, are unknown.METHODS: We conducted a 2-center, retrospective cohort study using data from 228 patients at Stanford University Medical Center and Santa Clara Valley Medical Center (CA), a county health care system. Patient demographics, medications, PSC disease severity, and inflammatory bowel disease status were extracted. Using stepwise variable selection, we included demographic and covariate predictors in the multiple logistic regression model assessing risk factors for cholangitis. Time-to-event analysis was performed to evaluate specific immunosuppressive medications and development of cholangitis.RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of patients had at least 1 episode of acute cholangitis (n = 72). Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy was associated with increased odds of acute cholangitis (odds ratio, 7.29; 95% confidence interval, 2.63-12.43), but immunomodulator use was protective against acute cholangitis (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.76). Anti-TNF therapy was associated with decreased time-to-cholangitis, with a median time of 28.4 months; in contrast, only 11.1% of patients who were prescribed immunomodulators developed cholangitis over the same time period (P < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest that classes of immunosuppressive medications differentially modify the odds of acute cholangitis. Biologic therapy, ie, anti-TNF therapy, was shown to have significantly higher odds for patients developing acute cholangitis whereas immunomodulator therapy was shown to have a potential protective effect. These findings may help guide physicians in decision-making for determining appropriate immunosuppressive therapy.

Clinical and molecular hepatology 2020 Abstract Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a multisystemic disease and a rapidly growing cause of chronic liver disease in children and adults worldwide. Diagnosis and management of extrahepatic manifestations of NAFLD, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea, polycystic ovarian syndrome, hypothyroidism, psoriasis, and extrahepatic malignancy are crucial for the treatment of patients with NAFLD. The leading cause of death in NAFLD is primarily from CVD, followed by liver-related mortality, extrahepatic cancer, liver cancer, and diabetes-related mortality. Therefore, clinicians need to identify high-risk patients earlier in the disease course and be aware of the extrahepatic manifestations of NAFLD to improve liver disease outcomes. In this review, we focus on the monitoring and management of the extrahepatic manifestations of NAFLD.

This was followed by the World Health Organization's (WHO) global targets for the care and management of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. These announcements and targets were important in raising awareness and calling for action; however, tracking countries' progress towards these elimination goals has provided insights to the limitations of these targets. The existing targets compare a country's progress relative to its 2015 values, penalizing countries who started their programmes prior to 2015, countries with a young population, or countries with a low prevalence. We recommend that (1) WHO simplify the hepatitis elimination targets, (2) change to absolute targets and (3) allow countries to achieve these disease targets with their own service coverage initiatives that will have the maximum impact. The recommended targets are as follows: reduce HCV new chronic cases to 5 per 100 000, reduce HBV prevalence among 1-year-olds to 0.1%, reduce HBV and HCV mortality to 5 per 100 000, and demonstrate HBV and HCV year-to-year decrease in new HCV- and HBV-related HCC cases. The objective of our recommendations is not to lower expectations or diminish the hepatitis elimination standards, but to provide clearer targets that recognize the past and current elimination efforts by countries, help measure progress towards true elimination, and motivate other countries to follow suit.

Cancer 2020 Abstract BACKGROUND: Patients from rural and low-income households may have suboptimal access to liver disease care, which may translate into worse HCC outcomes. The authors provide a comprehensive update of HCC incidence and outcomes among US adults, focusing on the effect of rural geography and household income on tumor stage and mortality.METHODS: The authors retrospectively evaluated adults with HCC using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data from 2004 to 2017. HCC incidence was reported per 100,000 persons and was compared using z-statistics. Tumor stage at diagnosis used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results staging system and was evaluated with multivariate logistic regression. HCC mortality was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox proportional hazards methods.RESULTS: HCC incidence plateaued for most groups, with the exception of American Indians/Alaska Natives (2004-2017: APC, 4.17%; P < .05) and patients the lowest household income category (<$40,000; 2006-2017: APC, 2.80%; P < .05). Compared with patients who had HCC in large metropolitan areas with a population >1 million, patients in more rural regions had higher odds of advanced-stage HCC at diagnosis (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.00-1.20; P = .04) and higher mortality (hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08; P = .02). Compared with the highest income group ($70,000), patients with HCC who earned <$40,000 annually had higher odds of advanced-stage HCC (odds ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.01-1.32; P = and higher mortality (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.16-1.31; P < .001).CONCLUSIONS: Patients from rural regions and lower income households had more advanced tumor stage at diagnosis and significantly higher HCC mortality. These disparities likely reflect suboptimal access to consistent high-quality liver disease care, including HCC surveillance.

Gut and liver 2020 Abstract The ongoing obesity epidemic and the increasing recognition of metabolic syndrome have contributed to the growing prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common form of liver disease worldwide. It is imperative to understand the incidence and prevalence of NAFLD as it is associated with a profound economic burden of hospitalizations, including the shifting trends in liver transplantation. The long-term cumulative healthcare cost of NAFLD patients has been shown to be 80% higher than that of non-NAFLD patients. We explore diagnostic challenges in identifying those with NAFLD who have a higher predilection to progress to end-stage liver disease. We aim to assess all-cause and cause-specific mortality as it relates to NAFLD.

Transplantation 2020 Abstract BACKGROUND: The regional impact of COVID-19 on solid organ transplantation in the United States (US) has not been fully evaluated.METHODS: A retrospective analysis of month-to-month trends on waitlist additions, waitlist deaths, and transplant surgeries between all United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) regions was performed. A linear regression model trained on historical data was used to estimate anticipated transplantation volume.RESULTS: All UNOS Regions reported a decrease in total waitlist additions and transplant surgeries. The largest decreases in total transplants were identified in Regions 1,2,6 and 9; with Regions 2, 7, 8 and 9 noting the largest decrease in waitlist additions. Six of the 11 regions noted increases in waitlist deaths, with UNOS Regions 9, 1, and 2, all located within the Northeast, noting the highest percent increase in waitlist deaths at 170%, 89%, and 54%, respectively. The largest reductions in SOT and waitlist deaths were seen in kidney and lung transplantation. Current transplantation volume is significantly lower than the low range of the 95% CI derived from the linear regression model (2182 vs 3110, p<0.05) CONCLUSIONS:: Significant decreases in total waitlist additions and transplant surgeries with increases in waitlist deaths were noted in the majority of US transplant domains. The impact was especially prevalent in areas with high burden of COVID-19 infection. National and regional strategies aimed at minimizing disruptions in transplantation are needed.

Journal of clinical and translational hepatology 2020; 8 (2): is a hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. The spread of obesity worldwide in pandemic proportions has led to a rapid rise of NAFLD in developed and developing countries alike. There are no approved pharmacological agents to treat steatohepatitis or advanced fibrosis but obeticholic acid recently has shown some promise in phase III trial. Currently, NAFLD is the number one etiology for simultaneous liver and kidney transplantation in the USA, second most common indication for liver transplantation (LT) and projected to become number one very soon. LT for NAFLD poses unique challenges, as these patients are generally older, obese and more likely to have a number of metabolic risk factors. Bariatric surgery is an option and can be considered if a structured weight loss program does not achieve the sustained weight loss goal. Comprehensive cardiovascular risk assessment and aggressive management of comorbid conditions are crucial in the LT evaluation process to improve post-transplant survival. Recurrent nonalcoholic steatohepatitis after LT is not uncommon, and thus warrants primary and secondary prevention strategies through a multidisciplinary approach. Prevalence of NAFLD in a donor population is a unique and growing concern that limits the access to quality liver grafts.

To understand the challenges in recognising patients with advanced fibrosis due to NASH and develop a standardised approach to screen these patients, the authors of this document provided their opinions and expertise from practice and published evidence to identify key challenges and current approaches for diagnosing NASH. The severity of liver fibrosis due to NASH is the main indicator of associated morbidity and mortality outcomes. Therefore, identifying patients with, or at risk of, advanced fibrosis due to NASH and linking them to appropriate care is critical. This can be challenging due to a lack of awareness of NASH among healthcare professionals and a lack of standardised protocols for identifying patients. Simple noninvasive tests may provide an opportunity to facilitate early identification of these patients. This article proposes a simple, universally applicable diagnostic algorithm for use in clinical practice, that includes sequential use of noninvasive tests, ideally a biological marker and an imaging technique, which may help to facilitate early diagnosis of these patients. In the opinion of the authors, early detection of advanced fibrosis is fundamental in the efforts to halt the progression of NASH and diagnostic algorithms may facilitate pre-emptive interventions to curtail the disease.

Digestive diseases and sciences 2020 Abstract BACKGROUND: Data on the current estimates of the disease burden of Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile) infection in the setting of end-stage liver disease (ESLD) are emerging.AIMS: We examined the recent trends and predictors of hospitalizations and in-hospital mortality from C. difficile infection among hospitalizations with ESLD in the USA.METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis using the National Inpatient Sample, 2005-2014. We defined ESLD and C. difficile infection using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the risk factors that impacted hospitalization and mortality.RESULTS: The prevalence of coding for C. difficile infection in decompensated cirrhosis increased from 1.3% in 2005 to 2.7% in 2014, with an annual rate of 7.8%. In hospitalizations with hepatocellular carcinoma, C. difficile infection increased steadily from 1.0 to 1.7% with an annual incremental rate of 6.4%. Among hospitalizations with ESLD, each passing 2-year period, increasing age, female, higher Charlson index, accompanying infection, hepatorenal syndrome, and ascites were associated with C. difficile infection. Although C. difficile infection was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality during hospitalization with decompensated cirrhosis (odds ratio 1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.44-1.63), the proportion of in-hospital mortality during hospitalization with C. difficile infection and decompensated cirrhosis decreased from 15.4% in 2005 to 11.1% in 2014, with an annual rate of -3.1% (95% CI -5.7% to -0.3%).CONCLUSIONS: While the prevalence of C. difficile infection in hospitalized patients with ESLD increased approximately twofold, the in-hospital mortality decreased significantly during the past decade.

Clinical transplantation 2020: e14128 Abstract Long waiting times due to ongoing organ shortage has led to increased utilization of locoregional therapies (LRTs) to bridge patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to liver transplantation (LT). We performed this study to evaluate the impact of LRTs on post-LT outcomes. We conducted a retrospective study of patients who were transplanted for HCC at Stanford University Hospital between 2008 and 2018 (n = 302). We found that receipt of 5 LRTs was an independent and significant predictor of poor overall 5-year survival (58.3% vs. 83.3%; HR 2.26, p = 0.03), poor recurrence-free 5-year survival (51.9% vs. 80.4%; HR 2.12, p = 0.03), and was associated with higher rates of recurrence (25.0% vs. 7.4%, p = 0.001). Moreover, recurrent HCC was more likely to be the cause of death (58.3% vs. 41.7%, p = 0.04) in patients who received 5 LRTs. Also, patients who required 5 LRTs showed an overall lower rate of radiological complete response (46.9% vs. 97.8%, p = 0.001) and were more likely to have more advanced pathological stage tumors in the explant (65.6% vs. 29.6%, p < 0.001). In conclusion, receipt of 5 bridging LRTs prior to LT is associated with worse post-transplant clinical outcomes.

Digestive diseases and sciences 2020 Abstract The prevalence, characteristics, burden and trends of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) hospitalizations in the USA remain unclear.We identified primary PBC hospitalizations from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) 2007 through 2014 using ICD-9-CM codes. We calculated the rates and trends of hospitalization for PBC per 100,000 US population among each gender (males and females) and racial categories (Whites, Blacks, Hispanics and other racial minorities), and measured the predictors of hospitalization, and of mortality, charges and length of stay (LOS) among PBC hospitalizations.There were 8460 (weighted: 41,191) PBC hospitalizations between 2007 and 2014. The mean national PBC hospitalization rate was 2.2 cases per 100,000 population (2.2/100,000), increasing from 1.7/100,000 (2007) to 2.5/100,000 (2014). From 2007 to 2014, the in-hospital mortality and LOS were unchanged while the charges increased from $65,993 to $73,093 ($225 million to $447 million overall expenses). Compared to Whites, the PBC hospitalization rate was 12% higher among Hispanics (RR: 1.12 53% lower in Blacks (RR: 0.47 5% lower among other racial minorities (0.95 [0.91-0.99]). The rate was higher among females (RR:4.02 [3.93-4.12]) compared to males. On multivariate analysis, Blacks and other racial minorities, respectively, had higher odds of mortality (AOR: 1.47 [1.03-2.10] and 1.33 [0.96-1.84]), while other racial minorities had longer LOS (7.0 vs. 5.6 days) and higher hospital charges ($48,984 vs. $41,495) when compared to Whites.The hospitalization rate and burden of PBC in the USA have increased disproportionately among females and Hispanics with higher mortality in Blacks.

Drug and alcohol dependence 2020; 209: 107917 Abstract Despite the demonstrated benefit of methadone, the incidence opioid-related overdose, and its associated mortality continues to rise at an alarming rate. The impact of high prevalence comorbid features such as chronic liver disease (CLD) on methadone treatment response remain unclear.To determine whether CLD is associated with poor response to methadone treatment.Using a well-established multi-center cohort from the Genetics of Opioid Addiction Study (GENOA), we evaluated if presence of CLD among 1234 eligible patients with opioid use disorder receiving methadone treatment impacted health and behavioural responses to treatment. CLD was classified as any liver disorder/dysfunction present for a minimum period of six months. Serial urine toxicology assessments were used to determine treatment response. The effect of CLD was determined using a multi-variable logistic regression model.CLD was present in 25 % (n = 314) of the population. On average, patients with CLD were found to be older (mean age 44 vs 36 years, p < 0.0001), unemployed (81.8 % vs 61 %, p < 0.0001), and receiving government disability benefits at significantly higher rates (21.9 % vs 11 %, p < 0.0001). Increased levels of physical craving, emotional stress, as well as health risk behaviors were noted in CLD patients. Findings from the multi-variable model demonstrate a 68 % increased risk for dangerous opioid consumption behaviors (Odds Ration [OR]: 1.68, 95 % Confidence Interval [CI] 1.22, 2.31, p = 0.001) among patients with CLD. Methadone dose (OR: 0.76, 95 % CI 0.70, 0.81, p < 0.0001) was shown to be protective with a significant risk reduction of 24 % per 20 mg increase in methadone. Duration in treatment was also found to be protective (OR: 0.99, 95 % CI 0.97, 0.99, p < 0.0001).CLD poses a distinct risk for patients with opioid addiction. Closer drug monitoring, and substance use contingency management should be considered to reduce mortality risk in these patients.

Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association 2020 Abstract The association between physical activity (PA) and all-cause and cause-specific mortality from nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) requires investigation. We studied whether PA, measured by accelerometer, is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality among individuals with NAFLD.We performed a longitudinal analysis using the 2003-2006 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data of adults (20 years or older) and collecting mortality data through December 2015. NAFLD was defined based on hepatic steatosis index or US fatty liver index scores, in the absence of other causes of chronic liver disease. PA was measured from participants who wore accelerometers 10 hrs/day for a minimum of 4 days over a 7-day period and classified as total PA, moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA), and sedentary behavior.Over an average follow-up period of 10.6 years, increasing duration of total PA was associated with reduced risk of death, from any cause, in an age- and sex-adjusted model (hazard ratio [HR], 0.52; 95% CI, for quartile vs trend=.001) and multivariable model (HR, 0.46, 95% CI 0.28-0.75; P for trend<.001) among individuals with NAFLD. Increasing duration of MVPA was associated with a lower risk of death from any cause in individuals with NAFLD. Furthermore, longer total PA was associated with a lower risk for cardiovascular disease-related death in individuals with NAFLD (HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.08-0.98 for highest quartile vs lowest quartile; P for trend=.007). We did not find this association for cancer-related mortality in individuals with NAFLD. Increasing duration of sedentary behavior did not affect all-cause or cause-specific mortality in individuals with NAFLD.Longer total PA and MVPA, measured by accelerometers over a 7-day period, are associated with lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in individuals with NAFLD.

Using US Census and national mortality records (2009-2018), we identified deaths with HCV infection, ALD, and drug overdose. HCV-related mortality without drug overdose increased up to 2014, followed by a marked decrease. Mortality from HCV and drug overdose increased significantly. Whereas ALD-related mortality without drug overdose continued to rise, no significant trend from ALD with drug overdose was noted. HCV-related mortalities reduced after the introduction of DAA agents, while drug overdose-related mortality was constantly increased.

We now show that the very early innate response also has an immunosuppressive component. Infected cells upregulate the CD47 \"don't eat me\" signal, which slows the phagocytic uptake of dying and viable cells as well as downstream antigen-presenting cell (APC) functions. A CD47 mimic that acts as an essential virulence factor is encoded by all poxviruses, but CD47 expression on infected cells was found to be upregulated even by pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that encode no mimic. CD47 upregulation was revealed to be a host response induced by the stimulation of both endosomal and cytosolic pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs). Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines, including those found in the plasma of hepatitis C patients, upregulated CD47 on uninfected dendritic cells, thereby linking innate modulation with downstream adaptive immune responses. Indeed, results from antibody-mediated CD47 blockade experiments as well as CD47 knockout mice revealed an immunosuppressive role for CD47 during infections with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis Since CD47 blockade operates at the level of pattern recognition receptors rather than at a pathogen or antigen-specific level, these findings identify CD47 as a novel potential immunotherapeutic target for the enhancement of immune responses to a broad range of infectious agents.IMPORTANCE Immune responses to infectious agents are initiated when a pathogen or its components bind to pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRR binding sets off a cascade of events that activates immune responses. We now show that, in addition to activating immune responses, PRR signaling also initiates an immunosuppressive response, probably to limit inflammation. The importance of the current findings is that blockade of immunomodulatory signaling, which is mediated by the upregulation of the CD47 molecule, can lead to enhanced immune responses to any pathogen that triggers PRR signaling. Since most or all pathogens trigger PRRs, CD47 blockade could be used to speed up and strengthen both innate and adaptive immune responses when medically indicated. Such immunotherapy could be done without a requirement for knowing the HLA type of the individual, the specific antigens of the pathogen, or, in the case of bacterial infections, the antimicrobial resistance profile.

The American journal of gastroenterology 2020 Abstract Higher levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the euthyroid state can negatively affect the metabolic health, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We studied the effect of TSH levels in the setting of normal levels of thyroid hormone on all-cause and cause-specific mortality stratified by NAFLD status.The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III from 1988 to 1994 and NHANES III-linked mortality data through 2015 were used. NAFLD was defined as ultrasonographically diagnosed hepatic steatosis without coexisting liver diseases. Subclinical hypothyroidism was defined as a TSH level over 4.5 mIU/L and \"low-normal\" thyroid function as higher TSH level (2.5-4.5 mIU/L) within the euthyroid reference range. The Cox proportional hazard model analyzed the all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality.In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, individuals with low thyroid function demonstrated an association with NAFLD in a dose-dependent manner. During a median follow-up of 23 years, low thyroid function was associated with increased all-cause mortality only in the univariate model. Low thyroid function was associated with a higher risk for all-cause mortality in individuals with NAFLD and not in those without NAFLD. Furthermore, low thyroid function was associated with a higher risk for cardiovascular mortality in the entire population and among those with NAFLD but demonstrated no association with the non-NAFLD group.In this large nationally representative sample of American adults, low thyroid function was associated with NAFLD and a predictor of higher risk for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in individuals with NAFLD.

Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association 2020 Abstract The profile of chronic liver disease (CLD) in the United States has changed due to obesity trends and advances in treatment of viral hepatitis. We assessed liver transplant listing trends by CLD etiology.Adult candidates for liver transplantation were selected from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (2002 through 2019). We calculated proportion trends for common CLD etiologies at time of placement on the wait list, including chronic infection with hepatitis B virus, chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH, including cryptogenic cirrhosis), alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) without or with chronic HCV infection, autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis, in patients with and without hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).From the 168,441 patients with known etiology and non-acute liver failure on the liver transplant waitlist, 27,799 patients (16.5%) had HCC. In 2002, the most common etiologies in patients without HCC were chronic HCV infection (37%) and ALD (16%), whereas only 5% had NASH. Among patients with HCC, 58% had chronic HCV infection and 10% had ALD and only 1% had NASH. In 2019, among patients without HCC, NASH was the second leading indication for liver transplantation (28% of patients), after ALD (38% of patients). Among patients with HCC, chronic HCV infection remained the leading indication (40% of patients) but NASH (24% of patients) surpassed ALD (16% of patients) to become the second leading indication. NASH was the leading indication in women without HCC (34%), in patients older than 54 years (36%), and in patients on Medicare (41%). In trend analysis, NASH was the most rapidly increasing indication for liver transplantation in patients without HCC (Kendall tau=0.97; P<.001) and in patients with HCC (tau=0.94; P<.0001).In an analysis of data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (2002 through 2019), we found NASH to be the second most common indication for liver transplant in 2019, and the fastest increasing indication. In 2019, NASH was the leading indication for liver transplantation among women without HCC.

Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine the association between COVID-19 and liver injury.A systematic literature search of indexed databases including, PubMed, Medline, and Embase databases from inception to 14 April 2020, was used to identify studies that reported data of liver chemistry in patients diagnosed with COVID 19. The overall prevalence of abnormal liver chemistry and relevant 95% confidence interval was used to estimate the pooled results studies.Sixty-four studies with 11 245 patients with COVID-19 were included. The pattern of abnormal liver enzymes was notable for higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) than alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. The overall global prevalence of elevated AST, ALT, total bilirubin, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase was 23.2, 21.2, 9.7, 15.0, and 4.0%, respectively. The prevalence of elevated AST was substantially higher among those with severe cases (45.5%) compared to non-severe cases (15.0%). Co-existing chronic liver disease presented up to 37.6% of patients with COVID-19.A fourth of COVID-19 patients had elevated liver enzymes and associated with disease severity. Our study may be used as a guide for clinicians and epidemiologists to proactively identify other sources of injury and illness in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Intensive monitoring for liver injury may be needed in cases with severe COVID-19.

Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society 2020 Abstract The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is growing in the US, especially among the elderly. Older patients are increasingly getting transplanted for HCC, but the impact of advancing age on long-term post-transplant outcomes is not clear. To study this, we used data from the US Multicenter HCC Transplant Consortium (UMHTC) of 4980 patients. We divided the patients into 4 groups by age at transplantation- 18-64 (n = 4001), 65-69 (n = 683), 70-74 (n = 252) and 75 years (n = 44). There were no differences in HCC tumor stage, type of bridging locoregional therapy or explant residual tumor between the groups. Older age was confirmed to be an independent and significant predictor of overall survival even after adjusting for demographic, etiologic and cancer-related factors on multivariable analysis. A dose-response effect of age on survival was observed, with every 5-year increase in age over 50 years resulting in an absolute increase of 8.3% in the mortality rate. Competing risk analysis revealed that older patients experienced higher rates of non-HCC-related mortality (p = 0.004), and not HCC-related death (p = 0.24). To delineate the precise cause of death, we further analyzed a single-center cohort of patients transplanted for HCC (n = 302). Patients older than 65 years had a higher incidence of de-novo cancer (18.1% vs 7.6%, p = 0.006) after transplantation and higher overall cancer-related mortality (14.3% vs 6.6%, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Even carefully selected elderly patients with HCC have significantly worse post-transplant survival, which are mostly driven by non-HCC related causes. Minimizing immunosuppression and closer surveillance for de novo cancers can potentially improve outcomes in elderly patients transplanted for HCC.

Journal of hepatology 2020 Abstract Among candidates listed for liver transplant (LT), MELD score may not capture acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) severity. Data on interaction between ACLF and MELD score in predicting waitlist (WL) mortality are scanty.UNOS database (01/2002 to 06/2018) on LT listings for adults with cirrhosis and ACLF (without HCC) was analyzed. ACLF grades 1, 2, 3a, and 3b- were defined using modified EASL-CLIF criteria.Of 18,416 candidates with ACLF at listing (mean age 54 years, 69% males, 63% Caucasians), 90-d WL mortality (patient death or being too sick for LT) was 21.6% (18%, 20%, 25%, and 39% for ACLF grades 1, 2, 3a, and 3b respectively). Fine and Gray regression model identified interaction between MELD and ACLF grade, with higher impact of ACLF at lower MELD score. Other variables included candidate's age, gender, liver disease etiology, listing MELD, ACLF grade, obesity, and performance status. A score developed using parameter estimates from the interaction model on the derivation cohort (N=9181) stratified the validation cohort and 36% respectively. Observed versus expected deciles on WL mortality in validation cohort showed good calibration (goodness of fit P=0.98) and correlation (R=0.99).Among selected candidates who are in ACLF at listing, MELD score and ACLF interact in predicting cumulative risk of 90-d WL mortality, with higher impact of ACLF grade at lower listing MELD score. Validating these findings in large prospective studies will support to factor in both MELD and ACLF in prioritizing transplant candidates and allocation of liver grafts.

Journal of clinical and translational hepatology 2020; 8 (4): 454-58 Abstract Chronic liver disease (CLD) is an under-recognized epidemic that continues to increase in prevalence and is a major health concern. Silymarin, the active compound of Silybum marianum (Milk thistle), has historically been used in CLD. A significant barrier to silymarin use is its poor bioavailability. Attempts at improving the bioavailability of silymarin have led to a better understanding of formulation methods, pharmacokinetics, dosing, and associated drug interactions. Clinically, through antioxidative, antifibrotic, anti-inflammatory, antitoxin, anticancerous mechanisms of actions. Despite the use of silymarin being extensively studied in alcoholic liver disease, metabolic-associated fatty liver disease, viral hepatitis, and drug-induced liver injury, the overall efficacy of silymarin remains unclear and more research is warranted to better elucidate the role of silymarin in CLD, specifically regarding its anti-inflammatory effects. Here, we review the current biochemical and clinical evidence regarding silymarin in CLD.

Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver 2020 Abstract Healthy diet has been recommended for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), although it is not clear whether improving diet quality can prevent mortality. We aim to assess the impact of quality of diet on NAFLD and mortality in subjects with and without NAFLD.We performed cohort study using the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1988 to 1994 and linked mortality data through 2015. We used the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) scores to define diet quality, with higher HEI scores (Q4) indicating better adherence to dietary recommendations. NAFLD was defined as ultrasonographic hepatic steatosis.Multivariate analysis showed that subjects with higher diet quality were inversely associated with NAFLD in a dose-dependent manner. During the median follow-up of 23 years, having a higher diet quality was associated with reduction in risk of all-cause mortality in the age, sex, Race/ethnicity-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.71-0.92). Higher diet quality was associated with a lower risk for all-cause mortality in subjects without NAFLD; however, this protective association with diet quality was not noted in those with NAFLD. Furthermore, a high diet quality was associated with a lower risk for cancer-related mortality in the total population and among those without NAFLD. This association was not noted in those with NAFLD.High diet quality was inversely associated with NAFLD and was positively associated with a lower risk for cancer-related and all-cause mortality in those without NAFLD.

Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.) 2020 Abstract In general, physical activity (PA) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) have an inverse association. However, studies assessing the impact of the widely accepted Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (PA Guidelines) on NAFLD are lacking. We performed a serial, cross-sectional analysis among adults by using the 2007-2016 United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. NAFLD and advanced fibrosis were defined by using various noninvasive panels. A PA questionnaire assessed the leisure-time PA, occupation-related PA, transportation-related PA, and total sitting time as sedentary behavior. PA was categorized according to the PA Guidelines. Of the 24,588 individuals (mean age 47.4 years; 47.9% males), leisure-time PA minutes/week) demonstrated 40% lower odds of NAFLD, whereas transportation-related PA was associated with 33% risk reduction in NAFLD. Analysis of total PA and sitting times simultaneously showed a dose-response association between sitting time and NAFLD (P for trend <0.001). Compliance with the PA Guidelines was lower in NAFLD versus non-NAFLD. The trends in compliance with the PA Guidelines for any type of PA remained stable in NAFLD except for a downtrend in transportation-related PA. In contrast, an improvement in compliance with the PA Guidelines for leisure-time was noted in the non-NAFLD cohort. Although PA demonstrated 10% stronger association with risk reduction of NAFLD in women, women showed a lower tendency of meeting the PA guidelines. Trends in total sitting time increased significantly regardless of NAFLD status. Conclusion: Sedentary behavior emerged as an independent predictor of NAFLD. Overall compliance with the PA Guidelines was lower in the NAFLD cohort with sex- and ethnicity-based differences. Implementation of these observations in clinical practice may improve our understanding as well as clinical outcomes.

(4): 362-370 Abstract Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the developed world, with a global prevalence of around 25%. NAFLD is considered to be the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and is strongly associated with obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. Insulin resistance plays a pivotal role in the development of NAFLD-related dyslipidemia, which ultimately increases the risk of premature cardiovascular diseases, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with NAFLD. Insulin affects hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism by hepatic or extrahepatic pathways. Aside from insulin resistance, several other factors also contribute to the pathogenesis of atherogenic dyslipidemia in patients with NAFLD. These include diet composition, gut microbiota and genetic factors, to name a few. The identification of potentially modifiable risk factors of NAFLD is of importance, so as to target those who may benefit from lifestyle changes and to help develop targeted therapies that decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases in patients with NAFLD.

Journal 2019 Abstract BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Body size-metabolic phenotype may help predict whether or not individuals with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) develop advanced liver disease. We studied the association of body size-metabolic phenotype with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and significant fibrosis.METHODS: Our cross-sectional study included 559 subjects (mean age of 53years; women 51%) with biopsy-proven NAFLD. Clinical, genetic, and histological characteristic features of NAFLD were evaluated. The metabolically unhealthy phenotype was defined by the presence of two or more metabolic components, while body size was categorized based on body mass index: obese ( 25kg/m2) or non-obese (< syndrome (MS)-, Obese MS- and non-obese MS+groups demonstrated comparable levels of insulin resistance, adipose tissue insulin resistance indexes, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) areas. The VAT area was significantly higher in the obese MS+group versus obese MS- group. However, the VAT to subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) ratio was highest in the non-obese MS+group. There was no difference in histology MS+, obese MS-, and obese MS+groups. analyses age, sex, smoking status, PNPLA3, TM6SF2, and VAT/SAT areas demonstrated an independent and dose-dependent relationship between the body size-metabolic phenotype and NASH or significant fibrosis.CONCLUSION: The non-obese MS+group displayed similar degree of hepatic histological severity compared to their obese MS- counterparts. Metabolic milieu beyond obesity may play a pathogenic role in non-obese MS+individuals who develop NASH with significant hepatic fibrosis.CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT02206841.

Journal of palliative medicine 2019 Abstract Background/Aims: Patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) have a high risk for readmission. We studied the role of palliative care consultation (PCC) in ESLD-related readmissions with a focus on health care resource utilization in the United States. Methods: We performed a retrospective longitudinal analysis on patients surviving hospitalizations with ESLD from January 2010 to September 2014 utilizing the Nationwide Readmissions Database with a 90-day follow-up after discharge. We analyzed annual trends in PCC among patients with ESLD. We matched PCC to no-PCC (1:1) using propensity scores to create a pseudorandomized clinical study. We estimated the impact of PCC on readmission rates (30- and 90-day), and length of stay (LOS) and cost during subsequent readmissions. Results: Of the 67,480 hospitalizations with ESLD, 3485 (5.3%) received PCC, with an annual increase from 3.6% to 6.7% (p for trend <0.01). The average 30- and 90-day annual readmission rates were 36.2% and 54.6%, respectively. PCC resulted in a lower risk for 30- and 90-day readmissions (hazard On subsequent 30- and 90-day readmissions, PCC was associated with decreased LOS (5.6- vs. 7.4 days and 5.7- vs. 6.9 days, p<0.01) and cost (US $48,752 vs. US $75,810 and US $48,582 vs. US $69,035, p<0.01). Conclusion: Inpatient utilization of PCC for ESLD is increasing annually, yet still remains low in the United States. More importantly, PCC was associated with a decline in readmission rates resulting in a lower burden on health care resource utilization and improvement in cost savings during subsequent readmissions.

Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics 2019 Abstract BACKGROUND: Currently, the relationship between depression and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is not clearly defined.AIM: To determine whether depression is associated with NAFLD and NAFLD-related advanced fibrosis in a large population sample.METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis using the 2007-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database among adults (20years or older) in the United States (US). Depression and functional impairment due to depression were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). NAFLD was defined by utilising the US fatty liver index (USFLI), hepatic steatosis index (HSI) and the fatty liver index (FLI) in the absence of other causes of chronic liver disease. The presence and absence of advanced fibrosis in NAFLD were defined by Fibrosis-4 score.RESULTS: Of the 10484 subjects (mean age 47.0years; 48.8% men), the prevalence of depression and functional impairment due to depression was higher in subjects with NAFLD than in those without. Compared to subjects without depression, those with depression were 1.6-2.2-fold more likely to have NAFLD. In our multivariate analyses, depression_med was associated with increased risk of NAFLD using USFLI (odds ratio [OR] 1.48 95% 2.01 95% CI 1.65-2.48), respectively. The addition of diabetes, obesity and lipid profile to the model reduced the ORs for depression, but the significance persisted. Depression was not associated with NAFLD-related advanced fibrosis.CONCLUSIONS: In a nationally representative sample of US adults, depression was independently associated with NAFLD.

Digestive diseases and sciences 2019 Abstract Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is the fastest-growing indication for the liver transplant and a leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma among patients listed for liver transplantation in the USA. Post-transplant nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis and steatohepatitis are frequent complications of liver transplantation. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis poses a significant challenge in both pre- and post-transplant period due to its association with metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. While optimal therapy is not yet available in the post-liver transplant setting, lifestyle interventions continue to remain as the mainstay of therapy for post-transplant nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Early recognition with protocol biopsies and noninvasive modalities, along with modification of known risk factors, are the most effective methods to curtail the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in the absence of FDA-approved pharmacologic therapy.

Although treatment has generally been centered on reversing metabolic risk factors that increase the likelihood of NAFLD by influencing lifestyle modifications, therapeutic modalities are being studied at the cellular and molecular level. The endocannabinoid system has been of recent focus. The agonism and antagonism of cannabinoid receptors play roles in biochemical mechanisms involved in the development or regression of NAFLD. Exocannabinoids and endocannabinoids, the ligands which bind cannabinoid receptors, have been studied in this regard. Exocannabinoids found in cannabis (marijuana) may have a therapeutic benefit. Our recent study demonstrated an inverse association between marijuana use and NAFLD among adults in the United States. This commentary combines knowledge on the role of the endocannabinoid system in the setting of NAFLD with the findings in our article to hypothesize different potential mechanisms that may influence the inverse relationship between cannabis and NAFLD.

Diabetologia 2019 Abstract AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The determination of diabetes as underlying cause of death by using the death certificate may result in inaccurate estimation of national mortality attributed to diabetes, because individuals who die with diabetes generally have other conditions that may contribute to their death. We investigated the trends in age-standardised mortality due to diabetes as underlying or contributing cause of death and cause-specific mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD), complications of diabetes and cancer among individuals with diabetes listed on death certificates in the USA from 2007 to 2017.METHODS: Using the US Census and national mortality database, we calculated age-standardised mortality due to diabetes as underlying or contributing cause of death and cause-specific mortality rates among adults over 20years with diabetes listed on death certificates. A total of 2,686,590 deaths where diabetes was underlying or contributing cause of death were analysed. We determined temporal mortality rate patterns by joinpoint regression analysis with estimates of annual percentage change (APC).RESULTS: Age-standardised diabetes mortality rates compared among underlying cause of death, contributing cause of death and all-cause mortality were 32.2 vs 75.7 vs 105.1 per 100,000 individuals during the study period. The age-standardised mortality rates due to diabetes as underlying or contributing cause of death declined from 112.2 per 100,000 individuals in 2007 to 104.3 per 100,000 individuals in 2017 with the most pronounced decline noted from 2007 to 2014 (APC -1.4%; 95% CI -1.9%, -1.0%) 95% CI -0.6%, 2.8%). In terms of cause-specific mortality among individuals with diabetes listed on death certificates, the age-standardised mortality rates for CVD declined at an annual rate of 1.2% with a marked decline of 2.3% between 2007 and 2014. Age-standardised diabetes-specific mortality rates as underlying cause of death decreased from 2007 to 2009 (APC -4.5%) and remained stable from 2009 to 2017. Age-standardised mortality rates for cancer steadily decreased with an average APC of -1.4% (95% CI -1.8%, -1.0%) during the 11-year Mortality in the subcategory of CVD demonstrated significant differences.CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Current national estimates capture about 30% of all-cause mortality among individuals with diabetes listed as underlying or contributing cause of death on death certificates. The age-standardised mortality due to diabetes as underlying or contributing cause of death and cause-specific mortality from CVD in individuals with diabetes listed as underlying or contributing cause of death plateaued from 2014 onwards except for hypertensive heart disease and heart failure.

Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver 2019 Abstract BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The relationship between bisphenol A (BPA) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is undefined. We studied the impact of BPA on NAFLD.METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2014 among adults in the United States (US). NAFLD was diagnosed using the hepatic steatosis index (HSI) and the US fatty liver index (USFLI) in the absence of other causes of chronic liver diseases. The first sample using HSI consisted of 7605 adults. The second sample using USFLI consisted of 3631 participants with availability of fasting data.RESULTS: Of the first 7605 participants (mean age 47years, 48.4% male), the prevalence of NAFLD and abnormally (ALT) levels was correlated with urinary BPA levels (P<0.05). Compared to the reference group with lowest quartile of urinary BPA levels, those with the third and fourth quartiles were 81% and 53% more likely to develop NAFLD defined by HSI. In a multivariate model, the ORs for NAFLD in the third and fourth quartiles were 1.69 (95% CI 1.39-2.04) and 1.44 (95% CI 1.19-1.76) respectively (P for trend <0.001). In the second sample using USFLI, high BPA levels (fourth quartile) remained an independent predictor of NAFLD (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.05-1.98, P for trend=0.012).CONCLUSIONS: High levels of urinary BPA were associated with NAFLD in a nationally representative sample of adults in the US. The pathophysiology remains unclear and warrants further investigation.

Medicines (Basel, Switzerland) 2019; 6 (1) Abstract Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a wide spectrum of liver damage from the more prevalent (75%80%) and nonprogressive nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) category to its common and more ominous subset, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NAFLD is now the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the developed world and is a leading indication for liver transplantation in United States (US). The global prevalence of NAFLD is estimated to be 25%, with the lowest prevalence in Africa (13.5%) and highest in the Middle East (31.8%) and South America (30.4%). The increasing incidence of NAFLD has been associated with the global obesity epidemic and manifestation of metabolic complications, including hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. The rapidly rising healthcare and economic burdens of NAFLD warrant institution of preventative and treatment measures in the high-risk sub-populations in an effort to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with NAFLD. Genetic, demographic, clinical, and environmental factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. While NAFLD has been linked with various genetic variants, including PNPLA-3, TM6SF2, and FDFT1, environmental factors may predispose individuals to NAFLD as well. NAFLD is more common in older age groups and in men. With regards to ethnicity, in the US, Hispanics have the highest prevalence of NAFLD, followed by Caucasians and then African-Americans. NAFLD is frequently associated with the components of metabolic syndrome, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Several studies have shown that the adoption of a healthy lifestyle, weight loss, and pro-active management of individual components of metabolic syndrome can help to prevent, retard or reverse NAFLD-related liver damage. Independently, NAFLD increases the risk of premature cardiovascular disease and associated mortality. For this reason, a case can be made for screening of NAFLD to facilitate early diagnosis and to prevent the hepatic and extra-hepatic complications in high risk sub-populations with morbid obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic risk factors.

European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology 2019 Abstract BACKGROUND AND AIM: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may be associated with sarcopenia. This study aims to determine whether sarcopenia is independently associated with NAFLD and advanced fibrosis.PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional data from 11325 participants in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed. NAFLD was defined as the presence of hepatic steatosis from the ultrasound. Sarcopenia was defined as the skeletal muscle index.RESULTS: NAFLD was more common in participants with sarcopenia than in those without (46.7 vs. 27.5%). Univariate analysis showed that (OR): 2.31; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.01-2.64], which remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, metabolic risk factors (OR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.03-1.48). This finding persisted after adjustment for C-reactive protein as a marker of chronic inflammation. NAFLD-associated advanced fibrosis was more common in participants with sarcopenia than in those without (7.8 vs. 1.6%). Sarcopenia was associated with NAFLD-associated advanced CI: Sarcopenia of NAFLD and NAFLD-associated advanced fibrosis independent of well-defined risk factors. Interventions to strengthen muscle mass may reduce the burden of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis.

The aim of this study was to assess the causes of HCC among liver transplant (LT) candidates in the United States.The Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (2002-2016) was used to estimate the trends in prevalence of HCC in LT candidates with the most common types of chronic liver disease: alcoholic liver disease (ALD), chronic hepatitis B (CHB), chronic hepatitis C, and NASH.158,347 adult LT candidates were included. Of these, 26,121 (16.5%) had HCC; this proportion increased from 6.4% (2002) to 23.0% (2016) (trend P < .0001). Over the study period, CHC remained the most common etiology for HCC (65%). The proportions of HCC accounted for by CHC and ALD remained stable (both trend P > .10), the proportion of CHB decreased 3.1-fold (P < .0001), while the proportion of NASH in HCC increased 7.7-fold (from 2.1% to 16.2%; P < .0001). Furthermore, since 2002, the prevalence of HCC in LT candidates with NASH increased 11.8-fold, while this rate increased 6.0-fold in CHB, 3.4-fold in ALD, and 2.3-fold in CHC (all P < .0001); the increasing trend in NASH was steeper than that for any other etiology (P < .0001 in a trend regression model). The proportion of LT candidates with HCC who ultimately received a transplant or died while waiting did not differ between etiologies (P > .05).Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is the most rapidly growing cause of HCC among US patients listed for liver transplantation.

Diseases (Basel, Switzerland) 2019; 7 (1) Abstract Recent breakthrough in our understanding pertaining to the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has pointed to dysregulation or derangement of the gut microbiome, also known as dysbiosis. This has led to growing interest in probiotic supplementation as a potential treatment method for NAFLD due to its ability to retard and/or reverse dysbiosis and restore normal gut flora. A thorough review of medical literature was completed from inception through July 10, 2018 on the PubMed database by searching for key terms such as NAFLD, probiotics, dysbiosis, synbiotics, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). All studies reviewed indicate that probiotics had a beneficial effect in patients with NAFLD and its subset NASH. Results varied between studies, but there was evidence demonstrating improvement in liver enzymes, hepatic inflammation, hepatic steatosis, and hepatic fibrosis. No major adverse effects were noted. Currently, there are no guidelines addressing the use of probiotics in the setting of NAFLD. In conclusion, probiotics appear to be a promising option in the treatment of NAFLD. Future research is necessary to assess the efficacy of probiotics in patients with NAFLD.

Nature communications 2019; 10 (1): 794 Abstract Prolonged exposure of CD8+ T cells to antigenic stimulation, as in chronic viral infections, leads to a state of diminished function termed exhaustion. We now demonstrate that even during exhaustion there is a subset of functional CD8+ T cells defined by surface expression of SIRPalpha, a protein not previously reported on lymphocytes. On SIRPalpha+ CD8+ T cells, expression of co-inhibitory receptors is counterbalanced by expression of co-stimulatory receptors and it is only SIRPalpha+ cells that actively proliferate, transcribe IFNgamma and show cytolytic activity. Furthermore, target cells that express the ligand for SIRPalpha, CD47, are more susceptible to CD8+ T cell-killing in vivo. SIRPalpha+ CD8+ T cells are evident in mice infected with Friend retrovirus, LCMV Clone 13, and in patients with chronic HCV infections. Furthermore, therapeutic blockade of PD-L1 to reinvigorate CD8+ T cells during chronic infection expands the cytotoxic subset of SIRPalpha+ CD8+ T cells.

Hepatology international 2019 Abstract BACKGROUND AND AIM: Advanced fibrosis associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been reported to have a higher risk of hepatic and non-hepatic mortality. We aim to study the recent trends in the prevalence of NAFLD-related advanced fibrosis in a large population sample.METHODS: Cross-sectional data from 28,739 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2005 to 2016 were utilized. NAFLD was defined using the hepatic steatosis index (HSI) and the US fatty liver index (USFLI) in the absence of other causes of chronic liver disease. The presence and absence of advanced fibrosis in NAFLD was determined by the NAFLD fibrosis score, FIB-4 score, and aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio of NAFLD-related advanced fibrosis from 2.6% confidence 2013-2016 model; using (p<0.01). A similar trend was observed in entire NHANES cohort regardless of NAFLD status. While the prevalence of advanced fibrosis increased steadily in non-Hispanic whites through the duration of the study, it leveled off during 2013-2016 in non-Hispanic blacks.CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of advanced fibrosis associated with NAFLD increased steadily from 2005 to 2016. More importantly, race/ethnicity-based temporal differences were noted in the prevalence of NAFLD-related advanced fibrosis during the study.

Gastroenterology 2019 Abstract Trends of mortality associated with extrahepatic complications of chronic liver disease might be changing. We studied trends in mortality from extrahepatic complications of viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease (ALD), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in the United States (US).We performed a population-based study using US Census and the National Center for Health Statistics mortality records, from 2007 through 2017. We identified trends in age-standardized mortality using joinpoint trend analysis with estimates of annual percentage change.The liver-related mortality among patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection increased from 2007 through 2013 and then decreased once patients began receiving treatment with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents, from 2014 through 2017. Among patients with HCV infection, the age-standardized mortality for extrahepatic cancers was 2.6%, for cardiovascular disease was 1.9%, and for diabetes was 3.3%. Among individuals with hepatitis B virus infection, liver-related mortality decreased steadily from 2007 through 2017. During the study age-standardized mortality from hepatitis B virus-related extrahepatic complications increased with an average annual percentage of 2.0%. Although liver-related mortality from ALD continued to increase, mortality from extrahepatic complications of ALD did not change significantly during the 11-year study. Among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the cause of death was most frequently cardiovascular disease, which increased gradually over the study period, whereas liver-related mortality increased rapidly.In an analysis of US Census and the National Center for Health Statistics mortality records, we found that after widespread use of DAA agents for treatment of viral hepatitis, cause-specific mortality from extrahepatic cancers increased, whereas mortality from cardiovascular disease or diabetes increased only among patients with HCV infection.

F1000Research 2019; 8 Abstract The paradigm shift from interferon-based to direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has revolutionized the field of liver transplantation. These advances in effective HCV treatment, along with the persistent shortage in available liver grafts, have encouraged investigators to assess the need for adopting more inclusive donor policies. Owing to the poor outcomes following liver transplantation with recurrent HCV infection, liver transplantation using HCV seropositive donors (non-viremic and viremic) had been restricted. However, as a result of the growing supply of HCV seropositive donors from the recent opioid epidemic along with the advent of efficacious DAA therapy to treat HCV recurrence, there has been an increasing trend to use HCV seropositive donors for both HCV seropositive and seronegative recipients. The review aims to discuss recent advances and associated outcomes related to the use of HCV seropositive grafts for liver transplantation.

Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society 2019 Abstract Morbid obesity is considered a relative contraindication for LT (Liver Transplant). We investigated if BMI (lean vs. obese) is a risk factor for post-LT graft and overall survival in NASH and non-NASH patients.Using the UNOS database, LT recipients from 01/2002 to 06/2013 (age 18 yrs.) with follow up until 2017 were included. The association of BMI categories calculated at LT with graft and overall survival after LT were examined.After adjusting for confounders, all obesity cohorts (Overweight, Class I, Class II, and Class III obesity) among LT recipients for NASH had significantly reduced risk of graft and patient loss at 10 years follow up compared to the lean BMI cohort. In contrast, non-NASH group of LT recipients had no increased risk for graft and patient loss for overweight, Class I, Class II obesity groups, but had significantly increased the risk for graft (p<0.001) and patient loss (p=0.005) in the Class III obesity group.In this retrospective analysis of UNOS database, adult recipients selected for first LT, NASH patients with the lowest BMI have the worse long-term graft and patient survival as opposed to non-NASH patients where the survival was worse with higher BMI.

Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society 2019 Abstract Liver transplantation (LT) for alcohol related hepatitis (AH) remains controversial. We convened a consensus conference to examine various aspects of LT for AH. The goal was not to unequivocally endorse LT for AH; instead it was to propose recommendations for programs that perform or plan to perform LT for AH. Criteria were established to determine candidacy for LT in the setting of AH and included the following: (1) AH patients presenting for the first time with decompensated liver disease that are non-responders to medical therapy without severe medical or psychiatric comorbidities (2) A fixed period of abstinence prior to transplantation is not required (3) Assessment with a multidisciplinary psychosocial team including a social worker and a addiction specialist/mental health professional with addiction and transplantation expertise. Supporting factors include lack of repeated unsuccessful attempts at addiction rehabilitation, lack of other substance use/dependency, acceptance of diagnosis/insight with commitment of patient/family to sobriety and formalized agreement to adhere to total alcohol abstinence and counseling. LT should be avoided in AH patients that are likely to spontaneously recover. Short- and long-term survival comparable to other indications for LT must be achieved. There should not be further disparity in LT either by indication, geography, or other sociodemographic factors. Treatment of alcohol use disorders should be incorporated into pre and post-LT care. The restrictive and focused evaluation process described in the initial LT experience for AH worldwide may not endure as this indication gains wider acceptance at more LT programs. Transparency in selection process is crucial with collection of objective data to assess outcomes and minimize center variation in listing. Oversight of program adherence is important to harmonize listing practices and outcomes.

Journal of investigative medicine high impact case reports 2019; 7: 2324709619836138 Abstract Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a common cause of hepatotoxicity associated with prescription-based and over-the-counter exposure to medications and herbal supplements. Use of unapproved and inadequately tested herbal supplements can cause DILI. Therefore, thorough history-taking on exposure to herbal supplements must be an integral part of clinical evaluation of DILI. Kratom is an herbal supplement or remedy that has been known for its analgesic effects and has also been used for self-treatment of opiate withdrawals. A 52-year-old man was seen for evaluation of yellow discoloration of the eyes and skin. He reported taking kratom for right shoulder strain for at least a couple of months. On workup, his total bilirubin was noted to be 23.2 mg/dL, which peaked at 28.9 mg/dL. He was noted to have mild elevation of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase. Extensive laboratory tests were ordered and known causes of chronic liver disease ruled out. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen was unremarkable without stigmata of portal hypertension or signs of chronic liver disease. He demonstrated no evidence of coagulopathy or hepatic encephalopathy during his illness. He underwent liver biopsy, which demonstrated histologic evidence of acute cholestatic hepatitis highly suspicious of DILI. He was advised to avoid kratom or other herbal supplements in future and prescribed ursodeoxycholic acid with significant improvement in his liver chemistries. Kratom is associated with significant liver enzymes derangements leading to DILI. Kratom is not approved for use in the United States and should be avoided.

The association of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) prior to or at transplant and poor graft and patient outcomes is not well established, particularly among NASH patients who inherently have an increased hypercoagulable profile. Using the United Network for Organ Sharing data set, we analyzed graft and patient outcomes of patients transplanted for the indication of NASH with and without PVT. Of 3689 NASH transplant recipients, the prevalence of PVT was 12% (450 with PVT and 3239 without PVT). NASH transplant recipients with PVT had inferior graft and patient survival compared with NASH transplant recipients without PVT, even after adjusting for recipient and donor demographic characteristics, body mass index, synthetic dysfunction, and presence of diabetes. In a multivariate Cox regression model, NASH transplant recipients with PVT had a 37% increased risk of graft failure (hazard ratio [HR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-1.63; P < 0.001) 31% increased risk of overall death (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.09-1.58; P < 0.001) compared with NASH transplant recipients without PVT at transplant. This difference in graft and patient survival was most pronounced in the early posttransplant period. These results demonstrate that NASH patients with PVT have decreased graft and patient survival independent of recipient and donor factors.

NAFLD is commonly seen in individuals with metabolic abnormalities, such as obesity and insulin resistance, which are closely associated with sarcopenia. Sarcopenia, defined as low muscle mass and impaired muscle function, is associated with NAFLD and worse outcomes in patients with NAFLD. As the world's elderly population and the prevalence of obesity continues to grow at an unprecedented rate, NAFLD and sarcopenia are projected to increase. Given that there are no approved pharmacologic treatments for NAFLD, it is imperative to gain a better understanding of the disease pathophysiology, to guide treatment options. Recent studies have given new insight into sarcopenic obesity, but there is no consensus on its definition. In this review, we attempt to address the impact of sarcopenia and obesity on NAFLD, especially in the elderly population.

Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver 2019 Abstract Current estimates of the population-based disease burden of liver failure or end-stage liver disease (ESLD) are lacking. We investigated recent trends in hospitalizations and in-hospital mortality among patients with ESLD in the United States (US).A retrospective analysis was performed utilizing the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2005 to 2014. We defined ESLD as either decompensated cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), criteria obtained from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision. Nationwide rates of hospitalization and in-hospital mortality were analyzed from 2005 to 2014.Hospitalization rates for decompensated cirrhosis during this period increased from 105.3/100,000 persons to 159.9/100,000 persons. In terms of HCC, hospitalization rates increased from 13.6/100,000 to 22.1/100,000. In patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-related decompensated cirrhosis, the hospitalization rate increased from 13.4/100,000 to 32.1/100,000 with an annual incremental increase of 10.6%, a magnitude two-fold higher than other etiologies. The proportion of NAFLD among hospitalizations with ESLD steadily increased from 12.7% to 20.1% for decompensated cirrhosis while the proportion of chronic hepatitis C (HCV) and alcoholic liver disease (ALD) declined (29.3% to 27.6% for HCV; 39.0% to 37.4% for ALD). Although the overall in-hospital mortality rates for ESLD declined during the study, mortality rates for NAFLD-related decompensated cirrhosis showed no significant change.Among etiologies of chronic liver disease, NAFLD demonstrated the fastest growing rate of hospitalizations in non-HCC patients with ESLD in the US. Our study highlights the need for a focus on NAFLD-related hospitalizations and its impact on resource utilization. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Annals of hepatology 2019 Abstract Three fourths of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected adult patients in the United States (US) are born between 1945 and 1965, also known as baby boomers (BB). Prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is raising in BB due to their advancing age and prolonged HCV infection. We evaluated inpatient hospitalization and mortality in BB associated with HCC.It is a retrospective cohort study utilizing the Healthcare Utilization Project-National Inpatient Sample (HCUP-NIS) database. From 2003 to 2012, top five primary cancer related hospitalization and mortality among BB were studied.Among 48,733 hospitalizations related to HCC in HCUP-NIS database from 2003 to 2012, BB 49.6% (24,210) whereas non-BB 50.4% (24,523). Within BB cohort, the top five cancers with the highest proportion of hospitalizations were HCC (46%), prostate (43%), kidney (41%), pancreas (33%), and bladder (21%). From 2003 to 2012, the proportion of HCC related hospitalizations represented by BB almost doubled (33.5 to 57.8%) whereas there was one-third reduction (66.4 to 42.1%) among non-BB. Similarly, HCC-related inpatient mortality in BB decreased by 28% (6.1 to 2.7 per 100,000 hospitalization) but it remained unchanged in non-BB (11.1 to 10.6). HCC accounted for 2nd highest mortality (4960 total deaths) among hospitalized BB behind pancreatic cancer. HCC related to HCV was disproportionately in compared to non-BB (50.6% vs. 19%; P<0.001).HCC ranks number one among the top five cancers with highest proportion of inpatient burden. Future studies should focus on understanding the underlying reasons for this ominous trend.

Scientific reports 2019; 9 (1): 8312 Abstract Clinical decompensation immediately prior to liver transplantation may affect post-liver transplant (LT) outcomes. Using the serial Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores recorded in the United Network for Organ Sharing national registry (2010-2017), we analyzed post-LT mortality among adult LT recipients based on the degree of fluctuation in MELD score during the 30-day period prior to LT surgery. Delta-MELD (D-MELD) was defined as recipient MELD score at LT minus lowest MELD score within the preceding 30 days. Impact of D-MELD as a continuous and categorical variable (D-MELD 0-4, 5-10, >10) on early, 30-day post-LT mortality was assessed. Overall, a total of 12,785 LT recipients were analyzed, of which 8,862 (67.9%) > 10. pre-operative D-MELD (adjusted HR, 1.07, 95% CI: 1.04-1.10) was associated with higher 30-day post-LT mortality. Moreover, pre-operative D-MELD > 10 was associated with nearly a two-fold increased risk for 30-day post-LT mortality (adjusted HR, 1.89, 95% CI: 1.30-2.77) compared to D-MELD 0-4. The increased risk of pre-LT mortality associated with severity of clinical decompensation assessed by the magnitude of pre-operative D-MELD persists in the early post-LT period.

Gut and liver 2019 Abstract Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease and encompasses a spectrum of pathology from simple steatosis to inflammation and significant fibrosis that leads to cirrhosis. NAFLD and its comorbid conditions extend well beyond the liver. It is a multisystemic clinical disease entity with extrahepatic manifestations such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hypothyroidism, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and psoriasis. Indeed, the most common causes of mortality in subjects with NAFLD are cardiovascular disease, followed by malignancies and then liver-related complications as a distant third. This review focuses on several of the key extrahepatic manifestations of NAFLD and areas for future investigation. Clinicians should learn to screen and initiate treatment for these extrahepatic manifestations in a prompt and timely fashion before they progress to end-organ damage.

Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology 2019 Abstract Studies on association between fatty liver disease and overall mortality have yielded conflicting results. We evaluated the impact of fatty liver disease and advanced fibrosis on overall morality with a focus on body size and abdominal fat distribution measured by computed tomography (CT).We performed a prospective cohort study including 34,080 subjects (mean age, 51.4 years; 58.6% men) who underwent abdominal ultrasonography and fat CT, from 2007 to 2015. Fatty liver was diagnosed by ultrasonography, and advanced fibrosis was defined as high probability of advanced fibrosis based on three noninvasive methods, aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score, and FiB-4 score. Body size was categorized by body mass index into obese (25 kg/m2 ) or nonobese (<25 regression analyses were performed.The prevalence of fatty liver disease was 37.5%, while the prevalence of advanced fibrosis in fatty liver disease was 1.8%. During a median follow-up of 87 months (interquartile range, 62-110), 296 deaths occurred. Fatty liver disease was not associated with higher overall mortality (multivariate-adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-1.34), while increased subcutaneous adiposity was associated with decreased mortality (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.60-0.88). Advanced fibrosis resulted in a 3.5-fold increase in overall mortality (adjusted HR 3.52, 95% CI, 1.86-6.65), which was more pronounced in the nonobese.While fatty liver disease did not impact overall mortality, subcutaneous adiposity was associated with reduced overall mortality. Advanced fibrosis was an independent predictor of increase in overall mortality.

BMJ case reports 2019; 12 (7) Abstract In the USA, mortality associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) continues to rise. Globally, HCC is the third most common cause of cancer-related death. In early stages of HCC, hepatic resection or liver transplantation are the preferred treatment options with a high probability of recurrence-free postoperative course. However, ineffective screening of chronic liver diseases in high-risk populations, poor linkage to care and suboptimal HCC surveillance has led to increasing rates of late-stage HCC at clinical presentation or diagnosis amenable only to palliative and experimental treatment options. Our case is a 66-year-old man with chronic hepatitis C virus infection complicated by cirrhosis and inoperable HCC which was non-responsive to selective intrahepatic trans-arterial chemoembolisation by interventional radiology. Therefore, he was treated with nivolumab immunotherapy and demonstrated normalisation of previously elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels suggestive of at least a partial response to immunotherapy. No adverse events related to nivolumab immunotherapy were encountered.

Digestive diseases and sciences 2019 Abstract Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) can lead to sudden and severe hepatic decompensation necessitating recurrent hospitalizations. We evaluated the trends, predictors, and healthcare cost burden of AH-related readmissions in the USA.Utilizing the National Readmissions Database 2010-2014, we performed a retrospective longitudinal analysis to identify the index readmission with AH for up to 90 days after discharge. Annual trends of 30- and 90-day AH-related readmissions were calculated. Predictors of 30- and 90-day readmission were determined by multivariate logistic regression. Annual healthcare cost burden associated with AH-linked (36.6%) were readmitted in 30 and 90 day, respectively, with rates that were statistically unchanged from 2010 to 2014. Predictors of 30-day readmissions included female gender, hepatitis C virus infection, cirrhosis, ascites, acute kidney injury, urinary tract infection, history of bariatric surgery, chronic pancreatitis, and high medical comorbidity index. Acute pancreatitis and palliative care consultation were associated with a lower risk of 30-day readmission. Predictors of 90-day readmission were similar to risk factors for 30-day readmission. From 2010 to 2014, the annual cost (and total hospitalization days) burden increased in 2014 to $164 million (22,244 days) and $321 million (42,772 days) for 30- and AH-related readmissions, respectively.Despite relatively stable trends in AH-related readmission, the total LOS and cost has been rising. A target-directed approach with a focus on high-risk subpopulations may help understand the unique challenges associated with the rising cost of AH-related readmissions.

Journal of clinical and translational hepatology 2018; 6 (4): 420-24 Abstract In parallel with the rising prevalence of metabolic syndrome globally, nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) disease is the most common chronic liver disease in Western countries and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has become increasingly associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. Recent studies have identified NASH as the most rapidly growing indication for liver transplantation (LT). As a hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, NAFL disease can be histologically divided into NAFL and NASH. NAFL is considered a benign condition, with histological changes of hepatocyte steatosis but without evidence of hepatocellular injury or fibrosis. This is distinct from NASH, which is characterized by hepatocyte ballooning and inflammation, and which can progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure. As for any other end-stage liver disease, LT is a curative option for NASH after the onset of decompensated cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Although some studies have suggested increased rates of sepsis and cardiovascular complications in the immediate postoperative period, the long-term posttransplant survival of NASH cases is similar to other indications for LT. Recurrence of NAFL following LT is common and can be challenging, although recurrence rates of NASH are lower. The persistence or progression of metabolic syndrome components after LT are likely responsible for NASH recurrence in transplanted liver. Therefore, while maintaining access to LT is important, concerted effort to address the modifiable risk factors and develop effective screening strategies to identify early stages of disease are paramount to effectively tackle this growing epidemic.

Hepatology international 2018 Abstract BACKGROUND AND AIMS: While the association between platelet activation and hepatic fibrosis has been previously demonstrated in animal studies; the utility of anti-platelet agents in reversing the progression of hepatic fibrosis requires further review. Utilizing systematic review methods, we provide to our knowledge the first meta-analysis combining evidence from all studies aimed to establish the effect of anti-platelet agents in the prevention of hepatic fibrosis.METHODS: We searched Medline, EMBASE and PubMed databases from inception to October 2018 to identify all studies aimed at evaluating the role of anti-platelet agents in the prevention of hepatic fibrosis. The primary outcome was hepatic fibrosis. The initial title, abstract, and full-text screening were performed in duplicate. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A fixed-effect generic inverse variance method was used to create a pooled estimate of the odds of hepatic fibrosis in patients with anti-platelet agents versus without anti-platelet agents.RESULTS: Among the 2310 unique articles identified during the title screening, 4 studies with a combined population of 3141 patients were deemed eligible for inclusion into the meta-analysis establishing the effect of anti-platelet agents on hepatic fibrosis. One study failed to report their findings in the entire cohort, electing to instead summarize the effects of anti-platelets within subgroups categorized by fibrotic risk factors. Use of anti-platelets was associated with 32% decreased odds of hepatic fibrosis, (adjusted pooled OR 0.68; CI 0.56-0.82, p0.0001). The statistical heterogeneity among the studies was insignificant.CONCLUSION: Use of anti-platelet agents is associated with the decreased odds of hepatic fibrosis. Due to limited evidence, future high-quality randomized controlled trials with larger comparative samples are required to further delineate the potential beneficial effects of these drugs in preventing hepatic fibrosis.

Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association 2018 Abstract BACKGROUND & AIMS: Non-alcoholic and alcohol-related fatty liver disease are overlapping diseases in which metabolic syndrome and alcohol consumption each contribute to progressive liver disease. We aimed to assess the effects of alcohol consumption and metabolic syndrome on mortality in individuals with fatty liver.METHODS: We searched the National Health and Nutrition and Examination Survey III for adults (20-74 years old) with hepatic steatosis, detected by ultrasound, for whom mortality and follow-up data were available. We collected data from the alcohol use questionnaire (self-reported number of days a participant drank alcohol; the number of drinks [10 g alcohol] per day on a drinking day; the number of days the participant had 5 or more drinks) and calculated the average amount of alcohol consumption in drinks/day for each participant during the year preceding enrollment. Excessive alcohol consumption for men was >3 drinks/day and for women was >1.5 drinks/day. We also collected clinical data, and mortality data were obtained from the National Death Index. Demographic and clinical parameters were compared among consumption groups using the chi2 test for independence or survey regression models. We used Cox proportional hazard models to identify independent predictors of all-cause and cause-specific mortality.RESULTS: The study cohort included excessive alcohol use). There was no significant difference in mean age between individuals with vs without excessive alcohol consumption (P=.65). However, overall mortality was significantly higher among participants with excessive alcohol consumption (32.2%) vs participants with non-excessive alcohol use (22.2%) after mean 20 years of follow up (P=.003), as well as after 5 years of follow up. In multivariate analysis, the presence of metabolic syndrome (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12-1.83) and excessive alcohol consumption (aHR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.21-2.66) were independently associated with an increased risk of death in individuals with hepatic steatosis; any lower average amount of alcohol consumption was not associated with mortality (all P>.60). In a subgroup analysis, the association of excessive alcohol use with mortality was significant in individuals with metabolic syndrome (aHR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.40-4.32) but not without it (P=.74).CONCLUSION: In review of data from the National Health and Nutrition and Examination Survey III, we associated alcohol consumption with increased mortality in participants with fatty liver and metabolic syndrome. These findings indicate an overlap between non-alcoholic and alcohol-related fatty liver disease.

American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons 2018 Abstract In the context of organ shortage, the opioid epidemic, and effective direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy for hepatitis C (HCV), more HCV-infected donor organs may be used for liver transplantation. Current data regarding outcomes after donor-derived HCV in previously non-viremic liver transplant recipients are limited. Clinical data for adult liver transplant recipients with donor-derived HCV infection from March 2017 to January 2018 at our institution were extracted from the medical record. Ten patients received livers from donors known to be infected with HCV based on positive nucleic acid testing (NAT). Seven had a prior diagnosis of HCV and were treated before liver transplantation. All recipients were non-viremic at the time of transplantation. All 10 recipients derived hepatitis C infection from their donor and achieved sustained virologic response at 12 weeks post-treatment (SVR-12) with DAA-based regimens, with a median time from transplant to treatment initiation of 43 days (IQR 20-59). There have been no instances of graft loss or death, with median follow-up of 380 days (IQR 263-434) post-transplant. Transplantation of HCV-viremic livers into non-viremic recipients results in acceptable short-term outcomes. Such strategies may be used to expand the donor pool and increase access to liver transplantation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association 2018 Abstract BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is known about trends in mortality among Hispanic subpopulations and etiologies of chronic liver disease (CLD). We investigated trends in mortality of CLD among the 3 largest Hispanic subgroups based on origin (Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans) in the United States (US) from 2007 to 2016.METHODS: We collected data from the US Census and national mortality database, calculated age-standardized mortalities for CLD among Hispanic subgroups, and compared these with non-Hispanic whites. We determined mortality rate patterns by joinpoint analysis with estimates of annual percentage change.RESULTS: Hispanics were relatively younger with a lower likelihood of high school education than non-Hispanic whites at time of death. Puerto Ricans had the highest rates of age-standardized hepatitis C virus-related mortality in 2016, followed by non-Hispanic whites, Mexicans, and Cubans. Age-standardized mortality rates associated with hepatitis B virus infection decreased steadily among all subjects. Age-standardized mortality rates from alcoholic liver disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease among non-Hispanic whites and all Hispanics increased and accelerated. Mexicans had the highest rates of age-standardized alcoholic liver disease-related mortality, followed by non-Hispanic whites, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans. Cirrhosis- and hepatocellular carcinoma-related mortality rates increased steadily from 2007 to 2016, with the highest among Puerto Ricans and non-Hispanic whites and Mexicans, and lowest in Cubans.CONCLUSIONS: We found high levels of heterogeneity in CLD-related mortality patterns among the 3 largest Hispanic subgroups. Therefore, combining Hispanics as an aggregate group obscures potentially meaningful heterogeneity in etiology-specific CLD-related mortality rates among Hispanic subgroups.

Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics 2018 Abstract BACKGROUND: Long term renal safety of antiviral agents against hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been debated.AIM: To compare longitudinal trends of renal function among HBV mono-infected patients (ADV) in comparison to untreated subjects.METHODS: A retrospective cohort consisting of 815 patients with chronic HBV infection was constructed. Serial estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was compared to the expected rate of age-dependent decline in eGFR, derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Generalised estimating equations and linear mixed-effects models were used to compare trends in eGFR (in mL/min/1.73m2 as a \"unit\").RESULTS: In NHANES data (n=23051), each year of age was associated with a 0.86 unit decrease in eGFR in subjects without hypertension and 0.96 units with hypertension. The Stanford cohort consisted of patients who received ETV (n=207), TDF (n=191), ADV (n=46) 4.0 (interquartile range: 1.9-6.5) years, there was no significant difference in the expected and observed rates of eGFR decline in untreated HBV patients. Patients receiving antiviral treatment experienced steeper reduction in renal function than expected. In the multivariable model, ETV was associated with eGFR loss at 1.81 units per year (P=0.06, compared to untreated patients). TDF- and ADV-treated patients experienced significantly higher rate of eGFR loss at 2.21 and 2.63 units per year, respectively (both P<0.01).CONCLUSION: In this longitudinal cohort study, HBV patients receiving antiviral therapy, particularly TDF and ADV, experienced more rapid loss in eGFR.

Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society 2018 Abstract BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis(NASH) is one of the top three indications for liver transplantation in western countries. It is unknown whether renal dysfunction at the time of liver transplantation has any effect on post-liver transplantation outcomes in recipients with NASH.METHODS: From the United Network for Organ Sharing-Standard Transplant Analysis and Research(UNOS-STAR) dataset, we identified 4,088 NASH recipients who received deceased donor liver transplant. We divided our recipients a priori into three categories: Group I with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)<30 ml/min/1.73m2 at the time of LT and/or received dialysis within 2 weeks preceding LT(n=937); Group II included recipients who had eGFR30 ml/min/1.73m2 and did not receive renal replacement therapy prior to LT(n=2,812); and Group III included recipients who underwent SLK transplantation(n=339). We examined the association of pre-transplant renal dysfunction with death with functioning graft, all-cause mortality, and graft loss using competing risk regression and Cox proportional hazards models.RESULTS: The mean\u00b1SD age of the cohort at baseline was 58\u00b18 years, 55% were male, 80% were Caucasian, and average exception MELD score was 24\u00b19. The median follow-up period was 5 years (median=1,816 days, interquartile range (IQR):1,090-2,723 days). Compared to Group I recipients, Group II recipients had 19% reduced trend for risk for death with functioning graft[Sub-Hazard Ratio(SHR)(95% CI):0.81(0.64-1.02)] and similar risk for graft loss [SHR(95% CI):1.25(0.59-2.62)] while Group III recipients had similar risk for death with functioning graft[SHR(95% CI):1.23(0.96-1.57)] and graft loss [SHR(95% CI):0.18(0.02-1.37)] using adjusted competing risk regression model.CONCLUSIONS: Recipients with preserved renal function before liver transplantation showed trend toward lower risk of death with functioning graft compared to SLK recipients and those with pre-transplant severe renal dysfunction in patients with NASH.

Transplantation 2018 Abstract BACKGROUND: In the United States, alcoholic liver disease (ALD) has recently become the leading indication for liver transplantation (LT).METHODS: Using the United Network for Organ Sharing registry, we examined temporal trends in adult liver transplant waitlist registrants and recipients with chronic liver disease (CLD) due to ALD from 2007 to 2016.RESULTS: From 2007 to 2016, ALD accounted for 20.4% (18 399) of all CLD waitlist (WL) additions. The age-standardized ALD WL addition rate was 0.459 per 100 000 US population in 2007; nearly doubled to 0.872 per 100 000 US population in 2016 and increased with an average annual percent change of 47.56% (95% CI: 30.33% to 64.72%).The ALD WL addition rate over twofold among young (18-39 years) and middle-aged (40-59 years) adults during the study period. Young adult ALD WL additions presented with a higher severity of liver disease including Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score compared to middle aged and older adults (> 60 years). The number of annual ALD WL deaths readily rose from 2014 to 2016, despite an overall annual decline in all CLD WL deaths. Severe hepatic encephalopathy, low BMI (< for 1-year waitlist mortality.CONCLUSION: ALD-related WL registrations and LT have increased over the past decade with a disproportionate increase in young and middle-aged adults. These subpopulations within the ALD cohort need to be evaluated in future studies to improve our understanding of factors associated with these alarming trends.

Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver 2018 Abstract AIMS: We compared (1) demographic and clinical characteristics, and (2) determinants of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and significant fibrosis in non-obese and obese NAFLD.METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 664 Asian subjects (mean age 53.1 years; men 50.3%) with biopsy-proven NAFLD and controls was conducted. Subjects were divided by their body mass index (BMI) into non-obese controls and obese NAFLD subjects for BMI, sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD), aminotransferase levels, insulin resistance, and abdominal visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area. There was no significant difference in histology between non-obese and obese subjects with NAFLD except for lower grade of hepatic steatosis in non-obese NAFLD and higher severity of in non-obese NASH. Predictors of NASH in non-obese included females (odds ratio [OR] 2.49), higher alanine aminotransferase (OR 1.03), lower high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (OR 0.96), higher prevalence of diabetes (OR 3.65) and higher VAT area (OR 1.63 per SD increase of VAT), while age (OR 1.04), higher aspartate aminotransferase (OR 1.02), diabetes (OR 2.76,), and higher VAT area (OR 1.57 per SD increase) were associated with significant fibrosis in the non-obese. SAD was independently associated with NASH or significant fibrosis among non-obese NAFLD subjects.CONCLUSION: While there were a few phenotypic differences from obese subjects, non-obese subjects with NAFLD displayed a similar severity of histological liver damage. Potential factor(s) beyond obesity may play a role as non-obese NAFLD advances to more severe disease. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Diseases (Basel, Switzerland) 2018; 6 (4) Abstract As a chronic disease encompassing a wide spectrum of liver-related histologic damage, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming a global epidemic with significant impacts on all-cause morbidity and mortality. Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus predispose individuals to NAFLD and related complications. Therefore, timely intervention with anti-diabetic medications may prevent and delay the development of NAFLD or have a therapeutic implication. The focus of this review is to evaluate the evidence supporting the efficacy of anti-diabetic medications in the treatment of NAFLD. While many of these anti-diabetic agents have shown to improve biochemical parameters, their effect on hepatic histology is limited. Among anti-diabetic medications, only thiazolidinediones and peptide-1 receptor agonists demonstrate improvement in histology.

Diseases (Basel, Switzerland) 2018; 6 (4) Abstract Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by histological evidence hepatic steatosis, lobular inflammation, ballooning degeneration and hepatic fibrosis in the absence of significant alcohol use and other known causes of chronic liver diseases. NAFLD is subdivided into nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). NAFL is generally benign but can progress to NASH, which carries a higher risk of adverse outcomes including cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma and death if liver transplantation is not pursued in a timely fashion. Currently, lifestyle modifications including healthy diet and increased physical activity/exercise culminating in weight loss of 5% to >10% is the cornerstone of treatment intervention for patients with NAFLD. Patients with NAFLD who fail to obtain this goal despite the help of dietitians and regimented exercise programs are left in a purgatory state and remain at risk of developing NASH-related advance fibrosis. For such patients with NAFLD who are overweight and obese, healthcare providers should consider a trial of FDA-approved anti-obesity medications as adjunct therapy to provide further preventative and therapeutic options as an effort to reduce the risk of NAFLD-related disease progression.

Diseases (Basel, Switzerland) 2018; 6 (4) Abstract There has been a growing interest in the role of vitamin E supplementation in the treatment and/or prevention of nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD). We performed a systematic review of the medical literature from inception through 15 June 2018 by utilizing PubMed and searching for key terms such as NAFLD, vitamin E, alpha-tocopherol, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Data from studies and medical literature focusing on the role of vitamin E therapy in patients with NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were reviewed. Most studies assessing the impact of vitamin E in NAFLD were designed to evaluate patients with NASH with documented biochemical and histological abnormalities. These studies demonstrated improvement in biochemical profiles, with a decline in or normalization of liver enzymes. Furthermore, histological assessment showed favorable outcomes in lobular inflammation and hepatic steatosis following treatment with vitamin E. Current guidelines regarding the use of vitamin E in the setting of NAFLD recommend that vitamin E-based treatment be restricted to biopsy-proven nondiabetic patients with NASH only. However, some concerns have been raised regarding the use of vitamin E in patients with NASH due to its adverse effects profile and lack of significant improvement in hepatic fibrosis. In conclusion, the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties of vitamin E accompanied by ease-of-use and exceptional tolerability have made vitamin E a pragmatic therapeutic choice in non-diabetic patients with histologic evidence of NASH. Future clinical trials with study design to assess vitamin E in combination with other anti-fibrotic agents may yield an additive or synergistic therapeutic effect.

Journal of viral hepatitis 2018 Abstract The Asian-American population is characterized by remarkable diversity. Studying Asians as an aggregate group may obscure clinically-meaningful heterogeneity. We performed a population-based study using data from the United States (US) National Vital Statistics System. We determined the trends in age-standardized mortality rates for chronic liver disease stratified by etiology among the most populous US-based Asian subgroups (Asian Indians, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese) and compared it to non-Hispanic whites. Annual percentage change was calculated to determine temporal mortality patterns using joinpoint analysis.Hepatitis C virus-related mortality rates were higher in non-Hispanic whites compared to individual Asian subgroups, but a sharp decline in mortality rates was noted in 2014 among non-Hispanic whites and all Asian subgroups. Age-standardized hepatitis B virus-related mortality rates were higher in all Asian subgroups as compared to non-Hispanic whites in 2016, with the highest mortality among Vietnamese followed by Chinese. Mortality rates for alcoholic liver disease have been steadily trending upwards in all Asian subgroups, with the highest mortality in Japanese. Overall, age-standardized cirrhosis-related mortality rates were highest in non-Hispanic whites, followed by Japanese, and more distantly by Vietnamese and other subgroups. However, hepatocellular carcinoma-related mortality rates were higher in most Asian subgroups led by Vietnamese, Japanese and Koreans compared to non-Hispanic whites. In this population-based study utilizing a nationally representative database, we demonstrated a marked heterogeneity in the mortality rates of etiology-specific chronic liver disease among Asian subgroups in the US.

We utilized the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1988 to 1994 in this study. NAFLD was defined by ultrasonographic detection of hepatic steatosis in the absence of other known causes of liver diseases and significant alcohol consumption. Hepatic steatosis was assessed by parenchymal brightness, liver to kidney contrast, deep beam attenuation, bright vessel walls and gallbladder wall definition. Antibodies to H. pylori and cagA of participants were measured IgG prevalence NAFLD was higher in H. pylori positive subjects (33.5\u00b11.8%) compared to H. pylori negative subjects (26.1\u00b11.7%, p <0.001). In terms of cagA protein status stratification, while cagA positive H. pylori group did not 95% CI: 0.81-1.37), cagA negative H. pylori was noted to have a significant association with NAFLD in a multivariable analysis (OR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.01-1.67). conclusion, our study demonstrated that cagA negative H. pylori infection was an independent predictor of NAFLD in the US general population.

Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine 2018; 14 (8): 1315-22 Abstract STUDY OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and related advanced fibrosis. We studied the treatment of OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) in a population with NAFLD.METHODS: Using an institutional database (2010-2014), we identified patients with NAFLD and OSA and studied changes in serum aminotransferases before and after CPAP use. We defined suspected (sNAFLD) as serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 30 U/L for men and > 19 U/L for women in the absence of known causes of chronic liver disease. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI) was used to determine significant fibrosis. Consistent CPAP use for more than 3 months with adequate adherence parameters defined good adherence.RESULTS: Of 351 patients with OSA on CPAP treatment, majority (mean age 57.6 years, 59.3% male) had abnormal ALT, and 89.4% met the criteria for sNAFLD. The prevalence of sNAFLD was higher among patients with moderate to severe OSA (90.6%) versus mild OSA (86.3%). There was a statistically significant improvement in AST, ALT, and APRI with CPAP therapy (all P < .01). There was an apparent dose-response relationship: patients with good adherence to CPAP showed a significantly larger decrease in AST and ALT than did those with poor adherence (P < .01). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed CPAP treatment with adequate adherence (odds ratio = 3.93, 95% confidence interval = 1.29-11.94) was an independent predictor of regression of sNAFLD after adjusting for obesity class and severity of OSA.CONCLUSIONS: OSA treatment with CPAP was associated with significant biochemical improvement and reduction in NAFLD-related fibrosis.

Adolescent health, medicine and therapeutics 2018; 9: 103-110 Abstract Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects an estimated 0.1%-2% of the pediatric population in the United States. While the clinical course in young children is indolent, adolescents who contract HCV have a disease course similar to adults, with a 26-fold increased risk of chronic liver disease-associated mortality, hepatocellular carcinoma, and need for curative liver transplantation. Furthermore, adolescent patients are entering childbearing age and carry a risk of passing HCV to their offspring via vertical transmission. Pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN) with ribavirin was previously the only treatment option for pediatric patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), but the high likelihood of adverse reactions and subcutaneous route of administration limited its use and efficacy. Recently, the direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) ledipasvir (LDV) and sofosbuvir (SOF) were approved for adolescents with CHC. This review discusses the natural history of CHC in pediatric patients, data supporting LDV/SOF in adolescents, and ongoing studies evaluating DAAs in pediatric patients.

Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.) 2018 Abstract With recent improvements in the treatment of end-stage liver disease (ESLD), a better understanding of the burden of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is needed in the United States (US). A population-based study using the US Census and national mortality database was performed. We identified the age-standardized etiology-specific mortality rates for cirrhosis and HCC among US adults aged 20 years from 2007 to 2016. We determined temporal mortality rate patterns by joinpoint analysis with estimates of annual percentage change (APC). Age-standardized cirrhosis-related mortality rates increased from 19.77/100,000 persons in 2007 to 23.67 in 2016 with an annual increase of 2.3% (95% CI 2.0-2.7). The APC in mortality rates for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-cirrhosis shifted from a 2.9% increase per year during 2007-2014 to a 6.5% decline per year during 2014-2016. Meanwhile, mortality for cirrhosis from alcoholic liver disease (ALD, 4.5%) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD, APC 15.4%) increased over the same period, while mortality for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-cirrhosis decreased with an average APC of -1.1%. HCC-related mortality increased from 3.48/100,000 persons in 2007 to 4.41 in 2016 at an annual rate of 2.0% (95% CI 1.3-2.6). Etiology-specific mortality rates of HCC were largely consistent with cirrhosis-related mortality. Minority populations had a higher burden of HCC-related mortality.CONCLUSION: Cirrhosis- and HCC-related mortality rates increased between 2007 and 2016 in the US. However, mortality rates in HCV-cirrhosis demonstrated a significant decline from 2014-2016, during the direct-acting antiviral era. Mortality rates for ALD/NAFLD-cirrhosis and HCC have continued to increase, while HBV-cirrhosis-related mortality declined during the 10-year period. Importantly, minorities had a disproportionately higher burden of ESLD-related mortality. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

Gastroenterology 2018 Abstract BACKGROUND & AIMS: Although treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has improved, the prevalence of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) has been increasing, so we need an updated estimate of the burden and etiology-specific mortality of chronic liver diseases. We studied the trends in age-standardized mortality of chronic liver diseases among adults 20 years or older in the United States (US), from 2007 through 2016.METHODS: We collected data from the US Census and National Center for Health Statistics mortality records, identifying individuals with HCV infection, ALD, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), or hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection using ICD-10 codes. We obtained temporal mortality rate patterns using joinpoint trend analysis with estimates of annual percentage change (APC).RESULTS: Age-standardized HCV-related mortality increased from 7.17/100,000 persons in 2007 to 8.14/100,000 persons in 2013, followed by a marked decrease in the time period at which patients began receiving treatment with direct-acting antiviral agents (from 8.09/100,000 persons in 2014 to 7.15/100,000 persons in 2016). The APC in HCV mortality increased 2.0%/year from 2007 through 2014, but decreased 6.4%/year from 2014 through 2016. In contrast, age-standardized mortality increased for ALD (APC of 2.3% from 2007 through 2013 and APC of 5.5% from 2013 through 2016) and NAFLD (APC of 6.1% from 2007 through 2013 and APC of 11.3% from 2013 through 2016). HBV-related mortality decreased steadily from 2007 through 2016, with an average APC of -2.1% (95% CI, -3.0 to -1.2). Etiology-based mortality in minority populations were higher. HCV-related mortality (per 100,000 persons) was highest among non-Hispanic blacks (10.28) and whites (6.92), followed by Hispanics (5.94), and lowest among non-Hispanic Asians (2.33). Non-Hispanic Asians had higher mortality for HBV infection (2.82 per 100,000 vs 1.02 for non-Hispanic blacks, and 0.47 for non-Hispanic whites).CONCLUSION: In our population-based analysis of chronic liver disease mortality in the US, the decline in HCV-related mortality coincided with the introduction of direct-acting antiviral therapies, while the mortality from ALD and NAFLD increased during the same period.

Diseases (Basel, Switzerland) 2018; 6 (3) Abstract In recent years, the opioid epidemic and new hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatments have changed the landscape of organ procurement and allocation. We studied national trends in solid organ transplantation (20002016), focusing on graft utilization from HCV seropositive deceased donors in the pre-2014 (20002013) versus current (20142016) eras with a retrospective analysis of the United Network for Organ Sharing database. During the study period, HCV seropositive donors increased from 181 to 661 donors/year. The rate of HCV seropositive donor transplants doubled from 2014 to 2016. Heart and lung transplantation data were too few to analyze. A higher number of HCV seropositive livers were transplanted into HCV seropositive recipients during the current era: 374 versus 124 liver transplants/year. Utilization rates for liver transplantation reached parity between HCV seropositive and non-HCV donors. While the number of HCV kidneys transplanted HCV seropositive from 165.4 to 334.7 kidneys/year from the pre-2014 era to the current era, utilization rates for kidneys remained lower in HCV seropositive than in non-HCV donors. In conclusion, relative underutilization of kidneys from HCV seropositive versus non-HCV donors has persisted, in contrast to trends in liver transplantation.

However, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score does not incorporate hepatic encephalopathy (HE), an independent predictor of waitlist mortality.To evaluate the impact of severe HE (grade 3-4) on waitlist outcomes in MELD 30 patients.Using the OPTN/UNOS database, we evaluated LT waitlist registrants from 2005-2014. Demographics, comorbidities, and waitlist survival were compared between four cohorts: MELD 30-34 with severe HE, MELD 30-34 without severe HE, MELD 35 with severe HE, and MELD 35 without severe HE.Among 10,003 waitlist registrants studied, 41.6% had MELD score 30-34 and 58.4% had MELD 35. Patients with severe HE had a higher 90-day waitlist mortality in both MELD 30-34 (severe HE 71.1% vs. no HE 56.6%; p < 0.001) and MELD 35 subgroups (severe HE 85% versus no HE 74.2%; p < 0.001). MELD 30-34 patients with severe HE had similar 90-day waitlist mortality as MELD 35 patients without severe HE (71.1 vs. 74.2%, respectively; p = 0.35). On multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling, MELD 30 patients had 58% greater risk of 90-day waitlist mortality than those without severe HE (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.53-1.62; p < 0.001).Patients awaiting LT with MELD score of 30-34 and severe HE should receive priority status for organ allocation with exception MELD 35.

Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver 2018 Abstract BACKGROUND AND AIM: Telomere length and telomerase has been linked with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the impact of telomere length on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and advanced fibrosis is in a large national population sample is not well understood.METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002 were utilized. Suspected NAFLD was diagnosed if serum alanine aminotransferase was > 30 IU/L for men and > 19 IU/L for women in the absence of other causes of chronic liver disease. Presence of advanced fibrosis was determined by the NAFLD fibrosis score, aspartate aminotransferase platelet ratio index, Of the 6,738 participants (mean age 46.3 years, 48.4% male), suspected NAFLD prevalence was inversely associated with leukocyte telomere length in young adults aged 20-39 years, though this was not seen in the overall population. Percentage of participants with advanced fibrosis increased corresponding with leukocyte telomere length (longest to shortest). The shortest quartile of leukocyte telomere length was associated with a significantly higher odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of advanced fibrosis of 2.36 (1.32-4.24) in a univariate model compared to the longest quartile, and 2.01 (1.13-3.58) in a multivariate model adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, waist circumference, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P for trend < 0.05, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: In this large nationally-representative sample of American adults, leukocyte telomere shortening was associated with increased risk of advanced fibrosis in the setting of suspected NAFLD independent of other known risk factors.

Diseases (Basel, Switzerland) 2018; 6 (2) Abstract The prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in the United States in 2011 and 2012 was estimated at 4.44.8%. As of 2015, 12.4 million people still possessed LTBI. Isoniazid, or isonicotinic acid hydrazine (INH), is the most commonly used medication among varying regimens that exist in the treatment of tuberculosis and LTBI. INH-related hepatotoxicity is a well-known adverse effect of its use, often causing asymptomatic elevations in serum aminotransferase levels. These elevations are typically transient and reversible, but can cause acute, clinically-significant liver injury in rare cases. We report a case of a 67-year old male who developed subacute hepatic injury secondary to INH treatment for LTBI, and ultimately underwent liver transplantation due to the progression to hepatic decompensation, despite withdrawal of the medication. Because symptoms of INH hepatotoxicity are nonspecific and prognosis can be variable, clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for this adverse effect. As exemplified by this case, early recognition may be life-saving.

Diseases (Basel, Switzerland) 2018; 6 (2) Abstract The prevalence of hepatitis C in pregnancy is as high as 3.6% in large cohorts. The prevalence of hepatitis C acquired by vertical transmission is 0.2% to 0.4% in the United States and Europe. Although screening is not recommended in the absence of certain risk factors, the importance of understanding hepatitis C in pregnancy lies in its association with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. There is potential for those infants infected by vertical transmission to develop chronic hepatitis C, cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. The risk of vertical transmission is increased when mothers are co-infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) or possess a high viral load. There is no clear data supporting that mode of delivery increases or reduces risk. Breastfeeding is not associated with increased risk of transmission. Premature rupture of membranes, invasive procedures (such as amniocentesis), intrapartum events, or fetal scalp monitoring may increase risk of transmission. In pregnant patients, hepatitis C is diagnosed with a positive ELISA-3 and detectable Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) RNA viral load. Infants born to HCV-infected mothers should be tested for either HCV RNA on at least two separate occasions. Although prevention is not possible, there may be a role for newer direct acting anti-viral medications in the future.

Patients with concurrent NAFLD and type 2 diabetes mellitus have a higher risk of progressing to advanced fibrosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis compared to non-diabetics. Lifestyle modifications, including weight loss, remain the mainstay of treatment for NAFLD, as there are no medications currently indicated for this disease state. Anti-diabetic pharmacologic therapies aimed at improving insulin sensitivity and decreasing insulin production have been studied to determine their potential role in slowing the progression of NAFLD. In this review, we focus on the evidence surrounding anti-diabetic medications and their ability to improve disease progression in patients with NAFLD.

Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association 2018 Abstract BACKGROUND & AIMS: Data on the differences in ethnicity and race among patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) awaiting liver transplantation (LT) are limited. We evaluated liver transplant waitlist trends and outcomes based on ethnicity and race in patients with PBC in the United States.METHODS: Using the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) registry, we collected data on patients with PBC on the liver transplant waitlist, and performed analysis with a focus on ethnicity and race-based variations clinical manifestations, waitlist mortality and LT rates from 2000 to 2014. Outcomes were adjusted for demographics, complications of portal hypertension, and Model for End-stage Liver Disease score at time of waitlist registration.RESULTS: Although the number of white PBC waitlist registrants and additions decreased from 2000 to 2014, there were no significant changes in the number of Hispanic PBC waitlist registrants and additions each year. The proportion of Hispanic patients with PBC on the liver transplant waitlist increased from 10.7% in 2000 to 19.3% in 2014. Hispanics had the highest percentage of waitlist deaths (20.8%) of any ethnicity or race evaluated. After adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics, Hispanic patients with PBC had the lowest overall rate for undergoing LT (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0. 60-0.83; P < .001) and a significantly higher risk of death while on the waitlist, compared to whites (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.15-1.74; P < .001). Furthermore, Hispanic patients with PBC had the highest proportion of waitlist removals due to clinical deterioration.CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of data from UNOS registry focusing on outcomes, we observed differences in rates of LT and liver transplant waitlist mortality of Hispanic patients compared with white patients with PBC. Further studies are needed to improve our understanding of ethnicity and race-based differences in progression of PBC.

In contrast to prior regimen involving ribavirin and pegylated interferon, these newer agents are highly effective, well-tolerated, have shorter course of therapy and safer essentially in all HCV patients including those with advanced liver disease and following liver transplantation. Clinicians caring for HCV-infected patients on the liver transplant (LT) waitlist are often faced with a dilemma whether to treat HCV infection before or after liver transplantation. Sustained virological response (SVR) rates following HCV treatment may improve hepatic function sufficiently enough to negate the need for LT in certain patients. On the other hand, the decrease in MELD without improvement in quality of life in certain patients may lead to delay or dropout from potentially curative LT surgery list. In this context, our review focuses on the approach to and optimal timing of DAA-based treatment of HCV infection in LT candidates in the peri-transplant period.

Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver 2018 Abstract Testosterone plays a role in predisposing individuals to cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, but its effects differ between men and women. We investigated the association between serum total testosterone and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in adults in the US.A cross-sectional analysis of data from participants in the 2011-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was performed. Subjects with significant alcohol consumption and those with viral hepatitis were excluded. We used the highest sex-specific quartiles of serum total testosterone as references. Suspected non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was diagnosed when serum alanine aminotransferase women.Of the 4758 subjects (49.4% men), the prevalence of suspected non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was inversely correlated with the sex-specific quartiles of testosterone in men and women. In a multivariate model, low total testosterone levels were associated with progressively higher odds of suspected non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in men after adjusting for age, obesity and other metabolic risk factors (P values for trends <.01). When the women were divided into 2 groups according to menopausal status, a significant correlation was observed only in the post-menopausal women (P values for trends <.01). The adjusted odds ratios for suspected non-alcoholic fatty liver disease were 1.72-1.99 in men and 2.15-2.26 in post-menopausal women (lowest quartile vs highest quartile).In this nationally representative sample of adults in the US, low total testosterone levels were associated with suspected non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in men and post-menopausal women independent of known risk factors.

Medicines (Basel, Switzerland) 2018; 5 (2) Abstract Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) of nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). It is defined by histologic or radiographic evidence of steatosis in the absence of alternative etiologies, including significant alcohol consumption, steatogenic medication use, or hereditary disorders. NAFLD is now the most common liver disease, and when NASH is present it can progress to fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Different mechanisms have been identified as contributors to the physiology of NAFLD; insulin resistance and related metabolic derangements have been the hallmark of physiology associated with NAFLD. The mainstay of treatment has classically involved lifestyle modifications focused on the reduction of insulin resistance. However, emerging evidence suggests that the endocannabinoid system and its associated cannabinoid receptors and ligands have mechanistic and therapeutic implications in metabolic derangements and specifically in NAFLD. Cannabinoid receptor 1 antagonism has demonstrated promising effects with increased resistance to hepatic steatosis, reversal of hepatic steatosis, and improvements in glycemic control, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Literature regarding the role of cannabinoid receptor 2 in NAFLD is controversial. Exocannabinoids and endocannabinoids have demonstrated some therapeutic impact on metabolic derangements associated with NAFLD, although literature regarding direct therapeutic use in NAFLD is limited. Nonetheless, the properties of the endocannabinoid system, its receptors, substrates, and ligands remain a significant arena warranting further research, with potential for a pharmacologic intervention for a disease with an anticipated increase in economic and clinical burden.

Medicines (Basel, Switzerland) 2018; 5 (2) Abstract Although the mortality rates of cirrhosis are underestimated, its socioeconomic burden has demonstrated a significant global impact. Cirrhosis is defined by the disruption of normal liver architecture after years of chronic insult by different etiologies. Treatment modalities are recommended primarily in decompensated cirrhosis and specifically tailored to the different manifestations of hepatic decompensation. Antifibrogenic therapies are within an active area of investigation. The endocannabinoid system has been shown to play a role in liver disease, and cirrhosis specifically, with intriguing possible therapeutic benefits. The endocannabinoid system comprises cannabinoid receptors 1 (CB1) and cannabinoid (CB2) whereas counteracts progression to fibrosis. Conversely, deletion of CB1 is associated with an improvement of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis, and deletion of CB2 results in increased collagen deposition, steatosis, and enhanced inflammation. CB1 antagonism has also demonstrated vascular effects in patients with cirrhosis, causing an increase in arterial pressure and vascular resistance as well as a decrease in mesenteric blood flow and portal pressure, thereby preventing ascites. In mice with hepatic encephalopathy, CB1 blockade and activation of CB2 demonstrated improved neurologic score and cognitive function. Endocannabinoids, themselves also have mechanistic roles in cirrhosis. Arachidonoyl ethanolamide (AEA) exhibits antifibrogenic a fibrogenic mediator independent of CB receptors, but in higher doses induces apoptosis of HSCs, which may actually show antifibrotic properties. 2-AG has also demonstrated growth-inhibitory and suppresses myofibroblasts stellate induces apoptosis, which may reveal antifibrotic and hepatoprotective mechanisms. Thus, several components of the endocannabinoid system have therapeutic potential in cirrhosis.

Diseases (Basel, Switzerland) 2018; 6 (3) Abstract Our aim is to review the efficacy of various herbs and supplements as a possible therapeutic option in the treatment and/or prevention of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We performed a systematic review of medical literature using the PubMed Database by searching the chemical names of many common herbs and supplements with \"AND (NAFLD or NASH)\". Studies and medical literature that discussed the roles and usage of herbs and supplements in NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) from inception until 20 June 2018 were reviewed. Many studies have claimed that the use of various herbs and supplements may improve disease endpoints and outcomes related to NAFLD and/or NASH. Improvement in liver function tests were noted. Amelioration or reduction of lobular inflammation, hepatic steatosis, and fibrosis were also noted. However, well-designed studies demonstrating improved clinical outcomes are lacking. Furthermore, experts remain concerned about the lack of regulation of herbs/supplements and the need for further research on potential adverse effects and herbdrug interactions. In conclusion, preliminary data on several herbs have demonstrated promising antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-adipogenic properties that may help curtail the progression of NAFLD/NASH. Clinical trials testing the safety and efficacy must be completed before widespread can be recommended.

Diseases (Basel, Switzerland) 2018; 6 (3) Abstract The two main subsets of nonalcoholic liver disease (NAFLD) include: non-progressive subtype; and (2) nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the less common subtype, which has the potential to progress to advanced liver damage. Current treatment strategies have focused on lifestyle management of modifiable risk factors, namely weight, and on the optimization of the management of individual components of metabolic syndrome. Various hypothetical pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed, leading to the development of novel drugs with the potential to effectively treat patients with NASH. Numerous clinical trials are ongoing, utilizing these experimental drugs and molecules targeting specific mechanistic pathway(s) to effectively treat NASH. Some of these mechanistic pathways targeted by experimental pharmacologic agents include chemokine receptor 2 and 5 antagonism, inhibition of galectin-3 protein, antagonism of toll-like receptor 4, variation of fibroblast growth factor 19, agonism of selective thyroid hormone against lysl oxidase-like-2, and inhibition of inflammasomes.

Diseases (Basel, Switzerland) 2018; 6 (4) Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic liver disease in the Western world. NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of histological features, including steatosis, steatohepatitis with balloon degeneration, and hepatic fibrosis leading to cirrhosis. In patients with advanced liver damage, NAFLD is associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia are components of metabolic syndrome and are commonly associated with NAFLD. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in patients with NAFLD. Therefore, it is important to pre-emptively identify and proactively treat conditions like hyperlipidemia in an effort to favorably modify the risk factors associated with cardiovascular events in patients with NAFLD. The management of hyperlipidemia has been shown to reduce cardiovascular mortality and improve histological damage/biochemical abnormalities associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a subset of NAFLD with advance liver damage. There are no formal guidelines available regarding the use of anti-hyperlipidemic drugs, as prospective data are lacking. The focus of this article is to discuss the utility of lipid-lowering drugs in patients with NAFLD.

European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology 2018 Abstract An estimated 22 million adults use marijuana in the USA. The role of marijuana in the progression of hepatic fibrosis remains unclear.We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of marijuana on prevalence and progression of hepatic fibrosis in chronic liver disease.We searched several databases from inception through 10 November 2017 to identify studies evaluating the role of marijuana in chronic liver disease. Our main outcome of interest was prevalence/progression of hepatic fibrosis. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and hazards ratios (HRs) were pooled and analyzed using random-effects model.Nine studies with 5 976 026 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Prevalence of hepatic fibrosis was evaluated in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis C and HIV coinfection by two, four, and one studies. Progression of hepatic fibrosis was evaluated by two studies. Pooled OR for prevalence of fibrosis was 0.91 (0.72-1.15), I=75%. On subgroup analysis, pooled OR among NAFLD patients was 0.80 (0.75-0.86), I=0% and pooled OR among HCV patients was 1.96 (0.78-4.92), I=77%. Among studies evaluating HR, pooled HR for progression of fibrosis in HCV-HIV co-infected patients was 1.03 (0.96-1.11), I=0%.Marijuana use did not increase the prevalence or progression of hepatic fibrosis in HCV and HCV-HIV-coinfected patients. On the contrary, we noted a reduction in the prevalence of NAFLD in marijuana users. Future studies are needed to further understand the therapeutic impact of cannabidiol-based formulations in the management of NAFLD.

While the clinical course in young children is indolent, adolescents who contract HCV have a disease course similar to adults, with a 26-fold increased risk of chronic liver disease-associated mortality, hepatocellular carcinoma, and need for curative liver transplantation. Furthermore, adolescent patients are entering childbearing age and carry a risk of passing HCV to their offspring via vertical transmission. Pegylated-interferon (PEG-IFN) with ribavirin was previously the only treatment option for pediatric patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC), but the high likelihood of adverse reactions and subcutaneous route of administration limited its use and efficacy. Recently, the direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) ledipasvir (LDV) and sofosbuvir (SOF) were approved for adolescents with CHC. This review discusses the natural history of CHC in pediatric patients, data supporting LDV/SOF in adolescents, and ongoing studies evaluating DAAs in pediatric patients.

We studied the association between marijuana and NAFLD utilizing cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2005-2014 and NHANES III (1988-1994).Suspected NAFLD was serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was > 30 IU/L for men and > 19 IU/L for women in the absence of other liver diseases (NHANES 2005-2014). In NHANES III cohort, NAFLD was the 14,080 (NHANES 2005-2014) and 8,286 of NAFLD and ultrasonographically-diagnosed NAFLD were inversely associated with marijuana use (p < 0.001). Compared to marijuana-na\u00efve participants, marijuana users were less likely to have suspected NAFLD (odds ratio [OR]: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.57-0.98 for current user) in the age, gender, ethnicity-adjusted model. On multivariate analysis, the ORs for suspected NAFLD comparing current light or heavy users to non-users were 0.76 (95% CI 0.58-0.98) and 0.70 (95% CI 0.56-0.89), respectively (P for trend = 0.001) light user). In insulin resistance-adjusted model, marijuana use remained an independent predictor of lower risk of suspected NAFLD.In this nationally representative sample, active marijuana use provided a protective effect against NAFLD independent of known metabolic risk factors. The pathophysiology is unclear and warrants further investigation.

Nutrients 2017; 9 (10) Abstract Malnutrition has become a dangerously common problem in children with chronic liver disease, negatively impacting neurocognitive development and growth. Furthermore, many children with chronic liver disease will eventually require liver transplantation. Thus, this association between malnourishment and chronic liver disease in children becomes increasingly alarming as malnutrition is a predictor of poorer outcomes in liver transplantation and is often associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Malnutrition requires aggressive and appropriate management to correct nutritional deficiencies. A comprehensive review of the literature has found that infants with chronic liver disease (CLD) are particularly susceptible to malnutrition given their low reserves. Children with CLD would benefit from early intervention by a multi-disciplinary team, to try to achieve nutritional rehabilitation as well as to optimize outcomes for liver transplant. This review explains the multifactorial nature of malnutrition in children with chronic liver disease, defines the nutritional needs of these children, and discusses ways to optimize their nutritional.

Nutrients 2017; 9 (10) Abstract The aim of this work is to develop a pragmatic approach in the assessment and management strategies of patients with cirrhosis in order to optimize the outcomes in this patient population.A systematic review of literature was conducted through 8 July 2017 on the PubMed Database looking for key terms, such as malnutrition, nutrition, assessment, treatment, and cirrhosis. Articles and studies looking at associations between nutrition and cirrhosis were reviewed.An assessment of malnutrition should be conducted in two stages: the first, to identify patients at risk for malnutrition based on the severity of liver disease, and the second, to perform a complete multidisciplinary nutritional evaluation of these patients. Optimal management of malnutrition should focus on meeting recommended daily goals for caloric intake and inclusion of various nutrients in the diet. The nutritional goals should be pursued by encouraging and increasing oral intake or using other measures, such as oral supplementation, enteral nutrition, or parenteral nutrition.Although these strategies to improve nutritional support have been well established, current literature on the topic is limited in scope. Further research should be implemented to test if this enhanced approach is effective.

Temporal trends and outcomes in NASH-related liver transplantation (LT) in the US were studied.A retrospective cohort study utilizing the United Network for Organ Sharing and Organ Procurement and Transplantation (UNOS/OPTN) 2003-2014 database was conducted to evaluate the frequency of NASH-related LT. Etiology-specific post-transplant survival was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier methods and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.Overall, 63,061 adult patients underwent LT from 2003 to 2014, including 20,782 HCV (32.96%), 9470 ALD (15.02%), and 8262 NASH (13.11%). NASH surpassed ALD and became the second leading indication for LT beginning in 2008, accounting for 17.38% of LT in 2014. From 2003 to 2014, the number of LT secondary to NASH increased by 162%, whereas LT secondary to HCV increased by 33% and ALD increased by 55%. Due to resurgence in ALD, the growth in NASH and ALD was comparable from 2008 to 2014 (NASH +50.15% vs. ALD +41.87%). The post-transplant survival in NASH was significantly higher compared to HCV 71.37-72.93, P < .001). In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, NASH demonstrated significantly higher post-transplant survival compared to HCV (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.71-0.79, P < .001).Currently, NASH is the most rapidly growing indication for LT in the US. Despite resurgence in ALD, NASH remains the second leading indication for LT.

Recently, there has been interest in the use of rifaximin for the prevention of SBP and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate this association of rifaximin. We searched several databases from inception through 24 January 2017, to identify comparative studies evaluating the effect of rifaximin on the occurrence of SBP and HRS. We performed predetermined subgroup analyses based on the type of control group, design of the study, and type of prophylaxis. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using a random effects model. We included 13 studies with 1703 patients in the meta-analysis of SBP prevention. Pooled 0.40 (95% CI: (95% CI: 0.20-0.44) (I=0%). The results of the subgroup analysis based on type of control was as follows: in the quinolone group, pooled OR was 0.42 (95% CI: 0.14-1.25) (I=55%), and in the OR was 0.40 (95% CI: 0.18-0.86) (I=64%). However, with sensitivity analysis, benefit demonstrable; pooled ORs were the comparison with quinolones and no antibiotics, respectively. Pooled OR based on randomized controlled trials was 0.41 (95% CI: 0.22-0.75) (I=13%). For the prevention of OR was 0.25 (95% CI: 0.13-0.50) (I=0%). Rifaximin has a protective effect against the development of SBP in cirrhosis. However, the quality of the evidence as per the GRADE framework was very low. Rifaximin appeared effective for the prevention of HRS.

Journal of clinical and translational hepatology 2017; 5 (3): 193-196 Abstract Background and Aims: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most rapidly growing indication for liver transplantation (LT) in the United States and is on a trajectory to become the leading indication for LT in the next decade. We aimed to study the trends in NASH-related LT among persons born between 1945 and 1965, the baby boomer (BB) generation. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis using population-based data from the United Network for Organ Sharing/Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network registry from 2004-2015 to evaluate the birth cohort-specific trends in liver transplant waitlist registrations and liver transplant surgeries in patients with NASH. We stratified our study population into three birth cohorts: 1) birth before 1945, 2) birth between 1945 and 1965, and 3) birth after 1965. Results: The overall rates of NASH-related waitlist registrations and liver transplant surgeries steadily increased from 2004 to 2015 and were reflective of a sharp rise noted in the NASH BB sub-group. From 2004 to 2015, the proportion of BB patients with NASH added to LT waitlist demonstrated an incremental growth, 60.6% in 2004 versus 83.2% in 2015 (p < 0.01). Among the liver transplant recipients with NASH, the proportion represented by the BB cohort increased from 56.3% in 2004 to 80.0% in 2015 (p < 0.01). Conclusions: We report rising rates of waitlist registration and LT for the indication of NASH. More importantly, the BB sub-cohort was mainly responsible for these alarming trends.

Diseases (Basel, Switzerland) 2017; 5 (4) Abstract We aim to study the impact of the baby boomer (BB) generation, a birth-specific cohort (born 1945-1965) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-related liver transplantation (LT) in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), alcoholic liver disease (ALD), and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We performed a retrospective analysis using the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)/Organ Procurement Transplant Network (OPTN) database from 2003 to 2014 to compare HCC-related liver transplant surgery trends between two cohorts-the BB and non-BB-with a secondary diagnosis of HCV, ALD, or NASH. From 2003-2014, there were a total of 8313 liver transplant recipients for the indication of HCC secondary to HCV, ALD, or NASH. Of the total, 6658 (80.1%) HCC-related liver transplant recipients were BB. The number of liver transplant surgeries for the indication of HCC increased significantly in NASH (+1327%), HCV (+382%), and ALD (+286%) during the study period. The proportion of BB who underwent LT for HCC was the highest in HCV (84.7%), followed by NASH (70.3%) and ALD (64.7%). The recommendations for birth-cohort specific HCV screening stemmed from a greater understanding of the high prevalence of chronic HCV and HCV-related HCC within BB. The rising number of HCC-related LT among BB with ALD and NASH suggests the need for increased awareness and improved preventative screening/surveillance measures within NASH and ALD cohorts as well.

Progress in transplantation (Aliso Viejo, Calif.) 2017; 27 (3): 225-231 Abstract The age of liver transplantation recipients in the United States is steadily increasing. However, the impact of age on liver transplant outcomes has demonstrated contradictory results.We aim to evaluate the impact of age on survival following liver transplantation among US adults.Using data from the United Network for Organ Sharing registry, we retrospectively evaluated all adults undergoing liver transplantation from 2002 to 2012 stratified by age (aged 70 years and older vs aged <70 years), presence of hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatitis C virus status. Overall survival was evaluated with Kaplan-Meier methods and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.Compared to patients aged <70 years, those aged 70 years and older had significantly lower 5-year survival following transplantation among all groups analyzed (hepatocellular 78.5%, P < .001). On multivariate regression, patients aged 70 years and older at time of transplantation was associated with significantly higher mortality compared to those aged <70 years (hazards ratio: 1.67; 95% confidence interval: 1.48-1.87; P < .001).The age at the time of liver transplantation has continued to increase in the United States. However, patients aged 70 years and older had significantly higher mortality following liver transplantation. These observations are especially important given the aging cohort of patients with chronic liver disease in the United States.

Clinics in liver disease 2017; 21 (3): 595-606 Abstract Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains a leading cause of chronic liver disease in the United States. Although the hepatic impact of chronic HCV leading to cirrhosis and the need for liver transplantation is paramount, the extrahepatic manifestations of chronic HCV infection are equally important. In particular, a better understanding of the prevalence and impact of extrahepatic manifestations of chronic HCV infection in the post-liver transplant setting relies on understanding the interplay between the effects of chronic HCV infection in a posttransplant environment characterized by strong immunosuppression and the associated risks of this milieu.

Journal of clinical and translational hepatology 2017; 5 (2): 130-133 Abstract In the United States, the fight to eradicate hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been ongoing for many years, but the results have been less than ideal. Historically, patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) were treated with interferon-based regimens, which were associated with frequent adverse effects, suboptimal response rates, and long durations of treatment - of up to 48 weeks. Expertise from specialist-physicians, such as hepatologists and gastroenterologists, was needed to closely follow patients on these medications so as to monitor laboratory values and manage adverse effects. However, the emergence of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents against HCV infection have heralded outstanding progress in terms of safety, tolerability, lack of adverse effects, efficacy, and truncated duration of therapy - 12 weeks or less - thereby making the need for close monitoring by specialist-physicians obsolete. With the recent approval of DAA agents by the Food and Drug Administration, the treatment model for CHC no longer relies on the limited number of specialist-physicians, which represented a major barrier to treatment access in the past, especially in underserved areas of the United States. We propose and share our experiences in adapting a task-shifting treatment model, one that utilizes a relatively larger pool of non-specialist healthcare providers, such as nursing staff (medical assistants, vocational licensed nurses, registered nurses, etc.) and advanced practice providers (nurse practitioners and physician assistants), to perform a variety of important clinical functions in an effort to make DAA-based antiviral therapy widely available against HCV infection. Most recently, task-shifting was implemented by the United States and World Health Organization in the fight against the human immunodeficiency virus and showed encouraging results. Based on our experiences in implementing this model at our outreach clinics, the majority of HCV-infected patients treated with DAA agents can be easily monitored by non-specialist healthcare providers and physician extenders. Task-shifting can effectively address one of the major rate-limiting factors in expanding treatment access for HCV infection.

American journal of gastroenterology 2017 Abstract Statins may improve outcomes in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of statins in the setting of CLD.We searched several databases from inception to 17 October 2016 to identify comparative studies evaluating the role of statins in CLD. Outcomes of interest were the associations between statin use and progression of fibrosis, development of hepatic decompensation in cirrhosis, and mortality in CLD. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were pooled and analyzed using a random effects model. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the method of detection for progression of hepatic fibrosis and quality of studies.We included 10 studies (1 randomized controlled trial and 9 observational) with 259,453 patients (54,441 statin users and 205,012 nonusers). For progression pooled HR (95% confidence interval) was 0.49 (0.39-0.62). On subgroup analysis of studies using ICD-9 (The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision) coding and a second method to detect cirrhosis, pooled HR was 0.58 (0.51-0.65); pooled HR for studies using ICD-9 coding only was 0.36 (0.29-0.44). For progression of fibrosis in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, pooled HR was 0.52 (0.37-0.73). For hepatic decompensation in cirrhosis, pooled HR was 0.54 (0.46-0.65). For mortality, pooled HR based on observational studies was 0.67 (0.46-0.98); in the randomized controlled trial, HR was 0.39 (0.15-0.99). However, the quality of evidence for these associations is low as most included studies were retrospective in nature and limited by residual confounding.Statins may retard the progression of hepatic fibrosis, may prevent hepatic decompensation in cirrhosis, and may reduce all-cause mortality in patients with CLD. As the quality (certainty) of evidence is low, further studies are needed before statins can be routinely recommended.Am J Gastroenterol advance online publication, 6 June 2017; doi:10.1038/ajg.2017.170.

Digestive diseases and sciences 2017 Abstract Disparities in receipt of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance contribute to disparities in overall survival outcomes.We aim to evaluate disparities in receipt of routine HCC surveillance among patients with cirrhosis in a large urban safety-net hospital.Consecutive adults (age 18) with cirrhosis from July 1, 2014, to December 31, 2015, were retrospectively evaluated to determine rates of receiving appropriate HCC surveillance within 6 months and 1 year after diagnosis of cirrhosis. Rates of HCC surveillance were stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, and liver disease etiology. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were utilized to evaluate for predictors of receiving appropriate HCC surveillance.Among 157 cirrhosis patients \u00b1 9.0 years. Among these patients, 49% received (n = 77) HCC surveillance within 6 months and 78% (n = 123) were surveyed within 1 year of cirrhosis diagnosis. On multivariate analyses, patients with NASH cirrhosis were significantly less likely to receive HCC surveillance compared with chronic HCV cirrhosis patients (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.19-0.99, p < 0.05). No significant sex-specific or race/ethnicity-specific disparities in receipt of HCC surveillance were observed.Among a diverse safety-net hospital population, sub-optimal HCC surveillance rates were observed: Only 49% of cirrhosis patients received HCC surveillance within 6 months, and 78% of cirrhosis patients received HCC surveillance within 1 year. Differences in rates of HCC screening by liver disease etiology were observed.

We assessed the impact of e-health on task-shifting in our treatment model.In a retrospective analysis, we reviewed the impact of e-health on optimizing the delivery of DAA-based regimen to HCV-infected patients in outreach clinics in medically underserved areas of California. A nonphysician healthcare provider worked in close conjunction with a hepatologist to monitor the patients during the course of antiviral therapy. We exclusively used our institution-based, secured e-health portal as the means of communication with the local staff and patients in outreach clinics.From January 2015 to June 2016, we treated over 100 HCV-infected patients with DAA-based regimens using the task-shifting model. During the study period, we did not experience any delay in the care of our patients undergoing treatment with DAA agents. Communication with the patient and staff using e-health was prompt, secured, and documented in electronic medical records. Due to the optimization of task-shifting by e-health and safety/tolerability of DAA, 95% patients did not need a follow-up clinic visit during the treatment. Return clinic visits during the treatment were unrelated to DAA use or associated with ribavirin-related anemia. In addition, we noted improvement in access and capacity of our outreach clinic.We report a positive impact of e-health in optimizing task-shifting for DAA in HCV-infected patients in underserved outreach clinics. More importantly, a secondary improvement in access and capacity of our clinic was noted.

Clinical diabetes : a publication of the American Diabetes Association 2017; 35 (2): 79-83 Abstract IN BRIEF Chronic liver disease (CLD) and type 2 diabetes have both been linked to increased morbidity and mortality. In this study, the impact of CLD and diabetes on all-cause mortality was quantified at the population level using U.S. population data. Both type 2 diabetes and CLD were found to be independently associated with increased mortality (age-adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.98 and 1.37 for diabetes and CLD, respectively), and having both diabetes and CLD substantially increased the risk of mortality (aHR 2.41).

Journal of clinical and translational hepatology 2017; 5 (1): 59-66 Abstract In the United States, chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) affects an estimated 0.1-2% of the pediatric population, who are consequently at risk for major complications, including cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death. The current standard of treatment for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) in children is pegylated-interferon-alpha (PEG-IFN) in combination with ribavirin. PEG-IFN/ribavirin therapy is approved for children ages 3 and older; however, it is often held from use until adulthood because of its extensive list of potential side effects and high likelihood of causing adverse symptoms. While CHC is usually indolent in children and adolescents, immediately treating and curbing the spread of HCV before adulthood is important, as there can be transmission to other individuals via sexual activity and infected females can later vertically transmit the infection during pregnancy, the latter representing the most common means of transmission for children in the United States. The recent development of direct-acting antivirals has shown promising results in clinical trials for use in children and has dramatically increased the rates of sustained virological response in adults while improving side effect profiles as compared to interferon-based treatments. Given the usually indolent course of CHC in children, significant side effects of the currently-approved PEG-IFN/ribavirin therapy, and likely availability of all-oral interferon-free regimens for children within a few years, deferring treatment in clinically-stable children with CHC in anticipation of upcoming superior treatment modalities may be justified.

Journal of clinical and translational hepatology 2017; 5 (1): 23-26 Abstract Background and Aims: Patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are dialysis-dependent form a unique group, in which safety, tolerability and efficacy of sofosbuvir (SOF)-based direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) need further evaluation. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 14 patients with CHC and ESRD on dialysis who received 15 courses of SOF-based therapy. We evaluated dose escalation to standard-dose SOF in this proof-of-principle experience. Results: Sustained virological response (defined as undetectable viral load at 12 weeks, SVR-12) was achieved in 13 out of the 15 (86.7%) treatment courses. Seven (46.6%) patients received reduced half dose as conservative proof-of-principal to mitigate potential toxicity. In 13 out of 15 treatment courses, patients completed the designated treatment duration. One patient was treated twice and developed SVR-12 with the retreatment. One patient was lost to follow-up and counted as a non-responder. Premature discontinuations were not due to DAA-related adverse effects. There were no reports of severe adverse effects or drug interactions. Conclusion: We treated CHC patients with ESRD using dose escalation to standard-dose SOF in this proof-of-principle experience and achieved SVR rates comparable to general population.

Journal of clinical and translational hepatology 2017; 5 (1): 16-22 Abstract Background and Aims: The current paradigm of specialist physician-managed treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) is inefficient in absorbing the approximately 3 million patients awaiting treatment in the United States. Task shifting-whereby specialist physicians screen patients for treatment eligibility but on-treatment monitoring is devolved to more abundant non-physician clinicians-achieves non-inferior outcomes with second generation direct-acting antivirals (2(nd) Gen DAAs), may increase treatment capacity, and may facilitate greater treatment access. We determined the cost effectiveness of 2(nd) Gen DAAs with respect to interferon-based first-generation DAAs) within a Methods: Using a previously described decision-analytic Markov structure, we modeled a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 patients with HCV genotype 1 infection over a lifetime horizon, based upon our outreach clinic's HCV treatment protocol. Treatment-na\u00efve and treatment-experienced HCV cohorts were modeled separately, based upon our outr8each clinic's demographics. Treatment response to 2(nd) Gen DAAs was modeled based on our outreach clinic's data. Adverse events, utility, costing, and transition probabilities were sourced from the literature. Results: Driven by improved effectiveness and safety, as well as an expected increase in treatment capacity, 2(nd) Gen DAAs treatment monitored by non-physician clinicians was projected to improve health outcomes and be dominant from a cost-effective perspective versus that of 1(st) Gen DAAs. Trends were consistent across all assessed patient subpopulations. Conclusions: Based on an assumption of increased treatment capacity accompanying a task-shifted treatment model, 2(nd) Gen DAAs-based treatment was cost effective and cost saving as compared to 1(st) Gen DAAs-based treatment for all HCV patient subgroups assessed.

Journal of viral hepatitis 2017 Abstract With effective antiviral therapies, rates of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and decompensated liver disease requiring liver transplantation (LT) are expected to decrease. We aim to evaluate overall trends in LT waitlist registrations, waitlist survival and likelihood of receiving LT among chronic HBV patients in the United States. Using the United Network for Organ Sharing database, we retrospectively evaluated adults (age18) with chronic HBV (with and without HCC) listed for LT from 1992 to 1996 (Era 1) vs 1997 to 2004 (Era 2) vs 2005-2015 (Era 3). Multivariate Cox-regression models evaluated probability of waitlist survival and receiving LT. Overall, 6797 chronic HBV adults were listed for LT. While the total number of HBV patients listed for LT remained stable, the proportion of HBV patients with HCC increased from 5.4% in Era 1 to 39.0% in Era 3. Compared to Era 1, waitlist mortality was higher in Era 2 (HR: 4.55, P<.001) and Era 3 (HR: 3.63, P<.001). However, in the most recent era, waitlist of receiving LT was also lower with latter time periods (compared patients requiring LT remained stable, the proportion of HBV patients with HCC continues to rise. The decrease in waitlist mortality and lower likelihood of LT among HBV patients may reflect the effectiveness of antiviral therapies in delaying disease progression in the current era.

Hepatology 2017 Abstract All-oral direct acting antivirals (DAAs) have been shown to have high safety and efficacy in treating patients with Hepatitis C (HCV) awaiting liver transplant (LT). However, there is limited empirical evidence comparing the health and economic outcomes associated with treating patients pre- vs. post-LT. The objective of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of pre- vs. post-LT treatment with an all-oral DAA regimen among (decompensated cirrhosis).We constructed decision-analytic Markov of the natural disease progression of HCV in HCC patients and DCC patients waitlisted (WL) for LT. The model followed hypothetical cohorts of 1,000 patients with a mean age 50 over a 30 year time horizon from a third-party US payer perspective, and estimated their health and cost outcomes based on pre- vs. post-LT treatment with an all-oral DAA regimen. Transition probabilities and utilities were based on the literature and hepatologist consensus. Sustained viral response (SVR) rates were sourced from ASTRAL-4 and SOLAR-1, -2. Costs were sourced from RedBook, Medicare fee schedules, and published literature.In the HCC analysis, the pre-LT treatment strategy resulted in 11.48 per-patient quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and $365,948 per patient lifetime costs vs. 10.39 and $283,696 in the post-LT arm. In the DCC analysis, the pre-LT treatment strategy results in 9.27 per-patient QALYs and $304,800 per patient lifetime costs vs. 8.7 and $283,789 in the post-LT arm. As such, the pre-LT treatment strategy was found to be the most cost-effective in both populations with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $74,255 (HCC) and $36,583 (DCC). Sensitivity and scenario analyses showed results were most sensitive to the utility of patients post-LT, treatment SVR rates, LT costs, and baseline MELD score (DCC analysis only).The timing of initiation of antiviral treatment for HCV patients with HCC or DCC relative to LT is an important area of clinical and policy research. Our results indicate that pre-LT treatment with a highly effective, all-oral DAA regimen provides the best health outcomes and is the most cost-effective strategy for the treatment of HCV patients with HCC or DCC waitlisted for LT.

American journal of managed care 2017; 23 (2): 107-112 Abstract To estimate change in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) disease and the economic burden associated with comprehensive treatment of the chronic HCV-infected Medicaid population.Decision-analytic Markov model.Treatment-na\u00efve patients with genotype 1 chronic HCV were followed over a lifetime horizon from the third-party payer perspective. Patients entered the model insured under Medicaid and were treated under state-specific restrictions by Metavir fibrosis stage (base case) or all treated (all-patient strategy) with an approved all-oral regimen (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir [LDV/SOF] for 8 weeks or 12 weeks, depending on cirrhosis status, viral load, and state-specific LDV/SOF restrictions). Untreated patients were assumed to age into Medicare at 65 years, where they were treated with LDV/SOF without restriction by fibrotic stage.The sustained virologic response (SVR) rate of the current Medicaid LDV/SOF restriction strategy was 75.2% versus 95.9% if all LDV/SOF-eligible patients were treated under Medicaid. Treating all eligible Medicaid patients with LDV/SOF, regardless of fibrotic stage, was projected to result in 36,752 fewer cases of cirrhosis; 1739 fewer liver 1.03 additional quality-adjusted life-years per patient. Treating all Medicaid patients with chronic HCV using LDV/SOF resulted in a 39.4% ($3.8 billion) savings and decreased the proportion of total costs attributable to downstream costs of care to 18.3%.A \"treat all\" strategy in a Medicaid population resulted in superior SVRs, substantial reductions in downstream negative clinical outcomes, and considerable cost savings. Current restrictive state policies regarding HCV treatment in Medicaid populations must be reassessed in light of these data.

Journal of multidisciplinary healthcare 2017; 10: 95-100 Abstract Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The rising incidence, genetic heterogeneity, multiple etiologies, and concurrent chronic liver diseases make diagnosis, staging, and selection of treatment options challenging in patients with HCC. The best approach to optimize the management of HCC is one that utilizes a core multidisciplinary liver tumor board, consisting of hepatologists, pathologists, interventional radiologists, oncologists, hepatobiliary and transplant surgeons, nurses, and general practitioners. In most cases, HCC is diagnosed by abdominal imaging studies, preferably with a triphasic computed tomography scan of the abdomen or magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen. Histopathological diagnosis using a guided liver biopsy may be needed in noncirrhotic patients or when radiological diagnostic criteria are not fulfilled in the setting of cirrhosis. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer staging system facilitates a standardized therapeutic strategy based on the tumor burden, extent of metastasis, severity of hepatic decompensation, comorbid medical illnesses, functional status of patient, HCC-related symptoms, and preference of the patient. Treatment options include curative surgery (hepatic resection and liver transplantation) and palliative measures (radiofrequency ablation, transarterial chemoembolization, and chemotherapy with sorafenib). The role of the multidisciplinary team is crucial in promptly reconfirming the diagnosis, staging the HCC, and formulating an individualized treatment plan. In potential liver transplant candidates, timely liver transplant evaluation and coordinating bridging/downsizing treatment modalities, such as radiofrequency ablation and transarterial chemoembolization, can be time-consuming. In summary, a multidisciplinary team approach provides a timely, individualized treatment plan, which can vary from curative surgery in patients with early-stage HCC to palliative/hospice care in patients with metastatic HCC. In most tertiary care centers in the US, a multidisciplinary liver tumor board has become the standard of care and a key component of best practice protocol for patients with HCC.

Diseases (Basel, Switzerland) 2017; 5 (4) Abstract Aim: To investigate the efficacy of lifestyle adjustment strategies as a preventive measure and/or treatment of obesity-related non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in adults. Method: A systematic review of literature through 1 July 2017 on the PubMed Database was performed. A comprehensive search was conducted using key terms, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), combined with lifestyle intervention, diet, and exercise. All of the articles and studies obtained from the search were reviewed. Redundant literature was excluded. Results: Several types of dietary compositions and exercise techniques were identified. Most studies concluded and recommended reduction in the intake of saturated and trans fatty acids, carbohydrates, and animal-based protein, and increased fatty acids (MUFAs), plant-based proteins, antioxidants, and other nutrients was recommended. The Mediterranean and Paleo diet both seem to be promising schemes for NAFLD patients to follow. Exercise was also encouraged, but the type of exercise did not affect its efficacy as a NAFLD treatment when the duration is consistent. Conclusions: Although these different dietary strategies and exercise regimens can be adopted to treat NAFLD, current literature on the topic is limited in scope. Further research should be conducted to truly elucidate which lifestyle adjustments individually, and in combination, may facilitate patients with obesity-related NAFLD.

Journal of clinical and translational hepatology 2017; 5 (4): 363-67 Abstract Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection remains the leading indication for liver transplantation (LT) in the United States. While most patients with chronic HCV infection remain asymptomatic, up to one-third develop progressive liver disease resulting in cirrhosis. LT is often the only curative treatment once significant hepatic decompensation develops. However, antiviral therapy for HCV infection has advanced markedly in the past 5 years with the discovery and approval of direct-acting antiviral agents. These new regimens are well tolerated, of short duration and highly effective, unlike the traditional treatment with pegylated-interferon and ribavirin. As achieving sustained virological response becomes increasingly attainable for a majority of HCV-infected patients, concerns have been raised regarding the optimal timing of treatment for HCV infection in the setting of end-stage liver disease and during the peri-transplant period. On one hand, HCV treatment may improve hepatic function and negate the need for LT in some, which is crucial given the scarcity of donor organs and mortality on the waiting list in certain regions. On the other hand, HCV treatment may result in lowering the priority for LT without improving quality of life, thereby delaying potentially curative LT surgery. This review evaluates the evidence supporting the use of direct-acting antiviral agents in the period before and following LT.

World journal of gastroenterology 8263-76 Abstract Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is defined as the presence of hepatic fat accumulation after the exclusion of other causes of hepatic steatosis, including other causes of liver disease, excessive alcohol consumption, and other conditions that may lead to hepatic steatosis. NAFLD encompasses a broad clinical spectrum ranging from fatty liver to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis finally hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NAFLD is the most common liver disease in the world and NASH may soon become the most common indication for liver transplantation. Ongoing persistence of obesity with increasing rate of diabetes will increase the prevalence of NAFLD, and as this population ages, many will develop cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. There has been a general increase in the prevalence of NAFLD, with Asia leading the rise, yet the United States is following closely behind with a rising prevalence from 15% in 2005 to 25% within 5 years. NAFLD is commonly associated with metabolic comorbidities, including obesity, type II diabetes, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of NAFLD is constantly evolving. Based on NAFLD subtypes, it has the potential to progress into advanced fibrosis, end-stage liver disease and HCC. The increasing prevalence of NAFLD with advanced fibrosis, is concerning because patients appear to experience higher liver-related and non-liver-related mortality than the general population. The increased morbidity and mortality, healthcare costs and declining health related quality of life associated with NAFLD makes it a formidable disease, and one that requires more in-depth analysis.

Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association 2017 Abstract Variations in level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) within the reference range of thyroid hormone could have negative health effects. We evaluated the effect of plasma TSH levels within the euthyroid range on the severity of histological damage associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).We performed a cross-sectional study of 425 subjects with biopsy-proven NAFLD (mean age, 53 years; 52% male) who participated in the Boramae NAFLD study from January 2013 to January 2017. Each subject underwent an anthropometric assessment and laboratory and clinical evaluations. Of the subjects, 282 were assigned to a strict to normal thyroid function group (plasma level of TSH, 0.4 to 2.5 mIU/L). Patients with low thyroid function were assigned to groups of subclinical hypothyroidism (plasma level of TSH above 4.5 mIU/L within a normal thyroid hormone level; n=59) or low-normal thyroid function (higher plasma TSH level [2.5 to 4.5 mIU/L] within a normal thyroid hormone level; n=84). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors independently associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and advanced fibrosis.NASH and advanced fibrosis were found in higher percentages of subjects with low thyroid function vs strict-normal thyroid function (52.4% vs 37.2% for NASH and 21.0% vs 10.6% for advanced fibrosis; P < .01). Among subjects with low thyroid function, a higher proportion of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism had NASH and associated advanced fibrosis vs patients with low-normal thyroid function (57.6% vs 48.8% for NASH and 25.4% vs 17.9% for advanced fibrosis; P < .01). Subjects with low thyroid function had more extensive hepatic steatosis with greater severity of balloon degeneration and fibrosis. In multivariate analyses, low thyroid function was significantly associated with NASH (odds ratio, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.04-2.50; P = .035) and advanced fibrosis (odds ratio, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.18-4.23; P = .014). Risks of NASH and advanced fibrosis increased significantly with plasma concentration of TSH (Ptrend <.05 for each).Subclinical hypothyroidism and low-normal thyroid function are independent predictors of NASH and advanced fibrosis, confirming the relationship between these diseases.

HE is currently a diagnosis of exclusion, requiring an extensive workup to exclude other possible etiologies, including mental status changes, metabolic, infectious, traumatic, and iatrogenic causes. The categorization of HE encompasses a continuum, varying from the clinically silent minimal HE (MHE), which is only detectable using psychometric tests, to overt HE, which is further divided into four grades of severity. While there has been an increased effort to create fast and reliable methods for the detection of MHE, screening is still underperformed due to the lack of standardization and efficient methods of diagnosis. The management of HE requires consultation from various disciplines, including hepatology, primary care physicians, neurology, psychiatry, dietician/nutritionist, social workers, and other medical and surgical subspecialties based on clinical presentation and clear communication among these disciplines to best manage patients with HE throughout their course. The first-line therapy for HE is lactulose with or without rifaximin. Following the initial episode of overt HE, secondary prophylaxis with lactulose and/or rifaximin is indicated with the goal to prevent recurrent episodes and improve quality of life. Recent studies have demonstrated the negative impact of MHE on quality of life and clinical outcomes. In light of all this, we emphasize the importance of screening and treating MHE in patients with liver cirrhosis, particularly through a multidisciplinary team approach.

The model compared simeprevir+PR) and ombitasvir+paritaprevir/ritonavir+dasabuvir\u00b1ribavirin) therapies with no treatment. Sustained virological response rates were based on Phase III RCTs. We assumed that 80% and 95% of HCV-GT1 patients were eligible for second-generation triple and all-oral regimens. Transition probabilities, utility and mortality were based on literature review. The value of cure was calculated by the difference in the savings from the economic gains associated with additional QALYs.Model estimated 1.52 million treatment-na\u00efve HCV-GT1 patients in the US. Treating all eligible HCV-GT1 patients with second-generation triple and all-oral therapies resulted in 3.2 million and 4.8 million additional QALYs gained compared to no treatment respectively. Using $50,000 as value of QALY, these regimens lead to savings of $185 billion and $299 billion; costs of these regimens were $109 billion and $128 billion. The value of cure with second-generation triple and all-oral regimens was $55 billion and $111 billion, when we conservatively assumed only drug costs. Cost savings were greater for HCV-GT1 patient cured with cirrhosis compared to patients without cirrhosis.The recent evolution of regimens for HCV GT1 has increased efficacy and value of cure.

Liver transplantation 2016; 22 (10): 1356-1366 Abstract Receiving Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) exception status for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) improves wait-list survival and probability of liver transplantation (LT). We aim to evaluate etiology-specific disparities in MELD exception, LT wait-list times, and post-LT outcomes among patients with HCC listed for LT. Using United Network for Organ Sharing 2004-2013 data, we evaluated adults (age > 18 years) with HCC secondary to hepatitis C virus (HCV), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), alcoholic cirrhosis (EtOH), EtOH/HCV, and combined HBV/HCV. Multivariate regression models evaluated etiology-specific odds of active exception, probability of receiving LT, and post-LT survival. In total, 10,887 HCC patients were listed for LT from 2004 to 2013. Compared with HCV-HCC patients (86.8%), patients with NASH-HCC (67.7%), and EtOH-HCC (64.4%) had a lower proportion with active MELD exception (P < 0.001). On multivariate regression, NASH-HCC and EtOH-HCC patients had significantly lower odds of active MELD exception compared with HCV-HCC (NASH-HCC-odds ratio [OR], (HR, 0.92; 95% CI 0.85-0.99; P = 0.03) were less likely to receive LT if they had active exception. Without active exception, these discrepancies were more significant (NASH-HCC-HR, 0.22; 95% 0.22-0.32; P < 0.001). In conclusion, among US adults with HCC listed for LT, patients with NASH-HCC, EtOH-HCC, and EtOH/HCV-HCC were significantly less likely to have active MELD exception compared with HCV-HCC, and those without active exception had a lower likelihood of receiving LT. More research is needed to explore why NASH-HCC patients were less likely to have active MELD exception. Liver Transplantation 22 1356-1366 2016 AASLD.

Medicine 2016; 95 (41) Abstract New direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy has dramatically increased cure rates for patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), but has also substantially raised treatment costs.The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the therapeutic benefit and net costs (i.e. efficiency frontier) and the quality-adjusted cost of care associated with the evolution of treatment regimens for patients with HCV genotype 1 in the United and clinical trial compared four approved regimens in treatment-na\u00efve genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C patients, including pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PR), first generation triple therapy (boceprevir + PR and telaprevir + PR), second generation triple therapy (sofosbuvir + PR and simeprevir + PR) and of care (QACC). QACC was defined as the increase in treatment cost minus the increase in the patient's quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) when valued at $50,000 per QALY.All-oral therapy improved the average sustained virologic response (SVR) rate to 96%, thereby offsetting the high drug acquisition cost of $85,714, which resulted in the highest benefit based on the efficiency frontier. Furthermore, while oral therapies increased HCV drug costs by $48,350, associated QALY gains decreased quality-adjusted cost of care by $14,120 compared to dual therapy. When the value of a QALY was varied from $100,000 to $300,000, the quality adjusted cost of care compared to dual therapy ranged from - $21,234 to - $107,861, - $89,007 to - $293,130, - $176,280 to - $500,599 for first generation triple, second generation triple, and all-oral therapies, respectively. Primary efficacy and safety measurements for drug regimens were sourced from clinical trials data rather than a real-world setting. Factors such as individual demographic characteristics, comorbidities and alcohol consumption of the individual patients treated may alter disease progression but were not captured in this analysis.New DAA treatments provide short-term and long-term clinical and economic value to society.Gilead Sciences, Inc.

The new oral direct-acting agents appear to be effective and safe in these patients.To evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of simeprevir and sofosbuvir in a diverse real-life cohort of patients, including difficult-to-treat patients.We conducted a retrospective cohort study in 198 consecutive patients with hepatitis C genotype 1 (148 nontransplant, 50 post transplant), who were treated with simeprevir and sofosbuvir for 12 weeks between December 2013 and December 2014. Primary outcome was sustained virological response with undetectable HCV RNA 12 weeks after completion of therapy (SVR12). Risk factors evaluated for lack of SVR12 included HCV 1a (vs. 1b), prior treatment (vs. none), and cirrhosis (vs. no cirrhosis).SVR12 rates were similar in non- and post-transplant settings, 82% and 88%, respectively. There were no significant differences in adverse events in patients regardless of cirrhosis or transplant status. On multivariate analysis also inclusive of gender and liver transplant status, negative predictors of SVR12 were having at least 2 or 3 risk factors (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10-0.87, P = 0.027 or 0.09-0.85, P = 0.025, respectively).Simeprevir and sofosbuvir combination is a safe and effective regimen for the treatment of non- and post-transplant patients with traditional risk factors for poor treatment response, unless more than 2 difficult-to-treat risk factors are present.

Journal of clinical and translational hepatology 2016; 4 (3): 169-174 Abstract Background and Aims: Utilization of living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) and its relationship with recipient Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) needs further evaluation in the United States (U.S.). We evaluated the association between recipient MELD score at the time of surgery and survival following LDLT. Methods: All U.S. adult LDLT recipients with MELD < 25 were evaluated using the 1995-2012 United Network for Organ Sharing registry. Survival following LDLT was stratified into three MELD categories (MELD < 15 vs. MELD 15-19 vs. MELD 20-24) and evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Overall, 2,258 patients underwent LDLT. Compared to patients with MELD < 15, overall 5-year survival following LDLT was similar among patients with MELD 15-19 (80.9% vs. 80.3%, p = 0.77) and MELD 20-24 (81.2% vs. 80.3%, p = 0.73). When compared to patients with MELD < 15, there was no significant difference in long-term post-LDLT survival among those with MELD 15-19 (HR: 1.11, 95% CI: 0.85-1.45, p = 0.45) and a non-significant trend towards lower survival in patients with MELD 20-24 (HR: 1.28, 95% CI: 0.91-1.81, p = 0.16). Only of LDLTs were performed in patients with MELD 20-24 and the remaining 86% in patients with MELD < 20. Conclusion: LDLT is underutilized in patients with MELD 20 and higher.

Digestive diseases and sciences 2016; 61 (9): 2505-2515 Abstract Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections remain one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Healthcare initiatives for chronic viral hepatitis to facilitate early diagnosis and linkage to care in an effort to reduce inpatient resource utilization associated with late diagnosis and end-stage liver disease have been partially successful.Our objective was to determine the impact of liver-related complications from chronic HBV and HCV infections on inpatient cost of care, length of stay, and mortality.Using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, National Inpatient Sample (HCUP-NIS), we studied the impact of chronic HBV and HCV infections on inpatient healthcare system following hospitalizations from 2003 to 2012.Of the 79,185,729 million hospitalizations among adult patients in the USA from 2003 to 2012, 143,896 (0.18 %) hospitalizations were HBV related and 1,073,269 (1.36 %) hospitalizations HCV related. HBV hospitalizations had a higher inpatient mortality (OR 1.34; 95 % CI 1.30, 1.38), median cost of care per hospitalization (+$2100.33; 95 % CI 1982.53, 2217.53), and increased length of hospitalization stay (+0.64 days; 95 % CI 0.60, 0.68; p < 0.01) compared to HCV.Despite higher per case resource utilization following hospitalization, HBV-infected patients demonstrate a lower inpatient survival in comparison with chronic HCV infection. These disparate observations underscore the need for early diagnosis of chronic HBV infection in at-risk population and prompt linkage to care.

Of those, 319 (1.83%) had positive HCV serology. The HCV-positive recipients were 1.6 years younger, less Caucasian and more African-American, and had a significantly higher rate of co-infection with hepatitis B virus (all P < 0.001). Post-transplant patients were discharged alive at similar rates regardless of HCV status: 88.4% in HCV+ vs. 90.3% in HCV- (P = 0.25). The mortality rates were also similar at 1 and 2 years after transplantation (20.7% in HCV+ vs. 19.2% in vs. 28.9% in HCV-, respectively; both P > 0.05), but at post-transplant year 3 year, mortality rate in HCV+ became significantly higher (42.5% vs. 36.4%, P = 0.04) and remained higher for the duration of the follow-up (mean 9.1 years, max 18.4 years). In multivariate survival analysis, after adjustment for confounders, being HCV+ was associated with higher mortality: adjusted hazard ratio 1.24 (1.04-1.46), P = 0.01. No association of HCV infection with time to graft loss was found (P = 0.92).Chronic HCV infection is associated with a moderate increase in post-lung transplant mortality. Treatment of HCV in lung transplant recipients may, therefore, result in improvement of post-transplant outcomes.

Real-world and clinical trial SVR and cost-per-SVR data have not been reported for the all-oral, peginterferon-free and ribavirin (RBV)-free ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) regimen. Our objective was to compare the rates of SVR achievement and cost per SVR between pooled data from clinical studies of LDV/SOF and from real-world clinical practice.Data were derived from the Hepatitis C Therapeutic Registry and Research Network (HCV-TARGET), a real-world, multicenter, prospective, observational study; and from the TRIO Network, a retrospective database of HCV-treated patients. The 1-year cost per SVR was calculated as the total cost of an SVR ([cost of treatment regimen, adverse events, and monitoring costs] per SVR) during the first year of treatment.After 12 weeks, the SVR rates obtained in real-world studies ranged from 94% to 98%, comparing favorably with the SVRs achieved in the ION-1 and ION-3 trials (94% and 95%-99% with 8 and 12 weeks of RBV-free therapy, respectively). A single SVR, on average, cost $84,989 among patients enrolled in the ION-3 trial, with higher costs ($101,204) among patients with compensated cirrhosis compared with noncirrhotic patients ($81,668). In the pooled TARGET/TRIO population, the average cost of an SVR was $84,770, with costs of $101,380 and $81,368 in patients with compensated cirrhosis and patients without cirrhosis, respectively.Unlike the results obtained with prior HCV regimens, this study suggests that similar SVR rates are achieved with LDV/SOF in clinical trial-based studies and real-world studies. Further, achieving an SVR in real-world clinical practice was not associated with excess costs.

World journal of hepatology 2016; 8 (2): 117-122 Abstract Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging pathogen and an increasingly recognized cause of graft hepatitis, especially in the post-orthotopic liver transplantation immunocompromised population. The exact incidence and prevalence of HEV infection in this population remains unclear but is certainly greater than historical estimates. Identifying acute HEV infection in this population is imperative for choosing the right course of management as it is very difficult to distinguish histologically from acute rejection on liver biopsy. Current suggested approach to manage acute HEV involves modifying immunosuppression, especially discontinuing calcineurin inhibitors which are the preferred immunosuppressive agents post-orthotopic liver transplantation. The addition of ribavirin monotherapy has shown promising success rates in clearing HEV infection and is used commonly in reported cases.

World journal of hepatology 2016; 8 (1): 69-73 Abstract Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease is the leading indication for liver transplantation (LT) worldwide. However, HCV is an independent predictor of lower survival following LT, and recurrence of HCV post-LT is virtually universal. The historic standard of care during the interferon era of HCV therapy was expectant management-initiation of antiviral therapy in the setting of documented disease progression following LT. With the advent of new direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapies for HCV, the paradigm of expectant treatment for recurrent HCV infection post-LT is shifting. The safety, tolerability, and efficacy of DAAs, even among the sickest patients with advanced liver disease, enables treatment of HCV in the pre-transplant setting among LT waitlist registrants. Finally, emerging data are supportive of preemptive therapy with DAAs in liver transplant recipients as the preferred approach. Expectant management of HCV following LT can rarely be justified in the modern era of HCV therapy.

Abstract Patients with Down syndrome who received blood transfusions, likely in conjunction with cardiothoracic surgery for congenital heart disease and prior to the implementation of blood-donor screening for hepatitis C virus infection, face a substantial risk of acquiring the infection. In the past, interferon-based therapy for chronic hepatitis C infection in patients with Down syndrome was noted to have lower efficacy and potentially higher risk of adverse effects. Recently, the treatment for chronic hepatitis C has been revolutionized with the introduction of interferon-free direct acting antivirals with favorable safety, tolerability, and efficacy profile. Based on our experiences, the newly approved sofosbuvir-based direct acting antiviral therapy is well tolerated and highly efficacious in this subpopulation of hepatitis C virus infected patients with Down syndrome.

Current hepatology reports 2016; 15 (4): 237-244 Abstract Although currently available therapies for chronic hepatitis B virus infection can suppress viremia and provide long-term benefits for patients, they do not lead to a functional cure for most patients. Advances in our understanding of the virus-host interaction and the recent remarkable success of immunotherapy in cancer offer new and promising strategies for developing immune modulators that may become important components of a total therapeutic approach to hepatitis B, some of which are now in clinical development. Among the immunomodulatory agents currently being investigated to combat chronic HBV are toll-like receptor agonists, immune checkpoint inhibitors, therapeutic vaccines, and engineered T cells. The efficacy of some immune modulatory therapies is compromised by high viral antigen levels. Cutting edge strategies, including RNA interference and CRISPR/Cas9, are now being studied that may ultimately be shown to have the capacity to lower viral antigen levels sufficiently to substantially increase the efficacy of these agents. The current advances in therapies for chronic hepatitis B are leading us toward the possibility of a functional cure.

World 2015; 7 (29): 2871-2879 Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a major complication of cirrhosis resulting in significant socioeconomic burden, morbidity, and mortality. HE can be further subdivided into covert HE (CHE) and overt HE (OHE). CHE is a subclinical, less severe manifestation of HE and requires psychometric testing for diagnosis. Due to the time consuming screening process and lack of standardized diagnostic criteria, CHE is frequently underdiagnosed despite its recognized role as a precursor to OHE. Screening for CHE with the availability of the Stroop test has provided a pragmatic method to promptly diagnose CHE. Management of acute OHE involves institution of lactulose, the preferred first-line therapy. In addition, prompt recognition and treatment of precipitating factors is critical as it may result in complete resolution of acute episodes of OHE. Treatment goals include improvement of daily functioning, evaluation for liver transplantation, and prevention of OHE recurrence. For secondary prophylaxis, intolerance to indefinite lactulose therapy may lead to non-adherence and has been identified as a precipitating factor for recurrent OHE. Rifaximin is an effective add-on therapy to lactulose for treatment and prevention of recurrent OHE. Recent studies have demonstrated comparable efficacy of probiotic therapy to lactulose use in both primary prophylaxis and secondary prophylaxis.

These drugs have revolutionized the management of HCV as all-oral regimens with favorable side effect profiles and superior rates of sustained virological response. Emerging real-world data are demonstrating results comparable to registration trials for DAA agents. Suddenly, the potential for eradicating HCV is on the horizon.

Almost 80 % of patients with cirrhosis and 85 % of patients with prior treatment experience achieved SVR-12.Treatment effectiveness with sofosbuvir-based regimens in medically underserved areas utilizing task-shifting from a specialist to a mid-level provider is comparable to those achieved in pivotal clinical trials for these regimens, and to \"real-world\" experiences of tertiary care centers in the USA.

World journal of gastroenterology 2015; 21 (42): 11893-11903 Abstract Alcoholic hepatitis is a pro-inflammatory chronic liver disease that is associated with high short-term morbidity and mortality (25%-35% in one month) in the setting of chronic alcohol use. Histopathology is notable for micro- and macrovesicular steatosis, acute neutrophil perivenular and perisinusoidal fibrosis, and Mallory hyaline bodies found in ballooned hepatocytes. Other findings include the characteristic eosinophilic fibrillar material (Mallory's hyaline bodies) found in ballooned hepatocytes. The presence of focal intense lobular infiltration of neutrophils is what typically distinguishes alcoholic hepatitis from other forms of hepatitis, in which the inflammatory infiltrate is primarily composed of mononuclear cells. Management consists of a multidisciplinary approach including alcohol cessation, fluid and electrolyte correction, treatment of alcohol withdrawal, and pharmacological therapy based on the severity of the disease. Pharmacological treatment for severe alcoholic hepatitis, as defined by Maddrey's discriminant factor 32, consists of either prednisolone or pentoxifylline for a period of four weeks. The body of evidence for corticosteroids has been greater than pentoxifylline, although there are higher risks of complications. Recently head-to-head trials between corticosteroids and pentoxifylline have been performed, which again suggests that corticosteroids should strongly be considered over pentoxifylline.

Patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a subset of NAFLD, are at risk for progressive liver disease and in need of effective treatment options. A practical approach may be pursued by identifying patients with NAFLD with the highest likelihood for histologic evidence of NASH. Despite decades of clinical trials, no single treatment can be recommended to all patients with NASH. Importantly, there is no evidence that pioglitazone or vitamin E improves fibrosis. Bariatric surgeries may improve histology in morbidly obese patients with NASH, although randomized clinical trials are lacking. Currently, NASH is the second leading etiology of liver disease among adults awaiting liver transplantation in the United States. The primary and secondary prevention of NAFLD may require aggressive strategies for managing obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.

The pathogenesis of NAFLD associated non-cirrhotic HCC is distinct from that of cirrhotic HCC because the metabolic syndrome (MS) along with obesity and insulin resistance (IR) underlie several unique mechanisms that promote tumorigenesis. IR associated with MS, NAFLD, and type 2 diabetes mellitus lead to the release of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, leptin and resistin, as well as decreased amounts of adiponectin. These processes favor the development of hepatic steatosis and inflammation within the liver, which precede HCC development. Nevertheless, further investigation is necessary to elucidate the determinants for development of HCC in patients with NAFLD in the absence of cirrhosis.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most common indication for liver transplantation in the United States. Given the rising prevalence of HCV-related SLKT, it is important to understand the impact of HCV in this patient population.We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the United Network for Organ Sharing registry to assess adult patients undergoing SLKT in the United States from 2003 to 2012. Patient survival following SLKT was assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.Patients infected with non-HCV have significantly lower survival following SLKT compared to non-HCV patients at three (three-yr survival: 71.0% vs. 78.9%, p 0.01) and five yr (five-yr survival: 61.4% vs. 72.5%, p < 0.01). The results of multivariate regression analyses demonstrated that patients infected with HCV had significantly lower survival following SLKT than patients with non-HCV disease (HR 1.41, 95% CI, 1.19-1.67, p < 0.001). In addition, lower post-SLKT survival was noted among patients with diabetes (HR 1.34, 95% CI, 1.13-1.58, p < 0.001) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HR 1.60, 95% CI, 1.17-2.18, p < 0.01).Hepatitis C infection is associated with lower patient survival following SLKT.

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the hepatic manifestation of the MS, with or without nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) can predispose to HCC in the absence of cirrhosis or advanced fibrosis. Nevertheless, the US literature investigating non-cirrhotic HCC in the setting of NAFLD/NASH and MS is lacking.To describe a retrospective case series of patients who developed HCC without cirrhosis in the setting of NAFLD/NASH or features of the MS.We identified NAFLD/NASH-associated HCC cases arising in the absence of cirrhosis between January 2010 and September 2012 from a tumor board database at Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC).Of 44 cases of HCC reviewed, six cases of non-cirrhotic HCC associated with NAFLD/NASH and/or MS were identified. Only one patient underwent partial hepatectomy with curative intent. The other five might have been candidates for potential curative partial hepatectomy or liver transplantation had they been diagnosed earlier.Our case series highlights the development of NAFLD/NASH and MS-associated HCC in the absence of cirrhosis in the US population and raises the important question of HCC screening for this at-risk group.

Two-thirds of the obese and diabetic populations are estimated to develop NAFLD. Currently, NAFLD is the most common etiology for chronic liver disease globally. The clinical spectrum of NAFLD ranges from simple steatosis, an accumulation of fat greater than 5% of liver weight, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a more aggressive form with necroinflammation and fibrosis. Among the patients who develop NASH, up to 20% may advance to cirrhosis and are at risk for complications of end-stage liver disease. One of the major complications observed in patients with NASH-related cirrhosis is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which has emerged as the sixth most common cancer and second leading etiology of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The incidence of HCC in the United States alone has tripled over the last three decades. In addition, emerging data are suggesting that a small proportion of patients with NAFLD may be at higher risk for HCC in the absence of cirrhosis - implicating obesity and diabetes mellitus as potential risk factors for HCC.

However, whether severity of HE at the time of liver transplantation (LT) directly impacts post-LT survival or whether this suspected mortality linkage is due to more severe liver disease and subsequently higher rates of post-LT infection is not well defined. Using population-based data from the 2003 to 2013 United Network for Organ Sharing registry, we evaluated the impact of HE at the time of LT on post-LT survival among adults in the United States. Survival was stratified by HE severity (none, grade 1-2, grade 3-4) and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score and was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. From 2003 to 2013, 59,937 patients underwent LT (36.1%, no HE; 53.8%, grade 1-2 HE; 10.2%, grade 3-4 HE). Compared to no HE, patients with grade 3-4 HE had significantly lower overall post-LT survival (1-year, 90.3%; < 0.001). On multivariate regression, grade 3-4 HE was independently associated with lower overall post-LT survival (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.17-1.39; P < 0.001). However, the increased mortality associated with HE is observed primarily within the first year following LT and was a reflection of higher rates of infection-related deaths among patients with more severe HE. In conclusion, grade 3-4 HE at the time of LT is associated with lower post-LT survival, with a proposed direct or indirect association of more severe HE before LT with increased rates of post-LT infections. Increased awareness and vigilance toward treating HE before LT and more aggressive monitoring and treatment for infections in the perioperative setting may improve LT outcomes.

Our current study aims to further delineate the impact of obesity using population-based registry data from the USA.All US adult liver transplant recipients from 2003 to 2012 were evaluated using the United Network for Organ Sharing registry. The impact of obesity on survival following liver transplantation was further stratified into class I obesity [body mass index (BMI) 30.0-34.9 kg/m(2)], class II obesity kg/m(2)), and III obesity (BMI 40 kg/m(2)) and evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models.Overall, 57,255 patients with chronic liver disease underwent liver transplantation, among which 32.9 % had BMI 30 kg/m(2). While patients in all obesity classes had similar survival to patients with BMI 18.0-24.9 kg/m(2), the presence of concurrent diabetes mellitus resulted in significantly lower post-transplant survival. After multivariate regression, post-transplant survival in patients with class II obesity (HR 0.97; 95 % CI 0.89-1.05) or class III obesity (HR 0.99; 95 % CI 0.90-1.09) was not significantly lower than patients with BMI 18.0-24.9 kg/m(2), but diabetes mellitus was independently associated with lower post-transplant survival (HR 1.29; 95 % CI 1.21-1.36).In conclusion, obesity alone was not associated with lower post-transplant survival. However, DM, either alone or comorbid with obesity, is associated with significantly greater post-transplant mortality.

Gastroenterology 2015; 148 (3): 547-555 Abstract Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has been predicted to become the leading indication for liver transplantation (LT) in the United States. However, few studies have evaluated changes in the etiology of liver diseases among patients awaiting LT, and none have focused on the effects of NASH on liver transplant waitlists in the United States.We collected data from the United Network for Organ Sharing and Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network registry from 2004 through 2013, on liver transplant waitlist registrants with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, NASH, alcoholic liver disease (ALD), or a combination of HCV infection and ALD. We compared differences in survival within 90 days of registration (90-day survival) and probability of LT among patients with different diseases using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate logistic regression models.Between 2004 and 2013, new waitlist registrants with NASH increased by 170% (from 804 to 2174), with ALD increased by 45% (from 1400 to 2024), and with HCV increased by 14% (from 2887 to 3291); registrants with HCV and ALD decreased by 9% (from 880 to 803). In 2013, NASH became the second-leading disease among liver transplant waitlist registrants, after HCV. Patients with ALD had a significantly higher mean Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score at time of waitlist registration than other registrants. However, after multivariate adjustment, patients with ALD were less likely to die within 90 days when compared with patients with NASH (odds ratio [OR] = 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67-0.89; P < .001); patients with HCV infection or HCV and ALD had similar odds for 90-day survival compared with NASH patients. Compared with patients with NASH, patients with HCV (OR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.35-1.55; (OR 95% CI: 1.06-1.24; P < .001), (OR = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.18-1.42; P < .001) had higher odds for 90-day survival.Based on data from US adult LT databases, since 2004 the number of adults with NASH awaiting LTs has almost tripled. However, patients with NASH are less likely to undergo LT and less likely to survive for 90 days on the waitlist than patients with HCV, ALD, or HCV and ALD.

Alimentary pharmacology sofosbuvir (SOF) is now approved for the treatment of patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1.To estimate the health economic outcomes for LDV/SOF compared with current treatments in US patients infected with HCV genotype 1.A hybrid decision-tree and Markov state-transition model was developed. For a cohort of 10 000 patients, the model captured outcomes for several pairings of LDV/SOF with comparators, including long-term health outcomes, number need to treat, life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYS) gained, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and costs per sustained virologic response (SVR). Patients with different levels of treatment experience and different cirrhosis stages were included.LDV/SOF decreased the number of advanced liver disease cases by 0-93% compared with current regimens or no treatment in treatment-na\u00efve patients. In treatment-experienced [pegIFN plus ribavirin (PR) or protease inhibitor (PI) + PR] patients, treatment with LDV/SOF decreased the incidence of advanced liver disease complications in most of the cases analysed, except SOF + SMV. For all patient sub-cohorts, LDV/SOF was associated with the lowest 1-year costs per SVR and, with regard to lifetime incremental costs per QALY gained, was either dominant or the most cost-effective treatment. Overall, treatment initiation at earlier stages of liver fibrosis resulted in improved health economic outcomes.LDV/SOF is associated with more favourable short- and long-term health economic outcomes compared with current therapies for patients across all levels of treatment experience and cirrhosis stages.

Journal of clinical gastroenterology 2015; 49 (2): 158-164 Abstract We aimed to determine the incidence and predictors of recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after partial hepatectomy.Liver transplantation is the preferred treatment for selected patients with HCC, but access to donor organs is limited. Partial hepatectomy is another accepted treatment option; however, postoperative recurrence is frequently observed.This is a retrospective cohort study of 107 consecutive patients who underwent partial hepatectomy for HCC between January 1993 and February 2011 at a US University Medical Center. Study endpoints were recurrent HCC, death, loss to follow-up, or last visit without HCC.The study cohort was 78% male with a median age of 61 years and 59% Asians. A total of 50 patients developed recurrent HCC (46.7%) after a median follow-up of 12 (1 to 69) months postresection. Recurrent HCC was significantly higher in patients with left-sided resection (41% at year 1, 54% at year 2, 62% at year 3, 81% at year 4, and 90% at year 5) compared with right-sided resection (18% at year 1, 34% at year 2, 36% at year 3, 44% at year 4, and 72% at year 5). In multivariate Cox proportional hazards model also inclusive of anatomic resection and TNM stage 3/4, left-sided resection was significantly with increased HCC recurrence (hazard ratio, 2.13; P=0.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-4.2) compared with right-sided resection.HCC rate is higher among those undergoing left-sided resection: 54% at year 2 and 81% at year 4. Liver transplantation should be considered in patients who are at high risk for recurrence.

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is not included in MELD, and severity of liver disease and risk of wait-list removal or wait-list death may be underestimated by MELD in patients with HE. Using United Network for Organ Sharing registry data, we evaluated the impact of HE on 90-day wait-list survival among adult LT wait-list registrants in the United States from 2003 to 2012. Survival was stratified by HE severity (none, grade 1-2, grade 3-4) and MELD. There were 84,947 new LT wait-list registrants during the study period; 36.8% had no HE, 57.4% had grade 1-2 HE, and 5.9% had grade 3-4 HE. Ninety-day wait-list mortality was significantly higher among patients with grade 3-4 HE compared with patients with grade 1-2 HE or no HE (24.4% versus 6.8% versus 3.5%; P < 0.001). When stratified by MELD, patients with grade 3-4 HE had 90-day wait-list mortality similar to that of nonencephalopathic patients with MELD scores 6-7 points higher. With the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, patients with grade 3-4 HE had 66% greater risk of 90-day mortality than patients without HE (hazard ratio = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.45-1.90; P < 0.001). The inclusion of HE severity in MELD improved the area under receiver operating curve for predicting 90-day wait-list survival from 0.6508 to 0.6863. In conclusion, grade 3-4 HE at time of wait-list registration significantly increases 90-day wait-list mortality independent of MELD score. Incorporating HE in the assessment of LT priority may improve prognostication of liver disease severity and prioritization for LT.

Liver transplantation 2014; 20 (12): 1454-1461 Abstract The prioritization of liver transplantation (LT) for patients with end-stage liver disease uses the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), which attempts to identify the sickest patients and thereby those who are in greatest need for LT. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is not included in MELD, and severity of liver disease and risk of wait-list removal or wait-list death may be underestimated by MELD in patients with HE. Using United Network for Organ Sharing registry data, we evaluated the impact of HE on 90-day wait-list survival among adult LT wait-list registrants in the United States from 2003 to 2012. Survival was stratified by HE severity (none, grade 1-2, grade 3-4) and MELD. There were 84,947 new LT wait-list registrants during the study period; 36.8% had no HE, 57.4% had grade 1-2 HE, and 5.9% had grade 3-4 HE. Ninety-day wait-list mortality was significantly higher among patients with grade 3-4 HE compared with patients with grade 1-2 HE or no HE (24.4% versus 6.8% versus 3.5%; P < 0.001). When stratified by MELD, patients with grade 3-4 HE had 90-day wait-list mortality similar to that of nonencephalopathic patients with MELD scores 6-7 points higher. With the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, patients with grade 3-4 HE had 66% greater risk of 90-day mortality than patients without HE (hazard ratio = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.45-1.90; P < 0.001). The inclusion of HE severity in MELD improved the area under receiver operating curve for predicting 90-day wait-list survival from 0.6508 to 0.6863. In conclusion, grade 3-4 HE at time of wait-list registration significantly increases 90-day wait-list mortality independent of MELD score. Incorporating HE in the assessment of LT priority may improve prognostication of liver disease severity and prioritization for LT.

However, significant racial disparities in the prevalence of obesity have been reported. To evaluate racial disparities and trends in the prevalence of obesity and obesity-related diseases. A population-based retrospective cohort study utilized data from the 1985 to 2011 California Behavioral Risk Factor Survey. Trends in obesity prevalence were stratified by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors. Multivariate logistic regression models evaluated independent predictors of obesity. The prevalence of obesity in significantly increased from 1985 to 2011 (8.6 vs. 22.8%, p < 0.001). This increase was seen among men and women, and among all race/ethnic, age, and socioeconomic groups. Hypertension and diabetes also increased during this time period (hypertension 20.7-35.9%; diabetes 4.2-11.2%). Obesity prevalence was highest in blacks and Hispanics, and lowest in Asians (blacks 33.3%; Hispanics 28.8%; Asians 9.0%; p < 0.001). Obesity prevalence was associated with lower education level, lower income, and unemployment status. After adjustments for age, sex, co morbidities, and surrogates of socioeconomic status, the increased risk of obesity in blacks and Hispanics persisted (blacks OR 1.51; Hispanics OR 1.18), whereas Asians were less likely to be obese (OR 0.37). While the overall prevalence of obesity increased from 1985 to 2011, significant racial/ethnic disparities in obesity have developed, with the highest prevalence seen in blacks and Hispanics, and the lowest seen in Asians.

It considered three patient cohorts: treatment-na\u00efve, treatment-experienced and treatment-na\u00efve human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infected. Subgroup analyses were conducted for treatment-na\u00efve patients with and without cirrhosis.Reductions in the incidence of new cases of liver-disease complications with sofosbuvir + pegIFN/RBV compared respectively. + pegIFN/RBV was typically associated with the lowest 1-year cost per SVR. When considering the lifetime incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained, sofosbuvir + pegIFN/RBV was the most cost-effective treatment option assessed. Sofosbuvir + pegIFN/RBV generally dominated (less costly and more effective than) boceprevir + pegIFN/RBV, telaprevir + pegIFN/RBV and simeprevir + pegIFN/RBV.Sofosbuvir + pegIFN/RBV yields more favourable future health and economic outcomes than current treatment regimens for patients across all levels of treatment experience and cirrhosis stage, as well as for individuals with or without HIV co-infection.

Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology 2014; 12 (8): 1363-1370 Abstract Prior studies have detected hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA polymerase mutations in treatment-naive patients. However, most of these studies used either direct polymerase chain reaction sequencing, which detects these mutations with low levels of sensitivity, or patient cohorts that were not well-characterized. We investigated the prevalence of HBV mutations in DNA polymerase by using a line probe assay.In a prospective, cross-sectional study, we enrolled 198 treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B (52.5% male; mean age, 41 years) from February 2009 to May 2011 from 3 gastroenterology and liver clinics in Northern California. Exclusion criteria included infection with hepatitis C or D viruses or human immunodeficiency virus. All patients completed a questionnaire (to determine demographics, history of liver disease, prior treatments, family medical history, drug and alcohol use, and environmental risk factors for hepatitis) that was administered by a research coordinator; mutations in HBV DNA polymerase were detected by using the INNO-LiPA HBV DR v.3 assay.Most patients were Vietnamese (48.5%) or (36.4%) and were infected with HBV genotypes B (67.5%) or C (24.2%). Mutations in HBV DNA polymerase were found in 2 patients (1%), rtI233V (n = 1) and rtM250M/L (n = 1).In a multicenter prospective study of treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B, we detected mutations in HBV DNA polymerase in only 1%. Because of the low prevalence of these mutations and the uncertain clinical significance of such quasispecies, routine HBV DNA polymerase mutation analysis cannot be recommended before initiation of antiviral therapy for treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B. The analysis requires further molecular and clinical studies.

We performed a systematic review to further investigate this association.We conducted a PubMed search of original research articles from January 1, 1995 to June 30, 2013 to identify case-control and cohort studies evaluating the association between HCV and CAD using keyword terms endpoints included myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, need for coronary artery bypass grafting, or transluminal percutaneous coronary angioplasty. Binary outcomes are reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI).We identified five studies (four cohort studies and one case-control study) that met our inclusion criteria. A significant association between HCV and CAD was demonstrated in one cohort study (adjusted HR 1.27; 95 % CI 1.22-1.31). One cohort study demonstrated a decreased risk of CAD associated with HCV (adjusted OR 0.74; 95 % CI 0.71-0.76). The remaining studies did not find a significant association between HCV and risk of CAD.The current systematic review demonstrates that the association between HCV and CAD remains unclear. We need more large, long-term cohort studies with clear definitions of patient population and endpoints to better ascertain the association between HCV and CAD.

The current study aims to evaluate race/ethnicity-specific and etiology-specific factors contributing to lower post-LT survival among African Americans in the USA. The 2002-2012 United Network for Organ Sharing registry was utilized to evaluate race/ethnicity-specific post-LT survival among patients with HCV, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), alcoholic liver disease (ALD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and cryptogenic cirrhosis. From 2002 to 2012, HCV was the leading indication for LT. While African Americans accounted for 9.5% of all LT during this period, they had the lowest overall and etiology-specific five-yr post-LT survival. On multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling, African Americans had significantly lower post-LT survival compared with non-Hispanic whites among patients with HCV (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.19-1.41), (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.19-1.94). In conclusion, African Americans had the lowest post-LT survival among patients with HCV, HCC, and ALD. Race/ethnicity and the etiology of chronic liver disease were observed to have a combined detrimental effect leading to lower survival following LT in African Americans.

Clinical transplantation 2014; 28 (6): 713-721 Abstract There is an increasing trend of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease undergoing liver transplantation in the U.S. Our study utilized data from the 2002-2012 United Network for Organ Sharing registry to evaluate MELD era trends in U.S. liver transplantations focused on patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), hepatitis C (HCV), alcoholic liver disease, and HCC. Survival outcomes were stratified by liver disease etiology and compared across time periods using Kaplan Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Patients with NASH were more likely to be women, had higher body mass index, and higher prevalence of diabetes and cardiac disease. However, overall long term survival was significantly higher in NASH and alcoholic liver disease patients (p < 0.001). Compared to HCV, NASH patients had significantly higher post-transplantation survival (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.63-0.77), and lower risk of graft failure (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.69-0.83). Despite having higher body mass index and higher prevalence of diabetes and cardiac disease, NASH patients had better post-liver transplantation survival compared to patients with HCV or HCC. Patients with alcoholic liver disease also had superior survival outcomes. However, these survival differences were limited to patients without HCC that underwent liver transplantation.

S. HEPATOLOGY 2014; 59 (6): 2188-2195 Abstract Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is currently the third leading indication for liver transplantation (LT) in the U.S. and is predicted to become the leading indication for LT in the near future. The trends in NASH-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) among LT recipients in the U.S. remain undefined. We performed a retrospective cohort study to evaluate trends in the etiology of HCC among adult LT recipients in the U.S. from 2002 to 2012, utilizing national data from the United Network for Organ Sharing registry. From 2002-2012, there were 61,868 adults who underwent LT in the U.S., including 10,061 patients HCC. The total number and proportion of HCC LT recipients demonstrated a significant increase following the implementation of the model for end stage liver disease (MELD) scoring system in 2002 (3.3%, n=143 in 2000 vs. 12.2%, n=714 in 2005 vs. 23.3%, n=1336 in 2012). The proportion of HCV-related HCC increased steadily from 2002 to 2012, and HCV remained the leading etiology of HCC throughout the MELD era (43.4% in 2002 vs. 46.3% in 2007 vs. 49.9% in 2012). NASH-related HCC also increased significantly, and NASH is the second leading etiology of HCC-related LT (8.3% in 2002 vs. 10.3% in 2007 vs. 13.5% in 2012). From 2002 to 2012, the number of patients undergoing LT for HCC secondary to NASH increased by nearly 4-fold, and the number of LT patients with HCC secondary to HCV increased by 2-fold. Conclusion: NASH is the second leading etiology of HCC leading to LT in the U.S. More importantly, NASH is currently the most rapidly growing indication for LT in patients with HCC in the U.S. (Hepatology 2013;).

To evaluate the disparate association of BMI and risk of hypertension and diabetes in Asians. We retrospectively studied 150,753 adults from the 1985-2011 California Behavioral Risk Factor Survey. Trends in prevalence of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes were stratified by ethnicity. Multivariate logistic regression models evaluated the incremental effect of one unit BMI increase on risk of hypertension and diabetes and the disparate risks of hypertension and diabetes at different BMI thresholds. Asians had the lowest BMI among all groups. However, the impact of increasing BMI on risk of hypertension and diabetes was significantly greater in Asians. For each one unit increase in BMI, Asians were significantly more likely to have hypertension (OR 1.15; 95 % CI 1.13-1.18) compared to non-Hispanic whites, blacks, and Hispanics. Similar trends were seen for diabetes (Asians: OR 1.15; 95 % CI 1.13-1.18). The risk of hypertension in Asians with BMI 22 was similar to non-Hispanic whites with BMI 27 and blacks with BMI 28. The risk of diabetes in Asians with BMI 28 was similar to non-Hispanic whites with BMI 30. Despite lower overall BMI compared to other groups, weight gain in Asians is associated with significantly higher risks of hypertension and diabetes. Compared to other ethnic groups, similar risks of hypertension and diabetes are seen in Asians at much lower BMI.

The rising prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) will in the near future lead to end-stage liver disease in a large cohort of patients with NASH-related cirrhosis and NASH is predicted to be a leading indication for liver transplantation in the coming decade. However, the prevalence of obesity and the progression of hepatic histological damage associated with NASH exhibit significant ethnic disparities. Despite a significantly lower body mass index and lower rates of obesity compared to other ethnic groups, Asians continue to demonstrate a significant prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and NASH. Ethnic disparities in central adiposity and visceral fat distribution have been hypothesized to contribute to these ethnic disparities. The current review focuses on the epidemiology of obesity and NASH among Asian populations.

In addition, HCV is the main cause of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) in the US. Recent developments in the diagnosis and treatment of HCV, including new recommendations pertaining to screening for HCV by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and newer treatment regimens with high efficacy, short duration and the potential for interferon-free therapies, have energised the health care practitioners regarding HCV management.To assess the full impact of HCV burden on clinical, economic and patient-reported outcomes.An expert panel was convened to assess the full impact of HCV burden on a number of important outcomes using an evidence-based approach predicated on Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. The literature was summarised, graded using an evidence-based approach and presented during the workshop. Workshop presentations were intended to review recent, relevant evidence-based literature and provide graded summary statements pertaining to HCV burden on topics including the relationships between HCV and the development of important outcomes.The associations of HCV with cirrhosis, HCC, liver-related mortality, type 2 diabetes mellitus, rheumatological diseases and quality of life impairments are supported by strong evidence. Also, there is strong evidence that sustained viral eradication of HCV can improve important outcomes such as mortality and quality of life.The current evidence suggests that HCV has been associated with tremendous clinical, economic and quality of life burden.

Digestive diseases and sciences 2014; 59 (1): 183-191 Abstract Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Existing studies comparing outcomes after liver transplantation (LT) versus surgical resection among transplant-eligible patients are conflicting.The purpose of this study was to compare long-term survival between consecutive transplant-eligible HCC patients treated with resection versus LT.The present retrospective matched case cohort study compares long-term survival outcomes between consecutive transplant-eligible HCC patients treated with resection versus LT using intention-to-treat (ITT) and as-treated models. Resection patients were matched to LT patients by age, sex, and etiology of HCC in a 1:2 ratio.The study included 171 patients (57 resection and 114 LT). Resection patients had greater post-treatment tumor recurrence (43.9 vs. 12.9 %, p < 0.001) compared to LT patients. In the as-treated model of the pre-model for end stage liver disease (MELD) era, LT patients had significantly better 5-year survival compared to resection patients (100 vs. 69.5 %, p = 0.04), but no difference was seen in the ITT model. In the multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, inclusive of age, sex, ethnicity, tumor stage, and MELD era (pre-MELD vs. post-MELD), treatment with resection was an independent predictor of poorer survival (HR 2.72; 95 % CI, 1.08-6.86).Transplant-eligible HCC patients who received LT had significantly better survival than those treated with resection, suggesting that patients who can successfully remain on LT listing and actually undergo LT have better outcomes.

The literature on these genotypes is sparse and this synopsis will review characteristics of patients infected with these genotypes.To review characteristics of patients infected with HCV genotypes 4, 5 and was conducted and relevant articles were reviewed.Intravenous drug use is generally responsible for HCV genotype 4 infection in developed countries, but unsafe medical practices cause most cases of HCV genotypes 4, 5 and 6 in endemic countries. The sustained virological response (SVR) rate for patients with HCV genotype 4 who receive pegylated interferon and ribavirin for 48 weeks ranges from 40% to 70% in various small studies. The SVR rate is in the 60-70% range for HCV genotype 5 and 70-80% range for HCV genotype 6 following 48 weeks with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Preliminary data suggest that a shorter course of 24 weeks of pegylated interferon and ribavirin may be acceptable for HCV genotype 6, with an SVR rate of approximately 70%.The current standard-of-care therapy for HCV genotypes 4, 5 and 6 is pegylated interferon and ribavirin for 48 weeks. A shorter course with 24 weeks of therapy may be considered for patients with genotype 6. Newer and much more effective therapies may be forthcoming in the next few years.

This study examines HCV-related HCC in Asians.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 792 consecutive Asian (n = 220) and non-Asian (n = 572) patients with HCV-related HCC identified at Stanford University Medical Center using International Classification of Diseases-9 diagnosis between July 1996 and June 2012.Asian patients were much older [66 (38-88) vs. 56 (31-87) years, P < 0.0001] and more likely to be female (33 vs. 19 %, P < 0.0001). A larger proportion of Asians were diagnosed with HCC within 2 years of HCV diagnosis (35 vs. 20 %, P = 0.001). Asian patients were more likely to undergo palliative therapy (46 vs. 28 %) and less likely to be listed for liver transplantation (20 vs. 48 %, P < 0.001), despite similar rates of meeting Milan criteria (52 vs. 58 %, P = 0.16). Overall, there was a trend for higher median survival rates in Asians (30 vs. 21 months, P = 0.091). Asians had higher long-term survival with palliative therapy only (5-year survival: 28 vs. 10 %, P < 0.0001); however, survival was similar among patients listed for liver transplantation.There were distinct differences in clinical presentations of Asian and non-Asian patients with HCV-related HCC. Asians with HCV-related HCC are less likely to undergo liver transplantation and more likely to have delayed HCV diagnosis. Improved strategies in HCV screening in Asians are needed, as it may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment of HCV infection and possible prevention of HCC development.

Journal of immigrant and minority health 2013; 15 (6): 1023-1029 Abstract The incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is higher in Asian Americans than in other ethnicities. While hepatitis B virus (HBV) is common, hepatitis C virus (HCV) is more prevalent in some subgroups. Our goal was to determine the etiology of liver disease associated with HCC in subgroups of Asian Americans. This was an analysis of 510 Asian HCC patients at a US medical center. Patients were identified using ICD9 diagnosis. Multivariate logistic regression was used to study predictors of HCV as the cause of HCC. Patients were Southeast Asian, Chinese, and Korean, with similar gender, age, and foreign-born status. Southeast Asians had a similar proportion of HBV- and HCV-related HCC, while Chinese and Korean patients had a higher proportion of HBV-related HCC. HCC was usually associated with HBV in Chinese and Korean patients, but both HCV and HBV were important associations in Southeast Asians.

Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology 2013; 28 (5): 855-860 Abstract Treatment end-point of therapy for patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) includes HBeAg seroconversion, which ranges from 15% to 22% after 1 year of oral nucleos(t)ides according to clinical trials. Our goal was to determine the incidence and predictors of HBeAg seroconversion in such patients in routine clinical practice because they may differ than reported rates.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 333 consecutive treatment-na\u00efve HBeAg-positive patients who were treated for CHB between 1/2000 and 6/2010 at three gastroenterology and liver clinics in the USA. Primary study end-point was HBeAg seroconversion-loss of HBeAg and antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) development.The majority of patients were Asian (96%). Median treatment duration prior to HBeAg seroconversion was 50 (range 26-52) weeks. Of the was 8.2%. On multivariate analysis inclusive of age, gender, and antiviral agents, independent predictors for HBeAg seroconversion at month 12 were hepatitis B virus DNA < 7.5 log10 IU/mL (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.59 [1.04-6.44]), P = 0.041) and alanine transaminase (ALT) > 1.5 \u00d7 upper normal limit (HR = 2.86 [1.05-7.81], P = 0.040), but not the choice of nucleos(t)ides.The HBeAg seroconversion rate seen in clinical settings for oral nucleos(t)ides appears much lower than those reported in pivotal trials, especially in patients with lower ALT and higher HBV DNA levels. HBeAg-positive patients should be counseled about the high possibility of the long treatment duration required to achieve recommended treatment end-points.

However, there are varying data on the treatment outcomes of ETV 0.5 mg daily in routine clinical settings, with seroconversion rates at 12 months ranging from 8 to 48% in studies limited to 44-90 patients from centers in Asia, Europe, and South America.In the present study, we examined long-term treatment efficacy and tolerability in 136 consecutive treatment-naive HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B patients treated between January 2005 and January 2011 with ETV 0.5 mg daily at community clinics and tertiary centers in the USA. The primary study end point was HBeAg seroconversion.Sixty-one percent of HBeAg-positive patients were men, mean age 39 \u00b1 12 years, median hepatitis B virus DNA IU/ml, median alanine median treatment duration 18 (6-60) months. At months 12, 24, and 36, complete viral suppression rates were 41, 66, and 85% and HBeAg seroconversion rates were 4.8, 20, and 30%, respectively. No patients experienced adverse events or developed genotypic resistance to ETV.In clinical settings, ETV is highly tolerable and potent at suppressing hepatitis B viremia; however, the rates of HBeAg seroconversion appear to be much lower than those reported, highlighting the importance of appropriate counseling and planning for long-term therapy.

We studied whether several donor cardiovascular risk factors (including advanced age, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus) contribute to worse outcomes for HCV positive and HCV negative liver transplant recipients.We obtained data from the United Network for Organ Sharing on all adult liver transplants performed in the United States between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2003. In total, 27,033 transplant cases were evaluated. Independent predictors of graft survival were determined using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis after controlling for factors previously found to be associated with differences in transplant outcomes.Donor diabetes was a strong independent risk factor for graft failure [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.20, p = 0.006] only in HCV positive recipients. Neither donor smoking status nor hypertension predicted graft loss in either cohort. Consistent with previous studies, advanced donor age, donation after cardiac death, height, and African American donor all predicted graft loss amongst both cohorts.Accounting for donor diabetes in relation to recipient HCV status in the selection of liver recipients may result in improved graft survival.

Thus, the presence of precore and BCP mutations in HBeAg-positive patients indicates an infection with a mixed viral population of wild-type and precore and/or BCP mutant hepatitis B virus (HBV). To date, there has been limited study of the prevalence and clinical significance of precore and BCP mutations in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B.To determine the prevalence, predictors and clinical characteristics of mixed wild-type and precore/BCP HBV infection, through a cross-sectional study, in a US cohort of patients with chronic hepatitis B.We conducted a retrospective study of 828 chronic hepatitis B patients with HBV genotype and mutation panel testing seen at three US gastroenterology and liver clinics from June 2005 to September 2009.A majority of our patients (92.3%) were either Vietnamese or Chinese American. In the HBeAg-positive cohort, 17% of patients had precore mutations only, 28% had BCP mutations only and 5% had both BCP and precore mutations. On multivariate analyses, HBV genotype C, increasing age, lower HBV DNA level and an ALT quotient >2 were independent predictors for the presence of precore and/or BCP mutations.The current distinction and management recommendations for HBeAg-positive vs. HBeAg-negative patients with chronic hepatitis B should be reassessed. Additional biomarkers and treatment endpoints should be studied for their usefulness in predicting continued viral suppression after treatment discontinuation.

We performed a prospective study to identify associations between etiologies of cirrhosis and ethnicity with HCC incidence.We used convenience sampling to select a cohort of 379 patients with cirrhosis who visited the liver clinic at the Stanford University Medical Center from 2001 to 2009 (65% male, 75% white or Hispanic, and 20% Asian). Study end points were HCC diagnosis by histology or noninvasive criteria, liver transplantation, or last screening without HCC. Patients were followed up, with ultrasound or computed tomographic imaging analyses and measurements of serum levels of -fetoprotein, approximately every 6 months, for a median time of 34 months (range, 6-99 mo).The etiologies of cirrhosis in the cohort were 7% hepatitis B, and 25% nonviral. Forty-four patients (12%) were diagnosed with HCC during the follow-up period. Patients with cirrhosis related to viral hepatitis had a statistically significantly higher incidence of HCC than those with nonviral diseases in Kaplan-Meier analysis (P = .04). There was no statistically significant difference in HCC incidence between Asian and non-Asian patients. In a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model that included age, sex, ethnicity, etiology, and Child-Pugh-Turcotte score, viral cirrhosis was associated significantly with HCC, compared with nonviral cirrhosis (hazard ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-10.1; P = .02) but Asian ethnicity was not.In a diverse cohort of patients in the United States with cirrhosis, a viral etiology of cirrhosis was associated with increased incidence of HCC, but Asian ethnicity was not. These findings indicate the importance of cirrhosis etiology in determining risk for HCC.

Our goal was to examine the complete viral suppression rate (undetectable HBV DNA PCR levels) with alternative therapies in such patients.We retrospectively studied 42 consecutive patients with partial response to entecavir (detectable HBV DNA at 12 months of therapy) who were treated at three clinics with rescue therapies: entecavir + adefovir (n = 5), tenofovir (n = 6), and entecavir + tenofovir (n = 31). Antiviral resistance was excluded by negative mutation analysis and/or absence of virologic breakthrough (increase >1 log(10)IU/mL from nadir).All patients were Asian and 57 % were male with a median age of 36 (22-64) years. Only a few patients had prior exposure to lamivudine (7 %) or adefovir (7 %). Almost all patients (95 %) had positive HBeAg. Overall, the complete viral suppression rate was 79 %, and the alanine aminotransferase normalization rate was 83 % in entecavir partial responders after 6 months on rescue therapies. Cumulative complete viral suppression rates were significantly different (P = 0.0164) among the entecavir + adefovir, tenofovir, and entecavir + tenofovir treatment groups at 6 months (20 vs. 83 vs. 83 %, respectively) and 12 months (20 vs. 100 vs. 97 %). All three patients without complete viral suppression on entecavir + adefovir became aviremic 6 months after switching to entecavir + tenofovir.Virologic response to entecavir + tenofovir combination therapy and tenofovir monotherapy appeared to be similar in most patients, but not with the entecavir + adefovir combination.

Recurrent viremia was defined as reappearance of detectable serum hepatitis B virus DNA (>100 IU/mL) on 2 consecutive laboratory tests from previously undetectable levels.Antiviral medications used at therapy was continued after HBeAg seroconversion in 49 patients (group I) and discontinued in the other 39 patients after consolidation therapy [median=12 months (range, 1 to 55 mo)] (group II). No patients in group I experienced recurrent viremia, whereas 90% in group II did. Elevated alanine aminotransferase also occurred in 38% of group II patients [median peak alanine aminotransferase 249 IU/mL (range, 93 to 1070 IU/mL)].Despite consolidation therapy, almost all patients who discontinued therapy after achieving HBeAg seroconversion and complete viral suppression experienced recurrent viremia, and close to half also experienced biochemical flares. HBeAg seroconversion does not seem to be a durable treatment endpoint for many patients, and they should be monitored carefully for virologic relapse and biochemical flares if antiviral therapy is withdrawn.

It is important to evaluate RFs for HCC in patients with chronic liver disease since HCC rarely occurs in those without underlying liver disease. We conducted a hospital-based case-control study of 259 incident HCC cases and 781 controls by convenience sampling between 02/2001 and 12/2009 from the liver clinic at Stanford University Medical Center. The study population was 41% White, 14% Hispanic, 3% African American, 40% Asian American, and 2% other race/ethnicity. RFs were examined through medical records and an in-person questionnaire. Alcohol and tobacco use was calculated by cumulative grams of alcohol or cumulative pack(s) of cigarette consumed over one's lifetime. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was defined by random glucose level of 200 mg/dL. RFs were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression. Independent predictors of HCC risk, after mutual adjustment and additional control for alcohol use, etiology of liver diseases, and DM, included age >40 (OR = 8.5 [2.6-28.3]), male gender (OR = 3.5 [2.2-5.8]), presence of cirrhosis (OR = 2.8 [1.6-4.9]), Asian ethnicity (OR = 2.8 [1.8-4.6]), AFP > 50 (OR = 4.2 [2.6-6.8]), and cumulative lifetime tobacco use of >11,000 packs (OR = 1.7 [1.0-2.9]). Heavy prolonged cigarette smoking, but not alcohol use, was a significant independent predictor for HCC in patients with underlying liver disease. Besides older age, male gender, presence of cirrhosis, and elevated AFP, Asian ethnicity and heavy cumulative tobacco use are strong independent predictors of HCC.

We hypothesized that Asian Americans infected with HCV may not identify with these established risk factors present in Caucasians and Hispanics, and our aim was to conduct a survey of risk factors in HCV-infected patients in these ethnic groups. In this prospective study, 494 patients infected with HCV completed a detailed risk assessment questionnaire at a liver centre in Northern California from 2001 to 2008. Among subjects participating in this study, 55% identified themselves as Caucasian, 20% as Hispanic, and 25% as Asian. Asian Americans were older, less likely to smoke or consume alcohol, and have a family history of cancer compared with Caucasians and Hispanics. The laboratory profiles were similar, and genotype 1 was the most common infection in all groups (74-75%). The great majority of Caucasians (94%) and Hispanics (86%) identified with commonly known risk factors, which was in contrast to 67% of Asians (P < 0.0001). The most common risk factors in Asians were blood transfusions (50%) and acupuncture (50%). Furthermore, 74% of Caucasians and 66% of Hispanics identified more than one major risk factor, while only 20% of Asians reported having more than one risk factor (P < 0.0001). Survey for established risk factors for acquisition of HCV may be more appropriate for risk assessment of Caucasians and Hispanics, but not for Asian Americans. These findings may guide the development of HCV screening in our increasingly diverse population.

The aims of this study were to compare the prevalence of CAD in patients with alcohol-related versus non-alcohol-related ESLD and to assess the diagnostic utility of dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) in predicting angiographically important CAD. Consecutive patients with ESLD being assessed for LT (n = 420, mean age 56 \u00b1 8 years) were identified and divided into groups of those with alcohol-related ESLD (n = 125) and non-alcohol-related ESLD (n = 295). Demographic characteristics, CAD risk factors, results of DSE, and coronary angiographic characteristics were recorded. There were no significant differences in age or CAD risk factors between groups. The incidence of severe CAD (>70% diameter stenosis) was 2% in 13% in the non-alcohol-related ESLD group (p <0.005). In the 2 groups, the presence of 1 CAD risk factor was associated with significant CAD (p <0.05 for all). Absence of cardiac risk factors was highly predictive in ruling out angiographically significant disease (negative predictive value 100% for alcohol-related ESLD and 97% for non-alcohol-related ESLD). DSE was performed in 205 patients. In the 2 groups, DSE had poor predictive value for diagnosing significant CAD but was useful in ruling out patients without significant disease (negative predictive value 89% for alcohol-related ESLD and 80% for non-alcohol-related ESLD). In conclusion, there was a significantly lower prevalence of severe CAD in patients with alcohol-related ESLD. These findings suggest that invasive coronary angiography may not be necessary in this subgroup, particularly in the absence of CAD risk factors and negative results on DSE.

The majority (77%) achieved CVS after 6 months of various combination regimens: 80% for ETV+TDF, 76% for TDF+LAM or 75% for ETV+ADV, and 69% for ADV+LAM or LdT (P = 0.86). After 6 months of therapy, CVS was observed in a similar proportion of patients treated for PR and AVR (72% and 74%, respectively).Although the majority of 109 treatment-experienced patients had prior treatment failure, high rates of CVS were rapidly achieved and did not significantly differ between indications of AVR and PR or between ETV-based and TDF-based regimens.

Most are small, conducted outside the United States, and compare dual infection with HCV monoinfection. The goal of this study was to characterize HBV/HCV dual infection in a large multiethnic, matched, case-control study of dual-infected and HBV-monoinfected patients at two United States centers. Using an International Classification of Disease Version 9 electronic query and chart review, we identified 115 HBV/HCV dual-infected patients with serial HBV DNA, HCV RNA, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. As a control, 115 HBV-monoinfected patients were chosen randomly and matched with cases by age \u00b110 years, sex, Asian versus non-Asian ethnicity, and study site. Both groups had similar sex, ethnic, and age distributions (68% male, 83% Asian, age 52 \u00b1 14 years). The median follow-up times were 33 and 38 months for the dual-infected and monoinfected groups, respectively. More monoinfected patients received HBV antiviral therapy than dual-infected patients (43% versus 24%; P = 0.002). No significant difference was detected between the proportion of monoinfected versus dual-infected patients with ALT above 40 U/L at presentation or during follow-up. Dual infection patients exhibited very little HBV/HCV codominance at baseline and throughout follow-up: patients had either HBV viremia with low or absent HCV RNA or detectable HCV RNA with low or absent HBV DNA. Asian ethnicity was predictive of HBV dominance after adjusting for sex, age, and baseline ALT elevation (odds ratio 7.35; P = 0.01).HBV/HCV dual-infected and HBV-monoinfected patients had similar clinical characteristics. Asian ethnicity is a major independent predictor of HBV-dominant disease, and HCV dominance with undetectable HBV DNA is more common in non-Asian individuals. Larger studies are needed to further characterize the natural history of HBV/HCV dual infection in Asian and non-Asian individuals.

This randomized, prospective, parallel-group clinical trial compared the efficacy and safety of pegylated interferon -2a (PEG-IFN -2a) plus assessed the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with chronic HCV-4.Eligible patients with proven chronic HCV-4 were randomized to receive either a weekly dose of PEG-IFN -2a (180 g) or PEG-IFN -2b (1.5 g/kg) and a daily dose of ribavirin (1000-1200 mg) for 48 weeks with 24 weeks post-treatment follow-up. The primary end point was sustained virological response (SVR) defined by undetectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after treatment. The Short form-36 Health Survey version 2 (SF-36v2) and the Chronic Liver Disease questionnaires (CLDQ) were assessed before, during and after therapy.The overall SVR rate of the entire cohort was 59.9%. The SVR rates were significantly higher in patients treated with PEG-IFN -2a and ribavirin (Group A; n=109) compared SF-36v2 and CLDQ were low during therapy and improved significantly after therapy successful therapy.Pegylated interferon -2a plus ribavirin was significantly more effective than PEG-IFN -2b and ribavirin therapy in the treatment of chronic HCV-4 patients. The tolerability and adverse events were comparable between the two regimens. The HRQOL improved significantly after successful PEG-IFN -2a plus ribavirin therapy.

The aim of this study was to compare the mortality of diabetic and non-diabetic patients following liver transplantation.We conducted a retrospective analysis of 530 adult patients undergoing liver transplantation at Stanford University Medical Center from February 1995 to July 2006. Information on diabetes mellitus was available for 431 patients; 96 patients who had acute liver failure (n = 17), combined liver and kidney transplantation (n = 28), or died prior to discharge (n = 51) were excluded from analysis.Over a mean follow-up of 4.5 years, survival was 81% in the diabetic group and 94% among controls (p = <0.0001). After controlling for age (mean +/- SD: 54.4 +/- 7.6 in diabetics, 50.1 +/- 9.6 in controls), body mass index (28.6 +/- 6.6 in diabetics, 27.1 +/- 5.4 in controls), presence of hepatitis C, and MELD score (17 +/- 9.6 in diabetics, 19 +/- 10.2 in controls), diabetes mellitus remained a significant predictor of death (HR 3.11, p = 0.01).Diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor for mortality following liver transplantation. Further investigation of this relationship should focus on the impact of more intensive pre- and post-liver transplantation glucose control, cardiovascular risk factor reduction, and the effects of accelerated atherosclerosis in the setting of immune suppression.

The effectiveness of tumor therapies to maintain tumor characteristics within these criteria or to downstage more advanced tumors to fall within these criteria is not well understood. The aim of this study was to examine the response to transcatheter arterial chemoinfusion (TACI) in HCC patients awaiting LT and its efficacy for downstaging or bridging to transplantation. We performed a retrospective study of 248 consecutive TACI cases in 122 HCC patients at a single U.S. medical center. Patients were divided into two groups: those who met the Milan criteria on initial HCC diagnosis (n = 95) and those with more advanced disease (n = 27). With TACI treatment, 87% of the Milan criteria group remained within the Milan criteria and 63% of patients with more advanced disease were successfully downstaged to fall within the Milan criteria. In conclusion, TACI appears to be an effective treatment as a bridge to LT for nearly 90% patients presenting within the Milan criteria and an effective downstaging modality for over half of those whose tumor burden was initially beyond the Milan criteria.

To obtain insight into NRTI resistance, we used a new sequencing technology to characterize the spectrum of low-prevalence NRTI-resistance mutations in HBV obtained from 20 plasma samples from 11 NRTI-treated patients and 17 plasma samples from 17 NRTI-naive patients, by using standard direct PCR sequencing and ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS). UDPS detected drug-resistance mutations that were not detected by PCR in 10 samples from 5 NRTI-treated patients, including the lamivudine-resistance mutation V173L (in 5 samples), the entecavir-resistance mutations T184S (in 2 samples) and S202G (in 1 sample), the adefovir-resistance mutation N236T (in 1 sample), and the lamivudine and adefovir-resistance mutations L180M, A181T, and the apolipoprotein mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like family of cytidine deaminases was estimated to be present in 0.6% of reverse-transcriptase genes. Genotype A coinfection was detected by UDPS in each of 3 patients in whom genotype G virus was detected by direct PCR low-level dual genotype infection with a sensitivity not previously possible.

Abstract Traditionally, the constellation of biochemistry tests including liver enzymes, total bilirubin, and hepatic synthetic measures (prothrombin time (PT) and serum albumin level) are referred to as liver function tests (LFTs). Abnormal LFTs can be encountered during primary health care visits, routine blood donation, and insurance screening. A reported 1% to 4% of asymptomatic patients exhibit abnormal LFTs, leading to a sizeable number of annual consultations to a gastroenterology and/or hepatology practice. A cost-effective and systematic approach is essential to the interpretation of abnormal LFTs. A review of pattern of abnormal LFTs, detailed medical history, and a comprehensive physical examination help establish a foundation for further individualized testing. Further investigation often involves biochemical testing for disease-specific markers, radiographic imaging, and even consideration of a liver biopsy. In the following account, markers of hepatic injury are reviewed followed by a discussion on an approach to various patterns of abnormal LFTs in an asymptomatic patient.

Advanced neoplasia prevalence was 12% in Asian men and 9% in non-Asian men (P = 0.21), and 8% and 7% in women (P = 0.62). Similar results were found in asymptomatic patients (13% and 13%, P = 0.99, for men; 8% and 6%, P = 0.46, for women). Factors associated with presence of advanced neoplasia were total number of polyps and presence of right-sided lesions. Asian men were more likely to have neoplasia overall compared with non-Asian men with odds ratio (OR) of 2.14 (1.23-3.72); however, there were no significant differences in the prevalences of advanced neoplasia in the two groups.Colorectal neoplasia is as prevalent in Asian Americans and preventive guidelines for colorectal cancer should also be advocated for this ethnic group.

Published studies of TACE report a 5-16% risk of serious complications. Compared with TACE, transcatheter arterial chemoinfusion (TACI) may have similar efficacy and fewer side effects.To examine the clinical outcomes of TACI.We performed a retrospective cohort study of 345 consecutive TACI cases in 165 patients performed at a single United States medical center between 1998 and 2002. Primary outcomes were tumour response and survival rates.Only seven patients were hospitalized for more than 24 h after the procedure, and only three patients had worsening of liver function within 30 days of TACI. Survival was significantly poorer for patients with tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) IV compared to those with TNM I-III and also for patients with Child's class B/C vs. A. Following adjustment for age, gender, ethnicity and aetiology of liver diseases, independent predictors of poor survival were Child's class B/C [Hazard Ratio (HR) = 1.69, P = 0.024] and TNM IV staging (HR = 1.63, P = 0.014).TACI appears to be safe and effective for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with TNM stage I-III; randomized controlled trials are needed to compare TACI to TACE.

Clinics in liver disease 2007; 11 (2): 227-247 Abstract Survival rates after liver transplantation have improved steadily because of earlier referral and timely evaluation, judicious patient selection, improved surgical techniques, superior immunosuppressive regimens, and effective prevention of perioperative opportunistic infections. Indications and contraindications for liver transplantation are undergoing constant modifications with the goal of improving survival and functional status of patients who have end-stage liver disease or acute liver failure. Potential candidates for liver transplantation should meet minimal listing criteria and not have contraindications to liver transplantation. Currently, the Model for End-stage Liver Disease score is used for organ allocation, but it may have future application in patient-selection criteria.

Thus, data regarding the efficacy of IFN not only on the underlying chronic HCV, but also on extrahepatic manifestations, are limited in these patients. Case reports suggest that the response of dermatologic extrahepatic manifestations to IFN in patients with chronic HCV is highly variable.

We collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells from chronic hepatitis C patients before initiation of IFN-alpha therapy and incubated the cells with or without IFN-alpha for 6 hours, followed by microarray assay to identify IFN-induced gene transcription. The microarray datasets were analyzed statistically according to the patients' race and virological responses to subsequent IFN-alpha treatment. The global induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) was significantly greater in sustained virological responders compared with nonresponders and in white patients compared with black patients. In addition, a significantly greater global induction of ISGs was observed in sustained virological responders compared with nonresponders within the group of white patients. The level of IFN-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 activation, a key component of the Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT signaling pathway, correlated with the global induction of ISGs and was significantly higher in white patients than in black patients. In conclusion, both treatment outcome and race are associated with different transcriptional responses to IFN-alpha. Because this difference is evident in the global induction of ISGs rather than a selective effect on a subset of such genes, key factors affecting the outcome of IFN-alpha therapy are likely to act at the JAK-STAT pathway that controls transcription of downstream ISGs.

Techniques in vascular and interventional radiology 2004; 7 (3): 123-129 Abstract Gastrointestinal endoscopy is the primary diagnostic and therapeutic modality in the management of gastrointestinal bleeding. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy, small bowel enteroscopy, and colonoscopy are well-established standards for initial evaluation of gastrointestinal bleeding, and have been used effectively for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Although thermal, injection, and mechanical methods have been the mainstay of endoscopic therapy, promising new technologies such as endoscopic ultrasound and wireless capsule endoscopy will further advance our ability to improve morbidity and mortality from severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Herein we review current standards and recent advances in the endoscopic management of upper, lower, and obscure gastrointestinal bleeding.

Reports from several transplant centers document that overall short-term patient survival rates in seniors undergoing liver transplantation are comparable to survival rates of younger adults. However, specific subgroups of older patients may not fare as well. Seniors with far-advanced end-stage liver disease are high-risk for liver transplantation and have poor survival rates. In addition, seniors older than 65 have worse outcomes than those who are 60 to 65, and studies have shown increased mortality with increasing age as a continuous variable. On the other hand, the majority of seniors who survive liver transplantation have full or only minimally limited functional status. Preoperative evaluation of older patients for transplantation requires careful screening to exclude cardiopulmonary disease, malignancy, and other diseases of the aged. Paradoxically, seniors may benefit from a senescent immune system, which results in decreased requirements for immunosuppressive drugs, and possibly a lower rate of acute allograft rejection. Despite good overall short-term survival in the elderly, long-term survival may be worse because of an increased rate of long-term complications, such as malignancy and heart disease. In conclusion, although advanced age is a negative risk factor, advanced age alone should not exclude a patient from liver transplantation; however, it mandates thorough pretransplant evaluation and careful long-term follow-up with attention to usual health maintenance issues in the elderly.

Cancer chemotherapy-induced reactivation is a known complication in patients with chronic HBV infection or history of HBV infection with recovery. Reactivation of HBV infection has a broad spectrum of manifestations ranging from mild elevation of aminotransferase levels to fatal fulminant hepatitis. Lamivudine is a nucleoside analogue and a potent inhibitor of HBV reverse transcription. The 4 patients treated with lamivudine included 1 woman with breast cancer and 3 men with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, ranging from 41 to 63 years of age. All 4 patients were undergoing standard, multi-agent chemotherapy when they presented with HBV reactivation manifested by sudden onset of fatigue, jaundice, and HBV serology consistent with active HBV infection (detectable serum HBV DNA) in the absence of other known causes of acute hepatitis. Lamivudine therapy (100 mg/d in 3 patients and 150 mg/d in 1 patient) was initiated from 1 to 18 days following the diagnosis of HBV reactivation. All 4 patients showed rapid decrease in aminotransferase levels within 2 weeks after initiating lamivudine therapy. Unfortunately, hepatic synthetic function failed to improve in 2 patients, who both died. The remaining 2 patients had suppression of HBV DNA to undetectable levels after 1 and 4 months of treatment and had biochemical and clinical improvement. The 2 patients who died received lamivudine therapy for 8 days and for 3 weeks. There have been no randomized clinical trials to study the role of lamivudine for prophylaxis or treatment of HBV reactivation associated with chemotherapy. However, based on our limited experience, lamivudine may be efficacious in suppressing potentially fatal HBV reactivation secondary to chemotherapy in patients with chronic HBV infection or prior infection with recovery. Patients who undergo chemotherapy should be screened for the presence of markers of chronic hepatitis B infection or previous HBV infection. We recommend that patients with chronic HBV infection (positive HBV DNA and/or positive HBsAg) or history of HBV infection with recovery (positive hepatitis B core antibody with or without HBsAb) be considered for prophylactic lamivudine use to prevent chemotherapy-induced HBV reactivation.

Clinics in liver disease 2001; 5 (4): 1073-1090 Abstract Advances in immunosuppressive therapy, operative techniques, and perioperative management have resulted in long-term patient survival rates approaching 90% following liver transplantation for chronic viral hepatitis. The increasing number of referrals for liver transplantation reflects the impact of chronic HCV infection as a cause of end-stage liver disease. Unlike hepatitis B, there is still no effective treatment in preventing recurrent hepatitis C after liver transplantation. The spectrum of allograft injury related to universal HCV infection recurrence ranges from no evidence of histologic injury to mild inflammation to severe disease with allograft failure in small proportion of patients. Various factors may explain these differing outcomes, including degree of pretransplantation viremia, HLA compatibility, presence of more pathogenic HCV genotypes, integrity of cellular immune response, and type of immunosuppression. Fortunately, patient survival does not seem to be affected short-term; the long-term outcome of liver transplantation for chronic hepatitis C is unclear but is likely to be decreased. Combination therapy with interferon plus ribavirin seems to be a promising treatment strategy for posttransplantation recurrent hepatitis C, and the use of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin may improve these results. Patients with moderate to severe allograft hepatitis are appropriate candidates for combination antiviral therapy. Histopathologically documented recurrent hepatitis C in liver transplant recipients is associated with impaired quality of life, inferior physical condition, and a higher incidence of depression compared with patients who did not have HCV and in those without HCV recurrence. In conclusion, it is possible that the continued improvements in antiviral therapy against HCV infection may ultimately decrease the number of patients needing liver transplantation. Suitable candidates with chronic HCV infection thus warrant treatment with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin combination therapy in the hope of decreasing disease progression. Recent studies, which require confirmation, suggest that nonresponders to standard antiviral therapy may benefit from maintenance therapy. The donor pool for patients with chronic hepatitis C and decompensated cirrhosis can be improved by using HCV-positive donors and by increasing utilization of newer surgical techniques, including adult-to-adult living-donor liver transplantation and split-liver transplantation.

These events have led to a marked lengthening of the waiting time for liver transplantation, resulting in increased deaths of those on the waiting list and sicker patients undergoing transplantation. Nearly 5000 liver transplantations were performed in the United States in 2000, while the waiting list grew to over 17,000 patients. The mounting disparity between the number of liver transplant candidates and the limited supply of donor organs has led to reassessment of the selection and listing criteria for liver transplantation, as well as revision of organ allocation and distribution policies for cadaver livers. The development of minimal listing criteria for patients with chronic liver disease based on a specific definition for decompensation of cirrhosis has facilitated the more uniform listing of patients at individual centres across the United States. The United Network for Organ Sharing, under pressure from transplant professionals, patient advocacy groups and the federal government, has continuously revised allocation and distribution policies based on the ethical principles of justice for the individual patient versus optimal utility of the limited organ supply available annually. Beginning in 2002, it is likely that the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score will be implemented to determine disease severity and direct donor organs to the sickest patients rather than to those with the longest waiting times.

Liver biopsy is usually done in an outpatient setting because most significant hemorrhage is evident within a few hours after biopsy. Delayed hemorrhage occurs much less frequently but carries a much higher mortality. We present a 41-yr-old man with chronic hepatitis C who underwent a percutaneous liver biopsy uneventfully but was found to have a pseudoaneurysm of the hepatic artery 5 days later. Shortly after admission, the patient experienced bleeding into the liver from the pseudoaneurysm, which was controlled initially by angiographic embolization. However, recurrent bleeding could not be controlled by repeat angiography and surgical intervention, and the patient expired. The diagnosis and management of pseudoaneurysm of the hepatic artery complicating liver biopsy is reviewed.

The recommended treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is interferon alpha (or equivalent) 3 MIU three times per week for 12 months, in patients showing response to therapy after 3 months. Patients with the greatest risk for progression to cirrhosis (i.e. persistently elevated alanine aminotransferase levels, detectable serum HCV-RNA and liver biopsy showing portal or bridging fibrosis and at least moderate inflammation and necrosis) are recommended as candidates for therapy. The indication for therapy is less obvious in patients with milder histological changes, compensated cirrhosis and age less than 18 years or older than 60 years. Treatment is not indicated for patients with persistently normal aminotransferases or decompensated cirrhosis. This review outlines the background studies that led to the recommendations of the National Institutes of Health for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C and reviews newer evolving treatment strategies over the past year. In particular, the results of studies exploring treatment options for relapsers and non-responders to prior interferon therapy and the reported results to date on the safety and efficacy of combination therapy with interferon plus ribavirin are highlighted. Although aggressive suppression of HCV-RNA with induction therapy (daily and/or higher doses) or long-acting pegylated interferon preparations may improve the current results of therapy, few data are yet available. Finally, the treatment of chronic hepatitis C with protease inhibitors holds promise but has yet to reach the stage of clinical trials.

A patient with unknown large volume ascites is the easiest and safest to laparoscope. Using a mini laparoscope, a bedside procedure with instantaneous return can be done. The newer noninvasive tests like determination of ascites fluid adenosine deaminase activity and polymerase chain reaction may be helpful in the prompt diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis. We recommend that patients with clinical presentation suggestive of peritoneal tuberculosis have either an aggressive diagnostic workup using high-yield tests or a trial of antituberculous therapy.

He had reactivation of HBV infection with acute hepatitis B manifest by detectable HBsAg and elevated aminotransferase levels >1000 IU/L. He was treated with lamivudine 150 mg daily and had prompt resolution of acute hepatitis B with return of elevated aminotransferases to normal, and initial loss of HBeAg with later loss of HBsAg. Lamivudine was continued during the course of further chemotherapy as prophylaxis against repeat HBV reactivation. Lamivudine is a nucleoside analogue that is a inhibitor of HBV reverse transcriptase and HBV replication. Lamivudine therapy should be considered for the treatment of HBV reactivation and might play a future role as preemptive therapy of HBV reactivation in patients with prior hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis B with inactive viral replication.

A high index of suspicion is a crucial factor in the prompt diagnosis of this rare but potentially fatal complication. We report a case of splenic rupture diagnosed 3 days after a colonoscopy and requiring splenectomy. We also reviewed 17 reported cases of splenic rupture after colonoscopy, including our case. The presumed mechanisms of splenic rupture during colonoscopy are direct trauma to the spleen, excessive splenocolic ligament traction, and decrease in the relative mobility between the spleen and the colon. Of the 17 cases reviewed, 10 had polypectomy and/or biopsy performed during colonoscopy. Other probable risk factors are identified and tabulated. The hemodynamic status of the patient is the primary factor used to determine the therapeutic option. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the abdomen reliably demonstrates laceration and subcapsular hematoma, and differentiates from perisplenic clot and hemoperitoneum. Thus, CT scan may help decide which patients may be managed operatively or nonoperatively. Splenectomy is the operative procedure of choice for splenic rupture after colonoscopy. Conservative management includes broad spectrum antibiotics, intravenous fluids, blood transfusion, and close hemodynamic monitoring. The factors mandating further evaluation of persistent abdominal pain after colonoscopy are hemodynamic instability, clinical features of acute abdomen, leukocytosis, and/or acute anemia. The onset of abdominal pain associated with one or more of these critical factors is usually within 24 h after colonoscopy. An emergent CT scan of the abdomen is the modality of choice to further evaluate these clinical features, but intestinal perforation and external bleeding must first be excluded.

Journal of clinical gastroenterology ; 54 (10): 850-56 Abstract Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Existing studies have highlighted significant disparities in HCC outcomes, particularly among vulnerable populations, including ethnic minorities, safety-net populations, underinsured patients, and those with low socioeconomic status and high risk behaviors. The majority of these studies have focused on HCC surveillance. Although HCC surveillance is one of the most important first steps in HCC monitoring and management, it is only one step in the complex HCC cascade of care that evolves from surveillance to diagnosis and tumor staging that leads to access to HCC therapies. In this current review, we explore the disparities that exist along this complex HCC cascade of care and further highlight potential interventions that have been implemented to improve HCC outcomes. These interventions focus on patient, provider, and system level factors and provide a potential framework for health systems to implement quality improvement initiatives to improve HCC monitoring and management.
