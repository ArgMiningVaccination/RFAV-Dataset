Core IMHA Help Sheet for Dogs and Cats A copy of this information is included with your package purchase! 1). Daily Multi Plus This is the supplement that provides the enzymes and probiotics necessary for proper digestion and immune system health. It also provides organic, whole food nutrition to improve the overall health of your dog or cat. How much should I give? Provide 1/2 teaspoon in each meal per 30 lbs. Mix with water so it is not dry. Serving size does not have to be exact. Err on the side of more rather that less. How long should I provide this supplement? This supplement should be given with every meal for the life of your pet. 2). Biopreparation F3 This is a highly regarded supplement vital to your animal's recovery. We recommend the F3+ Forte for this condition. It feeds cells on a cellular level providing thousands of natural nutrients directly into cells without the need for digestion while helping cells to efficiently detoxify. This can be placed in with meals, a little meatball made with a favorite food or in a little water used with a syringe. Follow the recommendations below for the Acute Phase and then when your animal's condition has stabilized in the \"normal\" range continue with the Maintenance Phase for the life of your animal. | | Weight | | Acute Phase | | Maintenance Phase | | Under 15 lbs | | 1/4 capsule every 2 hrs for a total of 1 1/2 - 2 capsules daily | | 1/2 capsule 2x daily | | 15 - 30 lbs | | 1/2 capsule every 1 - 2 hours for a total of 2 1/2 - 3 capsules daily | | 1/2 - 1 capsule 2x daily | | 30 - 50 lbs | | 1/2 capsule every 1-2 hours for a total of 4 - 5 capsules daily | | 1 capsule 2x daily | | Over 50 lbs | | 1 capsule every 2 hours for a total of 5-6 capsules daily | | 1 capsule 2x daily and you may add a third capsule daily. 3). ChlorOxygen This supplement is rich in chlorophyll that contains a compound that increases the health of red blood cells and greatly increases their oxygen carrying capacity. This could make the difference between life and death for your animal. Remember the directions on the bottle are for people so use the serving suggestions below. How much should I give? Use 2 - 4 drops per 10 lbs 4x daily while your animal is in the acute critical phase. How long should I provide this supplement? When your animal is stable in the \"normal\" range provide a maintenance dosage of 2 drops per 10 lbs twice daily for the life of your animal. 4). Immune Balance This remedy is used to help balance your animal's immune system in the presence of an autoimmune condition. It can work with the medications you may be receiving from your vet or on its own and can help support your animal's liver as well. How much should I give? Provide 1 ml per 25 lbs three times daily. Squirt directly into mouth by pulling out lower lip at corner of mouth. Do not tilt head back because your pet can breath some in. If this is difficult dosage can be placed in a small amount of special food or even main meals if necessary. It is best to give away from meals when possible. When your animal's condition improves you may be able to reduce the frequency to two times daily. How long should I provide this supplement? This can be used long term on a five days on two days off schedule or you can discontinue use when your animal is fully recovered and their RBC numbers stay up even when they are weaned off of the Immune Balance in the future. The length of time your animal stays on this remedy depends on the situation which is unique to you. Do not use or use with caution in animals with hypertension Other Recommendations Diet We recommend a simple whole food diet during the critical phase consisting of calf liver (blood building) mixed in scrambled eggs with liquified greens (lettuce liquified in blender with a little water). Meals should be small and spaced four or five times throughout the day. When your animal has improved and is stable you can move to a regular commercial whole food diet (preferably raw) or a home cooked diet (research how to do this properly and make sure to add a calcium source). There is also the option to use prepackaged premixes to which you add your own meat. Read our articles How to Feed Your Dog or How to Feed Your Cat in the Education Section of our website for more information. Exercise Exercise should be limited during the acute phase until your animal is very stable. This is because your animal's oxygen carrying capacity is greatly diminished and exercise can place potentially dangerous stress on your animal. About Medications Immune suppressing drugs and blood transfusions can be life-saving at the critical phase for your animal. It is hard for us to make recommendations concerning medications because it is really out of our \"jurisdiction\" and all animals and situations are so unique. What we do feel comfortable saying is that as time progresses these medications (especially drug \"cocktails\") can have severe and even potentially life-endangering side effects over time that could negatively effect the recovery of your animal. Veterinarians may be afraid and resistant to removing medications, and maybe rightfully so depending on the situation. However, we feel that leaving your animal on medications out of fear can be counter-productive. From our experience medications should be adjusted as your animal stabilizes to see what can be removed in the shortest time frame possible without risking the health of your animal. Common Causes Nothing \"just happens\". There is always a catalyst. Autoimmune conditions are caused by an insult to the body, most commonly from a chemical or toxin. Flea and tick pesticide treatments are a major cause. Reactions will be seen within hours or days of application. Vaccinations are another major cause with reactions generally seen anywhere from days to months after exposure. But if your animal is more sensitive household cleaners, lawn chemicals, mosquito fogging exposure and even skunk spray can trigger this condition. Please keep in mind that once an animal develops IMHA experiencing a relapse if exposed to any of the above is very common. Speak with your veterinarian about an exemption from future rabies vaccinations. Please Note: The majority of our supplements are basically herbs and whole foods, so a little more or less will not harm your animal. When determining the dosage estimate as best you can for the weight of your animal from our suggested serving sizes.
