Supporting bile production is essential when it comes to promoting the body's natural ability to detoxify.* When taken as a supplement, it helps stimulate the release of bile into the digestive tract. This supports healthy digestion and drainage, the body's natural detoxification processes, and the health of the liver bile duct system.* Advanced TUDCA is particularly supportive for phase III of liver detox*, which is the bile movement phase. However, it promotes increased production and quality of bile, so it also supports phase I and II of liver detox.* Note: Many TUDCA supplements are sourced from animal bile. For purity and ethical reasons, Advanced TUDCA is synthetic and produced in the CellCore lab. Formulated with Carbon Technology Carbon Technology is a proprietary blend of fulvic acids and polysaccharides that support cellular repair and the body's natural ability to detoxify.* With a low pH, Carbon Technology also helps protect ingredients from being digested by stomach acid, so that they remain intact as they enter the desired location in the body. The superstar team-up of TUDCA, melatonin, and NAC, help increase the flow of bile so toxins aren't remaining stagnant in the liver to cause damage. They assist in protecting liver cells and combat mitochondrial stress. It can help prevent the accumulation of fat in the liver. Together, these ingredients also help to lower systemic inflammation and prevent free radical damage by encouraging your body to produce more glutathione and other \"in-house\" antioxidants. This trio also works to enhance your digestive and microbiome health by helping protect the gut wall from damage and aid in reducing \"leaky gut\" syndrome. It can help regulate gut motility and calm inflammation in the GI tract. These components are backed by BioActive Carbon to help protect the constituents through the digestive process so they are fully active as they reach the intestines. BioActive Carbons also work to bind and aid in the removal of toxins that your bile is trying to purge. "}
