It seeks to optimize health over one's lifespan addressing the unique circumstances of the individual through appropriate interventions from an array of scientific disciplines to help people regain and promote optimal health. We approach care and service from our five pillars of health and well-being: - Sleep: Quality and quantity of sleep is essential for the body and brain to heal, repair, and prepare for the next day. Sleeping disorders or not getting enough sleep can lead to many chronic illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes. - Activity: Physical activity is fundamental to the circulatory and respiratory systems and produces bio-chemicals such as endorphins that promote positive emotions and brain functions. - Purpose: A sense of purpose is that which gives meaning to one's life. Having a reason to get up in the morning adds not only years to your life, but also life to your years. - Nutrition: Food is the fuel by which our mind and body function. Proper nourishment helps to keep people sustained through life's challenges. - Resilience: The ability to \"bounce back\" and adapt to adversity are the skills needed to respond to stress in order to thrive versus survive.
