Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science requirement.) cross listed: IREL 160 SHIP Core CHIN 270: Chinese Values, Medicine and Health (Traditional Chinese Values, Medicine and Health in English.) Taught in English. As the U.S. grows more diverse, issues of culture and cultural competence have become more important to health care students. Traditional Chinese philosophies and religions strongly influence the Chinese way of living and thinking about health and health care. This course is an introduction to the basic beliefs, values, philosophies, and religions of the Chinese people. It explores how Confucius, Daoism, and Buddhism influence Chinese people's concept of health, especially mental health. This course also provides an overview of the basic traditional Chinese medicine theories, herbal treatments, and Chinese food therapy. It discusses how the Chinese medical tradition merged with the western medical tradition and the role and value of traditional Chinese medicine in the current Chinese health care system. This course is intended for students considering Pre-Health or the Health Professions Program (HPP), or for any students interested in learning about Chinese traditional values. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Global Perspectives requirements.) cross listed: ASIA 270 COMM 378: Communicating Science and Medicine In this course we will examine how communication norms and practices shape our understanding of science, health, and medicine. By delving into a variety of case studies such as the current Covid-19 pandemic, vaccination policy, pharmaceutical marketing, biotechnology, and mental health diagnosis and treatment, the course will emphasize how science and medicine are products of a culture and not just the work of individuals in a laboratory or a hospital. Through these engagements, students will develop the conceptual knowledge and rhetorical fluency necessary to evaluate a scientific controversy of their choice; generate socially relevant and research-driven arguments; and identify the ways in which we can help to influence policy and shape public understanding of issues related to science, medicine, and human values. No prerequisites ENGL 209: Storytelling and STEM (Storytelling and STEM: Writing About Science.) A writing-intensive course focused on using the tools of narrative nonfiction to communicate scientific discovery to the public. Students will read the work of scientists and scientific communicators such as Stephen Hawking, Rebecca Skloot, Neil Degrasse Tyson, Atul Gawande, and Steven Pinker to discover the storytelling principles they employ to inform and entertain their readers. We will explore the science of story, the cognitive and evolutionary source of its power, and the art of scientific journalism, and students will draft and workshop their own essays about \"popular science.\" No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Writing requirements.) ENGL 221: Literature and Medicine Medical literature impacts everyone: we are all dual citizens of the kingdoms of health and sickness, of the everyday and the \"night-side of life\" as Susan Sontag puts it. Yet, throughout our varied stories about medicine, writers confront again and again the profound isolation and invisibility of the sick. What is it about physical pain that breaks down our language to describe it? How do medical narratives represent illness, giving structure and voice to this night-side of life? In this course, we explore medical texts by reading radically different writers across time, including Tolstoy, Shelley, and contemporary physicians. Throughout, we examine the myriad ways artists represent illness, through novels, poetry, short stories, autobiographies, films, guidebooks, and more. We work to unpack the binaries of sickness/health, normal/diseased, patient/doctor, and even life/death, in these stories about doctors, patients, epidemics, and mortality. After learning to \"read\" narratives of disease, students \"write\" disease, creating their own disease through an archive of texts. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) ENGL 222: Plagues in Literature: Now and Then Angelic hand prints splayed across plague bodies. Thrillers on futuristic, mutant viruses. Stories of plagues from past and present startle us with their imaginative variety. In fact, many readers have questioned why these narratives so often push the limits of the \"real\" in their representations. Why do writers represent plagues experimentally? Is contagion inherently dangerous to represent, even fictionally? We explore representations of epidemic diseases across a wide expanse of time, from antiquity to the 21st century, encountering along the way common tropes and stock figures of the genre: the plague-pits, enterprising tricksters, and well-poisoners, among others. Across varied stories, including Oedipus and Romeo and Juliet, we track how writers and film-makers use medical disasters to conjure the deepest spiritual crises of societies-gone-wrong, calling on the plague to search for divine meaning and patient zeroes. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Global Perspectives requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) ENGL/NEUR 232: Stories from the Spectrum: Neurodiversity, Health, and Medicine in Literature A boy with a penchant for prime numbers investigates the death of a dog. A young girl is scolded for failing to look her teacher in the eye. A man in the throes of a midlife crisis returns to his nonverbal son as he spiritually finds himself. Hidden within these narratives of neurodiverse characters, one discovers a slew of cultural assumptions about cognitive and intellectual disabilities. Do neurotypical writers often turn to autism reductively, as a stand-in for a theme or metaphor? What might an authentic representation of Autism Spectrum look like? This course considers the value of neurodiversity in literature while exploring many of the troubling aspects of the representations of cognitive difference across time, from earlier accounts of un-speaking children to the \"rain man's\" of contemporary film. This course ultimately takes seriously the bi-directional intersections between fiction and medicine, as real-life medical practices both shape and are shaped by these stories from the spectrum. No prerequisites. Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Writing requirements. ENGL 249: Brains, Minds, and Madness in Lit (Brains, Minds, and Madness in Literature.) Stories invite us into the minds of others. As readers, we step into another's consciousness: into fictional memories, sensations, and narratives that feel real, as the words of often-dead writers become part of our own brain-matter. Yet, how do our theories of the mind and its operations relate to literary representations of a character's interiority? And what can contemporary neuroscience teach us about literature, or about our own minds on literature? In this course, we examine stories and theories of the mind across time, exploring scientific writing about the brain alongside literary masterpieces from Virginia Woolf to Vladimir Nabokov. Moreover, we consider the close connection between sanity and insanity, examining the representations of madness and other neurological ailments in brains gone \"wrong.\" After learning to \"read\" the mind in literature, students will create their own aesthetic of the brain gone \"right\" or \"wrong\", creating narratives versed in the newest neuroscientific research on the pleasures and dangers of reading the \"minds\" of another. No Prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: NEUR 249 ES 382: Politcal Ecology Infectious Disease (The Political Ecology of Infectious Diseases.) An infectious disease, COVID19, is in the process of disrupting the social, political, economic, ecological, and medical systems that we have relied on, and in some ways taken for granted, up to now. Infectious diseases, like all things \u2014 animals, plants, genes, rivers, petroleum, planets, and molecules \u2014 have the ability to exert influence on their environments; that is, they have something like agency. In this course, we investigate what the nature of this quasi-agency is, and what the political, social, and economic consequences of accepting the agency of things might be. Our focus is on infectious diseases: where they come from, how humans discovered them and how we combat them, and how they have affected and are affected by international economic and political systems, environmental degradation, medical technology, ideas of sovereignty, and the prosecution of war and terrorism. Prerequisite: ES 110, ES 120, ES 220, BIOL 220, or any Politics or History course, or permission of the instructor. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences requirement.) HIST 282: The Pre-Modern Body This course investigates the roots of contemporary European and American understandings of the human body in social, cultural, and religious traditions from the ancient and medieval Mediterranean world. Students explore texts that illuminate the importance of the body to individual and group identity and discuss how these texts' definitions of \"normal\", \"beautiful\", and \"healthy\" bodies continue to wield influence. Among the course's questions: how was the central role of the body in identity (before and after death) shaped by Christian theology of a God who was embodied, suffered, and died? What assumptions were made about how biological sex dictated identity\u2014and how did pre-modern authors reckon with those who fell outside the sex or gender binary? How was spiritual morality understood to be inscribed on the physical body in complex ways (skin color, physical features, illness, pain, sexual activity)? How did racism and nascent colonialism shape ideals of body size and appearance? Students read primary sources ranging from patristic theology to werewolf stories, as well as important works of scholarship. HIST 284: Epidemic Disease in European History This course will focus on four epidemic diseases that caused widespread death and destruction in Europe and the Americas from the fourteenth to twentieth centuries: the Black Death, smallpox, cholera, and malaria. In each case, after learning about the symptoms of the disease, the progression of the epidemic(s), and the identity of the victims, we will explore multiple facets of the human response to these natural disasters, including: theories of disease; religious responses; medical measures; artistic representations; and the intersection of state power and public health efforts. We will also study key figures in the history of medicine. A significant portion of the course is devoted to the impact of disease in European imperial possessions (such as India and the Americas), violence against minority groups (notably Jews) in Europe in the wake of epidemics, and the ways in which theories of class and race influenced European thinking on disease. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Global Perspectives requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities and Cultural Diversity requirements.) MUSC 268: Music and the Mind In this course, we wrestle with fundamental questions regarding music and the human experience. Why does music exist? How did it evolve in the human species? What, exactly, does it do to us, as listeners and as practitioners? How does music change our brains? Is there really such a thing as a \"Mozart Effect?\" What new promises are there for therapeutic uses for music? Music's presence in the human species is clearly puzzling. While many scholars have speculated a reason for its existence, there is no definitive answer as to why we make music. Nevertheless, we do make music. There is not a single human culture on Earth that has no music. Some of the books we will be reading include Musicophilia, The Singing Neanderthals, and This is Your Brain on Music. Note that this is a course that requires students to give oral presentations. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: NEUR 268 PHIL 205: Medical Ethics The course will investigate the three primary strands of medical ethics: (1) issues of professional responsibility, such as confidentiality and informed consent, (2) moral dilemmas that arise in the course of treatment, such as decisions about euthanasia, and (3) public policy matters, such as universal health care. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) PHIL 225: Philosophy of Science Examination of issues such as the nature of scientific knowledge, what counts as a 'true' scientific theory, the basis of observation, and empirical knowledge. Consideration of ethical issues generated by scientific practice, the politics of technology, and current work on the sociology of scientific knowledge. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: ES 225 PHIL 291: Descartes to Kant Seventeenth- and eighteenth-century European philosophers, with a primary focus on epistemology and metaphysics, including the essence of the mind and its relation to the body. Readings will include Descartes, Spinoza, Locke, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Writing requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: NEUR 291 PHIL 296: Philosophy of Mind With the rise of Cognitive Science, Computer Science, and Neuroscience, questions about the nature of mind have become increasingly important, and in the last 40 years much work on philosophy of mind has been done in analytic philosophy. The class will begin with an examination of some of the most influential texts in philosophy of mind from the last 50 years, and then proceed to current topics. Central questions may include: What is the relationship between the mind and the brain? Is it possible to offer explanations of mental states by reducing them to biological, chemical, or physical states? Can human consciousness be best explained in terms of a computer model? Is it possible to describe the functioning of human thought in terms of a rule-based system of processing? No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: NEUR 296 PHIL 375: Neuroethics Neuroethics is an emerging interdisciplinary field that incorporates the findings of neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and philosophy to tackle key ethical issues in science, philosophy, health, and medicine. In this discipline, we explore two primary areas of study. The first is the neuroscience of ethics, which asks what current research in neuroscience and related fields can tell us about ethics. The second is the ethics of neuroscience, which asks how the study of ethics can inform emerging technologies and findings from the rapidly developing field of neuroscience. This course introduces students to both areas of research. As such, the course investigates a variety of questions related to free will, moral reasoning, memory, neuroenhancement, neuromarketing, cognitive enhancement, and how the law deals with these issues. Prerequisite: at least one 100- level course in philosophy, neuroscience, or psychology, or permission from the instructor. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) cross listed: NEUR 375 RELG 239: Religion, Biology, & Public Health This course examines religion as a social determinant of public health and introduces students to meditation and other mind-body practices, which have been successfully applied in medical settings. Students analyze selected practices of ordinary people in Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, and Christianity that shape health behaviors; assess the role of religious organizations in ongoing epidemic threats (COVID-19, HIV/AIDS, and Alzheimer's); and study connections between religion and public health (e.g., legacy of the social gospel movement in US Public Health Reform, impact of religious views on reproductive health, and application of meditation techniques in health care). Using an innovative methodology called Reacting to the Past, students delve into key historical moments that shaped modern approaches to biology, public health, and epidemiology, participating in extended role-playing games informed by influential texts in the history of ideas. Assessments include a sequence of verbal and written assignments, culminating in a final oral presentation. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Global Perspectives and Speaking requirements.) RELG 241: Religion & Science Even a cursory look at today's news reveals that the relationship between religion and science is a hot topic. So it has been for many centuries. In this course, we consider historical and contemporary issues in the relationship between religion and science in the modern world. We make use of historical, philosophical, and literary approaches to study how individuals and groups have understood religion and science, and how they have sought to understand and relate to the natural world. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities requirement. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Humanities requirement.) RELG 224: Islam and Science As an introduction to the relationship between Islam and science from both historical and contemporary perspectives, this course examines the major contributions of medieval Muslim scientists and their influence on modern science. Muslim medieval inventions and advances have shaped Western science for hundreds of years. Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Ibn Al-Haitham (Alhazen), al-Khawarizmi (Algorithmi), and Ibn Rushd (Averroes) were among the many Muslim scientists and philosophers who developed existing disciplines in astronomy, medicine, mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and transferred ancient knowledge from the Middle East, Greece, China, and India to European cultures. The course explores various scientific attempts at an interpretation of the Qur'an and how those attempts shaped the Muslim perception of science in general. The course also touches upon modern debates within Islamic and applied science, particularly in the field of bioethics. Focusing on contemporary controversies, the course examines, for example, attempts by contemporary Muslim scientists and religious scholars to reconcile or disprove the theory of evolution. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Global Perspectives requirements.) cross listed: ISLM 224 SOAN 245: Medical Anthropology This course approaches various aspects of medicine and disease from an anthropological perspective and from outside the framework of standard biomedical concepts. We will look at how experiences of illness and health are culturally, rather than biologically, constructed. A second objective is to compare the belief systems and medical practices of several specific Western and non-Western societies. In carrying out these cross-cultural comparisons, we will focus on qualitative research and read several ethnographic case studies. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Social Sciences and Global Perspectives requirements. Under the old GEC, this course meets the Social Science and Cultural Diversity requirements.) SPAN 322: Medical Spanish This course prepares students to use Spanish in a variety of health care settings. Particular emphasis is given to the acquisition of essential medical vocabulary in Spanish, and to the speaking and comprehension proficiency needed to conduct interviews with Spanish-speaking patients. The course will focus on the successful and caring treatment of Latino/Hispanic patients with limited English (often recent immigrants), as well as on the cultural norms that exist around health and the body in Latin America, norms which medical professionals must understand in order to deal properly with Spanish-speaking patients. Particularly recommended for students who are thinking of careers in the area of health care, but appropriate for any student interested in expanding Spanish proficiency in this field. Prerequisite: SPAN 212 or higher 200-level course, or placement exam recommendation or permission of instructor.

THTR 254: The Mind Onstage (The Mind Onstage: Performance, Action, Emotion.) In the last decade, prominent theater scholars have integrated neuroscience research into their studies. Their excitement stems from the realization that current scientific research seems to speak directly to one of the major concerns of theatre scholars for decades: How does performing and/or watching a performance affect the brain? In this interdisciplinary class, students study plays that depict neuroscience and neurological conditions, learn about how theatre is used therapeutically, and read contemporary and classic theatrical theory, as we explore the ways science and the humanities can intersect. No prerequisites. (Under the Forester Fundamental Curriculum, this course meets the Humanities and Writing requirements.) cross listed: NEUR 254 Experiential Core HPPC 180: Intro to Healthcare Professions (Introduction to Healthcare Professions Seminar Series.) This series of seminars gives undergraduate students who are interested in healthcare careers a chance to analyze their own individual skills, values and interests, and explore career options. The course provides a self-evaluation that will help point students towards careers that best fit their interests and abilities. It also introduces students to many different careers in healthcare and explains those roles within the healthcare team. Some of the careers that are examined include: physician, nurse, physician assistant, physical therapist, pharmacist, podiatrist, psychologist, nurse anesthetist, pathologist assistant, nutritionist, medical lab technician, and paramedic. Must be a participant in the Health Professions Program or permission of instructor. HPPC 181: Community, Culture, and Health Lifestyle Medicine: Community, Culture, and Health Outcomes Seminar Series. Sequenced within the Health Profession Program Seminar Series, this course explores how culture, community, and policy intersect and impact health outcomes.
