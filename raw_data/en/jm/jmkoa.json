Article contents PCR-ELISA method for Mycoplasma contamination detection in veterinary vaccines Published online by Cambridge University Press: 13 February 2008 Abstract A polymerase chain reaction-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PCR-ELISA) method was set up to detect Mycoplasma in live vaccines and to establish the optimal experimental conditions. According to the 16S rRNA gene sequences published in GenBank, which include Mycoplasma gallisepticum of chicken and M. hyopneumoniae, M. hyosynoviae and digoxin (Dig), and probe, labelled with biotin, were designed using the software DNAstar and Primer Premier 5.0. The system and conditions of PCR-ELISA were optimized using purified genomic DNA extracted from Mycoplasma as a template. Samples of 30 batches of Newcastle disease live vaccines (I strain), 30 batches of Newcastle disease live vaccines (La Sota strain) and 30 batches of swine fever live vaccine were tested by PCR-ELISA. Results showed that the detection rate of Mycoplasma contamination from different vaccines was higher (36.5%) with this technique than with PCR (24.4%). The PCR-ELISA appeared to be a simple, fast and reliable method for qualitative and quantitative analysis of Mycoplasma. The practical use of PCR-ELISA as a kit to detect Mycoplasma contamination in live vaccine seems very promising. - Type - Research Article - Information [Chinese Journal of Agricultural Biotechnology](/core/journals/chinese-journal-of-agricultural-biotechnology), [Volume 4](/core/journals/chinese-journal-of-agricultural-biotechnology/volume/A14090BCED87C5149958778200394A9E), [Issue 3](/core/journals/chinese-journal-of-agricultural-biotechnology/issue/07CD9DE454DC92E5E6CDFCCFCAD5262C), December 2007 , pp. 187 - 192 - Copyright - Copyright \u00a9 China Agricultural University and Cambridge University Press 2007 Footnotes First published in Journal of Agricultural Biotechnology 2007, "}
