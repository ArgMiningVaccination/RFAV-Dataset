The aim of the study was to investigate the use of CAM, beliefs about CAM and the purpose of using it amongst Polish cancer patients. Methods: The study included 864 cancer patients (median 63 years old), who were individually interviewed. The questionnaire was designed specifically for this study. Results: Amongst 732 patients who declared that they heard about CAM, 342 patients (46.7%) had used CAM; 91% of these patients had used it as a complementary therapy and 9% had used it as an alternative therapy. Patients younger in age, highly educated, professionally active, with longer medical history, and at more advanced cancer stages have, statistically, used CAM more often; 66% of participants could not state what the health effect of CAM is. Patients received information about CAM from the internet, friends, family and other patients. Only 18% of patients discussed using CAM with a doctor. Conclusions: CAM was popular amongst Polish cancer patients, especially in younger, educated and professionally active patients with longer cancer history at advanced stage. Patients used CAM as a complementary therapy for strengthening immune system, improving morphological and biochemical test parameters, reducing the side effects of conventional therapy and improving their well-being.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-01-30", "cleaned_text": "Complementary and Alternative Medicine Use in Hospitalized Cancer Patients\u2014Study from Cancer patients in particular are willing to explore to alternative therapies. The prevalence of CAM use amongst cancer patients is in the range of 9-88% and depends on country and cancer type [ [3](#B3-ijerph-19-01600)]. Meta-analysis of patient data found an increase in CAM use by cancer patients from 25% in the 1980s to 32% in the 1990s and 49% in the 2000s [ [3](#B3-ijerph-19-01600)]. Delay or refusal of conventional cancer treatment, due to a belief in alternative medicine, may have a negative impact on survival for cancer patients [ [4](#B4-ijerph-19-01600), [5](#B5-ijerph-19-01600), [6](#B6-ijerph-19-01600), [7](#B7-ijerph-19-01600), [8](#B8-ijerph-19-01600), [9](#B9-ijerph-19-01600), [10](#B10-ijerph-19-01600)]. In Poland, there is still a lack of studies about CAM use among cancer patients. In 2017, there was an intensive discussion in the popular press; the two most widely read Polish magazines were alarmed, reporting that about 75% of cancer patients used some unconventional therapies [ [11](#B11-ijerph-19-01600), [12](#B12-ijerph-19-01600)], and that some patients even resigned from conventional, evidence-based treatments. However, it was only a speculation, which was not based on systematic studies or solid data, and was mostly based on interviews with expert oncologists and individual patients. Therefore, at that time, we decided to carry out this study. The aims of this study were to investigate CAM popularity among cancer patients in Poland, explore patients' insights and beliefs about CAM, and evaluate their goals and expectations when using complementary and alternative medicine. 2. Materials and Methods [13](#B13-ijerph-19-01600), [14](#B14-ijerph-19-01600)]. The questionnaire consisted of 24 main closed questions, with some questions allowing further options for respondents to complete when answering: 15 questions allowed the patient to select a single response, 7 questions allowed the patient to select 1 or more responses (as applicable to them) and 2 questions provided the patient with a scale of responses to select from (see [Supplementary Files S1](#app1-ijerph-19-01600)). Demographic data included age, gender, education, profession, working status, place of residence and some information about cancer diagnosis (tumor localization, date of diagnosis, stage of disease, intention of treatment). Patients were individually interviewed by students during the research survey for more reliable data collection. Students supported patients in reading and in their understanding of the questions and difficult phrases, encouraging them to give honest answers. [Figure 1](#ijerph-19-01600-f001)). Statistical Analysis [http://statistica.io](http://statistica.io)(accessed on 1 January 2018)) TIBCO Software Inc., Krakow, half of patients who had used a complementary medicine (172 patients, 55%) had noticed the positive effects of CAM therapy ( [Figure 5](#ijerph-19-01600-f005)). [Table 2](#ijerph-19-01600-t002)). 4. Discussion 4.1. Prevalence and Reasons for CAM Use [15](#B15-ijerph-19-01600)], and the percentage of cancer patients treated with CAM is 46% in Japan [ [16](#B16-ijerph-19-01600)], 60% in Canada [ [17](#B17-ijerph-19-01600)], 70-83% in the US [18](#B18-ijerph-19-01600), [19](#B19-ijerph-19-01600)], 85% in [ [20](#B20-ijerph-19-01600)] and 98% in Shanghai [ [21](#B21-ijerph-19-01600)]. [22](#B22-ijerph-19-01600)]; additionally, 44.5% of Japanese patients using CAM claimed that they used complementary and alternative medicine to cure cancer [ [16](#B16-ijerph-19-01600)]. Buckner et al. [ [17](#B17-ijerph-19-01600)] reported that 51.6% of Canadian patients using CAM declared that they were \"just trying to do everything that can help\". Other reasons for CAM use included strengthening the immune system and in attempts to improving sleep and relaxation. In France, most patients indicated that their reason for using CAM was to prevent or treat the side effects of conventional therapy (81%), and about half of patients reported that their reason was to improve their well-being [ [23](#B23-ijerph-19-01600)]. Half of Italian cancer patients claimed that they used CAM, and of these, most of them thought that CAM could decrease the side effects of chemotherapy [ [24](#B24-ijerph-19-01600)]. Another Polish study demonstrated that CAM is commonly used by patients following a primary diagnosis of cancer. Half of patients (49%) hoped to enhance the effect of conventional therapy, whilst 16% hoped to treat the side effects [ [25](#B25-ijerph-19-01600)]. The main reasons that patients in our study used CAM were the following: strengthening the immune system (71%), improvement of morphological and biochemical test parameters (64%), improvement of well-being (39%), and reducing the side effects of conventional therapy (29%). Similar results were reported amongst cancer patients in Sweden [ [26](#B26-ijerph-19-01600)]. [22](#B22-ijerph-19-01600)]. In the analysis of Tascilar et al. [ [27](#B27-ijerph-19-01600)], most patients from the countries studied used CAM together with conventional treatments. 4.2. Predictors of users were more likely to have advanced stages of cancer (IV) and have a history of delayed diagnosis [ [32](#B32-ijerph-19-01600)]. CAM were more likely to be used by breast cancer and lung cancer patients [ [24](#B24-ijerph-19-01600)]. In contrast, in our study, there were no significant differences among the prevalence of CAM usage based on cancer types. 4.3. Types of are some therapy preferences that have been reported to be nation-specific. In the USA, the most popular CAM were vitamins, minerals, herbal supplements and green tea [ [28](#B28-ijerph-19-01600), [29](#B29-ijerph-19-01600)]. In Sweden, the most popular were vitamins, minerals and relaxation [ [26](#B26-ijerph-19-01600)]. In Japan, patients often used mushrooms, propolis and Chinese herbs. In Saudi Arabia, some of the most commonly used CAM treatments were found to be Zamzam water, camel milk and olive oil [ [16](#B16-ijerph-19-01600), [22](#B22-ijerph-19-01600)]. People in Saudi Arabia also considered supplication and Quran recitation as part of CAM [ [22](#B22-ijerph-19-01600)]. Americans often engaged in spiritual practices\u2014meditation and prayer [ [29](#B29-ijerph-19-01600), [30](#B30-ijerph-19-01600)]. 4.4. Sources of Information about CAM [20](#B20-ijerph-19-01600), [26](#B26-ijerph-19-01600)]. Hyodo et al. [ [16](#B16-ijerph-19-01600)] reported that over 60% of patients did not consult with a doctor over their usage of CAM. In France, only 33.5% of cancer patients using CAM discussed it with oncologists [ [23](#B23-ijerph-19-01600)]. However, in Italy, most CAM users informed their oncologists [ [24](#B24-ijerph-19-01600)]. Patients declared that they did not talk about CAM with doctors for various reasons, including fear of disapproval, exclusion from clinical trials or simply because no health care professionals asked them [ [34](#B34-ijerph-19-01600), [35](#B35-ijerph-19-01600)]. In our study, patients mostly obtained information about complementary and alternative medicine from the internet, friends, family and other patients. In various other studies, the same sources of information on CAM were the most popular amongst cancer patients [ [17](#B17-ijerph-19-01600), [20](#B20-ijerph-19-01600), [22](#B22-ijerph-19-01600), [24](#B24-ijerph-19-01600), [33](#B33-ijerph-19-01600), [36](#B36-ijerph-19-01600)]. The Pew Internet Project for Health reported that more than 60% of people who used the internet were looking for health-related information, half of whom were looking for information on CAM [ [37](#B37-ijerph-19-01600)]. Only about 6% of Italian cancer patients had heard about CAM from a doctor [ [24](#B24-ijerph-19-01600)]. Clinicians often do not ask patients about CAM use [ [38](#B38-ijerph-19-01600), [39](#B39-ijerph-19-01600)]. It could be a good idea to research whether doctors and other medical professionals (e.g., nurses) are interested in their patients' CAM use in future studies. 4.5. Experiences and Recommendation of CAM Use [26](#B26-ijerph-19-01600)]. Berretta et al. [ [24](#B24-ijerph-19-01600)] demonstrated that beneficial effects of using CAM were reported by 34.5% of patients, whereas more than half of them (59%) had no opinion about effects; however, 87.3% of respondents said they would recommend CAM, and 67.2% trusted in CAM. In Japan, 24.3% of cancer patients reported beneficial effects of CAM, such as pain relief, decreasing the side effects of conventional treatment, reducing tumor growth and improved well-being. About 70% of patients did not know whether CAM was effective [ [16](#B16-ijerph-19-01600)]. Only a small percentage of patients using CAM reported side effects from the therapy [ [16](#B16-ijerph-19-01600), [24](#B24-ijerph-19-01600)]. In our study, 6.7% of patients using CAM as an alternative therapy reported negative effects, and only 2.6% of patients were using CAM as a complementary treatment. It is difficult to evaluate the adverse effects of overall CAM. Complementary and alternative medicine encompasses a diverse range of therapies and methods. Some CAM, such as acupuncture, meditation, massage and music therapy could be in some way beneficial for cancer patients and could improve their general health [ [40](#B40-ijerph-19-01600), [41](#B41-ijerph-19-01600)]. However, there are also known adverse interactions between CAM and some anti-cancer drugs (e.g., inhibition or activation of cytochromes) [ [24](#B24-ijerph-19-01600), [27](#B27-ijerph-19-01600), [42](#B42-ijerph-19-01600)]. A significantly high adverse effect on survival was noted in cases of patients using CAM who delayed their conventional cancer treatment in favor of CAM; the five-year overall survival was significantly worse in cases of breast, lung and colorectal cancer patients [ [43](#B43-ijerph-19-01600)]. Johnson et al. [ [44](#B44-ijerph-19-01600)] showed that CAM use was associated with a significantly higher risk of death, because patients resigned from at least one standard oncological method of treatment. We noted that almost one in three of the patients surveyed in the present study believed that CAM should be regulated by law. CAM use by cancer patients is common. The Society of Integrative Oncology recommends integration of evidence-based CAM into regular oncologic care. Guidelines have been prepared based on reliable sources of information to help patients understand the risks and benefits of using CAM [ [45](#B45-ijerph-19-01600)]. 4.6. Limitations 5.
