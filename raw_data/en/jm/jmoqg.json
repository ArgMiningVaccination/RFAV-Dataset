Common Myths MYTH: The Vaccine Was Created Too Quickly A vaccine being developed in less than 1 year is an amazing feat. The speed might make some nervous, but these vaccines went through the same tests as similar vaccines. The global medical and research communities as well as governments worked together to develop and get the vaccine into production and to the people in record time due to the health risks that COVID-19 presents to the global population. MYTH: You Can Skip the 2nd Dose of Moderna & Pfizer No. If you skip the 2nd shot, you may lose your immunity. The second dose is necessary to keep up your body's defense against COVID-19. MYTH: Young People Don't Need the Shot Even if you are young, you can still develop long-term symptoms from the virus such as breathing issues, fatigue, loss of smell or taste and more. You may not be high risk for severe symptoms, but the virus is still being spread. We need to work together to protect those who are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 symptoms.
