The list summarises the indications and any limitations of use in children as assessed by the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Product (HMPC ). The age range and use of herbal medicinal products, within this special population of patients, are frequently discussed by healthcare professionals. The purpose of this overview is to provide a summary of the information from the monographs for ease of re ference. The list pertains to the specific herbal substances/preparations1 as mentioned in the EU herbal monographs and not to other categories of herbal products such as food or food supplements. 1 Ethanol is often used as extraction solvent in the manufacture of herbal medicinal products. Solvents specified for herbal pr eparations as listed here do not reflect the ethanol content in the finished product. The final amount is calculated by the produce r and appears on the label and in the package leaflet of each individual product. For more information please consult the ' Reflection paper on ethanol content in herbal medicinal products and traditional herbal medicinal products used in children ' (EMA/HMPC/85114/2008 ). European Union herbal monographs: Overview of recommendations for the uses of herbal medicinal products in the paediatric pop ulation EMA/HMPC/228356/2012 Page 2/100 The list is divided into two groups of herbal medicinal pr oducts: well-established use (marketing authorisation, WEU): demonstrated sufficient safety and efficacy data ( page 14 -22); traditional use (simplified registration, TU): accepted on the basis of sufficient safety data and plausible efficacy (pag e 23-100). The EU herbal monographs are generally applied within the EU and are taken into account by Member States when examining an application. Mem ber States are not obliged to follow the monographs and it is possible that a Member State, with a due justification, will choose not to adhere to a specific monograph. The list is derived from information in the EU herbal monographs as adopted. For further information reference should be made to the specific EU herbal monographs and assessment reports.
