Longevity Wellness has two locations: [Vilalara Longevity 244 Six Senses Zighy Bay, Oman How many spas can you paraglide into? Zighy Bay's Bond-ish arrival option ranks as one of the coolest on the planet. But it's not all adrenaline-charged. The resort is geared toward relaxation and repose, with a dedicated spa. Located in the Musandam Peninsula, with mountains to one side and beach on the other, one could hardly ask for a grander setting. Equally tantalizing are the three-, five- and seven-day detox, fitness, destressing and adventure programs with options you can customize. [Six Senses Zighy Fordoun Hotel & Spa, South Africa Dr. Elliot Ndlovu is a Zulu spiritual healer and director of Fordoun, one of South Africa's top-rated spas. The family owned place is located on a former dairy farm in the hills of Kwazulu Natal province's Midlands and surrounded by a working cattle farm. Its motto is \"Ubuntu,\" a Zulu phrase that roughly translates as \"treat others as you would like to be treated.\" The indigenous-themed treatments, walks, birdwatching, trout fishing and ballooning are all restful activities, but the star attraction is a session with Ndlovu, who a few years back traveled to the Oscars in Los Angeles to give readings to a bevy of A-list stars.

There's an impressive roster of therapists and visiting experts, as well as 14-day wellness programs, including ones devoted to stress and burnout and sleep enhancement. Yoga, pilates, meditation, a library, swimming pool and landscaped gardens provide more ways to find peace and quiet.
