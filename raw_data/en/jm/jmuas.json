Dingell Ranking Minority MemberCommittee on CommerceHouse of Representatives Dear Mr. Dingell:In response to your request, we are pleased to submit this report assessing the evidence for creating an additional class of drugs in the United States that would not be for sale outsidepharmacies but would be available without a physician's prescription. As you requested, todetermine if there are significant benefits or costs from such a class, we review the drugdistribution systems in ten countries and the European Union. The report also reviews thepractice of pharmacy, focusing on pharmacists counseling of patients on the use ofnonprescription drugs. We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional committees and government agencies, and we will make copies available to others upon request. If you have any questionsor would like additional information, please call me at (202) 512-3092. Major contributors to thisreport are listed in appendix VIII. Sincerely yours, Kwai-Cheung Chan Director for Program Evaluation in Physical Systems Areas Executive Summary PurposeThe classification of drugs in the United States into one of two classes, prescription or nonprescription, is unique. Other countries have a class ofdrugs that is available without a prescription but can be obtained only in apharmacy and sometimes can be dispensed only by a pharmacist. Todetermine whether the United States would benefit from adding such adrug class, the Ranking Minority Member of the House Committee onCommerce asked GAO to examine the drug distribution systems in 10 countries. Because their health care systems differ, their experiences maynot be completely applicable in the United States; however, they can helpinform the debate. Accordingly, this report answers the followingquestions: (1) What conclusions can be drawn from studies or reports onthe development, operation, and consequences of different drugdistribution systems? (2) What are the drug distribution systems for the 10countries? (3) What drug distribution system will be implemented in theEuropean Union? (4) How does access to nonprescription drugs varybetween the study countries and the United States? (5) How dopharmacists ensure the proper use of nonprescription drugs? (6) What isthe U.S. experience with dispensing drugs without a physician'sprescription but only by pharmacists? BackgroundThe United States has very few restrictions on where nonprescriptiondrugs can be sold. It has been argued that the United States would benefitfrom the creation of a pharmacy- or pharmacist-class of drugs. 1 Of two general views on such a class, the first sees it as a fixed class into whichdrugs could be placed permanently with no expectation that they wouldeventually be moved into a different class. The second (and the onegenerally advocated by proponents of an intermediate class at this time)sees it as a transition class from prescription to nonprescription: a drugwould spend a period of time in the transition class, during which itssuitability for sale outside pharmacies could be assessed. Supporters of an additional class of nonprescription drugs argue that, because pharmacists would be more involved in patients' selection anduse of nonprescription drugs, such a class would (1) increase the numberof drugs available to consumers without a prescription, (2) reduce drugmisuse, and (3) lower health care costs by reducing the number of visits tophysicians for ailments that could be treated with the wider range of drugs 1A pharmacy class of drugs is defined as a category of nonprescription drugs that may be sold only in pharmacies. There are no restrictions on who may sell the product. A pharmacist class ofnonprescription drugs may also be sold only in pharmacies, but unlike the pharmacy class, thepharmacist must be involved in the sale. In this report, intermediate class refers to either a pharmacyor pharmacist class. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 2 Executive Summary that would be available without a prescription. To assess the merits of these arguments, GAO reviewed the pertinent literature and interviewed or requested information from national and state government health officials,representatives of professional and consumer associations, academics,and pharmacists in the United States, the European Union, Australia,Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden,Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Results in BriefLittle evidence supports the establishment of a pharmacy or pharmacistclass of drugs in the United States at this time, as either a fixed or atransition class. The evidence that is available tends to undermine thecontention that major benefits are being obtained in the countries thathave such a class. This conclusion is substantiated by six points.(1) Reliable and valid studies that examine the effect of different drugdistribution systems on overall health and health care system costs do notexist. (2) While a pharmacy or pharmacist class exists in all 10 countries, itis not used with any frequency in any of them to facilitate the movement ofdrugs to sale outside specialized drug outlets. (3) The European Union hasdecided not to impose any particular drug distribution system on itsmember countries because it has found no evidence of the superiority ofone system over another. (4) There is no clear pattern of increased ordecreased access to drugs as nonprescription products where apharmacist or pharmacy class exists. (5) While a pharmacy or pharmacistclass is assumed by some to improve safeguards against drug misuse andabuse, in the 10 countries these safeguards are easily circumvented, andstudies show that pharmacist counseling is infrequent and incomplete.(6) Experience in Florida with a class of drugs similar to a pharmacistclass has not been successful; pharmacists have not regularly prescribedthese drugs, and recordkeeping requirements have not been followed. GAO's Analysis Extant Studies No systematic evidence supports the superiority of one drug distributionsystem over another. Studies have not attempted to link different systemswith differences between countries in health care costs, adverse drugreactions, and quality of care. No studies show that problems or benefitsarise from either restricting the sale of nonprescription drugs topharmacies or allowing them to be sold outside pharmacies. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 3 Executive Summary Drug Distribution Systems All 10 countries restrict the sale of some or all nonprescription products. France, Italy, and the Netherlands restrict the sale of all nonprescriptiondrugs to specialized drug outlets, while the 7 other countries allow the saleof only some nonprescription drugs outside these outlets. No countrylimits nonprescription drugs to sale by pharmacists or in pharmacies inorder to assess their suitability for sale outside pharmacies. Instead, drugsare placed in the pharmacy or pharmacist class with no assurances thatthey will eventually be assessed for more general sale. The European Union has set criteria for distinguishing prescription from nonprescription products. However, since EU officials could find no evidence showing the superiority of a particular drug distribution system,each country will decide the nature and number of its own drugdistribution classes. Access to Nonprescription DrugsThere is no consistent pattern across the 10 countries and the United States on the accessibility of 14 selected drugs. The United States allowsthe sale of some of the drugs without a prescription that most of the othercountries restrict to prescription sale. Conversely, the United Statesrestricts some drugs to prescription sale that most of the other countriesallow to be sold in a pharmacist or pharmacy class. The United States has fewer community pharmacies per capita than 6 of the 10 countries, so that restricting the sale of some nonprescription drugsto community pharmacies in the United States would appear to besomewhat of a greater inconvenience. However, this could be partially orcompletely offset if other outlets such as managed-care and mail-orderpharmacies also sold these products or if new pharmacies opened. Access could be reduced in the United States if consumers had to request these drugs from a pharmacist or an employee, as is generally the case inthe other countries. However, even if self-selection were not allowed, ifthe intermediate class were used to move drugs out of prescription statusthat would not otherwise have been reclassified, access to the drugswould increase since a prescription would no longer be needed. The Role of Pharmacists Only in Australia (and only for some drugs in some states) dorequirements that pharmacists counsel customers on nonprescription druguse explicitly state what information should be discussed. In 3 countries,pharmacists are expected to provide sufficient information for the proper GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 4 Executive Summary use of nonprescription drugs, but there are no detailed counseling requirements. Other countries typically require that a pharmacist be awareof sales, be on the premises when a sale is made, or promote proper druguse. However, counseling and other pharmacist interventions withcustomers often do not occur. Although counseling by pharmacists on theuse of nonprescription drugs has improved, it is often infrequent andincomplete. Only in some states in Australia and only for some drugs are pharmacists required to maintain records on nonprescription drug use. In none of thecountries are pharmacists required to report adverse drug reactions. InItaly and the United Kingdom, such reports from pharmacists are notaccepted, while in the others pharmacists rarely report these reactions. Pharmacist associations in the United States and other countries advocate \"pharmaceutical care,\" a concept that seeks to expand pharmacy practicefrom only dispensing drugs to being more involved in monitoring drugtherapy (for instance, checking for adverse drug reactions).Pharmaceutical care is being implemented in some communitypharmacies, but even if its value there can be documented, there will stillbe reason for debate on the need for an intermediate class. The U.S. Experience The Florida Pharmacist Self-Care Consultant Law allows pharmacists toprescribe specific medications without the supervision of a physician.However, they rarely use this authority and, when they do, seldom followthe law's recordkeeping requirements. As in the 10 countries, Floridapharmacists often gather incomplete information and spend little time inassessing and responding to their patients' medical complaints. RecommendationsGAO is making no recommendations in this report. Agency CommentsOfficials from the Food and Drug Administration reviewed a draft of thisreport and provided written comments (see appendix VI). Their commentswere brief and stated that the report does not address all the changes thatwould be necessary for the United States to adopt an intermediate class ofdrugs. A comprehensive assessment of all such changes was beyond thescope of GAO's work.

Nonprescription drugs areoften referred to as over-the-counter ( OTC) medications (the terms are used interchangeably in this report). The term \"prescription\" has severalmeanings but generally refers to the order of a physician to a pharmacistfor the delivery of certain medications to a patient. A prescription drugmay be dispensed to a patient only on the basis of such an order.Nonprescription drugs are available for general sale without a prescriptionby self-service in pharmacies and in nonpharmacy outlets such as grocerystores, mass merchandisers, gas stations, and restaurants. 1 The principal factors used to determine the prescription or nonprescription status ofdrugs are the margin of safety, method of use and collateral measuresnecessary to use, benefit-to-risk ratio, and adequacy of labeling forself-medication. Nonprescription drug sales were over $13 billion in 1992and may reach $18 billion by the end of 1995 or 1996 (Covington, 1993, p.xxv). The importance of these medicines is growing, partly as a result ofthe reclassification of some commonly used drugs from prescription tononprescription status. 2 The two-tier system in the United States is unusual. Other countriestypically have either more or different categories. There can be limitationson where and by whom a nonprescription drug can be sold. In somecountries, the sale of some or all nonprescription drugs is restricted topharmacies. Additionally, in some countries, certain nonprescriptionproducts have to be dispensed personally by a pharmacist. The 1951 Durham-Humphrey Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 provided the statutory basis for the two-tier drugclassification system in the United States. Since that time, there have beena number of proposals to introduce a third category of drugs in the United 1There are several exceptions to the two-class system. First, in some states selected schedule V controlled substances are available without a prescription but must be dispensed by a pharmacist.(Controlled substances are psychoactive drugs regulated under the Controlled Substances Act on thebasis of their abuse potential, medical acceptance, and ability to produce dependence.) Second, insulinis a nonprescription product in some states but can be dispensed only by a pharmacist. Third, inFlorida pharmacists can prescribe a limited number of prescription drugs without a prescriptionhaving been written by another health professional. Fourth, in some states pharmacists have\"dependent\" prescribing authority in which typically they can prescribe drugs under protocolsestablished by supervisory physicians. These exceptions are discussed in chapter 5. 2This is commonly referred to as switching. Between 1976 and July 1995, FDA switched 55 drug products. The pace of drug switches has increased in the past 10 to 15 years and the current pace isexpected to continue. When a drug becomes available without a prescription, it is sometimes sold fordifferent ailments and at different strengths than it was as a prescription product. For example,ibuprofen was prescribed for chronic arthritis in 400 mg and larger doses. As an OTC product, it ismarketed as a general pain reliever and is available only in doses of 200 mg or less. In these situations,the prescription product remains available as well. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 10 Chapter 1 Introduction States. These proposals have been called by a number of names, including pharmacist-legend, pharmacist-only, third class of drugs, and transitionclass. Although there is some variation between them, the basic idea is thesame: a class of drugs would be established that would be available only inpharmacies but no prescription would be needed. One variation is that thepharmacist would have to be personally involved in the sale of a drug inthis class; a sales clerk could not sell the drug without the permission ofthe pharmacist. (For additional information on the history of this issue inthe United States, see appendix I.) There are two general views on how an additional class of drugs would be used in the United States. The first, and the one advocated in the past byvarious pharmacist organizations such as the American PharmaceuticalAssociation ( APhA ) and the California Pharmacists Association, sees it as a permanent class. It would be similar to the current classes in that drugswould be placed in the class with no expectation that they wouldeventually be moved to the prescription or nonprescription class. Drugs inthe new class would be thought not to be appropriate for use withoutsome supervision by a health professional but a physician's oversightwould not be necessary. Drugs in this middle class could come from eitherthe prescription or nonprescription classes, although it is generallybelieved that they should come from the prescription class. Opponents ofthis proposal have included the Nonprescription Drug ManufacturersAssociation ( NDMA ) and the American Medical Association ( AMA). The second, advocated first in 1982 by the National Association of Retail Druggists ( NARD ) and currently supported by such groups as APhA and the National Consumers League, sees the intermediate class as a transitionclass. A drug that was being switched from prescription to nonprescriptionstatus would spend a period of time in the transition class, during whichthe suitability of the drug for general sale could be assessed. 3 The assessment could be based not only on experiences with the drug as aprescription product (as is currently done) but also on experiences withthe drug in the transition class, where it would not be limited toprescription sale. The argument is that this would give a better picture ofhow the drug would be used if it were available for general sale (that is,without a prescription and outside of pharmacies). Information that couldbe gathered while the drug was in the transition class includes types andlevels of misuse among the general public, incidents of adverse drugreactions, and interactions with other medications. At the end of a 3The length of time a drug would spend in the transition class has not been specified, although Penna (1985) gives 5 years as a possibility. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 11 Chapter 1 Introduction specified period, the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) would decide to switch the drug to the general sale class, return the drug to prescriptionstatus, or keep the drug in the transition class for further study. 4 This proposal has also been opposed by, among others, NDMA and AMA. The effect of an intermediate class of drugs in the United States would depend on whether the drugs in it would come from the prescription orgeneral sale class. Figure 1.1 illustrates the several ways an intermediatedrug class might function in the United States. 4This report uses the following definitions: \u2014Fixed, intermediate class = a class of nonprescription drugs into which pharmaceuticals would be permanently placed. The sale of these drugs would be restricted to sale either in pharmacies or bypharmacists. \u2014Transition class = a class of nonprescription drugs into which a drug could be temporarily placed while its suitability for less restrictive sale was being assessed. As proposed in the United States, drugsin the transition class would be available for sale without a prescription but only from a pharmacist.The class would be used for assessing the appropriateness of selling a drug in any retail outlet. \u2014Intermediate class = a general term encompassing both a fixed, intermediate class and a transition class. \u2014Pharmacist class = a class of nonprescription drugs that can be sold only in pharmacies and if the pharmacist is personally involved in the sale. \u2014Pharmacy class = a class of nonprescription drugs that can be sold only in pharmacies, but the pharmacist does not have to be personally involved in the sale. The distinction between a pharmacyclass and a pharmacist class is relevant for both a fixed, intermediate class and a transition class. \u2014General sale class = a class of nonprescription drugs available for sale outside pharmacies and drugstores. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 12 Chapter 1 Introduction Figure 1.1: Possible Uses of an Intermediate Drug Class in the UnitedStates Intermrdiate class Prescription class Nonprescription GeneralSaleC A BC Transition Class Fixed ClassIntermediate class Note: A = If the intermediate class were viewed as a fixed class, it would primarily be used to switch prescription drugs into it rather than into the unrestricted sale category. The intermediate classwould increase access by removing the need for a prescription in order to purchase the productbut sales would be restricted to pharmacies or by a pharmacist. B = If it were determined that a nonprescription drug available for general sale should be more restricted, it could be moved to the intermediate class rather than to the prescription class. Theintermediate class would be used to decrease access to the drug by providing safeguards (forinstance, sale only in pharmacies) that are not available if there are no restrictions on the sale ofthe drug. C = If the intermediate class were viewed as a transition class, a prescription drug would be switched into it for a period of time and then reassessed to determine if sale should be allowedoutside pharmacies. The intermediate class would be used to allow nonprescription access todrugs but would include the safeguard of pharmacist counseling and the assessment of safety forfuture switching to the general sale class. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 13 Chapter 1 Introduction Arguments for and Against anIntermediate Class ofDrugsArguments for and against an intermediate class of drugs fall into two general (but sometimes related) categories: health and economic. Table1.1 lists some of the arguments that have been put forth in support of andopposition to an intermediate class of drugs. Most of the arguments arerelevant for both a fixed and a transition class. The principal differencebetween a fixed and a transition class is not the benefits and costs thatwould ensue but their goals. The goal of a transition class in the UnitedStates would be to facilitate the movement of drugs into the general salecategory. The goal of a fixed class would be to place drugs permanently inthe class. Table 1.1: Arguments for and Against an Intermediate Class of Drugs For Against With the establishment of a transition class, consumers would have access to more pharmaceuticals without a prescription.Medications formerly available only by prescription would becomeavailable earlier without a physician's prescription but withpharmacists' counseling (National Consumers League, 1991). a This argument, made specifically in support of a transition class, couldalso be made for a fixed class. Advocates of a transition classfurther state that drugs would be moved only from prescriptionstatus into the intermediate class; current OTCs would not bemoved into it. (Fixed- class proposals did not address this issue)The NDMA president (Cope, 1984) has argued that access tononprescription products would decrease because theintermediate class would be limited to sale in pharmacies: thereare approximately 54,000 U.S. community pharmacies but over750,000 stores that sell nonprescription products. b NDMA has not uniquely addressed the transition class proposal. Instead, it hasgrouped it with the proposals calling for a fixed class and statedthat both will restrict access to some nonprescription drugs.NDMA argues that current OTCs could be moved into theintermediate class under any of these proposals APhA has stated that customers could use the expertise ofpharmacists, well trained in pharmacology, as an added resourceon nonprescription drug use, drug interactions, and other factors.This is relevant for both a fixed and a transition classIndustry officials have noted that pharmacists' counseling isinfrequent and sometimes incorrect and this would not changewith an additional drug class; in addition, a new class of drugs isnot needed for pharmacists to give counseling. This is relevant forboth a fixed and a transition class APhA officials have stated that because of their training,pharmacists can a play a useful role in helping customers assesstheir medical needs and determining whether a physician's visit isnecessary. Through this advice, visits to physicians for minorailments would decrease and physicians would have more time forpatients with serious illnesses. In addition, patients would not haveto go to the doctor for a medication previously available only byprescription, so the cost of the physician's visit would be saved.This is relevant for both a fixed and a transition classNDMA has stated that only physicians possess the skillsnecessary for diagnosing and treating illnesses; pharmacistscould not replace physicians. c A visit to the physician can be not merely to receive a drug but also to be diagnosed. Improperdiagnosis can lead to symptoms being treated and the patientfeeling better but, because of the lack of a physician's diagnosis,what was treated might not be the true underlying cause.Improper treatment could have serious and expensiveconsequences, thereby negating the savings from not visiting aphysician. For example, an antiulcer medication might make thepatient feel better but the underlying cause might be not an ulcerbut stomach cancer. This is relevant for both a fixed and atransition class National Consumers League officials have stated that anintermediate class facilitates the giving of advice to individuals whocannot read drug labels or have difficulties understanding them. a This is relevant for both a fixed and a transition classConsumers practice self-medication responsibly. NDMA hasstated that consumers read and understand drug labels, whichcontain all the information they need. This is relevant for both afixed and a transition class (continued) GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 14 Chapter 1 Introduction For Against Proponents state that until consumers learn how to properly use recently switched drugs, pharmacists should be particularlyaccessible for them because of their high potential for toxicity andabuse. While this argument holds for both a fixed and a transitionclass, it is most relevant for the latter because of the implication thatonce there is more experience with these drugs as nonprescriptionproducts, pharmacists will not have to be involved in their saleNDMA has stated that drugs unsafe for unsupervised use byconsumers on the basis of their labeling directions should beprescription products; they should not be available fornonprescription sale even with pharmacist counseling. d Opponents have also argued that there have been no problemswith already switched drugs; they have not been abused orcaused widespread toxicity. This is relevant for both a fixed and atransition class Penna writes that pharmacists could provide FDA postmarketingsurveillance information on misuse, adverse reactions, and theextent of the use of a drug as a nonprescription product. e This would be useful information for both a fixed and a transition class; itis most relevant for the latter because of the use of the class tofacilitate and better assess the appropriateness of switching drugs.This information could be used to determine whether to allow salesin any retail outlet, keep the drug in the intermediate class, or returnit to prescription statusNDMA president Cope writes that the current two-tier systemworks well; an additional class is not necessary to ensure safety. b If they wish, consumers can go to pharmacies for advice but arenot compelled to do so (NDMA, 1992). This is relevant for both afixed and transition class Proponents argue that when necessary, recalls of nonprescriptionproducts would be facilitated since there would be fewer outletsfrom which to recall intermediate-class drugs. APhA officials havestated that pharmacists have a commendable record in facilitatingdrug recalls. This is relevant for both a fixed and a transition classOpponents argue that FDA and the pharmaceutical industry havean excellent record in recalling products from both pharmacy andnonpharmacy outlets. Thus, an intermediate class is not neededfor this purpose. This is relevant for both a fixed and a transitionclass Proponents have argued that abuse of nonprescription drugs wouldbe reduced because a pharmacist would check if the drug andquantity being purchased were appropriate. Pharmacists couldeducate consumers on proper drug use. This is relevant for both afixed and a transition classOpponents argue that an intermediate class would not beeffective in preventing abuse since it would not address theunderlying problem and would represent only a smallinconvenience in obtaining the product. In addition, they arguethat the abuse of OTCs is often localized and generally sporadicand subsides after a short period. Consumer education at thelocal level is the best approach to solving these problems. This isrelevant for both a fixed and transition class More drugs would be available without a prescription because ofthe safeguard of restricting sale to pharmacies or by a pharmacist;proponents argue that health care costs would decrease becausethe nonprescription version of a drug is generally less expensivethan the prescription version. This is relevant for both a fixed andtransition classOpponents argue that because of restricted competition andpharmacists' wanting to be compensated for counseling, the priceof intermediate-class drugs would be higher than if they had beenmade nonprescription in the current two-tier system, without anycorresponding benefit to consumers or the health care system c aNational Consumers League, Taking Your Medicine: Providing Consumer Safeguards (Washington, D.C.: September 1991). bJ.

GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 15 Chapter 1 Introduction Many of the arguments for an intermediate class of drugs suggest that the quality of health care would improve if pharmacists' involvement weregreater. Proponents such as APhA argue that pharmacists are well trained in pharmacology and that their expertise is underused. They could play animportant role in improving drug use. It is argued further that making useof this expertise is especially important for recently switched drugs whosepotential for widespread abuse and toxicity is great. In the case of atransition class, Penna (1985) writes that pharmacists would be in aposition to aid FDA in its switch decisions by maintaining records of the medications they dispense and by providing access to them to researchersassessing the safety and efficacy of these drugs. They might also beencouraged or required to report adverse drug reactions and be involvedin postmarketing evaluation studies. Currently, FDA derives this information only from the use of drugs as prescription products. Some arguments against an intermediate class of drugs come from industry officials who have argued that while pharmacists have usefulinformation to pass on to consumers, an intermediate class is notnecessary for tapping into it. If customers are interested in getting advicefrom pharmacists, they can go to a pharmacy and ask for it but are notforced to do so. They also note some difficulties with an increased role forpharmacists. Counseling for nonprescription products is infrequent andsometimes inappropriate, and they argue that this would not change withthe establishment of an intermediate class of drugs. In addition,consumers use nonprescription drugs responsibly. They read andunderstand drug labels. There is nothing for the pharmacist to add. NDMA agrees that pharmacists are well-trained in pharmaceuticals but believesthat they are not trained in other roles\u2014in particular, diagnosing illnesses( NDMA , 1992). Only physicians have this training and should be performing this role. Improper diagnosis could lead to treating symptoms rather thanthe underlying cause of an illness. Finally, opponents argue that thecurrent two-tier system works well ( NDMA , 1992). It is simple and effective. Either a drug is safe enough to be taken without medical supervision or itis not. There is no need for an intermediate class of drugs. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 16 Chapter 1 Introduction Objectives, Scope, and Methodology Objectives To find out whether there would be significant advantages to creating an additional class of drugs, the Ranking Minority Member of the HouseCommittee on Commerce asked us to examine the operation of drugdistribution systems in 10 countries that have a pharmacist or pharmacyclass of drugs and to compare these systems with that in the United States.To respond to this request, we posed specific evaluation questions: 1. What conclusions can be drawn from studies or reports on the development, operation, and consequences of differentmultiple-classification drug distribution systems? 2. What are the drug distribution systems for the 10 countries?3. What drug distribution will be implemented in the European Union?4. How does access to nonprescription drugs vary between the study countries and the United States? 5. How do pharmacists ensure the proper use of nonprescription drugs?6. What is the U.S. experience with dispensing drugs without a physician's prescription but only by pharmacists? Our purpose was to learn generally about factors that affect drug distribution in other countries and, in particular, about the perceived costsand benefits of a pharmacist or pharmacy class of drugs. This can raiseimportant issues about the desirability or usefulness of such a class ofdrugs in the United States. By studying other countries, it is possible tobring empirical data to the debate. Scope We examined the drug distribution systems in Australia, Canada,Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland,and the United Kingdom. (See appendix II.) As requested, we also studiedthe harmonized system for the members of the European Union ( EU).5 We 5The 15 members of the European Union are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the UnitedKingdom. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 17 Chapter 1 Introduction examined the classification of the following 14 IV.) We chose these drugs becausethey either are past switches or have been suggested as candidates forswitching in the United States or another country. We focused on an intermediate class of drugs as it has generally been discussed in the United States and practiced in other countries\u2014that is, aclass of nonprescription drugs available only in pharmacies or from apharmacist. We did not assess the more general notion of pharmaceuticalcare, although we discuss it briefly in chapters 4 and 5. 6 An intermediate class of drugs might be considered one form of pharmaceutical care. Whilesome arguments and evidence regarding pharmaceutical care are thereforerelevant for an intermediate class of drugs, a complete evaluation ofpharmaceutical care was beyond our scope. Methodology To determine what is known about the operation of drug distributionsystems that include a pharmacist or pharmacy class of drugs, weexamined extant information and gathered expert opinion on six generalissues. (1) The findings of studies on the health and economic effects of apharmacist or pharmacy class. (2) The experiences of other countries andthe European Union with a pharmacist or pharmacy class, including itsuse to move a drug to a general sale class, its usefulness in preventing drugabuse, and its effect on drug expenditures. (3) The effect on consumers'access to nonprescription drugs of restricting their sale to pharmacies orpersonal sale by pharmacists. (4) The role of pharmacists in the studycountries and the United States and the findings of studies on pharmacistcounseling for nonprescription drugs. (5) The limited experience in theUnited States of pharmacists prescribing drugs without a physician'sinvolvement and of restricting some nonprescription drugs to sale only bypharmacists. We gathered information from a number of sources and used several data collection methods. We did not do independent analyses of data bases. Literature Review We conducted computerized literature searches on the following topics:(1) drug distribution systems in the study countries, (2) the behavior of 6Pharmaceutical care involves pharmacists \"designing, implementing, and monitoring a therapeutic plan, in cooperation with the patient and other health professionals, that will produce specifictherapeutic outcomes\" (Klein-Schwartz and Hoopes, 1993, p. 11). GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 18 Chapter 1 Introduction pharmacists, (3) the classification of the 14 drugs, (4) the advantages and disadvantages of an intermediate class of drugs, and (5) assessments ofthe health and economic effects of different drug distribution systems. Interviews With U.S. Experts and OfficialsWe conducted interviews with officials of FDA involved in the regulation of prescription and nonprescription drugs, pharmacy associations, drugmanufacturers, consumer groups, and drug manufacturer associations. Wealso interviewed academics who have written on this subject. In addition,we met with officials and academics in Florida to discuss theirexperiences with the Florida Pharmacist Self-Care Consultant Law (seeappendix V). Country Studies We requested information from government and pharmacy associationofficials in the 10 study countries. Because Canada's individual provinceshave a great deal of power over drug distribution, we also requestedinformation from officials in Ontario. 7 We sought to gather descriptive information on the drug distribution system in each country, includingcriteria for drug classification, the classification of the 14 drugs,requirements for pharmacist counseling, and liability issues. To obtain more in-depth information about the systems and experiences of particular countries, we traveled to Australia, Canada, Germany, theNetherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. We chose thesecountries because each allows the sale of some drugs outside pharmacies.The extensiveness of this general sale class varies greatly betweencountries; however, it was important to assess the experiences ofcountries where at least some drugs are available in the same manner as inthe United States. We met with government officials, industry andpharmacy representatives, and other individuals knowledgeable aboutdrug distribution in each country. The trips also allowed us to gather theviews of a wider range of people than we contacted by mail, such asconsumer groups, physicians' associations, drug manufacturers, andacademics. We also visited officials in Brussels, Belgium, to understandthe rationale behind the decisions of the European Union regarding drugdistribution in the member countries. We conducted our evaluation between February 1993 and December 1994 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. 7We chose Ontario because it is the most populous Canadian province and the distribution system there is typical of (although not exactly the same as) the systems in other provinces. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 19 Chapter 1 Introduction Study Strengths and LimitationsAlthough studies have examined individual drug distribution systems, we found that little effort has been made to systematically compare systems.Our study brings together information about the drug distribution systemsin 11 countries (including the United States), Ontario, Canada, and theEuropean Union. In addition to describing the systems, we examine theaccessibility of nonprescription drugs in the study countries and theUnited States, describe the role of pharmacists in the countries, and assessevidence for implementing a class of nonprescription drugs available onlyfrom pharmacies (or personally from a pharmacist) in the United States.This information allows the assessment of the operation of a pharmacistor pharmacy class of drugs in the study countries as well as raises issuesthat would have to be addressed if such a class of drugs were consideredin the United States. One important difference between the United States and the other countries limits the lessons that can be learned. In all the countries otherthan the United States, there is some government provision of health careto the general public or universal health insurance through the privatesector but regulated by the government. Thus, the context in which drugsare acquired, sold, and paid for can be quite different in these countriesfrom that in the United States. If the barriers to obtaining a prescriptiondrug in these countries are smaller than in the United States becauseindividuals do not directly pay for physician visits and drugs prescribed inthem, there may be less incentive there to purchase nonprescriptionproducts. Another limitation is that the available data did not allow us to directly assess the effect of a pharmacy or pharmacist class on adverse drugeffects, quality of care, and cost of drugs to the consumer and health caresystem. Instead, we had to rely on the assessments of governmentofficials, association representatives, and other experts in each country.We also did not examine in great detail the individual drug classificationdecisions made in each country. That is, we did not examine thedocumentation that supports particular classification decisions to assesshow decisionmaking varies between countries. Additionally, because ofcost and resource limitations, we did not visit every country included inthe study. (We did not travel to Denmark, France, Italy, and Sweden.) Finally, because our focus is on the experiences of other countries and what can be learned from them, we did not assess the principal reason FDA has given for not establishing an intermediate class of drugs\u2014namely, thata public health need for such a class in the United States has not been GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 20 Chapter 1 Introduction demonstrated. Consequently, we did not address issues such as the frequency of adverse effects for nonprescription drugs in general and,more specifically, for recently switched drugs in the United States. Agency CommentsOfficials from FDA reviewed a draft of this report and provided written comments (see appendix VI). They stated that the report does not considercertain additional requirements establishing an intermediate class of drugswould impose upon FDA, drug manufacturers, or pharmacists such as new FDA labeling requirements and additional training of pharmacists. The report discusses other potential additional requirements for pharmacists inchapters 2, 3, and 5. However, we did not attempt to address all additionalrequirements because a comprehensive assessment was beyond the scopeand objectives of our report. An assessment of the additional requirementsfor FDA and drug manufacturers was also beyond our scope. Report OrganizationThe following chapters address each of the five evaluation questions.Chapter 2 summarizes studies that have assessed the effects of differentdrug distribution systems and describes the drug distribution systems inthe 10 countries as well as officials' views on the operation of theirsystems. It also describes the system in the European Union. Chapter 3presents information on access to nonprescription drugs in the studycountries, including the classification of the 14 drugs. Chapter 4summarizes the role of pharmacists in each country and examines studiesof pharmacists' behavior in the study countries and the United States.Chapter 5 examines the U.S. experience, focusing on Florida with itsPharmacist Self-Care Consultant Law. Chapter 6 summarizes our findingsand presents conclusions. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 21 Chapter 2 Drug Distribution Systems Drug distribution systems differ from country to country. In this chapter, we summarize information from studies on the consequences of thedifferent systems. To show how the United States differs, we describe thedrug distribution systems for the 10 countries and the European Union.Our purpose is to identify the countries that have a pharmacist orpharmacy class of drugs and examine possible benefits that the UnitedStates does not receive because they have such a class and the UnitedStates does not. Specifically, we answer the following questions: 1. What conclusions can be drawn from studies or reports on the development, operation, and consequences of different drug distributionsystems? 2. What is the structure of the drug distribution system in each country?3. What are the criteria for the initial classification, and subsequent classification changes, of a given drug product in each country? 4. To what extent is the pharmacist or pharmacy drug class used as a transition class for drugs being moved from prescription to general sale? 5. How effective is a pharmacist or pharmacy class in preventing the abuse of drugs? 6. What is the effect on expenditures on a drug when the drug is switched from prescription to nonprescription status? 7. What drug distribution system will be implemented in the European Union? 1 Studies on the Consequences ofDifferent DrugDistribution SystemsLittle or no analysis has been done to show the advantages and disadvantages of different drug distribution systems. For example, as ofMarch 1995, researchers had not attempted to determine how differencesin drug distribution systems may affect health care costs. A number ofstudies have found significant differences in prescription drug pricesacross countries, both at the retail and manufacturers' level. However, asthe costs of production and distribution make up only a small share of thetotal cost of any prescription drug, it is unlikely that differences indistribution systems are major sources of country-by-country differences 1A major argument made in favor of a pharmacist or pharmacy class of drugs\u2014the counseling role of pharmacists\u2014is addressed in chapter 4. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 22 Chapter 2 Drug Distribution Systems in drugs prices ( GAO, 1994a, p. 29). The effect of different drug distribution systems on nonprescription drug prices has not been assessed.2 Similarly, no studies have attempted to link the type of drug distributionsystem in a country to the frequency of adverse drug reactions or haveattempted to relate different drug distribution systems to the quality ofhealth care. The studies that have been done focus on the experiences of a single country when switching specific drugs and do not attempt to assess themerits of alternative drug distribution systems (Andersen and Schou, 1993;Bytzer, and Temin, 1992). While some researchers have found healthand economic benefits to switching specific drugs in a particular country,no attempt has been made to determine what the effects would have beenunder a different drug classification system. For instance, would coughand cold remedies have been switched earlier in the United States if anintermediate-drug class had been available? If so, what would the benefitshave been? If not, are there costs (for instance, adverse drug reactions)that would have been avoided if they had been switched into anintermediate class? There are also no studies that explicitly attempt to linkthe drug distribution system with the switching of specific drugs. In sum, itis necessary to examine other data to assess how a new class of drugs inthe United States might operate. The Number and Type of Drug Classes in theStudy CountriesTable 2.1 summarizes the drug classes in the 10 countries, Ontario, and the United States. Note that in the Netherlands and Switzerland, a distinctionis made between pharmacies and drugstores. Pharmacies are run byprofessionals with university degrees in pharmacy. All nonprescriptiondrugs can be sold in pharmacies and prescriptions can be dispensed.Conversely, in drugstores, the principal \"drug expert\" is the druggist.Although some training is required to become a druggist, it is notuniversity-based and is not as extensive as that for a pharmacist. In 2The only comparative information we identified on nonprescription drugs costs, drawn from OTC News , indicated that of 6 countries examined, the United States had the lowest percentage markup (33 percent) from manufacturers' price to retail price (\"Editorial,\" 1993, p. 391). The figures do notindicate why the differences existed and whether there was a difference in the average markup fordrugs restricted to sale in pharmacies and those available for general sale (in countries that have bothdistribution classes). Moreover, these results do not necessarily mean that the United States has thelowest nonprescription drug prices, since manufacturers' prices may vary between countries. The 6countries were France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 23 Chapter 2 Drug Distribution Systems contrast to pharmacies, prescription drugs cannot be dispensed in drugstores, nor can all nonprescription drugs be sold there. Table 2.1: Drug Classes in Ten Countries, Ontario, and the United States Country PrescriptionaPharmacistbPharmacycDrugstoredGeneral salee Australia x x x x Canadafx x x Ontario x x x x Denmark x x x France x x Germany x xgx Italy x x Netherlands x xgx Sweden x x x Switzerland x x x x United Kingdom x xgx United States x x aPrescription = class of drugs available only with a prescription. Some countries have multiple classes of prescription drugs. For instance, in some countries, refillable prescriptions are notallowed for certain prescription drugs. For our purposes, it is sufficient to combine thesecategories into a single prescription class. bPharmacist = class of drugs available without a prescription but the pharmacist must be involved in a sale. Involvement may be defined as loosely as being on the premises when the sale ismade. cPharmacy = class of drugs available without a prescription but only in pharmacies. The pharmacist does not have to be involved in a sale. dDrugstore = class of drugs available without a prescription but only in pharmacies or drugstores. In some countries, pharmacies and drugstores are distinguishable drug outlets. A pharmacistdoes not have to be employed at a drugstore. Instead, it is sufficient for someone with lesstraining to be the \"drug expert.\" Fewer drugs are available in drugstores than in pharmacies. eGeneral sale = class of drugs available without a prescription and outside pharmacies and drugstores. fThe federal government classifies a drug as either prescription or nonprescription. Each province determines where the drug can be sold in that province. However, the federal government doesrecommend whether the drug should be available outside pharmacies. Because of this, we listthree drug classes at the national level in Canada. gThe name of this class is \"pharmacy restricted\" in Germany, \"pharmacy-only products\" in the Netherlands, and \"pharmacy medicines\" in the United Kingdom. We list these classes here underpharmacist class because the requirements to sell drugs in these classes fit our definition ofpharmacist class rather than pharmacy class. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 24 Chapter 2 Drug Distribution Systems In Australia, Canada, and Switzerland, some of or all the power for classifying drugs for distribution rests with the states, provinces, orcantons rather than the national government. For our purposes, it issufficient to note that drug classification is rather uniform throughoutAustralia and Switzerland and, therefore, we categorize these systems asbeing national rather than local. In Canada, since the number of drugclasses and classification decisions varies greatly between provinces, wepresent information on Ontario as well as the national government. 3 As table 2.1 shows, the two-tier system in the United States is unique. Allthe other countries restrict the sale of at least some nonprescription drugsto pharmacies. France, Italy, and the Netherlands do not allow the sale ofany drugs outside pharmacies or drugstores. Although some drugs areavailable for sale outside pharmacies in Denmark, Germany, Sweden, andSwitzerland, this general sale class is quite small. 4 In Australia, Canada (including Ontario), and the United Kingdom, the general sale class islarger than in these 4 countries but smaller than in the United States. The general rationale for restricting the sale of nonprescription drugs is the same in all the countries. Drugs are not typical consumer products.The dangerous aspects to them means they should be treated accordingly.A pharmacist can help provide guidance to patients on the proper use ofthe drugs and, thereby, reduce the possibility of adverse effects. 5 Criteria for Classifying DrugsAll 10 countries and the United States generally use a drug's safety, efficacy, and quality for approving it. Each country then uses relatedcriteria for determining the drug's distribution class. For instance, amongthe criteria the United Kingdom uses when switching a drug fromprescription to pharmacist class is that the medicine has an acceptablemargin of safety during unsupervised use, including safety in overdose orfollowing accidental misdiagnosis. Officials in the United Kingdom also 3There is currently an effort in Canada to harmonize the drug distribution regulations among the provinces. The proposal calls for four classes: prescription, pharmacist, pharmacy, and general sale. 4For instance, in Denmark this class is limited to such items as vitamins, certain medicines for animals, and anthelmintics (that is, medicines for killing or ejecting intestinal worms). 5The origins of restricting drugs to sale in pharmacies dates back hundreds of years. For instance, in Germany between the 14th and 18th centuries pharmacists were given exclusive rights to market drugsand other products such as sugar, spices, liquors, wine, tobacco, coffee, and chocolate in order toensure a livelihood to pharmacists. Over time, the exclusive rights to sell products becameincreasingly limited to medicines. However, the rationale for these restrictions remained the same: toprotect the pharmacies on behalf of the public welfare. In the 17th century, apothecaries were givenexclusive right to sell medicines in Britain. (See Sonnedecker, 1976.) More information on current drugclassification systems is in appendix III. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 25 Chapter 2 Drug Distribution Systems told us that when making classification decisions, they take into account the role that pharmacists are expected to play. Among the criteriaDenmark uses is that the drug should be available by prescription for 2years without problems before it is switched. (A detailed comparison ofthe specific classification criteria was beyond our scope.) An Intermediate Class as a Transition ClassOver the last 15 years, the number of drugs switched from prescription to nonprescription status has increased in the United States. In fact, this is aworldwide trend. Despite arguments for a transition class in the UnitedStates, an intermediate class is not frequently used as a transition class inthe study countries. It is operative only in Australia (and there was somesupport for it by government officials in Ontario and by Canadian nationalpharmacy association officials). In the Australian state of Victoria, after adrug is switched from prescription class to pharmacist class, officialswatch for reports of adverse drug effects (they do not actively track usersof the drug). If reports do not materialize, they consider switching the drugfrom pharmacist to pharmacy class. It is important to emphasize that evenwhen the class is considered a transition class, the goal is not to allow thedrug to be sold outside pharmacies. One Australian official told us that shecould remember only paracetemol (acetaminophen in the United States)being moved into the general sale category. 6 In Canada, although some government and pharmacy officials told us theysupport the general idea of a transition class, the intermediate class is notgenerally used in this manner. Some manufacturers' officials wereconcerned that drugs could get \"stuck\" in a transition class. They said thatibuprofen was switched in the provinces in 1989 out of prescription classinto pharmacist class, where it was supposed to remain for only a shorttime, but it still remains there today, 6 years later. More generally, aCanadian official questioned the idea of whether a transition class wouldallow drugs to be switched from prescription status faster if the datapackage for switching remained the same. Only by altering the packagecould the process be made faster: either fewer or shorter tests would berequired or drugs would have to be switched before the tests werecompleted. The same official raised the issue of the usefulness of the datathat might be gathered through a transition class. There would be nocontrols in the studies. The official thought that because of the lack ofcontrols, the studies would provide little useful information. A U.S. 6Since this conversation, aspirin in 500 mg packages of 16 pills or less (single ingredient only) has been switched to general sale in Australia. The movement of drugs to general sale is also very rare in theUnited Kingdom. However, U.K. officials did speculate that cost considerations might increasemovement in the future. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 26 Chapter 2 Drug Distribution Systems manufacturer echoed this idea and stated that FDA responds to randomized, double-blind studies in which the experimental drugs arecompared to placebos. (In a double-blind medical experiment, neither thepatients nor the persons administering the treatment and recording theresults know which subjects are receiving the drug and which arereceiving the placebo.) This allows the effectiveness and adverse effects tobe accurately assessed. A transition class would not provide this type ofstudy. An official in the United Kingdom stated that, theoretically, newadverse reactions could be found when a drug is switched to a pharmacistor pharmacy class but that, as a practical matter, the adverse-effect profilefor a drug is established by the time a drug is switched. In the other countries we visited, the intermediate classes were not transition but permanent. There was no certainty that the drugs would beassessed for reclassification after a period of time. Thus, little helpfulinformation is available from other countries as to whether or how atransition class might speed the switching of drugs. If a transition class is to play a role in speeding approval of a change from prescription to nonprescription status, it must regularly employ a systemto track adverse effects. Without this information, the class could not aid FDA in assessing a drug for general sale. Tracking studies would help link drug use (or at least purchases) to adverse effects. They could also givesome indication of the pattern of use in the population. Two difficultieswith such a recordkeeping requirement are the time burden it places onpharmacists and the likelihood of increased costs. Preventing AbuseProponents for an intermediate class of nonprescription drugs argue thatlimiting the availability of certain drugs to pharmacies would impedeabuse. For example, the pharmacist would be expected to intervene if acustomer wanted to purchase inordinate amounts of a drug (either at onetime or over a period of time) or if the customer appeared to have nomedical need for it. The class could be used in two ways. First, for drugsbeing switched from prescription to nonprescription status, abuse couldbe studied and a decision made at a later time on appropriateclassification. Second, nonprescription products that were being abusedcould be moved back to the intermediate class for some safeguards. 7 7For example, this issue has been raised in regard to phenylpropanolamine, an appetite suppressant and an ingredient in some weight-reduction products. Various officials raised the issue of youngwomen taking large amounts of these products in attempts to lose weight. Associations between thedrug and bulimia and anorexia have been suggested. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 27 Chapter 2 Drug Distribution Systems The advantage of moving a drug from general sale to an intermediate class is that it would still be available to customers for legitimate uses. Althoughaccess would be restricted to pharmacies, the added impediment of aprescription would not be required. Currently, if access is to be restricted,the drug must be moved to prescription class. 8 The usefulness of an intermediate class to prevent drug abuse has notbeen demonstrated. We identified no studies that addressed the generalissue of using an intermediate class to deter drug abuse. Few governmentand pharmacy officials whom we spoke with in the United States andabroad thought that an intermediate class would be completely successfulin doing so. They agreed that it would be quite easy for an individual whowanted a large amount of a drug simply to visit several pharmacies andbuy what appears to be a reasonable amount in each one, thereby avoidingpotential surveillance. Having to deal with a pharmacist might be animpediment, as would the necessity of visiting several pharmacies;however, it would not be overly difficult to get around the system. The difficulties in using a pharmacist class to prevent abuse can be illustrated by experience in New South Wales, where Australian truckdrivers were taking ephedrine to try to stay awake. At the time, the drugwas restricted to sale by pharmacists. New South Wales officials decidedto move the drug back to prescription status, and eventually the otherAustralian states followed their lead. In this case, since restricting the saleof ephedrine to pharmacists did not prevent abuse, officials thought itnecessary to put tighter controls on the product. Similarly, a study in Germany indicated the difficulty of preventing the sale of nonprescription drugs even when they are restricted to pharmacies(Product Testing Foundation, 1991). Children between the ages of 10 and14 were sent to pharmacies to see how easily they could purchasenonprescription medications containing alcohol. In all 54 pharmacies thechildren visited, they were allowed to purchase the drugs. In only one casewas the purchaser questioned intensively. The consumer association thatdid the study criticized the pharmacists, and the pharmacy associationcalled the results \"lamentable.\" 8This recently occurred in Oregon when the state switched ephedrine (which is used, among other uses, as a nasal decongestant in the treatment of asthma) from nonprescription to prescription status.Oregon investigators had found that large amounts of ephedrine tablets were being sold weekly by afew retailers. The drug was being used in the illegal production of methamphetamine. To deal with theproblem, Oregon officials restricted ephedrine to prescription sale. An intermediate class of drugswould have allowed the drug to remain a nonprescription product but sale would have been limited topharmacies or pharmacists. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 28 Chapter 2 Drug Distribution Systems The Economics of an Intermediate Class ofDrugsMuch of the discussion about the proposed roles for an intermediate drug class has centered on public health issues. For example, a primaryconcern has been the effect of an intermediate class on consumers' abilityto use pharmaceuticals safely and effectively. In addition, an intermediateclass of drugs would also have an economic effect. Establishing apharmacy or pharmacist class could affect the price and availability ofdrugs to consumers and might also alter the revenues or profits of bothmanufacturers and retailers. Drug Expenditures Pharmacy experts in the United States told us that drugs cost less asnonprescription than prescription medicines, although initially thenonprescription cost may be higher than was the prescription price.Ibuprofen is an example. However, the experiences of other countries donot clarify what the economic effect of establishing an intermediate classof drugs would be in the United States. The few studies that have beendone focus on the switching of particular drugs in particular countries.The studies do not generalize beyond the study country and do notattempt to determine the effect of the presence or absence of a pharmacistor pharmacy class. Ryan and Yule (1990), examining the economic benefits of switching loperamide (an antidiarrheal) and topical hydrocortisone from\"prescription only medicines\" to \"pharmacy medicines\" in the UnitedKingdom, found that the costs of obtaining each drug decreased after theproducts were switched. However, in the United Kingdom (and all thestudy countries), prescription drug prices are controlled in some mannerby the government. 9 Nonprescription drug prices generally are not, although some are controlled if the drugs are purchased with aprescription. Therefore, a comparison of drug prices before and after aswitch is not a comparison of two free markets. Because there is no U.S.government price control, a comparison of drug prices in the studycountries before and after switching would not yield useful insights for theUnited States. (Thus, the Ryan and Yule findings do not necessarilyindicate what would occur in the United States if a drug were switched toan intermediate class.) 9For example, in France the government regulates both new product prices and price increases. In Germany and Sweden, the government sets an upper limit on the amount the insurer can pay forgroups of identical or equivalent drugs. In the United Kingdom, the government determines how muchprofit a company is allowed to make from selling medicines to the National Health Service. (See GAO,1994b.) GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 29 Chapter 2 Drug Distribution Systems When Temin (1992) studied the costs and benefits of switching cough-and-cold medicines in the United States, he found that visits todoctors for common colds fell by 110,000 per year (from 4.4 million) from1976 to 1989, coinciding with the switching of the medicines. 10 After ruling out other possibilities, he concluded that the decrease in physicians' visitswas attributable to the switching of these drugs. 11 He estimated this to be a saving of $70 million per year. Although there is thus some evidence of cost savings from switching drugs, the effect of an intermediate class of drugs has not been assessed.Ryan and Yule did not assess what the savings would have been ifloperamide and topical hydrocortisone had been sold outside pharmacies.Temin did not study how the savings would have been different ifcough-and-cold medications had been restricted to sale by pharmacists. 12 Therefore, while the studies do indicate potential savings from switchingdrugs, we cannot use them to assess empirically the relative savings fromdifferent drug distribution systems. Our interviews with officials in the study countries indicated that the cost savings from fewer physicians' visits may not be as great as expected.They said that many patients do not pay the full price for a prescribeddrug. For instance, an insured patient might have only a $5.00 copaymentfor a prescription drug while having to pay the full price for anonprescription product. Patients might thus have an incentive to go todoctors for a prescription. It could be for either a different buttherapeutically equivalent product or the original drug if insurance coversit. The latter has occurred in Denmark with antiulcer medications thatwere switched in 1989. Bytzer, Hansen, and Schaffalitzky de Muckadell(1991) estimated that only 3 percent of the sales of cimetidine andranitidine were made without some medical assessment or control. InGermany, approximately half of nonprescription drug sales are prescribedand reimbursed. 10In 1983, Temin estimated the potential costs and benefits of switching topical hydrocortisone, thiazide diuretics, and oral penicillin. He based his estimates not on empirical data but on a theoreticalexploration of switching. He concluded that there would be clear benefits to switching hydrocortisoneand penicillin but that the net benefit from switching thiazide diuretics would be small. 11The factors he considered and rejected as possible explanations were different definitions of the common cold, decreased incidence of the common cold, decreased number of potential patients, ageneral decrease in visits to physicians, and a relative increase in the cost of visits to physicians. 12It should be clear that neither study was meant to assess the effect of an intermediate drug class; each followed the norm in the country where it was conducted. In the United Kingdom, drugs arenormally switched from \"prescription only medicines\" to \"pharmacy medicines.\" Few drugs have beenswitched to the \"general sale list.\" In the United States, Temin studied the only possible switch to makea drug available for less-restrictive sale, from prescription to general sale. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 30 Chapter 2 Drug Distribution Systems A somewhat similar situation exists in the Netherlands with respect to acetaminophen. This drug can be purchased without a prescription as ageneral pain reliever; however, it is also commonly used as a pain killer forcancer patients and, in fact, is the most prescribed drug in the country.When it is prescribed, it is reimbursable. An official told us that this resultsin consumers being able to get their headache remedy free of charge. Economic Factors The economic effects of an intermediate class of drugs depend on severaldifferent factors and the current literature does not provide acomprehensive analysis of them. A complete treatment of economic issueswas outside our scope. In the remainder of this section, however, webriefly illustrate some of the unresolved economic issues in assessingproposals for an intermediate class of drugs. The economic effect of an intermediate class of drugs would largely depend on how this class were structured and used\u2014that is, whether itwas a transition or a permanent class and, if the latter, whether the drugsin this class were coming largely from the prescription or thenonprescription category. For example, if drugs were moved to pharmacyor pharmacist class from prescription status, then the drug choicesavailable to consumers without a prescription would increase. However, ifdrugs were largely moved to the intermediate class from the general salecategory, then these drugs would be less widely available to consumersbecause fewer retail outlets could sell them (although they would still beavailable without a prescription). A major unresolved question is how the availability of a pharmacist or pharmacy class would affect pharmaceutical prices. Depending on thestructure of the new class, several factors might strengthen or soften itseffect. The following four examples provide an illustrative, but notcomprehensive, list of scenarios that could play out if the United Statesadopted an intermediate class of drugs. The availability of an intermediate class of drugs might prompt a change inmanufacturers' pricing patterns. For example, if the introduction of anintermediate class permitted a drug to be switched from prescriptionstatus, the price might decline. If drugs were switched from general sale to the intermediate class, theywould be available in fewer retail outlets. It is possible that the decrease inthe number of retailers selling these drugs could adversely affect retailcompetition and, as a result, drive up prices. However, the availability of GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 31 Chapter 2 Drug Distribution Systems mail-order pharmacies and other outlets (provided they sold the drugs in the intermediate class), and the likelihood of new pharmacies opening,could mitigate or eliminate this effect. If drugs were moved to the intermediate class from the general salecategory, the greater role of pharmacists might lead to higher prices if acounseling fee were implemented. The effect of an intermediate class of drugs on consumers' out-of-pocketdrug expenses would depend on the behavior of third-party payers such ashealth insurers, which often pay all or most of the cost of prescriptiondrugs but generally do not pay for over-the-counter products. If insurerselected not to reimburse consumers for drugs that were moved fromprescription status to an intermediate class, consumers' out-of-pocketexpenditures would increase. However, if fewer drugs were reimbursed,health insurance costs might decrease and partially or fully offsetconsumers' greater out-of-pocket drug expenditures. An intermediate class of drugs could also produce savings in other health care costs. The cost of obtaining a prescription drug includes not only thecost of the drug itself but also the cost of the visit to a physician. Patientswould be saved the cost of the visit to the physician for a pharmacy- orpharmacist-class drug. 13 While this is potentially true for new prescriptions, cost savings for refilling prescriptions is less clear, sincerefills are often ordered on the telephone. Drug Distribution in the European UnionThe 15 member countries of the European Union are moving toward the creation of a single international market, without barriers to the freemovement of goods, services, persons, or capital. One aspect of this is theharmonization of requirements governing the manufacturing andmarketing of pharmaceuticals.Regulatory authority rests with DirectorateGeneral III \"Industry.\" Section III-E-3 deals with pharmaceutical products.Decisions of the European Union must be approved by a vote of themember countries. EU directives for pharmaceuticals establish the same requirements throughout the European Union, including requirements for advertising,labeling, and wholesale distribution. A 1992 directive \"concerning theclassification for the supply of medicinal products for human use\" 13However, we saw in the previous section that savings from reduced physicians' visits may not be as large as anticipated. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 32 Chapter 2 Drug Distribution Systems establishes criteria for determining whether a drug will be a prescription or nonprescription product.14 Article 3 states that \"Medicinal products shall be subject to medical prescription where they: \u2014are likely to present a danger either directly or indirectly, even when used correctly, if utilized without medical supervision, or \u2014are frequently and to a very wide extent used incorrectly, and as a result are likely to present a direct or indirect danger to human health, or \u2014contain substances or preparations thereof the activity and/or side effects of which require further investigation, or \u2014are normally prescribed by a doctor to be established parenterally.\" The directive goes on to state that \"Medicinal products not subject to prescription shall be those which do not meet the criteria established inArticle 3.\" Despite this directive, the member countries will retain the authority for classifying drugs into prescription and nonprescription classes. Thispower will not be transferred to the European Union. Nonetheless, theexpectation is that because of the EU classification criteria, drugs will be increasingly classified as prescription or nonprescription throughout theunion. It is expected that classification into prescription andnonprescription classes will become harmonized throughout the EuropeanUnion in the next 15 to 20 years. However, the European Union has decided not to impose a particular drug distribution system on the member countries. It will be up to each countryto determine the number and nature of nonprescription drug classes in it.If a country decides that it wants to restrict the sale of nonprescriptiondrugs to pharmacies, this will be allowed. Similarly, if a country wants toallow the sale of some or all nonprescription drugs outside pharmacies, itmay do so. Thus, despite the European Union's developing criteria todistinguish prescription from nonprescription products, member countriescan have more than two drug distribution classes. An EU official with major responsibilities for and involvement in the directive told us that the reason the European Union decided not to 14Directive 92/26/EEC. See Official Journal of the European Communities , April 30, 1992. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 33 Chapter 2 Drug Distribution Systems require a particular drug distribution system was that sufficient evidence did not exist to recommend one system over another. EU officials were not convinced that restricting drug sales to pharmacies was a commercialbarrier to trade. Conversely, they were not convinced that allowing thesale of drugs outside pharmacies would increase health concerns. Wewere told that as long as a country's requirements are the same for bothdomestic and foreign entities, the European Union will accept its drugdistribution system. Drug distribution systems are seen, in part, as a function of tradition. Member countries were unwilling to give up their current systems. Ingeneral, the northern European countries are less restrictive on the sale ofmedications than are the southern countries. The northern countries didnot want to restrict the sale of all nonprescription drugs to pharmacies,while the southern countries did not want to allow their sale outsidepharmacies. In the absence of sound evidence to support one system assuperior to the other, the European Union decided to allow the countriesto determine their own individual systems. While there will be no required changes in the number and type of drug classes in a country, officials in the Netherlands told us that they areplanning to adapt to EU guidelines by moving from a three-tier to a two-tier system. Their plan is to combine the pharmacist and drugstore classes intoone class and allow the drugs to be sold in both locations. It was notedthat some nonprescription drugs currently restricted to sale bypharmacists will be moved back to prescription status. Officials of theNetherlands indicated that they perceived no major, consistent benefitfrom requiring that a large category of nonprescription drugs be availableonly from pharmacists. SummaryProponents of an intermediate class of drugs, as either a fixed or transitionclass, in the United States argue that it would create certain benefits.Evidence supporting this contention is small. No studies have assessed therelative merits of alternative drug distribution systems. All 10 of our studycountries had a pharmacist or pharmacy class of drugs or both, but it wasnot used as a transition class to facilitate the movement of drugs togeneral sale. We also found no evidence that such a class of drugs issuccessful in preventing abuse. At most, it is an impediment. No studieshave assessed whether an intermediate class deters drug abuse andanecdotal evidence suggests that drug abuse is not easily deterred withsuch a class. An additional class would not necessarily reduce drug GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 34 Chapter 2 Drug Distribution Systems expenditures. Physicians' visits might not be reduced as greatly as expected if the drug costs remained reimbursable with a prescription or ifa reimbursable prescription product could be substituted. Finally, theEuropean Union has not found evidence to support the superiority of onedrug distribution system over another and, thus, is not requiring theestablishment of a particular drug distribution system in its membercountries. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 35 Chapter 3 Access to Nonprescription Drugs Proponents of an intermediate drug class argue that access to pharmaceuticals would increase in the United States if an additionalnonprescription drug class, either fixed or transition, were established.Opponents argue that access would decrease. The actual change in accesswould depend on how the intermediate class were used. In general, access would decrease if (1) drugs that are currently available without a prescription were to be moved into the intermediate class or(2) drugs that would have been switched to general sale were insteadplaced into the intermediate class. However, access would increase if (1) drugs that would have been moved back to prescription status were placed in the intermediate category or(2) the effect of an intermediate class were to allow drugs to move into itthat could not be moved into the general sale class. While the number ofoutlets (54,000 pharmacies) selling the product would not change,accessibility would increase because a prescription would not benecessary. Beyond these general observations, it is unclear exactly how access would change. No studies have assessed this issue and, moreover, it would bevery difficult to do so. A complete understanding of how access would beaffected would require assessing a number of factors, including thenumber of drug outlets that would sell the drugs, how the class would beused, and the number and nature of drugs that would be placed in it. Noneof these can be precisely predicted. In this chapter, we report our comparison of access to nonprescription drugs in the United States with that in the study countries. Making thiscomparison helped us understand what the effects of an intermediate classmight be in the United States regardless of whether a fixed or transitionclass were established. We focused on the following three aspects ofaccess: the number of community pharmacies and drugstores in eachcountry, the availability of nonprescription drugs by self-selection, and,more generally, the classification of particular drugs as either prescriptionor nonprescription products. In particular, we answer the followingquestions: 1. How many pharmacies and drugstores are there in each of the study countries and the United States? GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 36 Chapter 3 Access to Nonprescription Drugs 2. In the study countries, can consumers select nonprescription drugs themselves, or must they request such drugs from a pharmacist? 3. How does the classification of the 14 drugs we selected vary between the study countries and the United States? The drugs include a number of pain relievers, antiulcer medications, and allergy medicines (see appendix IV). Their classification varies fromcountry to country, and all have been either switched or mentioned ascandidates for switching in the United States or another country. Privatesector officials in the United States indicated that the 14 are a good list forgetting a general indication of the access to nonprescription drugs in acountry. 1 However, it is not possible to generalize from this list about drug classification in a country\u2014that is, the classification of these drugs doesnot necessarily indicate the overall availability of nonprescription drugs ina country. Instead, the drugs should be viewed as examples of differencesbetween countries. The Access to Pharmacies andDrugstores Number of Pharmacies and DrugstoresThe number of community pharmacies can give some indication of how available intermediate-class drugs would be in the United States. However,there are a number of other drug outlets that could increase theavailability of these products, including government, managed care, andmail-order pharmacies. 2 If these outlets were to sell intermediate class drugs, consumers would not have to go to a community pharmacy topurchase them. However, we cannot be certain that all or any of thesepotential outlets would choose to sell the drugs. Thus, any analysis of howaccessible intermediate class drugs would be is limited by uncertainty overthe number of outlets. 1As our work progressed, we encountered some criticism of the list based on the belief that it should have included a more diverse array of drugs such as antibiotics and muscle relaxants. 2Government pharmacies include those operated by the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Public Health Service (including the Indian Health Service). The importanceof noncommunity pharmacies is illustrated by the fact that one fourth of all prescriptions aredispensed in these outlets. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 37 Chapter 3 Access to Nonprescription Drugs Similarly, any comparison between countries of the number of drug outlets must note that in some countries physicians are permitted todispense drugs where there is no convenient pharmacy. For example, inFrance and Italy physicians are allowed to dispense nonprescription drugsin rural areas where no pharmacy is available. The effect is to increase thenumber of drug outlets for nonprescription drugs and, hence, theiraccessibility. For countries that have more specialized drug outlets thanthe United States, physicians' dispensing would increase the differencebetween the countries while narrowing the difference for countries thathave fewer pharmacies than the United States. If the United States were toallow physicians to dispense intermediate-class drugs where no pharmacywas available, this would also reduce inconvenience but negate onerationale (not having to visit a physician to receive the drug) for such aclass of drugs. To get some indication of how many U.S. outlets would be able to sell these drugs and how similar this is to other countries, we compared thenumber of community pharmacies per capita in the United States with acomparable measure in other countries. We found that the United Stateshas considerably fewer community pharmacies or drugstores per capitathan 6 of the countries. 3 (See table 3.1.) However, only Denmark, with one pharmacy for every 17,500 residents, and Sweden, with one for every10,200 residents, have substantially fewer pharmacies per capita than theUnited States, which has one for every 4,800 residents. The UnitedKingdom, Canada, and Ontario have a similar number per capita to theUnited States. This gives some indication that restricting nonprescriptiondrugs to sale in pharmacies might be more of an inconvenience in theUnited States than it is in 6 of the countries we studied. 3While the Netherlands has fewer pharmacies per capita than the United States and Switzerland has approximately the same, there are also drugstores in these countries that can sell some but not allnonprescription drugs. Taking the pharmacies and drugstores together, there are proportionately moreof these drug outlets in these countries than pharmacies in the United States. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 38 Chapter 3 Access to Nonprescription Drugs Table 3.1: Number of Community Pharmacies and Drugstores in TenCountries, Ontario, and the UnitedStates in 1993-94 Country Pharmacies DrugstoresPharmacies and drugstores per capita Australia 5,000a1:3,600 Canada 6,121a1:4,500 Ontario 2,400a1:4,200 Denmark 297a1:17,500 France 22,377a1:2,600 Italy 15,633a1:3,700 Netherlands 1,500 3,000 1:3,400 Sweden 857a1:10,200 Switzerland 1,500 900 1:2,900 United Kingdom 12,025a1:4,800 United States 53,841b a1:4,800 aNot applicable. bIncludes drug chain, independent, food store, and mass merchant pharmacies. (See Drug Store News for Pharmacists , April 11, 1994.) Accessibility of Community Pharmacies inthe United StatesIf drugs in the intermediate class were to come from the general sale rather than prescription class, change in access to these products woulddepend on not only the number of community pharmacies but also theirdistribution. In some parts of the country, the nearest pharmacy can be100 or more miles away. Even within a city, the number of pharmaciesvaries between neighborhoods, and nonpharmacy drug outlets generallysell fewer products than do pharmacies. Therefore, people with a nearbypharmacy already have an advantage in the number of nonprescriptionproducts readily available to them. Moving drugs from the general saleclass to an intermediate class could make this difference somewhat larger.The number of outlets selling the drugs would decrease, and individualswith easy access to pharmacies would find these drugs readily available tothem while those without accessible pharmacies would not. However, moving drugs from the prescription class to an intermediate class would not change the number of outlets (that is, pharmacies) sellingthem (assuming noncommunity pharmacies chose to sell the products),and, therefore, the difference in access for individuals with readilyavailable pharmacies and those without would remain the same. It would GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 39 Chapter 3 Access to Nonprescription Drugs still be necessary to go to a pharmacy to purchase the drug. The difference would be that a prescription would not be required. Moreover, introducing an intermediate class of drugs in the United States would constitute a large change in nonprescription drug distribution sincethe more than 690,000 nonpharmacy drug outlets would not be allowed tosell these products. Consumers would have to learn that not allnonprescription drugs could be sold in all retail outlets. Individuals whowanted to purchase a drug in the intermediate class would need to knowthat it was necessary to purchase the drug at a pharmacy. This wouldaffect all residents, regardless of location. The Self-Selection of DrugsIn the United States, nonprescription products (except for controlled substances available without a prescription and insulin) are generallyavailable by self-service\u2014that is, consumers can select theirnonprescription products from the shelves personally. Consumers havethe power to choose their own nonprescription drug regimen bycomparing different products on such items as dosing, side-effects, andprice. Of course, if they are in a pharmacy, they can always ask thepharmacist for information or advice. In other countries, self-selection ofpharmaceuticals is limited to certain drug classes or not allowed at all.Table 3.2 summarizes the direct availability of nonprescription drugs toconsumers. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 40 Chapter Access to Nonprescription Drugs Table 3.2: Self-Service for Nonprescription Drugs in TenCountries, Ontario, and the UnitedStates aCountry Pharmacist Pharmacy Drugstore General sale Australia No Varies by stateYes CanadabNocVaries byproduct Yes Ontario No Yes Yes Denmark No France No Germany No Yes Italy No Netherlands No No Sweden Varies byproduct Yes Switzerland No No Yes United Kingdom No Yes United States NodYes aThe table reports on actual availability of drugs by self-service rather than by what the law allows. In some countries, self-service is legally allowed but pharmacy association policy (whichis followed) forbids self-selection. A blank cell indicates the country does not have the indicateddrug class. bAccess to pharmaceuticals is a provincial responsibility in Canada. The federal government indicates whether it believes products should be restricted to sale only in pharmacies or beavailable for general sale. Some provinces do not allow self-selection for some nonprescriptiondrugs sold only in pharmacies. cThis category exists only for controlled substances. dThis category exists only for controlled substances and insulin in some states. The table shows that the ability to choose one's own drugs is limited, except for drugs available outside pharmacies (in countries where this isallowed). Only in Australia, Canada (as determined by the individualprovinces such as Ontario), and Sweden is self-service allowed for someor all pharmacist or pharmacy drugs. If the United States were to follow the general pattern in other countries of not permitting self-service for pharmacist- or pharmacy-class products (asis done for controlled substances available without a prescription andinsulin in some states), purchasing these products would be muchdifferent from purchasing other nonprescription drugs. Consumers wouldnot only be unable to buy the products in outlets such as conveniencestores and gas stations but would also find it more difficult to compare GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 41 Chapter 3 Access to Nonprescription Drugs products if they could not select pharmacist- or pharmacy-class drugs directly from the shelf.4 The Effect of an Intermediate Class onDrug ClassificationOne of the principal benefits cited by proponents of an intermediate class is that the number of products available without a prescription wouldincrease because FDA would have the option of putting drugs in a class that provides for consumer counseling (National Consumers League, 1991). Tosee if there is a pattern of greater nonprescription availability in countriesthat have a pharmacist or pharmacy class, we examined the classificationof 14 drugs in the study countries and the United States. (See appendixesIII and IV.) These drugs have either been switched or mentioned ascandidates for switching in the United States or in another country, butthey are only examples meant to illustrate differences between thecountries. It is not possible to generalize from them to the entire drugclassification system in a country. Our analysis shows only that thepresence or absence of a pharmacist or pharmacy class has no consistenteffect on drug classification. It is unclear what effect establishing anintermediate class in the United States would have on the classification ofdrugs as prescription or nonprescription products. Specific examples illustrate how classification varies between countries. Ibuprofen is available for general sale in the United States but, although itis a nonprescription product in 10 other countries, its distribution islimited to specialized drug outlets in all of them. Naproxen is alsoavailable for general sale in the United States but as a nonprescriptionproduct in only 2 of the 10 countries. For these two drugs, the UnitedStates clearly has the most open system and the lack of an intermediateclass has not prevented their being switched here. In fact, the UnitedStates was among the first to classify ibuprofen (1984) and naproxen(1994) as nonprescription products. However, for other drugs the United States is more restrictive. For the 10 countries studied, only France, Italy, and Sweden, like the United States,do not allow nonprescription sale of the antihistamine terfenadine.Similarly, only Germany, Sweden, and the United States do not allow the 4While some control over the sale of intermediate-class drugs would be necessary if the theoretical benefits of such a class were to be achieved, this would not necessitate prohibiting self-selection forthese drugs. Instead, the requirement could be that the pharmacist would have to consult withconsumers when the purchase was made. This would allow customers to select their own drugs andcompare one with another. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 42 Chapter 3 Access to Nonprescription Drugs nonprescription sale of promethazine, another antihistamine.5 In the seven countries, these drugs are available in either a pharmacist or pharmacyclass; the U.S. system is less open than theirs are. It is unclear whether thetheoretical safeguards associated with a pharmacist or pharmacy classwould be sufficient for regulators to switch these drugs from prescriptionto nonprescription. It is thus unclear whether establishing an intermediate class of drugs in the United States would allow more drugs to be switched, since the UnitedStates already classifies some drugs as nonprescription that othercountries that have a pharmacist or pharmacy class still restrict toprescription class. What is clear is that other factors in addition to orinstead of the existence of a pharmacist or pharmacy class account fordifferences in drug classification between the study countries. An assessment of the relative openness of the current drug distribution system in the United States compared to the other countries studieddepends on one's definition of \"access.\" If access is defined by theavailability of drugs for general sale, the United States appears to have themost open system, since more of the 14 drugs are available for sale outsidepharmacies than in any of the other countries. However, if access isdefined by the availability of drugs for nonprescription sale regardless ofwhere they can be sold, the United States falls somewhere in the middle.Some countries have more of the 14 drugs available without a prescriptionthan the United States does, but others have fewer. SummaryThere is no simple answer to the general question of how access tononprescription drugs would be affected by creating an intermediate classof drugs in the United States. It would depend partly on where drugs in theclass came from. If they were switched from prescription class (as bothfixed- and transition-class proposals emphasize), access could increase,since the drugs would be available without a prescription. But if they wereswitched from general sale (which advocates of a transition class arguewould not occur), access could decrease, since their sale would be limitedto pharmacies. 5In the 1980's, FDA approved promethazine as a nonprescription product. However, in response to comments and a citizens' petition, FDA withdrew its approval. There were allegations that the drugwas connected with Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (often referred to as SIDS). At the time, themanufacturer volunteered to withdraw the drug as a nonprescription product. FDA has not approvedan application to switch terfenadine to nonprescription status because of concern about druginteractions as well as complications for patients with heart or liver disease. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 43 Chapter 3 Access to Nonprescription Drugs Restricting the sale of some nonprescription drugs to pharmacies could be somewhat more inconvenient in the United States than in the 6 studycountries that have substantially more community pharmacies anddrugstores per capita than the United States. In addition, the accessibilityof pharmacies varies greatly between areas in the United States. Peoplewithout ready access to a community pharmacy would be at adisadvantage if they wanted to purchase drugs in the intermediate class.However, this could be partially offset if outlets such as mail-orderpharmacies chose to sell these products. The larger change might be thatpeople would have to adjust to not being able to buy some nonprescriptionmedicines outside pharmacies. All 10 study countries have some restrictions on self-selection of nonprescription drugs. Only the United States allows self-service for allnonprescription products (except for controlled substances availablewithout a prescription and insulin). Other countries restrict consumeraccess to some or all nonprescription products. Thus, on this dimension,consumers in the United States have greater access to nonprescriptiondrugs than do consumers in the other countries. The establishment of anintermediate class could change this. Because the benefits of such a classwould be difficult to achieve without some control on the distribution ofthese drugs in pharmacies, self-selection might not be allowed for them. No clear picture of the effect of a pharmacist or pharmacy class on drug classification decisions emerges from our analysis of 14 drugs. There is noconsistent pattern of greater or lesser nonprescription drug availability asa result of the existence of a pharmacist or pharmacy class. The UnitedStates allows the sale of some drugs without a prescription that manyother countries do not, while the opposite is also true. Whether theestablishment of such a class in the United States would allow more drugsto be moved out of the prescription class is unknown. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 44 Chapter 4 The Practice of Pharmacy Many of the theoretical benefits associated with a pharmacist or pharmacy class of drugs (whether a fixed or transition class) involve improving druguse or, conversely, reducing misuse. The assumption is that pharmacistswill pass on to consumers the information they need to take a drugproperly. Critics of an intermediate class in the United States do notquestion the potential value of pharmacists' relaying information toconsumers but do not believe that it is necessary to have an additionaldrug class to do this. In this chapter, we describe the role pharmacists play in monitoring the use of pharmacist- and pharmacy-class drugs in the study countries. Wefocus on pharmacist practices that would have to be engaged in for a fixedor transition class to be effective. We also report on selected aspects ofpharmacy practice in the United States, including counseling onnonprescription drugs. Specifically, we answer the following questions: 1. Are pharmacists in the 10 countries required by law to counsel consumers on the proper use of nonprescription drugs? 2. What are the legal sanctions for failing to provide counseling?3. What studies show whether pharmacists in the study countries and the United States counsel purchasers of nonprescription drugs, and what isthe quality of that counseling? 4. What are the requirements and practices of pharmacists in monitoring adverse drug reactions and maintaining patient profiles? 5. How might recent developments in the practice of pharmacy affect the counseling behavior of pharmacists in the United States? Counseling Requirements onNonprescriptionDrugsOne reason proponents commonly give for limiting nonprescription drugs to sale in pharmacies (even if no counseling is required) is that it allowscustomers to ask for advice if they want it. Table 4.1 summarizes thecounseling requirements for nonprescription drugs in the 10 studycountries and Ontario. Only in Australia, Denmark, Germany, and Italy arepharmacists required to provide information to patients on the use ofnonprescription drugs. In Australia, these requirements vary by state:some states require counseling on pharmacist class drugs but others donot. For instance, in Victoria, the pharmacist is required to speak with thepatient every time a pharmacist-class drug is sold. In Denmark, Germany, GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 45 Chapter 4 The Practice of Pharmacy and Italy, the pharmacist is required to provide information to patients on their medications; however, there are no specific counseling requirements.In Ontario and the United Kingdom, nothing is required beyond thepharmacists' supervision of sales. In France, the Netherlands, andSwitzerland, pharmacists need merely be physically present on thepremises of the pharmacy. In Sweden, while the pharmacist is expected topromote proper drug usage, there is no requirement that a pharmacist bepresent when a nonprescription drug is sold. There are no nationalcounseling requirements in Canada. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 46 Chapter 4 The Practice of Pharmacy Table 4.1: Pharmacist Counseling Responsibilities for NonprescriptionDrugs in Ten Countries and Ontario Country Pharmacist responsibility Australia Counseling requirements are set by the states. There are no counseling requirements for pharmacy-class drugs. Some states have counselingrequirements for pharmacist-class drugs. For instance, in Victoriapharmacists must \"give appropriate and adequate advice in respect ofdosage, frequency of administration, general toxicity, adverse effects,contra-indications or precautions to be observed in the usage of thatpotent substance\" Canada There are no national counseling requirements Ontario Pharmacists must \"make [the] decision to\" sell a pharmacist-class drug.This is defined the pharmacist \"must be aware of the sale.\" Nocounseling requirements state what specific information must be given tothe consumer Denmark The pharmacist must provide information about pharmaceuticals.

No counseling requirements state what specific informationmust be given to the consumer GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 47 Chapter 4 The Practice of Pharmacy The Enforcement of CounselingRequirementsIn the 6 countries we visited\u2014Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom\u2014and Ontario, there issome enforcement of the requirements for pharmacists sellingnonprescription drugs, but it is somewhat limited. Enforcement issometimes by a professional association and is sometimes focused onphysical aspects of the pharmacy rather than the counseling of patients.The number of inspectors is sometimes small and nonprescription drugscan be less emphasized than prescription products. Counseling requirements are set by the states in Australia. Officials in the state of Victoria told us that enforcement is done primarily through threepharmacy inspectors of the Pharmacy Board of Victoria on the basis ofprofessional standards. One reason for the board's enforcing the lawrather than the state is that the board's standard of proof is less stringent,thereby making it easier to discipline recalcitrant pharmacists. The statestandard of proof, \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" has been replaced by theless strict \"balance of probabilities.\" The pharmacy board brings its casebefore pharmacy representatives who may impose penalties ranging fromletters of admonition and fines to temporary suspension or permanentcancellation of a pharmacist's registration. There are three or foursuspensions or cancellations per year. We were told that generally there isnot a great deal of enforcement in Australia unless there are complaints ordrug abuse concerns. Enforcement of pharmacist requirements is done at the state and regional level in Germany and focuses on the physical aspect of the pharmacyrather than the behavior of pharmacists. Inspectors check such items ascleanliness of the pharmacy, proper storage of medicines, size of thelaboratory, availability of instruments, and orderliness of records. In the Netherlands, the State Public Health Inspectorate supervises all matters relating to the sale of drugs. Pharmacists must give access at anytime to inspectors to examine the pharmacy and everything in it. Ifinspectors find that the pharmacy is not operating in accordance with thelaw, they inform the pharmacist and stipulate a time within which theproblem must be corrected. We were unable to determine the amount ofeffort put forth in identifying violations of counseling requirements fornonprescription products. In Switzerland, each canton has a pharmacist organization that conducts inspections. Inspectors examine the shop and laboratory to determine if GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 48 Chapter 4 The Practice of Pharmacy they are in accordance with regulations. They also check to see if the pharmacist is present when the pharmacy is open, as required by law. In the United Kingdom, pharmacy medicines are to be sold only under the supervision of a pharmacist. This is normally defined as being present,aware of the transaction, and in a position to intervene. Enforcement ofthe law is not by the government but by the Royal Pharmaceutical Societyof Great Britain. The society has 18 pharmacy inspectors and 2 inspectorsfor nonpharmacy drug outlets. This works out to about 650 to 700pharmacies per inspector. We were told that a large number of cases are brought to the attention of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society every year by competitors andconsumers. After the society visits the pharmacy to meet with thepharmacist, it decides whether to handle the case informally or to takeformal evidence. Often it sends only a warning letter. Approximately 15cases a year are prosecuted. Additional cases (6 in 1993) are dealt withthrough the pharmacy code of ethics. However, we were told that thesociety is unlikely to base action on the sale of pharmacy-class drugs (forinstance, selling a pharmacy medicine without appropriate counseling). Overall, Royal Pharmaceutical Society officials thought that a great deal of effort was put into identifying violations of laws and regulationsconcerning purchases of nonprescription drugs. Government officials toldus that enforcement of pharmacy practice requirements is successfulmainly as a deterrent. Pharmacists are aware of the law and try to staywithin it. In Ontario, pharmacists (or an intern) must make the \"decision to sell\" a pharmacist-class drug. This is generally defined as the pharmacist's being\"aware of the sale.\" There is no requirement that pharmacists actuallyspeak with the patients. Enforcement is done by the Ontario College ofPharmacists, a professional and regulatory association. Officials told usthat compliance with the law is minimal. There is no method formonitoring pharmacist interventions other than through consumercomplaints to the college, which are then investigated. We asked pharmacy officials in the countries we did not visit how much effort is put forth in enforcing nonprescription drug counselingrequirements. Officials in France and Denmark told us that \"moderate\"effort is put into enforcing counseling requirements in those countries;Swedish officials said that there is \"some\" effort. In Italy, there are no GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 49 Chapter 4 The Practice of Pharmacy sanctions against pharmacists who do not counsel patients on the use of nonprescription drugs. Officials noted that the enforcement of counseling requirements can be problematic. It is difficult to determine what is or is not appropriatecounseling behavior. Appropriateness needs to be assessed case by case.What appears to be a lack of counseling might reflect a legitimatejudgment by the pharmacist, such as that a particular customer regularlyuses the drug and does not need counseling on it. This makes enforcementof counseling requirements quite difficult. Studies of Pharmacist Counseling onNonprescriptionDrugsVarious academics, consumer groups, and pharmacy associations have conducted studies of the behavior of pharmacists when they sellnonprescription drugs. Typically, participants in a study go to a pharmacyand attempt to purchase a particular nonprescription product or describetheir symptoms (or those of the person for whom they are buying theproduct), seeking advice from the pharmacist on what drug to purchase.Each shopper has been trained by the investigators to act in accordancewith a script developed for the study. The pharmacist's advice is recordedand compared to what the pharmacist should have done according tocriteria determined by a group of experts. We refer to these investigationsas trained shopper studies. Other common study designs are investigators'observation of pharmacists' behavior and pharmacists' completion of aquestionnaire on their counseling activities. Table 4.2 lists the pharmacist counseling studies, their methodologies, and what they assessed. Studies have not been conducted in all the countries.While the studies vary considerably in design and objective, a number ofcommon themes are evident. Despite differences in the law andregulations across countries, counseling is generally incomplete andinfrequent.

Quantity = time spentcounseling, number of counseling events per day, or availability of pharmacist for counseling.Frequency = percentage of patients receiving counseling. Estimates of the frequency of pharmacists' counseling on nonprescription products (that is, the percentage of patients receiving advice) ranged from11.1 percent in Sweden (Marklund, Karlsson, and Bengtsson, 1990) and12.3 percent in Canada (Taylor and Suveges, 1992a) to 93.75 percent inGermany (Product Testing Foundation, 1991). 1 Germany's was by far the highest estimate.2 The second highest, based on self-reports of pharmacists, was 37.6 percent in the United Kingdom for single proprietorpharmacies (Phelan and Jepson, 1980). (The lowest estimate for theUnited Kingdom was 21 percent for chain pharmacies, also found byPhelan and Jepson.) However, even in Germany, the researchers generallythought that too little counseling was being done. In one third of the casesin Germany, only one piece of information was being passed to theconsumer. An Australian study found that the vast majority of pharmacists thought that they should counsel for both prescription and nonprescriptionmedications (Ortiz et al., 1984b). However, pharmacists gave a number ofreasons for not counseling. The three most important were lack of adequate medical histories, lack of feedback from the person counseled, and the belief that counseling may not be necessary. 1The Swedish estimate was based on reports by pharmacy personnel, the Canadian estimate on observation of pharmacists, and the German estimate on a trained shopper study. 2This estimate is somewhat misleading since an unspecified proportion of the shoppers actively requested advice from the pharmacist while the others requested a product but relied on thepharmacist to provide information without the shopper's requesting it. Thus 93.75 percent is anestimate of pharmacist counseling based on active and passive shoppers. It is unclear from the studywhat proportion of shoppers received information without requesting it. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 53 Chapter 4 The Practice of Pharmacy Another reason counseling may not occur is that customers may not want it. In Canada, Taylor and Suveges (1992a) found that 195 of 207 customerswho did not receive advice on a nonprescription product indicated thatthey did not want counseling. The main reasons they gave were that theyhad \"used [the] medicine before with good results\" and \"had alreadyreceived advice elsewhere on what to buy.\" Regarding the quantity of counseling (that is, the availability of pharmacists to counsel, the number of counseling events per day, and thetime spent counseling), a Canadian study found that pharmacistsresponded to requests from patients for advice on nonprescription drugsan average of 2.8 times a day (Poston, Kennedy, and Waruszynski, 1994).The range between pharmacies was from 0.07 to 38.64 counseling eventsper day. A study in Australia found that 23 percent of pharmacistcounseling activities involved OTC medications (Ortiz, Thomas, and Walker, 1989). (This was the second most frequent counseling activitybehind giving advice on prescribed medications.) Patients initiated thecounseling in 259 of 438 cases. In 394 of the cases, counseling took 2minutes or less. The quality of counseling was somewhat mixed. Recommended products and advice (when given) were generally found to be appropriate. Willisonand Muzzin (1992) found that in Canada the quality of advice varied byailment, with patients receiving better advice on less complex problems.For three of four scenarios in which the use of a prescription medicationwas not involved, the percentage of patients receiving totally safe andappropriate advice ranged from 62 to 77 percent. For the fourth scenario,only 17 percent received such advice. In Germany, the Product TestingFoundation (1991) found that pharmacists' explanations tended to beaccurate for preparations requiring special explanations (for instance,appetite suppressants and iron preparations) and that performance hadimproved since 1984. There are also examples of inappropriate advicebeing given. For instance, Goodburn et al. (1991) found that pharmacistsin the United Kingdom gave inappropriate advice for the treatment ofchildhood diarrhea 70 percent of the time. In Germany, Glaeske(1989) found that 61 percent of all nonprescription products sold wereineffective or presented dangers to the uninformed user. In all the countries where studies have been conducted, researchers found that information-gathering and advice were often incomplete (that is, theinformation given was appropriate but not everything that should have GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 54 Chapter 4 The Practice of Pharmacy been covered was discussed). In Australia, Feehan (1981) found a lack of information-gathering on patients' characteristics. For instance, 25 of 43pharmacists were prepared to sell a weight-reduction product withoutchecking on the patient's health or to see whether she was taking othermedications. Glaeske (1989) reported that in Germany no pharmacistasked all the questions considered to be essential. For instance, not onetrained shopper who was a woman was asked if she was pregnant orlactating. Consultation on side effects was unsatisfactory\u2014for example,such simplistic statements as \"every medication has side effects\" and\"there are no side effects\" were sometimes made. In a 1991 study, theConsumers Association (1991) of the United Kingdom found thatcustomers were not adequately questioned. Only 10 percent ofpharmacists asked the trained shoppers what other medications they weretaking. Studies in Australia (Harris et al., 1985), Canada (Willison and Muzzin, 1992), and the United Kingdom (Smith, Salkind, and Jolly, 1990) found awide range of skills and performance between pharmacists. Feehan(1981) in Australia and Willison and Muzzin (1992) in Canada thought thatthis could indicate a shortcoming in pharmacists' education for dealingwith patients and that there is a need to strengthen their clinicalinterviewing skills. Interestingly, Smith, Salkind, and Jolly (1990) in theUnited Kingdom found that pharmacists' counseling was either very goodor very poor. Few pharmacists were in the middle. The studies generally found that pharmacy practice has improved as more and better counseling has been given. This is so when the sameorganization collected the same data at different times (Product TestingFoundation, 1984 and 1991) as well as when the results of different studiesover time were compared (Willison and Muzzin, 1992). The results of studies in the United States of pharmacist counseling on nonprescription drug use are quite similar to the findings in othercountries. However, no studies in the United States have assessed thefrequency of pharmacy counseling on these products. Three studies assessed some aspect of the quantity of counseling. In a mail survey, Carroll and Gagnon (1983) found that 96 percent of householdssaid the pharmacist was available to answer questions aboutnonprescription medications half the time or more. Meade (1992),reporting on a study conducted for APhA , noted that 69 percent of pharmacists said they counsel patients 10 or more times per day on GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 55 Chapter 4 The Practice of Pharmacy nonprescription products, well within the range reported in Canadian pharmacies. Another survey conducted for APhA (Market Facts, 1994) indicates that pharmacist counseling for nonprescription drugs isincreasing. The 1993 National Prescription Buyers Survey found that thepercentage of respondents who had ever asked a pharmacist for adviceabout a nonprescription drug had increased from 37 percent in 1979 to64 percent in 1993. (There was evidence that interactions with pharmacistsfor prescription advice had increased as well.) The other U.S. studies in table 4.2 examined the quality of counseling. In the 1960's and early 1970's, two studies examined pharmacists' counselingregarding nonprescription drugs in U.S. pharmacies (Knapp et al., 1969,and Wertheimer, Shefter, and Cooper, 1973). The conclusions of bothstudies were generally negative. Insufficient inquiries of patients weremade, counseling was infrequent, and inappropriate drugs were sold. 3 Jang, Knapp, and Knapp (1975), while finding some positive aspects ofpharmacists' counseling, also had criticisms, including poor performanceon drug monitoring and controlling OTC drug use. The Wertheimer, Shefter, and Cooper (1973) study was replicated by Vanderveen and colleagues (Vanderveen, Adams, and Sanborn, 1978;Vanderveen and Jirak, 1990). In the 1978 study, the authors concluded thatthe pharmacy \"profession has not made any great strides in the area of OTC product counseling.\" The only question asked by more than one fourth ofthe pharmacists was the age of the child for whom the medicine was beingpurchased. The 1990 study found some improvement, with a majority ofpharmacists asking about both the age of the child and the duration of theillness. However, no other issue was raised by more than half thepharmacists. The general conclusion was that while pharmacists'counseling had improved, it could still be better. Barnett, Nykamp, and Hopkins (1992) found that the majority of pharmacists questioned customers before making OTC recommendations and gave directions on their use. For one scenario, an average of 2.81 outof 5 pertinent questions were asked; for a second, an average of 1.58questions out of 5 were asked. Combining results from the two scenarios,they found that 68.2 percent of product recommendations by pharmacistsyounger than 30 were appropriate while 42.4 percent by pharmacists 30 3Linn and Davis (1973) also studied nonprescription drug counseling in the United States but had a different focus. They found some support for the hypothesis that \"business oriented\" pharmacists weremore likely to recommend medications than were \"professional oriented\" pharmacists. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 56 Chapter 4 The Practice of Pharmacy and older were appropriate. Overall, the authors concluded in 1992 that pharmacists had made strides in OTC counseling since the earlier studies. In a study of pharmacist counseling for prescription drugs in Wisconsin, where there is a requirement that pharmacists provide appropriateconsultation for a prescription, Pitting and Hammel (1983) sent trainedshoppers to 84 pharmacies. (The number of trained shoppers and theselection method for the pharmacies was not given.) They found that61.5 percent of pharmacists did not consult with the patient when aprefabricated drug was dispensed, although 87.5 percent did consult oncompounded products. Thus, even when pharmacists were legallyrequired to counsel patients, not all pharmacists did so. 4 The results of the studies in the United States are rather similar to those incountries where the sale of at least some nonprescription drugs isrestricted to pharmacies. In general, the theory of pharmacy practicediverges from the reality. The advice of pharmacists is often appropriatebut not universally given. In addition, it is often incomplete, with littleinformation being given to customers on such items as possible sideeffects. In other words, what information is given is accurate, but notenough was passed on to consumers. Researchers consistently found alack of information-gathering on the part of pharmacists. For instance,information is often not gathered on symptoms and other medications.More positively, within a range of pharmacists' behavior, manypharmacists do a good job. In addition pharmacists' performance, whilestill often deficient, has improved over time. Activities of Pharmacists Reporting Adverse Drug ReactionsOne argument for an intermediate class of drugs is that pharmacists would be in a position to monitor patients for adverse drug reactions tomedications in this class. In the case of a transition class, this informationcould be passed on to FDA and aid in its decision whether to allow the sale of a drug outside pharmacies. However, in Italy and the United Kingdom, 4The authors speculated that their overall estimates of counseling might be high because (1) the prescription mix was dominated by prefabricated dosage forms for which a low rate of appropriateconsultation was observed, (2) the prescriptions in the study were all new prescriptions and theconsultation rate is probably lower for renewals (counseling is required for both new prescriptionsand renewals), and (3) most prescriptions contain more specific instructions to the patient than thosein this study and specific instructions would seem less likely to stimulate the pharmacist to consult. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 57 Chapter 4 The Practice of Pharmacy adverse drug reaction reports from pharmacists are not accepted. In the other countries, reports from pharmacists are accepted but not required.This is the same as in the United States. Government, pharmacy, andmanufacturers' officials stated that pharmacists rarely submit adversedrug reaction reports. Thus, the experiences of the 10 other countries donot allow us to assess the benefits from or costs of requiring pharmaciststo report adverse drug reactions. However, there is some limited information from the United States that suggests that community pharmacists can, at least in some situations,successfully monitor patients for adverse drug reactions. Meade (1994aand b) gives examples of pharmacists who have successfully done this.She reported on a pharmacist in Minnesota who, through consultationwith a patient, detected that a prescription drug was causing the patientdizziness, chest pain, and swelling and tingling in the hands. When theprescribing physician took the patient off the drug, the symptomsdisappeared. Meade also reported on a pharmacist in Tennessee whodiscovered from a patient's reaction to a prescribed drug that the patienthad diabetes. Maintaining Patient ProfilesOne potential role for pharmacists is to record prescription and nonprescription drug sales in patient profiles. This information could helplink drug use with adverse drug reactions and other complications. Otheruses for profiles would be prospective. For instance, a patient profilecould alert a pharmacist to medical conditions that might be affected by aprescribed drug's side effects. The pharmacist could alert the physician tothe problem and, if it were appropriate, the physician or pharmacist couldselect a different drug without these side effects. Similarly, a profile couldalert the pharmacist to possible adverse interactions with other drugs thata patient was currently taking. It is not possible to judge the usefulness of such a procedure for nonprescription products. Only in Australia are pharmacists ever requiredto include nonprescription drug use in patient profiles. 5 These requirements are determined by the individual Australian states and existonly in certain states and for particular pharmacist-class drugs. The drugsfor which sales must be recorded vary from state to state. There are norequirements in any of the states for recording sales of pharmacy-classdrugs or drugs available outside pharmacies. Officials in Victoria told us 5As we show in chapter 5, a similar recordkeeping requirement exists for some prescription drugs that pharmacists themselves can prescribe in Florida. The experience has been that patients' profiles arenot adequately maintained. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 58 Chapter 4 The Practice of Pharmacy that there has been some difficulty in getting pharmacists to comply with recording requirements. They attributed this to the requirements' coveringtoo many drugs and, consequently, they have reduced the list ofnonprescription drugs for which the sale must be recorded to those forwhich they believe recording is most important. The situation in Victoria is similar to one in the state of Washington in the United States for prescription drugs. Washington has mandatoryregulations governing pharmacy practice that include a requirement thatpharmacists maintain and use patient profiles. In a trained shopper study,Campbell et al. (1989) found that 67 percent maintained these profiles.While this was an increase from 54 percent in 1974 (when the law wasenacted), it was considerably below the law's 100 percent. The authorsspeculated that it was doubtful that maintaining and using patient profileswas significantly greater in Washington than it was in states that did nothave the same requirements. In 1987, the National Association of Retail Druggists surveyed pharmacists through the NARD Newsletter (The NARD Survey, 1988). More than 1,300 pharmacists responded.6 While 92 percent of the pharmacists reported that they maintain patient profiles, only 15 percent said that they record OTC drug sales in them. Officials' Views The views of many of the government officials in the countries we visited(Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the UnitedKingdom) were consistent with the results of the studies discussed above.There was agreement that pharmacists have done a rather poor job ofpassing their knowledge on to consumers. Many officials questioned thefrequency of pharmacists' counseling and thought that not enoughcounseling was being done. Pharmacists were selling drugs and providinglittle or no advice on their use. Officials gave several possible explanationsfor this, including time constraints and a lack of counseling skills. Nonetheless, the officials thought that pharmacists had the potential to improve drug use if they passed their knowledge on to patients. There wasgeneral agreement that pharmacists are knowledgeable and have a greatdeal to offer patients on the proper use of medications. This position washeld even by those who opposed or questioned the usefulness of 6The number of pharmacists who were sent the survey was not reported. It is possible that there is a selection bias problem in this study\u2014that is, the pharmacists who responded to the survey might notbe representative of all pharmacists. Those who responded could be among the more or less activepharmacists. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 59 Chapter 4 The Practice of Pharmacy restricting the sale of some nonprescription drugs to pharmacies. Pharmacists could ask key questions about other drugs a patient iscurrently taking and about underlying medical conditions and couldmonitor compliance and report adverse drug reactions. Professional pharmacist associations in these countries are taking criticisms seriously, and many have initiated various programs to addressthem. They have instituted continuing education courses to givepharmacists the skills necessary to better perform their counseling role. Anumber of officials noted that pharmacy education has changed a greatdeal in the past 10 or so years. There is currently more of an emphasis onclinical pharmacy with its focus on patient service. Pharmacists whoreceived their training before this change are often described as not havingthe \"people skills\" to be good counselors. Recent Developments in Pharmacy PracticeIn this section, we briefly describe some recent developments in the practice of pharmacy that are relevant to our assessment of anintermediate class of drugs. Our purpose is not to evaluate these changesbut to make the reader aware of them. Pharmaceutical Care The idea of pharmaceutical care constitutes a major change in the practiceof pharmacy. It moves pharmacists away from their traditional role ofdispensing drug products and involves them more in selecting andmonitoring drug therapies. The idea has been advocated in the UnitedStates by academics in university-based pharmacy schools and pharmacyorganizations and has spread to other countries (the initiatives mentionedabove have often been undertaken under the name of pharmaceuticalcare). Hepler defined pharmaceutical care as \"the responsible provision ofdrug therapy for the purpose of achieving definite outcomes that increasea patient's quality of life\" (1991, pp. 141-42). It involves \"designing,implementing, and monitoring a therapeutic plan, in cooperation with thepatient and other health professionals, that will produce specifictherapeutic outcomes\" (Klein-Schwartz and Hoopes, 1993, p. 11). The proponents of pharmaceutical care point to various studies (most of them in institutional settings where complete patient information exists)that show the benefits that pharmacists can have on health care. Forinstance, one hospital study showed shorter length of stay, smaller totalcost per admission, and smaller pharmacy cost per admission for patientswho received either of two programs involving pharmaceutical care GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 60 Chapter 4 The Practice of Pharmacy (Clapham et al., 1988).6 In another study, elderly apartment residents were instructed in drug use and given access to drug counseling by pharmacists(Hammarlund, Ostrom, and Kethley, 1985). After 1 year, the residents whoinitially had the greatest number of medication problems (and wereavailable for follow-up interviews) were found to have had an 11-percentdecrease in the number of prescriptions taken and a 39-percent decreasein the number of medication problems. There is some evidence of the value of pharmaceutical care in community pharmacies. McKenney et al. (1973) examined the effect of a clinicalpharmacist's counseling hypertensive patients in three communitypharmacies. Throughout the study, the pharmacist maintained closecontact with the patients' physicians. The patients who received thecounseling were more likely than those who did not receive it to show anincreased knowledge of hypertension and its treatment, comply moreoften with their prescribed therapy, and maintain their blood pressurewithin the normal range. In a later study, pharmacists in six communitypharmacies in Virginia were trained to provide similar services (McKenneyet al., 1978). Results showed improved compliance and better bloodpressure control in patients receiving counseling than in those notreceiving it. Pharmacists also detected 38 instances of adverse drugreactions. Rupp (1992) estimated the value of community pharmacists intervening to correct prescribing errors. Of 33,011 prescriptions that were examined,623 (1.9 percent) were found to be problematic. The estimated value ofthese interventions was $76,615. 7 Nichols et al. (1992) examined the effect of counseling on nonprescription drug purchasing decisions. They foundthat 25.4 percent of patients purchased a different product than they hadintended after receiving counseling, 13.4 percent did not purchase a drug,and 1.3 percent were referred to their physician. However, the study didnot measure the importance of these decisions (for instance, how much ofan improvement was brought by changing medications). More research is being conducted on the effect of pharmaceutical care in community pharmacies. Studies are focusing on the effect of drug usereviews by pharmacists, the use of protocols by pharmacists in managingand monitoring diseases, and a pharmaceutical care program for pediatric 6The two programs were (1) pharmacist monitoring of drug therapy in the patient-care area and (2) centralized pharmacist monitoring of computerized patient profiles. 7These projected savings include only the estimated direct costs of medical care that was avoided because of the pharmacists' intervention. Such items as losses in patient productivity, pain andsuffering cost, and the value of possible litigation were not estimated. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 61 Chapter 4 The Practice of Pharmacy and adolescent patients with asthma. In addition, there appears to be at least some movement among community pharmacists to implementpharmaceutical care. Training courses are offered on how to implementpharmaceutical care (Martin, 1994) and articles have been written onpharmacies where it has been established (Meade, 1994a and b). For our purposes, it is important to note that the methods and goals of pharmaceutical care are consistent with those of an intermediate drugclass. The general idea of both is that pharmacists would be more involvedin a patient's drug therapy by such actions as consulting with patients. Theevaluation of pharmaceutical care in community pharmacies would givesome indication of the potential value of a greater role for pharmacistsand, consequently, would provide some information on the value of anintermediate class of drugs. However, even if a positive value wereestablished, or at least indicated, a number of the difficulties we haveidentified in this report would still have to be addressed. Fornonprescription drugs, pharmacists would need to counsel patients,monitor and report adverse drug reactions, refer patients to physicianswhen necessary, and perform many other activities. This has not been thenorm. Other issues would also need to be addressed. For instance, pharmaceutical care can take a great deal of time. Pharmacists wouldprobably have to delegate more responsibility to technicians. Theappropriate role for technicians would have to be determined.Pharmacists' compensation for pharmaceutical care activities may beespecially important. Many pharmacies now charge a fee forpharmaceutical care services. (Some pharmacies have different feesdepending on the level of services offered.) However, some insurancecompanies have been reluctant to pay for the services (Martin, 1994). It should be clear that pharmaceutical care regarding nonprescription drugs can be given without an intermediate class of drugs. When and ifpharmaceutical care is established in community pharmacies, the need foran intermediate class will still need to be established. It will still be unclearwhat benefits would accrue from establishing such a class of drugs.Arguments such as we hear now will still be heard (for instance, moredrugs would be switched and health care costs would be reduced). Thedifference would be that, at least in some areas, pharmacists would bedoing what is necessary for an intermediate-drug class to be successful.How much, if anything, would be gained by establishing an intermediateclass of drugs, even under these circumstances, is unclear. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 62 Chapter 4 The Practice of Pharmacy Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990Within the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 are new requirements for the practice of pharmacy that went into effect onJanuary 1, 1993, and that mandate prospective drug use reviews,counseling of patients, and maintenance of patient profiles for Medicaidrecipients. Although these requirements cover only Medicaid beneficiaries,most (44) state boards of pharmacy have extended them to cover otherpatients receiving prescriptions. The goal, of course, is to improve healthcare through helping patients understand and follow medication directionsbetter. Success is being evaluated by several studies funded by the HealthCare Financing Administration. The applicable regulations require prospective drug use reviews before each Medicaid prescription is filled. Prescriptions are to be screened forpotential problems from therapeutic duplication, drug-diseaseinteractions, drug-drug interactions, incorrect dosage or duration oftreatment, drug-allergy interactions, and clinical abuse or misuse. Thepharmacist is to intervene, if necessary, before the prescription isdispensed. Additionally, in drug use reviews pharmacists must offer to counsel patients about their prescription medications. Exact counselingrequirements are defined by each state. Information that might be passedon includes the name and description of the medication, the dosage,special directions and precautions, common severe side or adverse effects,interactions, therapeutic contraindications, and proper storage.Pharmacists must also make a \"reasonable effort\" to obtain, record, andmaintain at least the following information: the patient's name, address, telephone number, date of birth or age, andgender; the patient's individual history, where significant, including disease states,known allergies and drug reactions, and a comprehensive list ofmedications and relevant devices; the pharmacist's comments relevant to the patient's drug therapy. The reaction of practicing pharmacists to the new requirements has been mixed. Some see it as an opportunity while others are wary. While the lawrequires pharmacists to perform additional duties, it does not stipulatethat they should be compensated for them, despite some pharmacies'having had to hire new employees and buy new computer software.Pharmacists are also concerned that lawsuits against them will increase. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 63 Chapter 4 The Practice of Pharmacy A 1994 survey conducted for the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy found that only 38 percent of all customers stated that someonein the pharmacy offered to have a pharmacist discuss their prescriptionmedications with them. The president of the association stated that theresults \"clearly indicate that too few patients and caregivers are beingcounseled on their prescription medications.\" However, the same studyfound that pharmacist counseling is perceived positively by the public.Seventy-one percent of offers to counsel were accepted, and the samepercentage of patients thought that counseling was very important. Thecounseling that was done also appears to have been of a high quality, with99 percent of respondents believing that the pharmacist had clearlypresented the information and with pharmacists telling patients how andhow often to use their medications at least 93 percent of the time. A largemajority of patients were also told the dosage amount, the name (alongwith a description) of the medication, how long it should be taken, specialdirections or precautions, and any side effects. However, less than half ofthe pharmacists told patients how to monitor the effects of theirmedications and what they should do in the event of a missed dose. Liability Pharmacists' liability is becoming a concern throughout the United States.8 Data from the Chicago Insurance Company show that claims againstpharmacists rose 22 percent from 1987 to 1990. Recent court rulings haveexpanded a pharmacist's liability under some circumstances. Pharmacistsin some states may now be held liable if they fail to instruct a patientabout the maximum safe dosage or fail to identify a potential adverse druginteraction for a prescribed drug. (Chapter 5 discusses pharmacists'liability in prescribing drugs in Florida.) A 1994 ruling by an Arizona appellate court also indicates that pharmacists' liability might be increasing. According to one source, amajority of court decisions involving pharmacy liability between 1986 and1994 had concluded that pharmacists generally did not have aresponsibility to warn patients of potential adverse effects of their drugregimen. However, in Lasley v. Shrake (880 P.2d 1129 (1994)), the appellate court ruled that pharmacists have a general duty of \"reasonablecare\" that could include a duty to warn. The case was sent back to the trialcourt to determine what constitutes reasonable care. 8Liability was not a concern to officials in other countries where there is a general lack of litigiousness compared to the United States. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 64 Chapter 4 The Practice of Pharmacy In addition, some pharmacists have speculated that requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 will also increase pharmacists'potential liability, as could pharmaceutical care. SummaryThe success of an intermediate class of drugs, whether a fixed ortransition class, depends in part on the role of pharmacists in the drugdistribution system. The theory of pharmacy practice diverges from thereality. In all 10 study countries, pharmacists are expected to play a role(although the role varies between countries) in ensuring the proper use ofdrugs in a pharmacist or pharmacy class. Despite these requirements,pharmacists' counseling of patients, although increasing, is not as frequentand complete as it should be. Our findings for the United States aresimilar. Pharmacists in the study countries are not required (or not allowed) to report adverse drug reactions. In only one instance are they required torecord the sale of nonprescription drugs in patient profiles. Thus, in thesecountries, nonprescription drug sales are limited to pharmacists orpharmacies in order to restrict distribution or promote counseling, not toincrease surveillance of nonprescription drug use. Our findings indicate the difficulty of successfully establishing an intermediate class of drugs. Active pharmacist involvement is necessaryfor an intermediate class to serve its purpose of improving drug use.However, pharmacists will not necessarily counsel patients simplybecause it is expected or required, and enforcing such requirements isquite difficult. Also, it is unclear whether requiring pharmacists tomaintain patient profiles and monitor adverse drug effects would succeed.There is little international experience in these matters. Recent developments in pharmacy practice in the United States indicate that the role of community pharmacists may be changing. Theimplementation of pharmaceutical care and the counseling requirementsof the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 are beginning to movepharmacists from their traditional role of dispensing medications to one ofmonitoring their patients' drug therapies. The activities involved aresimilar to those that would be required for the theoretical benefits of anintermediate class to be achieved. However, even if pharmacists begin toregularly perform these activities, there will still be reason to determinethe need for establishing such a class of drugs. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 65 Chapter 5 The U.S. Experience While the United States has essentially only two classes of drugs (prescription and general sale, the latter commonly referred to as OTCs), there are situations in which a pharmacist may supply a prescription drugto a patient without a physician's prescription and instances in whichnonprescription drugs are not available for general sale. These includedispensing a small number of controlled substances (for instance,particular amounts of codeine) regulated under the Controlled SubstancesAct (Public Law 91-513, title II) and insulin. Similarly, in Floridapharmacists have been given the independent authority to dispense alimited number of prescription drugs without a doctor's prescription.Federal law requires that prescriptions be dispensed by \"practitioners\" butallows individual states to determine who is a \"practitioner.\" In Florida,this group includes pharmacists. Finally, in some states pharmacists havebeen given dependent prescribing authority\u2014that is, they may prescribeunder the supervision of a physician. In this chapter, we describe thesesituations. The lessons that can be learned from them are relevant for botha fixed and transition class since, as with an intermediate class,pharmacists are expected to do more than simply dispense medications. Schedule V Controlled Substances andInsulinUnder the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, the manufacturing, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances (that is, psychoactivedrugs) is regulated. The act's purpose, among other things, is to preventdrug abuse and dependence and strengthen law enforcement authority inthe field of drug abuse. These drugs are placed into one of five categories(referred to as schedules) based on three criteria: currently acceptedmedical use, abuse potential, and human safety. Schedule V drugs have thefewest restrictions and may be made available by FDA without a prescription. They are defined as drugs having a low abuse potentialrelative to drugs or other substances in schedule IV, having a currentlyaccepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and leading tolimited physical or psychological dependence when abused relative todrugs or other substances in schedule IV. Schedule V drugs are classified as prescription or nonprescription products as determined under the Durham-Humphrey Amendment to theFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938. Some schedule V drugsclassified as nonprescription under this act are available without aprescription in some states but not all. However, even when a prescriptionis not required, schedule V drugs are still available only from a pharmacist.Schedule V products are few. They are the narcotic buprenorphine, thestimulant pyrovalerone, and products containing specific amounts of the GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 66 Chapter 5 The U.S. Experience narcotics codeine, dihydrocodeine, ethylmorphine, diphenoxylate with atropine sulfate, opium, or difenoxin with atropine sulfate. Larger doses ofthese products (when available) are in a more restricted schedule. Sellers of schedule V products must follow federal and state requirements. For instance, in Connecticut the seller must keep a record containing \"thefull name and address of the person purchasing the medicinal preparation,in the handwriting of the purchaser, the name and quantity of thepreparation sold and the time and date of sale.\" Federal regulations statemore generally that the purchaser must be 18 years old or older andfurnish suitable identification and that all transactions must be recordedby the dispensing pharmacist. While one purpose of the Controlled Substances Act is to improve public health, the requirements for selling a product differ from what is typicallydiscussed for an intermediate class of drugs. Under the act, the focus is onrecordkeeping; in an intermediate class of drugs, activities such ascounseling and monitoring patients would be stressed. Nonetheless, thetwo are somewhat similar in that the pharmacist is involved in the sale andthat reducing drug abuse is a goal. Any information on how successful theestablishment of schedule V has been in reducing drug abuse would behelpful in evaluating the potential value of an intermediate class of drugs. However, we were unable to locate any studies evaluating the usefulness of schedule V in preventing abuse or monitoring the use of the products. 1 Therefore, while it would be useful to know how successful schedule Vhas been, we have no data with which to find out. Insulin is also available without a prescription but restricted to dispensing by pharmacists in most states. 2 However, a physician must first determine the patient's insulin needs and provide instructions for controllingdiabetes. As with schedule V products, we located no studies thatevaluated the effect of this restriction. 1In an earlier study, we reported on state prescription drug monitoring programs. While 11 states had programs, schedule V drugs were not covered in any of them (GAO, 1992). 2In the other states, insulin either is restricted to prescription sale or may be sold without a prescription by any retailer. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 67 Chapter 5 The U.S. Experience The Florida Pharmacist Self-CareConsultant LawThe Florida Pharmacist Self-Care Consultant Law (sometimes referred to as the Florida Pharmacist Prescribing Law), which went into effect onOctober 1, 1985, is unique in the United States. It allows pharmacists toindependently prescribe specific categories of medications that underfederal law may be dispensed only upon the prescription of a licensedpractitioner; in Florida, this includes pharmacists. Perhaps the mostimportant point about the law is that pharmacists are able toindependently prescribe medicines\u2014that is, they are not operating underthe supervision of a physician. 3 Despite this independence, the law does limit what pharmacists can do.Pharmacists are not allowed to order injectable products, treat a pregnantpatient or nursing mother, order more than a 34-day supply of the drug,prescribe refills unless specifically authorized to do so in the formulary, ororder and dispense anyplace but in a pharmacy. 4 Pharmacists recommending a drug must advise patients to see a physician if theircondition does not improve at the end of the drug regimen. When the law went into effect, there were 35 drugs in the formulary. Since then, 7 drugs have been added, bringing the total to 42. Responsibility forthe original list, as well as for adding and deleting drugs, rests with aseven-member committee. 5 The law states that any drug sold as an OTC product under federal law may not be included in the formulary. Amongthe categories of drugs in the formulary are oral analgesics, antinauseapreparations, and antihistamines and decongestants. Under the law, pharmacists are not required to perform the prescribing role. However, if they choose to do so, a number of requirements pertain,including the labeling of products, creating prescriptions, and maintainingpatients' profiles. (More detail on the products in the formulary and therequirements for pharmacists is in appendix V.) Evaluation In 1990, a group of researchers from the College of Pharmacy at theUniversity of Florida reported on the effect of Florida's Pharmacist 3In some states, other health professionals (physicians' assistants, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists) may prescribe medications but only under protocols established by supervisoryphysicians. (These situations for pharmacists are described later in this chapter.) 4The formulary is the list of drugs pharmacists are allowed to prescribe and the conditions under which they may be prescribed. 5The committee consists of two members of the Board of Medicine, one member of the Board of Osteopathic Medicine, three members of the Board of Pharmacy, and one additional person with abackground in health care or pharmacology. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 68 Chapter 5 The U.S. Experience Self-Care Consultant Law during its second and third years of operation (Eng et al., 1990). Four methods were used in the study: a survey ofpharmacists, pharmacy audits, shopper visits, and a survey of consumers.The following four subsections summarize the results that are mostrelevant to our report. Survey of Pharmacists In a mail survey of pharmacists, Eng and colleagues found thatpharmacists infrequently prescribed drugs from the formulary.Thirty-three percent of community pharmacists had prescribed a drug atleast once. Of this group, 60 percent had prescribed less than one drug permonth. The principal reasons given for not prescribing were that drugs inthe formulary offered no advantages over nonprescription drugs,prescribing increased the risk of liability, and time was too short.Conversely, the main reasons for prescribing were that it helped thepatient maximize self-care, used the pharmacist's knowledge, and savedthe patient money. No differences were found between the prescribers and nonprescribers with respect to gender, professional degree, position (for instance,prescription department manager and pharmacy owner), and prescriptionvolume. The study authors did find that pharmacists with fewer years ofpractice were more likely to prescribe than those with more years ofpractice, and independent community pharmacists were more likely toprescribe than chain pharmacists. Pharmacy Audits The law requires that if a pharmacist prescribes a drug, the pharmacy mustmaintain a profile of the patient. Of 19 pharmacies that reported that theirpharmacists prescribed drugs, only 9 maintained the required profiles. Theaudits showed that pharmacists' prescriptions made up a small proportionof the total number of prescriptions: less than 0.25 percent of all themedications that were prescribed in the 9 pharmacies. These prescriptionswere primarily limited to topical pediculicides (lindane shampoo), oralanalgesics, and otic (ear) analgesics. These categories constituted82 percent of all pharmacists' prescriptions. Shoppers' Visits Trained shoppers found that the quality of the pharmacists' performancein 21 community pharmacies was high in two areas: (1) following the law'slabeling and quantity limitation requirements and (2) practicing the art ofcommunication. In more than 70 percent of the cases, the shoppers foundthat the pharmacist was friendly, provided some privacy, and appeared tobe interested. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 69 Chapter 5 The U.S. Experience However, the pharmacists spent very little time in assessing and responding to medical complaints presented by patients. Less than17 percent of the 62 pharmacists asked about chronic medical conditions,medication allergies, and current prescription and nonprescription drugsthat the patients were taking. Only 5 percent of the pharmacists askedabout the onset, duration, and frequency of the medical problem while13 percent asked if they had tried other medications. In less than40 percent of the visits, pharmacists provided information on topics suchas the number of doses to be taken per day, the duration of the treatment,and side effects. The authors noted that when counseling was provided,the information was generally accurate but incomplete. The performance of the 21 pharmacists in three scenarios was mixed. In a scenario leading to the recommendation of an OTC product, all 21 pharmacists recommended the correct product. However, for a scenariothat should have led to referral to a physician, only 1 pharmacist made thereferral. In a scenario leading to the pharmacist's prescribing a product,the patient asked for a specific shampoo that was in the formulary; only 5pharmacists prescribed it. The four reasons given for not prescribing werethat liability insurance did not cover the pharmacist's prescribing, it isagainst company policy to prescribe, a prescription is needed, and theparticular pharmacist does not prescribe. Consumer Survey Consumers in the pharmacies were surveyed to determine their attitudestoward receiving advice from pharmacists. 6 Three principal reasons were given for seeking advice from pharmacists: confidence in their abilities,convenience, and the problem's not being serious enough to consult aphysician. All 149 of the patients who answered the question on howpleased they were with the pharmacist's actions indicated that they weresatisfied. Ninety percent of consumers said that they would follow thepharmacists' advice regarding seeing their physician or taking arecommended OTC product or pharmacist prescribed drug. A small majority (52.3 percent) also indicated a willingness to pay a fee for apharmacist's services if a drug were prescribed by the pharmacist but notif the pharmacist only provided advice, recommended a nonprescriptionproduct, or referred the patient to a doctor. Of those willing to pay aseparate fee, one third were willing to pay more than $5.00. 6The pharmacists selected the customers to be surveyed. Of 362 surveys distributed by the pharmacists, 163 were returned. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 70 Chapter 5 The U.S. Experience Officials' Assessment of the Effect of the LawOfficials we met with in Florida invariably thought that the effect of the law had been minimal because few pharmacists were using theirprescribing authority. One official who had previously done pharmacyinspections in Florida estimated that 1 in 50 pharmacists actuallyprescribed drugs. The officials' reasons for the lack of prescribing mirrored those given by the pharmacists themselves. The first involved the drugs in the formulary.There is a belief that the drug categories available to the pharmacists andthe specific drugs in them are not very useful because some OTC products work just as well. Therefore, there is no incentive for a pharmacist to useone of the drugs in the formulary to treat patients. 7 The second explanation involved the liability issue. Individual pharmacistswere concerned that they would increase their liability risk if theyprescribed. Insurance companies did not want to insure individuals whoprescribed drugs. The policies of some pharmacists who prescribed werecanceled while others had riders attached. At one point, there was aninsurance surcharge if a pharmacist wanted to prescribe. The third common reason given for pharmacists' not prescribing was the presence of time constraints. As shown in appendix V, a number ofrecordkeeping requirements are associated with prescribing a drug. Theytake time (one official estimated 10 minutes per prescription). One officialtied the recordkeeping requirements to the liability issue, noting that thepaperwork involved with prescribing brings pharmacists into the spotlightand makes them more fearful of liability. Comparisons With Studies in Other CountriesIn chapter 4, we discussed the practice of pharmacy in the study countries, including reports on pharmacists' counseling on nonprescription drugs.The experiences in Florida are generally similar to those in the othercountries. For example, Florida is similar to Australia\u2014the one countrywhere pharmacists are ever required to maintain patient profiles onnonprescription drug use\u2014in that pharmacists often did not maintain therequired profiles. Recordkeeping requirements were seen in both places asbeing excessive. In Florida, this was attributed to the requirements taking 7In addition, a number of the drugs were switched to nonprescription status at the national level soon after the development of the Florida formulary, thereby limiting pharmacists' prescription authority(since no drug sold OTC under federal law may be included in the formulary). Moreover, some of theproducts were available at lower doses without a prescription, which could lessen the incentive forpharmacists to prescribe. Thirteen of the drugs fell into one of these categories within 3 years of thelaw's going into effect. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 71 Chapter 5 The U.S. Experience too much time, while in Australia the requirements were viewed as covering too many drugs. Similarly, in counseling their patients, pharmacists in other countries and Florida did not gather sufficient information from them on such items asmedical conditions and other medications being taken. In many cases,counseling was more incomplete than inappropriate. Consumers' views toward pharmacist counseling were also quite similar. Customers in Florida were generally positive toward pharmacists'counseling, but they were less willing to pay for advice from pharmacists ifonly a nonprescription drug was involved. A study in Canada also foundthat most customers did not want advice on nonprescription drugs. Pharmacists as DependentPrescribersWhile pharmacists in Florida have been given independent (although limited) prescribing authority, some pharmacists elsewhere in the UnitedStates have been given dependent prescribing authority. Typically, thepharmacists are constrained by protocols established by supervisoryphysicians. Dependent prescribing has not normally been discussed interms of an intermediate class of drugs, but it does indicate roles thatpharmacists have played in addition to the traditional one of dispensingmedications. Because these activities are outside the scope of this report,we do not evaluate them here. Instead, we only describe alternative rolesthat pharmacists sometime have in the United States. Pharmacists in the Indian Health Service and theVeterans AdministrationThe Indian Health Service ( IHS), part of the U.S. Public Health Service in the Department of Health and Human Services, provides health services toAmerican Indians and Alaskan Natives, including hospital and ambulatorymedical care. IHS pharmacists are authorized to provide certain prescription drugs directly to patients without a physician's authorization.At the outset of the program, the pharmacists could modify doses, dosageforms, and quantities of medicines and make therapeutic substitution ofmedicines. Later, their responsibilities were expanded to include treatingminor acute illness and monitoring patients receiving chronic drug therapybetween physician visits. The activities of pharmacists are defined byapproved protocols that indicate their functions, responsibilities, andprescribing privileges. The protocols are organized by disease and includesuch elements as the criteria for inclusion in pharmacy-based care,specific definitions of the role of the referring physician or nurse and the GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 72 Chapter 5 The U.S. Experience pharmacist, criteria for periodic visits by physicians to review a patient's status and the quality of care the pharmacist delivers, and drug therapy. In March 1995, the Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA) issued a directive establishing medication prescribing authority for, among others, clinicalpharmacy specialists. 8 The directive defines inpatient and outpatient prescribing authority for clinical pharmacy specialists and otherprofessionals, it lists the requirements for pharmacists to be givenprescription authority, and it notes that each professional given theprescription authority will be limited by \"a locally-determined scope ofpractice\" that indicates his or her authority. Prescriptions written withinthe scope of practice do not require a physician's signature, but thoseoutside the scope of practice do. Dependent Prescribing Authority in the StatesNine states have established dependent prescribing privileges for pharmacists.9 In California, Nevada, and North Dakota, pharmacists are allowed to prescribe only in institutional settings; there are no suchrestrictions in the six other states. Only in New Mexico is special trainingrequired for pharmacists to prescribe. In these nine states, prescribing is done by a protocol that involves a voluntary agreement between the pharmacist and the physician. Thepharmacist is responsible for initiating, monitoring, and modifying drugtherapy while the physician supervises the process and overall patientcare. For example, in Washington, all practicing pharmacists are eligible toinitiate and modify drug therapy by protocol, but a written agreementmust be developed between the pharmacist and an authorized prescriber.The agreement must be sent to the Washington State Board of Pharmacyfor review. It must include, among other items, the type of prescribingauthority to be exercised (including types of medical conditions and drugsor drug categories), documentation of prescriptive activities to beperformed, and a mechanism for communicating with the authorizingpractitioner. 8See VHA Directive 10-95-019, \"General Guidelines for Establishing Medication Prescribing Authority for Clinical Nurse Specialists, Nurse Practitioners, Clinical Pharmacy Specialists and PhysicianAssistants.\" 9The nine states are California, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, and Washington. A number of evaluations of pharmacist prescribing have been done.For instance, in California they have been conducted in a hospital (Chenella et al., 1983), nursingfacility (Thompson et al, 1984), and health maintenance organization (McGhan et al., 1983). GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 73 Chapter 5 The U.S. Experience North Dakota recently gave pharmacists the right to prescribe but only in institutional settings (a hospital, skilled nursing facility, or swing bedfacility) in which a patient's medical records are readily available to thephysician. Following diagnosis and initial patient assessment by a licensedphysician, pharmacists in these settings (under the supervision of thesame licensed physician) can initiate or modify drug therapy. SummaryWe found no data to evaluate the experience of pharmacists in the UnitedStates dispensing schedule V controlled substances or insulin. However,the data on Florida show that the experience there of pharmacistsprescribing drugs, whether a fixed or transition class, has been quitesimilar to that in 10 countries we studied. A number of lessons for thesuccess of an intermediate class of drugs, whether a fixed or transitionclass, in the United States can be learned from Florida. First, the drugs inan intermediate class must be seen as worth the effort of dispensing. Ifnot, the drugs will not be used and the benefits of the class will not berealized. Second, the liability and insurance issues have to be addressed.Third, recordkeeping requirements can be burdensome. Pharmacists arebusy and, if the recordkeeping requirements are too extensive, they willeither not maintain the records or not dispense the drugs. A method ofcollecting the data would have to be developed that does not impose toogreat a burden on pharmacists. This would be especially important for atransition class of drugs, for which recordkeeping would be a necessity if FDA were to gather data on the suitability of a drug for sale outside pharmacies. Calls for an intermediate class of drugs do not focus on pharmacists' dependent prescribing authority, but it gives some indication of rolespharmacists may play other than the traditional one of dispensingmedications. An evaluation of these roles would have to study thecounseling of patients, monitoring adverse drug reactions, any reductionsin cost, and the setting in which the prescribing takes place. Pharmacistsin institutional settings (including IHS and VA) have access to patients' records that indicate their health status and drug regimen whilepharmacists in community pharmacies (from where intermediate-classdrugs would be dispersed) might not have this information. Prescribingunder these two circumstances is quite different. The results of evaluatingone may not be applicable to the other. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 74 Chapter 6 Summary and Conclusions The purpose of this report was to examine the structure and operation of drug distribution systems in other countries in order to better understandthe potential advantages and disadvantages of establishing an intermediateclass of drugs in the United States. The assumption is that while theexperiences of other countries might not be models for the United States,they might provide a useful starting point for discussion. This chaptersummarizes our findings and presents our conclusions. Extant StudiesThe two-tier U.S. drug distribution system with its prescription andgeneral sale classes is unique among the 10 countries we studied. Thesecountries restrict the sale of at least some nonprescription drugs topharmacies or personal sale by a pharmacist. However, their drugdistribution systems differ, and no efforts have been made to studysystematically the consequences of the different systems. We found nosystematic evidence to support the superiority of one drug distributionsystem over another. Drug Distribution Systems The Benefits of a Transition ClassIt is unclear how some of the benefits of a transition class would be realized in the United States. The experiences of other countries cannot beused to assess its usefulness because their intermediate classes are notused in this manner. Instead, they are generally viewed as fixed classesinto which drugs are placed permanently. The intermediate classes areused solely to restrict access to drugs, not to facilitate their movement togeneral sale. It is unclear whether a transition class could be effective in monitoring adverse drug reactions while a drug is being considered for general sale.Several officials, questioning the usefulness of the data that would becollected, argued that toxicity profiles are well established through clinicalresearch and experience with drugs as prescription products. Additionally,the data that would be collected when a drug was in the transition classwould not be from well-controlled studies. The conclusions that could bedrawn from the data would not be as well supported as conclusions fromother types of studies. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 75 Chapter 6 Summary and Conclusions If an intermediate class were used to increase knowledge to better assess drugs for switching, pharmacists would have to keep records on patients'drug purchases. This would allow the purchase of a drug to be linked withadverse outcomes. Pharmacists would have to record symptoms, othermedical conditions, the practitioners who recommended the product, andthe amount purchased. They would also have to follow up, recordingexperiences with a product such as efficacy, side effects, and interactionswith food, drugs, and medical conditions. These recordkeepingrequirements would take time and add costs; much less demandingrecordkeeping requirements deter pharmacists in Florida from prescribingsuch drugs. Similarly, in the Australian state of Victoria, we found thatpharmacists often did not maintain records of patients' use ofpharmacist-class drugs, despite being required to do so. The Use of an Intermediate Class to Prevent AbuseOfficials in the United States and abroad thought that an intermediate class, whether fixed or transition, would do little to prevent drug abuse.While having to buy drugs in pharmacies rather than in other outletswould be a deterrent (for instance, a consumer would have to talk to thepharmacist or would be able to buy only a small amount of the drug), thissafeguard would be relatively easy to circumvent. Consumers could visitthe same pharmacy on numerous occasions or go to several pharmacies topurchase the drug. Experiences in Australia and Germany in whichpharmacist-controlled nonprescription drugs were either used orpurchased improperly are consistent with these conclusions. Drug Expenditures All 10 countries control the prices of prescription drugs but notnecessarily nonprescription products. Consequently, we could not drawuseful lessons for the United States (where neither prescription nornonprescription prices are controlled) on how prices change when a drugis switched. We did find some evidence from the United States and the United Kingdom that the price of a drug decreases when it is switched fromprescription to nonprescription status. However, the effect on price of thepresence or absence of an intermediate drug class has not been assessed. We also found that moving a drug to nonprescription status did not necessarily reduce health care costs. An incentive is created to obtain adrug with a prescription when such drugs remain reimbursable if they areprescribed but not if bought without a prescription. This can occur if GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 76 Chapter 6 Summary and Conclusions patients have less out-of-pocket costs (for instance, because of a small copayment) for a prescription drug than for a nonprescription product,even if the nonprescription product is less expensive. The European UnionThe European Union has decided not to require that the member countriesestablish a particular drug distribution system. The European Union wasnot convinced of the superiority of any particular system. Each membercountry will be allowed to establish whatever drug distribution it wants,provided the requirements for domestic producers and importers are thesame. The European Union has established criteria for distinguishingprescription from nonprescription drugs in the hope that drugs in thesecategories will become consistent from country to country. Access to Pharmaceuticals Number of Pharmacies and DrugstoresThere are approximately 54,000 community pharmacies in the United States. This is substantially less per capita than 6 of the countries studied(if drugstores are included), while 2 other countries and the Canadianprovince of Ontario have approximately the same number as the UnitedStates. Only Denmark and Sweden have many fewer communitypharmacies per capita than the United States. This suggests that limitingthe sale of some nonprescription drugs to pharmacies in the United Stateswould create somewhat greater access problems than in 6 of the countries.However, this is complicated by the number of other outlets such asmail-order and managed care pharmacies that might choose to sell thesedrugs. If such outlets chose to sell these products, the reduced access tothese drugs from limiting them to sale in pharmacies could be offset. While the number of pharmacies gives some indication of access, the distance to a pharmacy is also very important. The distance that peoplelive from pharmacies varies greatly in the United States. The nearestpharmacy can be 100 or more miles away. Restricting the sale of somenonprescription drugs to pharmacies would give individuals who haveready access to a pharmacy a greater number of nonprescription drugsfrom which to choose. However, if the drugs were to come from theprescription class, relative access between customers with and withoutready access to a pharmacy would remain the same. The drugs would still GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 77 Chapter 6 Summary and Conclusions be available for sale only in pharmacies; the difference would be that a prescription would not be required. Self-Selection of Drugs Of the countries studied, only the United States allows self-selection of allnonprescription drugs. Denmark, France, and Italy do not allowself-service for any drugs, while the remaining countries allow it for somebut not all nonprescription products. If the United States were to establishan intermediate class of drugs (whether fixed or transition), it might notallow the self-selection of these products, since the theoretical benefitsassociated with the class would be difficult to achieve without somecontrol on their distribution in pharmacies. This could change the waynonprescription drug purchases are made, since comparisons betweenproducts would be more difficult for consumers to make, not being able toselect intermediate-class products from the shelf personally. Classification of Drugs Our examination of the classification of 14 selected drugs in the studycountries indicated no clear pattern of increased nonprescription drugavailability because of the existence of a pharmacist or pharmacy class. Itappears that other factors in addition to or instead of the existence of apharmacist or pharmacy class account for differences in drugclassification between the countries. Despite the absence of anintermediate class, the United States allows the sale of some of the 14drugs without a prescription that many other countries restrict toprescription sale. Conversely, the United States restricts to prescriptionsale some drugs that other countries allow to be sold without aprescription but only in a pharmacist or pharmacy class. It also appears that access in one country relative to another depends in part on how access is defined. More of the 14 drugs were available for saleoutside pharmacies in the United States than in any of the other countries.However, the United States restricts the sale of more of these drugs toprescription status than do 5 of the countries. These drugs, while availablefor sale without a prescription, are restricted to a pharmacist class. Thus,if the criterion used for defining access is the number of drugs availablefor general sale, the United States has the most accessible system.However, if the criterion is the number of drugs available without aprescription, the United States is somewhere in the middle in terms ofaccessibility. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 78 Chapter 6 Summary and Conclusions Pharmacy PracticeOfficials in the countries we visited and the literature on pharmacist counseling generally agree that the theory of pharmacy practice divergesfrom the reality. The theory of pharmacy practice involves (and thesuccess of a fixed-intermediate or transition class requires), for example,the complete and appropriate counseling of patients on such issues asdosing instructions and potential adverse drug reactions, as well asmaintaining patient profiles. However, pharmacists have often notperformed these roles (especially for nonprescription drugs), either in theUnited States or abroad, even when doing so is expected and, in somecases, required. Pharmacist counseling, as practiced, is less frequent andless thorough than desired, although it has improved over time. In effortsin the United States and elsewhere to increase the role of pharmacists,professional associations and academics are advocating the idea of\"pharmaceutical care,\" with its emphasis on monitoring a patient's drugtherapy rather than on dispensing the drugs. There is evidence that ininstitutional settings such as hospitals, there are benefits frompharmaceutical care. However, pharmaceutical care is only now beingimplemented in community pharmacies and its value has yet to beestablished. Improved drug use is often cited as a justification for an intermediate drug class, and evidence for it gives support for expanding the role ofpharmacists in general. Such an expansion does not necessitate creatingan additional drug class. Indeed, the current system would benefit from animprovement in pharmacist counseling. The Florida ExperienceThe Florida Pharmacist Self-Care Consultant Law has had very little effect on the practice of pharmacy. Pharmacists rarely prescribe drugs in theformulary. This is attributed to (1) drugs being available without aprescription that are just as effective as the ones in the formulary, (2) theperception of increased liability, and (3) burdensome recordkeepingrequirements. ConclusionsOther countries' and Florida's experiences do not support a fundamentalchange in the drug distribution system of the United States such ascreating an intermediate class of drugs, whether fixed or transition, at thistime. Its benefits are unclear. No evidence at this time shows the overallsuperiority of a drug distribution system that restricts the sale of at leastsome nonprescription drugs to pharmacies. However, it should also beclear that there is no evidence that systems that do this are necessarily GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 79 Chapter 6 Summary and Conclusions inferior to drug distribution systems that allow some or all nonprescription drugs to be sold outside pharmacies. The evidence that does exist tends to undermine the contention that major benefits are being obtained in countries with a pharmacist or pharmacyclass. Such a class is not being used to facilitate the movement of drugs tosale outside pharmacies. Also, pharmacist counseling as it is currentlypracticed does not support the goals of either a fixed or a transition class.Pharmacists are not regularly counseling patients, maintaining patientprofiles, or monitoring for adverse drug effects. Thus, there is no evidenceto show that the role that U.S. pharmacists would have to play to supportthe appropriate use of an intermediate class of drugs (either fixed ortransition) would be fulfilled reliably and effectively. The evidenceindicates that at this time major improvements in nonprescription drug useare unlikely to result from restricting the sale of some OTCs to pharmacies or by pharmacists, nor are the safeguards for pharmacy- orpharmacist-class drugs that would have otherwise remained in theprescription class likely to be sufficient. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 80 GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 81 Appendix I History of the Intermediate-Drug Class Issue in the United States The 1951 Durham-Humphrey Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938 provided the statutory basis for two classes of drugsin the United States: (1) those restricted to sale by prescription and(2) those that can be sold without prescription. The latter are availablewithout any medical intervention and can be sold in both pharmacy andnonpharmacy outlets. A little over a decade after the passage of thisamendment, various organizations began to call for an additional class orclasses of drugs. In 1964, the APhA House of Delegates sought the establishment of the following four drug classes: 1. prescription-only, renewable only with the prescriber's authorization;2. prescription-only, at the pharmacist's discretion;3. pharmacist only at a patient's request; and 4. nonprescription, available directly to the public without professional direction or control. Each year from 1967 to 1970, the APhA House of Delegates reaffirmed its support for four classes of drugs, but FDA took no action. In 1974, FDA wrote that there have been \"comments by pharmacy organizations that a so-called 'third class of drugs,' under the control ofpharmacists be created,\" but \"no controlled studies or other adequate research data have been supplied to support the position that any class of OTC drugs must be dispensed only by pharmacists in order to assure their safe use . . . . There is at this time no public health concern that would justifythe creation of a third class of drugs to be dispensed only by a pharmacist or in apharmacy. The 'third class of drug' issue is at this time solely an economic issue. TheCommissioner therefore categorically rejects the establishment of a third class of drugs atthis time\" (39 Fed. Reg. 19881 (June 4, 1974)). This response drew on a 1974 letter from the Department of Justice to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare that dealt with proposalsfor a new class of drugs. The letter stated that \"these proposals wouldseverely restrain competition in the distribution and sale of OTC drug products and inconvenience the consuming public.\" GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 82 Appendix I History of the Intermediate-Drug Class Issuein the United States In 1982, NARD passed a resolution calling for a \"pharmacist legend\" class of drugs\u2014drugs moving from prescription to nonprescription status thatcould be dispensed only under a pharmacist's supervision. Drugs wouldremain in this class only until consumer understanding was demonstratedand a drug's safety as a nonprescription medicine had been evaluated. This resolution formed the basis for a 1984 petition from NARD to FDA asking it to restrict the right to sell ibuprofen (which FDA was considering moving from prescription to nonprescription status) to pharmacists. In thepetition, NARD also sought that all drugs being switched initially be considered for the \"pharmacist legend\" category. Later in 1984, the APhA House of Delegates passed a resolution favoring the idea of a category ofdrugs that supported the movement of drugs from prescription tononprescription status. In response to the NARD petition, FDA stated that \"the agency has continued to conclude that limiting certain drugs to sale-by-pharmacist only isunnecessary because a public health need for such a limitation has notbeen demonstrated\" (FDC Reports , 46:50 (December 10, 1984), 12). FDA went on to question whether it has the authority to establish an additionalclass of drugs, the implication being that legislation would be needed. Also in 1984, AMA adopted a resolution against a third class of drugs: \"Resolved, that the Association oppose the establishment of a third classof drugs\" (American Medical Association, 1984, p. 432). It stated that AMA supported the present classification into prescription and OTC drugs. Seeing no reason to change the classification system, FDA took no action and the two-tier system remained in place. Florida established a class of drugs quite similar to a fixed, intermediate class of drugs in 1986. Pharmacists were given the power to prescribeapproximately 30 prescription drugs. In other words, the state (which hasthe power to grant prescribing authority) gave pharmacists the right todispense particular prescription drugs. (The Florida experience isdiscussed in detail in chapter 5.) In 1987, APhA reaffirmed its 1984 position and also supported the use of the term \"transition class of drugs\" for this drug category. In 1992, in response to a petition from the Pharmacists Planning Service (a pharmacy advocacy group based in California) that an intermediate classof drugs be created, FDA reiterated its position on the lack of empirical GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 83 Appendix I History of the Intermediate-Drug Class Issuein the United States support for one and its lack of authority to establish such a class. In a 1994 letter to the Consumers for World Trade, FDA made the same points. In addition to these national efforts, there have been attempts at the state level to establish an intermediate class of drugs. For instance, in 1959 a billwas proposed in Minnesota that a pharmacy board be allowed to restrictcertain nonprescription products to pharmacy sale. In 1985, a bill wasintroduced in the Illinois state legislature that called for pharmacist-onlysale of switched drugs. More recently, a 1993 Oregon bill proposedestablishing a transition class of drugs. Except for the Florida lawdiscussed above, none of these, or other similar bills, have passed. 1 In 1992, the California legislature passed a resolution calling for the Congressand FDA to investigate a transitional class of drugs. The resolution was forwarded to the president, the Congress, and FDA. Throughout this period, the Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association (formerly called the Proprietary Association), an industrytrade association, has been a principal opponent of an additional class ofdrugs. Among other activities, it has opposed bills considered in statelegislatures that would have restricted to pharmacists the sale of switcheddrugs. Other current opponents of a transition class of drugs include AMA, the Food Marketing Institute, the National Coalition of Hispanic Healthand Human Services Organizations, the National Council on Aging, and theNational Grange. Current supporters of a transition class include APhA , the American College of Apothecaries, the Consumers Federation of America, the NationalAssociation of Retail Druggists, the National Consumers League, theNational Council of Senior Citizens, and the Public Citizen HealthResearch Group. 1As discussed in chapter 5, drugs have been made available for sale under certain circumstances without a prescription but only from pharmacists and in nine states pharmacists have been givendependent prescribing authority. However, these situations are not what has typically been discussedwhen an intermediate class of drugs has been considered. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 84 Appendix II Description of Drug Classification Systems in Ten Countries, Ontario, and the UnitedStates Australia Regulatory Authority The Therapeutic Goods Administration of the Ministry of Health is responsible for the quality, safety, and efficacy of drugs in Australia. Afterthe administration completes its assessment, the scheduling (distributionclass) of drugs is determined. The National Health and Medical ResearchCouncil, acting upon the advice of its Drugs and Poisons SchedulingCommittee, recommends to the states and territories what drugs should bein what class. The drug classes are enforced by state or territorylegislation. The states and territories do not have to accept therecommendation of the national committee. In practice, there is only slightvariation in the scheduling of drugs from one state or territory to another. Drug Classes Drugs are classified into one of the following poisons schedules. \"Schedule 1: Poisons of plant origin of such danger to health as to warrant their being available only from medical practitioners, pharmacists or veterinary surgeons. \"Schedule 2: Poisons for therapeutic use that should be available to the public only from pharmacies; or where there is no pharmacy service available, from persons licensed to sellSchedule 2 poisons. \"Schedule 3: Poisons for therapeutic use that are dangerous or are so liable to abuse as to warrant their availability to the public being restricted to supply by pharmacists or medical,dental, or veterinary practitioners. \"Schedule 4: Poisons that should, in the public interest, be restricted to medical, dental or veterinary prescription or supply, together with substances or preparations intended fortherapeutic use, the safety or efficacy of which requires further evaluation. \"Schedule 5: Poisons of a hazardous nature that must be readily available to the public but require caution in handling, storage, and use. \"Schedule 6: Poisons that must be available to the public but are of a more hazardous or poisonous nature than those in Schedule 5. \"Schedule 7: Poisons which require special precautions in manufacture, handling, storage or use, or special individual regulations regarding labelling or availability. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 85 Appendix II Description of Drug Classification Systemsin Ten Countries, Ontario, and the UnitedStates \"Schedule 8: Poisons to which the restrictions recommended for drugs of dependence by the 1980 Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs should apply. \"Schedule 9: Poisons which are drugs of abuse, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except for amounts which may be necessary for medicalor scientific research conducted with the approval of Commonwealth and/or State orTerritory Health Authorities.\" Pharmacists deal primarily with drugs in schedules 2, 3, 4, and 8. Drugs in schedule 2 are available in pharmacies or from a licensed dealer wherethere is no pharmacy within a certain distance. Schedule 2 drugs areconsidered to be dangerous to human life if misused or carelessly handled.Schedule 3 drugs are available from a pharmacist but a prescription is notrequired. The general criterion for schedule 3 is that professionalsupervision over the supply of a drug is needed but the prescription of aphysician is not necessarily required. These drugs are not accessible to thepublic. Schedule 4 drugs are available only on the prescription of amedical practitioner, dentist, or veterinarian. Addictive substances, suchas morphine and other narcotics, are listed in schedule 8. Storage andrecording provisions for schedule 8 poisons are very strict. Additionally, an \"unscheduled\" group of drugs is available for sale in retail outlets other than pharmacies. When the System Began The current classification system was developed in response to a 1954request of the Public Health Committee. Originally, there were eightschedules. In 1985, a ninth schedule was formed at the national level.Schedule 8 was divided into two parts and named schedule 8 and schedule9. All the states and territories still have eight schedules exceptQueensland, which has nine. Switch Decisions Drugs are switched between distribution classes based on therecommendations of the National Health and Medical Research Council.Manufacturers can petition that drugs be switched. Drugs can also beswitched by the states and territories based on their processes. Thefollowing are the principal types of data required for a switch: \"\u2014Full details of investigations made with respect to the safety of the substance, including tests carried out by universities and/or research institutions, and clinical trials, GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 86 Appendix II Description of Drug Classification Systemsin Ten Countries, Ontario, and the UnitedStates \u2014Known side effects, \u2014Occurrence of sensitivity tolerance or idiosyncrasy in response to the substance,\u2014Metabolism, rate, extent and mode of elimination of the substance,\u2014Any tendency towards accumulation in the body,\u2014Any special incompatibility,\u2014Any recognised standard such as pharmacopoeial monograph,\u2014Complete bibliography relating to pharmacological and therapeutic actions,\u2014Summary of animal studies,\u2014Adverse drug reactions from Australia and overseas,\u2014Occurrence of unusual or alarming reactions,\u2014Occurrence of abuse or habituation,\u2014Any epidemiological data that may be available,\u2014Details of scheduling status of the product in other countries,\u2014A copy of any data submitted to any overseas regulatory bodies in support of a scheduling change, \u2014If that application was unsuccessful, the rationale for refusal by the regulatory authority,\u2014Indications for which claims are to be made if proposal is for a Schedule 3 product,\u2014Strength, dose and frequency proposed,\u2014Full details of proposed labelling and packaging,\u2014Warning statements and limitations proposed for the label,\u2014Whether an insert is proposed and, if so, the text,\u2014What aspects the applicant expects the pharmacist to advise on during Schedule 3 supply,\u2014Any other data the Company feels is relevant to the submission,\u2014Risk/benefit analysis data.\" GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 87 Appendix II Description of Drug Classification Systemsin Ten Countries, Ontario, and the UnitedStates The guidelines do not lay out the criteria by which this information is assessed. Canada Regulatory Authority Regulatory authority for pharmaceuticals is divided between the federaland provincial governments. Generally, federal law determines what maybe sold as a drug and what may be said about it. Provincial law regulateshow and where drug products may be sold. At the federal level, the regulation of drugs rests with the Drugs Directorate of the Health Protection Branch, Health Canada. Within thedirectorate, there are the bureaus of Human Prescription Drugs and ofNonprescription Drugs. The principal federal drug law is the Food andDrugs Act. Authorities in each province also have control over some aspects of drug regulation. The authority in Ontario is described later in this appendix. Drug Classes At the federal level, there are two classes of drugs: prescription andnonprescription. Nonprescription drugs are further divided intoproprietary medicines ( GP, or general public) and products assigned a drug identification number ( DIN). GP products are \"drugs intended for the symptomatic treatment of minor self-limiting illnesses that do not requirethe advice or intervention of a health professional.\" GP numbers are assigned to products available for sale outside pharmacies. DINs are normally assigned to prescription and nonprescription drugs restricted topharmacies. This allows the federal government to indicate its preferencefor place of sale. However, provincial authorities make the final determination on place of sale. They may allow the sale outside pharmacies of any drug classified asa nonprescription product by the federal government, whether it has a GP number or a DIN. Provinces may make federal regulations more but not less strict. For instance, a province could require that a drug classifiednonprescription be sold only with a prescription in that province. Fiveprovinces (British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, andSaskatchewan) require that some nonprescription drugs be kept in a \"no GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 88 Appendix II Description of Drug Classification Systemsin Ten Countries, Ontario, and the UnitedStates public access\" area. Others may be stored on shelves accessible to the public. A provincial effort is under way to harmonize the number and types of drug classes throughout the country. The proposal calls for four drugclasses: prescription, pharmacist, pharmacy, and general sale. When the System Began Regulations of the Food and Drugs Act were amended in 1975 to includedrugs intended for sale without a prescription and outside pharmacies.(These drugs had been covered by the Proprietary or Patent MedicinesAct.) In 1976, British Columbia became the first province to establish aclass of nonprescription drugs to which the public did not have directaccess. Switch Decisions Switch decisions are made by the Bureau of Nonprescription Drugs. TheHealth Protection Branch has published the following guidelines on theinformation needed for a switch decision: \"1. Efficacy data will be required if the indication of use or dosage differ from those approved for prescription use . . . . \"2. A summary of all animal and human clinical safety data, including data that may have been part of an original New Drug Submission, as well as data which have accumulatedsince the product's introduction. \"3. A summary of all known and foreign adverse reaction reports since the introduction of the medicinal ingredient on the market, and a summary of adverse effects, their frequencyand the dose at which they occurred. Any adverse effects that could require patientmonitoring by a physician should be clearly described. Any potential for misuse or abuseand actual occurrences thereof should also be discussed. \"4. All proposed nonprescription labelling and promotional material demonstrating that the safe and effective use of the product can be assured by nonprescription labelling, ratherthan depending upon the professional judgement of a physician. The appropriate cautionsand contraindications must be expressed in lay terms. \"5. . . . Chemistry and manufacturing data will be required where they differ from the prescription product. \"6. Date of introduction of the prescription drug onto the Canadian market and a summary of the sales data . . . . A summary of international market status, i.e. countries where GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 89 Appendix II Description of Drug Classification Systemsin Ten Countries, Ontario, and the UnitedStates requests for authorization to sell (either prescription or nonprescription) have been made and the status (approved, pending, rejected) of those authorizations. If an authorization hasbeen refused, the reason for refusal, for both the prescription and nonprescriptionproducts. If an authorization has been approved for nonprescription sale, the date ofintroduction onto the market and confirmation that the product is currently marketed.\" Switch decisions may be changed by the individual province to further restrict access to the drug by specifying place of sale. Ontario Regulatory Authority The Ontario Ministry of Health is responsible for the classification of drugsfor distribution. It is advised by the Ontario College of Pharmacists, whichmakes scheduling recommendations. The ministry rarely disagrees withthe recommendation of the college. Statutory authority is contained in theHealth Disciplines Act. Drug Classes Drug distribution classes are divided into prescription and twononprescription classes\u2014namely, products available only frompharmacists and products that can be sold in both pharmacies and otherretail outlets. 1 The former category of nonprescription drugs is referred to as schedule C. A further refinement on schedule C drugs is that they mustbe kept in areas to which the public does not have access. This \"no publicaccess\" rule is not by statute but is College of Pharmacists policy. When the System Began We were unable to determine when the drug classification system wasestablished. Switch Decisions Switch decisions are made by the Ontario Ministry of Health with theadvice of the Ontario College of Pharmacists. 1The prescription and nonprescription classes are divided into a number of subclasses, each with particular requirements. For our purposes, the three-tier division of one prescription and twononprescription classes is sufficient. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 90 Appendix II Description of Drug Classification Systemsin Ten Countries, Ontario, and the UnitedStates Denmark Regulatory Authority The National Board of Health (Sundhedsstyrelsen) under the Minister of the Interior gives final approval to recommendations on classification bythe Licensing Committee. Drug Classes Denmark has seven pharmaceutical distribution classes. 1. Group A Narcotics: prescription only, no refills.2. Group A: prescription only, no refills.3. Group B: prescription only, refills allowed.4. Group BEGR: prescription only, dispensing only to hospitals.5. Group NB-S: prescription only, dispensing only to hospitals or after prescription by specialists defined by the National Board of Health. 6. Group H: nonprescription, sale in pharmacies only.7. Nonprescription: a few medicinal products that can be sold outside pharmacies (for example, certain pharmaceutical specialties for animals,vitamins, and anthelmintics\u2014that is, medicines for killing or ejectingintestinal worms). When the System Began The drug classification system was revised in the Medicines Act of 1975. Atthat time, a small class of drugs available for sale outside pharmacies wasestablished. Further revisions to this system were made in 1993 as part ofthe implementation of European Union directive 92/26/EEC. (See chapter2 for a discussion of this directive.) Switch Decisions There is no formal procedure for switches. Switch decisions are made bythe National Board of Health. Six principles are used to guide switchdecisions: 1. OTC products should be safe in ordinary use, GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 91 Appendix II Description of Drug Classification Systemsin Ten Countries, Ontario, and the UnitedStates 2. risks of overdose reactions should be minimal, 3. the drug should not possess an abuse potential,4. the drug should be indicated for minor diseases and symptoms easily diagnosed by lay persons, 5. the drug should not need professional supervision, and6. the regulatory authorities should have great experience with the drugs in question. France Regulatory Authority The regulatory authority for drugs rests with the National DrugAdministration (Agencie du medicament) in the Ministry of Health. Drug Classes France has four drug classes: 1. Prescription, list A: nonrefillable prescriptions.2. Prescription, list B: controlled narcotics and certain psychotropics.3. Prescription, list C: refillable prescriptions.4. Nonprescription.All drugs may be sold only in pharmacies. In rural areas where there is no pharmacy, physicians may be authorized to dispense drugs. When the System Began We were unable to determine when the current drug classification systemwas established. However, the distribution of drugs has been limited topharmacies since the Royal Declaration in 1777 (and even earlier). GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 92 Appendix II Description of Drug Classification Systemsin Ten Countries, Ontario, and the UnitedStates Switch Decisions Safety, efficacy, and quality are the factors considered when a drug approval decision is made. We were unable to gather specific informationon the criteria used for reclassifying drugs. Germany Regulatory Authority The registration of pharmaceuticals and market approval are regulated bythe Drug Institute Federal Health Office (Institut fur Arzneimittel desBundesgesundheitsamts). Its authority rests in the drug law,Arzneimittelgesetz. Drug Classes Pharmaceuticals are categorized into one of three classes for distribution. 1. Prescription. These products are available only with a prescription and only in pharmacies. 2. Pharmacy restricted. These are nonprescription products sold only in pharmacies. 3. Free-to-sell. These drugs are nonprescription but their sale is not restricted to pharmacies. However, the retailer has received some specialeducation. When the System Began The drug classification system was adopted in 1961. Switch Decisions Switch decisions are made by the Federal Health Office. Dr. WalterAlhterr, a member of the German Parliament and Deputy Chairman of theCommittee for Health, cited the following factors as being particularlyimportant when assessing a switch candidate: Is the drug sufficiently effective? Can the application and the indications of the drug be assessed by theself-medicating consumer? Is the margin of safety large enough? What about the safety profile at high dose? Is there a specific toxic risk? What about the adverse reaction profile? GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 93 Appendix II Description of Drug Classification Systemsin Ten Countries, Ontario, and the UnitedStates What about interactions? Has the drug been used for a sufficiently long time under prescription rules? What is the marketing experience? Do we already have OTC experience? Italy Regulatory Authority Regulatory authority for classifying drugs into distribution classes restswith the United Commission for Drugs (Commissione Unica per ilFarmaca). Drug Classes Italy has the following three drug classes: 1. Prescription only.2. Free sale (nonprescription, sale in pharmacies only).3. Hospital use only (for use in hospitals and other health centers).Further distinctions are made between drugs that are reimbursable by the government and those that are not. When the System Began The current classification was adopted in 1992. At that time, a subcategoryof the free sale class was established for switch products. Unlike othernonprescription medications, these drugs cannot be advertised to thegeneral public. Switch Decisions Authority to switch drugs resides in the Ministry of Health. Netherlands Regulatory Authority The responsibility for drug approval resides in the Ministry of Welfare,Health, and Cultural Affairs (Ministerie van Welzijn, Volksgezondheid enCultuur). Within the ministry is the Committee for the Evaluation of GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 94 Appendix II Description of Drug Classification Systemsin Ten Countries, Ontario, and the UnitedStates Medicines, which judges the efficacy and safety of drugs. The committee consists of 18 experts on pharmacy, clinical pharmacology, toxicology,and related disciplines. The committee is assisted in its work by theNational Institute for Drug Analysis and Control, which performs druganalyses and evaluates chemical and pharmaceutical data, and theNational Institute for Public Health and the Environment, which assessespharmacological and toxicological data. The drug approval processincludes the classifying of drugs into classes for sale. Drug Classes In the Netherlands, drugs are classified into one of three schedules forsale. 1. Prescription-only medicines. Drugs in this class can be sold only in pharmacies and only with a prescription from a physician. In rural areas,physicians may dispense drugs. 2. Pharmacy-only products. This class of nonprescription products is available without a prescription but only in pharmacies. (Despite drugs inthis class being legally available for sale without a prescription, mostpharmacists will not sell them without a prescription.) 3. Over-the-counter. These drugs are available without a prescription in both pharmacies and druggist shops. In the pharmacy, the leadingprofessional is the pharmacist, who is licensed to dispense all drugsregistered by the Medicines Evaluation Board. The leading professional ina druggist shop is the druggist, who is licensed to dispense only drugs thatare neither prescription-only medicines nor pharmacy only. The Dutch government plans to move to a two-class system consisting of their current prescription and over-the-counter classes. When the System Began The legal structure for the supply of medicines and, therefore, the drugclassification system are based on the Direct Supply Act of 1958, whichbecame effective in 1963. Switch Decisions Decisions to change the classification of a drug are made by the Ministryof Welfare, Health, and Cultural Affairs, acting on the advice of theCommittee for the Evaluation of Medicines. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 95 Appendix II Description of Drug Classification Systemsin Ten Countries, Ontario, and the UnitedStates The criteria for classifying a drug as a pharmacy-class product are the diagnosis of the disease can be made by the patient with the help of the pharmacist, taking the drug according to the dosage instructions in the leaflet does notresult in severe side effects, there are no dangerous interactions with other drugs, and a dosage two to three times the recommended dose has no severe toxiceffects. Sweden Regulatory Authority The regulatory authority responsible for the classification of drugs is theMedical Products Agency (Lakemedelsverket) of the Ministry of Healthand Social Affairs. The exclusive right to market pharmaceuticals at the retail level in Sweden belongs to the National Corporation of Swedish Pharmacies(Apoteksbolaget). Only the corporation may sell pharmaceuticals directlyto patients and customers in the outpatient-care sector and to hospitals inthe inpatient-care sector. The corporation is owned two thirds by the stateand one third by Apoteksbolaget's Pension Foundation. Because of itsexclusive right to the retail sale of pharmaceuticals, all pharmacists whodispense medication at the retail level are employees of the state. Thecurrent agreement with the government expires December 31, 1995. Therehas been some discussion of allowing the sale of some nonprescriptiondrugs outside pharmacies. Drug Classes There are four drug classes in Sweden: prescription, nonprescription(which can be sold only in pharmacies), free medicines, and herbalmedicines. Some antiseptic solutions and liniments are classified as freemedicines and can be sold outside pharmacies. Herbal medicines can alsobe sold in general stores. When the System Began The prescription and nonprescription categories were established in 1934.We were unable to determine when the free medicines and herbalmedicines classes were established. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 96 Appendix II Description of Drug Classification Systemsin Ten Countries, Ontario, and the UnitedStates Switch Decisions Authority to switch drugs rests with the Medical Products Agency. Among the criteria for assessing the reclassification of a drug to nonprescriptionstatus are pack size, toxicity, adverse reactions, interactions, drugdependence, years of prescription use, suitability for self-medication, andworldwide experience. Switzerland Regulatory Authority Marketing approval for drugs is the responsibility of the cantons, not thecentral government. However, five cantons concluded in 1900 that it wasnot feasible for each of them to regulate pharmaceuticals individually.They formed the Intercantonal Office for the Control of Medicaments(Interkantonale Kontrollstelle fur Heilmittel) \"to investigate and assess thesecret medicines and medical specialties sent to it by the participatingCantons as to harmfulness, appropriate composition, misleading characterof advertisements, labels and inserts, and the relationship of price tovalue.\" By 1934, all 25 cantons were parties to the agreement. Thisagreement has been revised on several occasions. The 1971 agreementgave four principal purposes for the office: 1. the quality control of marketed drugs,2. the quality control of manufacturing,3. the licensing of new drugs, and4. continuous review. Licenses are issued for only 5 years, so the office is continually reviewing products that are already on the market. Proposals have been made to give the federal government more power, but none has been accepted. Drug Classes Pharmaceuticals are categorized into one of five distribution classes inSwitzerland. 1. Class A: nonrefillable prescription. These drugs are available only with a prescription, in pharmacies, and the prescription cannot be refilled. Thisclass includes restricted pharmaceuticals such as narcotics. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 97 Appendix II Description of Drug Classification Systemsin Ten Countries, Ontario, and the UnitedStates 2. Class B: prescription only. Like class A products, drugs in class B are available only with a prescription and in pharmacies. However, unlikeclass A, the prescription can be refilled. 3. Class C: nonprescription, pharmacies only. Drugs in this class are available without a prescription but only from a pharmacy. 4. Class D: nonprescription, pharmacies and drugstores. Class D drugs are available without a prescription but only in pharmacies and drugstores. 2 Drugstores specialize in the sale of certain nonprescription products suchas herbal medicines, cosmetics, health foods, household items, andchemicals. 5. Class E: nonprescription, all stores. These products are sold without a prescription and are available outside pharmacies and drugstores. Items inthis category are limited to such health products as herbal cough candy,bandaids, dietetics, and baby products. The decisions of the Intercantonal Office for the Control of Medicaments are binding for prescription drugs, but the cantons have some freedom onthe classification of nonprescription products. In practice, there is littlevariation between cantons. When the System Began Classes A, B, and C were established in 1927. Class D dates from 1948. Wewere unable to determine when class E was established. Switch Decisions Switch decisions are made by the Intercantonal Office for the Control ofMedicaments. A medication switched from prescription to nonprescriptionstatus is placed in class C (pharmacy only). In recent years, a number ofdrugs have been switched from class C to class D (nonprescription,pharmacies and drugstores). The factors examined when a drug is considered for switching include need for diagnosis by a physician, adequate labeling for nonprescription use, consistency in the expected benefits of the drug, efficacy, 2Pharmacies are managed by university-trained and licensed pharmacists, while drugstores are managed by druggists who undergo a 4-year nonacademic apprenticeship and a specialty examination. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 98 Appendix II Description of Drug Classification Systemsin Ten Countries, Ontario, and the UnitedStates consistency in expected side effects, side effects of long-term use, side effects of short-term use, toxicity (acute and chronic), potential for interaction with other drugs, potential for interaction with foods, masking symptoms of another disease, habit-forming or abuse potential, history of use, method of use, indications amenable to self-treatment, risk-benefit relationship. United Kingdom Regulatory Authority Marketing authorizations for all drug products are granted by the Licensing Authority, which consists of the health and agricultureministers. The regulatory authority for human drugs is contained in theDepartment of Health. (The Department of Agriculture is responsible foranimal drugs.) Within the Department of Health, the Medicines ControlAgency is responsible for the approval (licensing) of human drugs. It isadvised by the Medicines Commission. The commission gives generaladvice on the administration of the Medicines Act of 1968 and on anymatter relating to medicinal products. It must have at least eight members,who together cover the following areas of expertise: (1) the practice ofmedicine, (2) the practice of veterinary medicine, (3) the practice ofpharmacy, (4) chemistry other than pharmaceutical chemistry, and (5) thepharmaceutical industry. The commission may recommend theestablishment of expert committees. Among the committees establishedare the Committee on the Safety of Medicines and the Committee on theReview of Medicines. The Committee on the Safety of Medicines isresponsible for advising on the efficacy, safety, and quality of newmedicines for human use. The Committee on the Review of Medicinesadvises on the efficacy, safety, and quality of products already on themarket that have not previously been reviewed by the regulatoryauthorities. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 99 Appendix II Description of Drug Classification Systemsin Ten Countries, Ontario, and the UnitedStates Drug Classes For the purpose of retail sale or supply, drugs for human use are divided into three classes. 1. Prescription-only medicines. Drugs in this category may be sold or supplied only from a registered pharmacy and in accordance with aprescription issued by an authorized practitioner. 2. Pharmacy medicines. These products may be sold or supplied only from a registered pharmacy or under the supervision of a pharmacist. Aprescription is not required. If the pharmacist is not present or on thepremises, the staff may not sell the drug. 3. General sale list. General sale medicines can be sold without the supervision of a pharmacist. Sales must be made from places that can beclosed to the public. This prohibits sales from market stalls, streetmarkets, or vehicles. Some of these medicines may be sold by means ofautomatic machines. When the System Began The classification system was established under the Medicines Act of 1968. Switch Decisions The responsibility for switching drugs between classes rests with theLicensing Authority, which amends the product license if a switch isapproved. The Department of Health receives requests to change theclassification of drugs. The Medicines Control Agency, advised by theCommittee on the Safety of Medicines and the Medicines Commission,recommends approval or disapproval of a switch. The criteria forswitching a drug from prescription-only medicine to pharmacy class are \"Indications suitable for self-medication including self-diagnosis (may be recurrent attack of condition requiring physician aided diagnosis on first attack); \"Medicine has acceptable margin of safety during unsupervised use including safety in overdose or following accidental misdiagnosis; \"Medicine is not a new drug substance for which further postmarketing evidence of safety is required; \"Medicine does not present a hazard to the community (indirect danger) from unsupervised use as might occur with development of resistant flora to antibiotics; \"Medicine has no major abuse or dependence potential; and GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 100 Appendix II Description of Drug Classification Systemsin Ten Countries, Ontario, and the UnitedStates \"Medicine is not for parenteral use.\" Reclassification of a drug from pharmacy only to general sale may be requested formally through either a variation in the product license or anabridged application for a product license, requesting general sale statusfor the product. The Licensing Authority makes the decision on whether toallow general sale list status. The request may also occur informallythrough a submission to the Department of Health that asks that theswitch be considered. The evidence may then be referred to theCommittee on the Safety of Medicines. Very few switches of drugs havebeen made from pharmacy class to general sale. Generally, the product license-holder applies for a change in the product license. The authorities or a third party may also initiate a switch.However, if the manufacturer does not want a product switched to a lessrestricted distribution class, it will not normally be reclassified. United States Regulatory Authority FDA has regulatory authority for classifying drugs for distribution. Each individual state has the power to determine who has prescribing authorityin it. Drug Classes There are two drug classes in the United States: prescription andnonprescription. Nonprescription drugs may be sold in any retail outlet.Prescription drugs may be dispensed pursuant to a \"practitioner's\" order,usually a doctor's prescription. There are several exceptions to this. First,in Florida, some prescription drugs may be dispensed by pharmacists, whoare considered \"practitioners\" under Florida law. (See appendix V.)Second, insulin is available in some states without a prescription but onlyfrom pharmacists. Third, in some states some controlled substances maybe dispensed by a pharmacist without a prescription if there is low abusepotential. Fourth, there are some situations in which pharmacists havedependent prescribing authority. Typically, in this situation, pharmacistsmay prescribe drugs but only under protocols established by supervisoryphysicians. (See chapter 5 for more discussion on these four cases.) GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 101 Appendix II Description of Drug Classification Systemsin Ten Countries, Ontario, and the UnitedStates When the System Began The two-tier classification was enacted into law by the 1951 Durham-Humphrey Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and CosmeticAct of 1938. Switch Decisions Switch decisions are made by FDA with the advice of advisory committees. The Durham-Humphrey Amendment specified three classes of drugs thatwere required to be limited to prescription use: certain habit-forming drugs listed by name in the Federal Food, Drug, andCosmetic Act; drugs not safe for use except under the supervision of a licensedpractitioner because of toxicity or other potentiality for harmful effect, themethod of use, or the collateral measures necessary for use; and drugs limited to prescription under an approved new drug application. For purposes of switching, the second criterion is the most important. A former director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research discussed13 issues that should be considered when making switch decisions. Thesebuild on the second criterion. 1. Does the switch candidate's frequency of dosing affect its safe use?2. Is the minimally effective dose for the proposed OTC indication known? 3. Has the candidate been used for sufficiently long time on the prescription market to allow a full characterization of its safety profile? 4. Does the candidate have a large margin of safety?5. Has the candidate's safety profile been defined at high dose?6. Does the candidate have a special toxicity in its class?7. Have possible drug interactions for the candidate been characterized?8. Is there a full understanding of the pharmacodynamics of the switch candidate? 9. Has a vigorous risk analysis been performed? GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 102 Appendix II Description of Drug Classification Systemsin Ten Countries, Ontario, and the UnitedStates 10. Has the efficacy literature been reviewed in a way that would support the expected usage and labeling of the candidate? 11. What do \"use data\" (from National Prescription Audit, National Drug/Disease, and other sources) show? 12. What foreign countries market the candidate OTC? What is its experience in those countries? 13. What is the worldwide marketing experience of the candidate? GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 103 Appendix III Classification of 14 Drugs in Ten Countries, Ontario, and the United States Table III.1 displays the current classification of each of the 14 drugs in 8 of the study countries (we were unable to obtain complete classificationinformation for France and Italy). In some of the countries, particulardrugs appear in more than one distribution class because classificationcan depend on dosage, intended use, pack size, and other factors. Forinstance, naproxen is both a pharmacy-class and prescription-class drug inAustralia. It is a pharmacy-class drug when it is \"the only therapeuticallyactive substance in packs of 12 or less dosage units, for treatment ofspasmodic dysmenorrhoea.\" In all others cases, naproxen is a prescriptiondrug. Therefore, in table III.1, Australia is indicated as classifyingnaproxen as both a prescription- and pharmacy-class product.

PPA as a weight-control product isnot available. We were unable to obtain information on codeine and sulindac. In Italy, naproxen,ranitidine, and terfenadine are limited to prescription sale. Aspirin, cimetidine, diclofenac,diflunisal, ibuprofen, indomethacin, PPA as a decongestant, and promethazine are in thepharmacist class in at least some cases. We were unable to determine if these drugs are everrestricted to prescription sale. Theophylline is not available. We were unable to obtain informationon codeine, PPA in weight-control products, and sulindac. bPhenylpropanolamine. cCodeine is regulated under the Narcotics Control Act in Canada. Some codeine products are available from pharmacists without a prescription. dAlthough all these drugs are legally available without a prescription in the Netherlands, most pharmacists will not dispense them without a prescription. eSome codeine products are available from pharmacists without a prescription in some states. All the U.S. nonprescription medications are restricted either to prescription sale or to nonprescription sale in pharmacies or drugstores inmost of the study countries. The United States allows the sale of 7(counting both indications of phenylpropanolamine as 1 drug) of the 14drugs without a prescription. This includes ibuprofen and naproxen, forwhich only doses of 200 mg have been switched, and cimetidine, whichhas been switched only in doses of 100 mg. Larger doses of these productsremain available only by prescription. It also includes codeine, which isavailable in low doses in some states without a prescription, andtheophylline, which is available without a prescription only in combinationproducts. Thus, 6 of the drugs are available outside pharmacies. It is clearfrom the table that none of the other countries allow the sale of as many of GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 107 Appendix III Classification of 14 Drugs in Ten Countries,Ontario, and the United States these drugs outside pharmacies as does the United States.1 However, 5 of the countries (Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and theUnited Kingdom) allow more of the drugs to be sold without a prescriptionthan the United States. (Denmark allows the same number to be sold whileCanada, France, Germany and Sweden allow fewer.) Of the 7 drugs available without a prescription in the United States, only aspirin and phenylpropanolamine (as a decongestant) are available forsale outside pharmacies in any of the study countries. All but aspirin andthe 200 mg dose of ibuprofen are restricted to prescription sale in at least 1country. Thus, for these 7 drugs, the United States has the most opensystem. 2 All 7 drugs available only by prescription in the United States are availablein at least 1 of the study countries without a prescription. In addition,ibuprofen is available in larger doses in the United Kingdom as anonprescription product than it is in the United States, while cimetidinemay be sold without a prescription in larger doses in Denmark and theNetherlands. 3 Two of these drugs (promethazine and terfenadine) are allowed fornonprescription sale in 3 or more of the countries. Each of these has beenconsidered for nonprescription status in the United States. 4 1This observation holds even if France and Italy are included, since these countries limit the sale of all drugs to pharmacies. Codeine, when it is available as a nonprescription drug in the United States, isavailable only from pharmacists. Thus, 5 of the drugs are sold outside of pharmacies in the UnitedStates. 2When codeine is available without a prescription in the United States, it must be dispensed by a pharmacist. Thus, for codeine, the United States is more restrictive than Australia, where pharmacistinvolvement is not required, and equally restrictive as Canada, Ontario, Denmark, Switzerland, and theUnited Kingdom. 3We were unable to determine what doses of cimetidine are available without a prescription in Italy. 4In addition, cimetidine was just recently switched after a long process. In 1993, FDA's Nonprescription Drugs and Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory committees considered evidence forswitching cimetidine. The dose under consideration (200 mg or less), which is smaller than theprescription dose, was for the treatment of heartburn. (Larger doses of cimetidine are used in thetreatment of ulcers. These were not considered for switching.) The committees decided that theeffectiveness of cimetidine at the lower dosage had not been demonstrated. The same committeesreassessed cimetidine in 1994. They concluded that, based on additional analyses and a new dosingregimen, the lower dose of cimetidine was effective. However, they still recommended againstswitching the drug because of concerns about drug-drug interactions. They said that the drug could beapproved for nonprescription sale if the results of new drug interaction tests are sufficient for approvaland committee recommendations for labeling are implemented. At the joint meeting of theNonprescription Drugs and Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory committees in March 1995, it wasrecommended that cimetidine be approved for nonprescription use. The drug, in doses of 100 mg, wasswitched in June 1995. (Dosing is 200 mg up to twice daily.) GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 108 Appendix III Classification of 14 Drugs in Ten Countries,Ontario, and the United States In the 1980's, FDA approved promethazine as a nonprescription product. However, in response to comments and a citizens' petition, FDA withdrew its approval. There were allegations that the drug was connected withSudden Infant Death Syndrome (often referred to as SIDS). At the time,the manufacturer volunteered to withdraw the drug as a nonprescriptionproduct. FDA has not approved an application to switch terfenadine to nonprescription status because of concern about drug interactions as wellas complications for patients with heart or liver disease. Terfenadine hadbeen sold without pharmacists' intervention in Canada. However, becauseof concerns about drug interactions, the Canadian federal governmentsuggested to the provinces that they restrict it to sale only by pharmacists. There are competing explanations for why these drugs are allowed for sale without a prescription in some countries but not here. Certainly, at leastthese two drugs have been considered for nonprescription status in theUnited States but have been denied for what appear to be appropriatereasons. Whether they would be nonprescription products now if anintermediate drug class were available is not possible to know. Moreover, 9 of the study countries (all but Sweden) have used their pharmacist or pharmacy class to allow nonprescription sale of some drugsrestricted to prescription sale in the United States. None of these drugscan be sold outside pharmacies in any of the countries. It is unclearwhether these drugs would be more or less restricted if these countrieshad a two-tier system like the one in the United States. However, it is clearthat officials in these countries see a role for their pharmacist or pharmacyclass as they have restricted the sale of these drugs to pharmacies or bypharmacists. However, some FDA officials told us that they were unclear about the purpose of an intermediate drug class and how it would be usedin the United States. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 109 Appendix IV Descriptions of Drugs Examined in This Study This appendix briefly describes the 14 drugs whose classification in the study countries we examined. We include common brand names, thepurpose of the drug, adverse effects, and interactions with otherpharmaceuticals. The information presented comes primarily from twopublications by the American Medical Association and from The Essential Guide to Prescription Drugs by James W. Long, M.D., and The Complete Drug Reference by the U.S. Pharmacopeia (American Medical Association, 1993; Clayman, 1988; Long, 1992; U.S. Pharmacopeia, 1992). AspirinAspirin is known chemically as acetylsalicylic acid, or ASA. It has beencommonly used since 1899. It is a nonnarcotic analgesic that relieves pain,reduces fever, and alleviates the symptoms of arthritis. In small doses, ithelps prevent blood clots. Common adverse effects are indigestion,nausea, and vomiting. Aspirin has a tendency to irritate the stomach andeven cause bleeding. Taken in large doses, it can aggravate ulcers, kidneydisease, and liver disease. It has been linked to Reye's syndrome, a rarebrain and liver disorder occurring usually in children. Aspirin can increase the effect of anticoagulants, leading to an increased risk of abnormal bleeding. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs canincrease the likelihood of stomach irritation when taken with aspirin.Corticosteroids taken with aspirin can also increase the likelihood ofstomach irritation. Aspirin may reduce the effect of drugs for gout andincrease the effect of oral antidiabetic drugs. CimetidineCimetidine was introduced in 1976. It is marketed under the brand nameTagamet. Cimetidine is used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. Itworks by inhibiting the secretion of stomach acid and, thus, creating amore favorable environment for the healing of peptic ulcers of theduodenum, esophagus, and stomach. The overall incidence of adversereactions to cimetidine is low. As cimetidine promotes healing of thestomach lining, there is a risk that it may mask stomach cancer. It istherefore usually prescribed only when the possibility of stomach cancerhas been ruled out. Lower doses are used to treat heartburn, acidindigestion, and sour stomach. Antacids may reduce absorption of cimetidine. Cimetidine can cause an increase in the blood level of some benzodiazepine drugs (a family ofpsychoactive compounds with a common molecular configuration), GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 110 Appendix IV Descriptions of Drugs Examined in ThisStudy leading to an increased risk of adverse effects. It can increase the effect of anticoagulant drugs and the blood levels of anticonvulsant drugs. CodeineCodeine is an analgesic narcotic that was introduced in 1886. It is usedprimarily to relieve mild to moderate pain and control cough. It is oftenused in combination with milder analgesics, such as aspirin andacetaminophen, to enhance their effectiveness. It is frequently added tocough mixtures containing antihistamines, decongestants, andexpectorants to make these preparations more effective in reducing thefrequency and severity of cough. It is an ingredient in many prescriptioncold medicines and coughs. All drugs that have a sedative effect on thecentral nervous system are likely to increase sedation with codeine.Codeine may interact with monoamine oxidase inhibitors to cause adangerous rise in blood pressure. 1 Serious adverse effects are rare. The most common is constipation. In fact,codeine has been used to control diarrhea. Codeine can be habit-forming iftaken for extended periods, especially if higher-than-average doses aretaken. It is normally used only for short-term relief of symptoms. DiclofenacDiclofenac is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug that was introduced in1976. It is marketed under the brand name Voltaren. Its principal uses areto relieve the symptoms associated with major types of arthritis, menstrualcramps, and bursitis, tendinitis, and related conditions. The most commonside effects are gastrointestinal disturbances, particularly abdominal pain,indigestion, nausea, and either diarrhea or constipation. Fluid retention isthe only expected side effect. In combination with a number of drugs, diclofenac can increase the risk of bleeding. It may also increase the toxicity of a number of other drugs. DiflunisalDiflunisal, introduced in 1982, is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugwith a prolonged duration of action. It is marketed under the brand nameDolobid. It reduces mild to moderate pain and inflammation. It is used torelieve discomfort in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, although itdoes not cure the underlying disease. It is also effective for pain relief after 1Monoamines play an important part in the metabolism of the brain. An excessive accumulation of monoamine can induce a dangerous reaction characterized by high blood pressure, palpitations,sweating, and a feeling of suffocation. Monoamine oxidase is a monoamines. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 111 Appendix IV Descriptions of Drugs Examined in ThisStudy minor operations and dental work and may also be given to treat sprains, strains, and some types of back pain. Serious adverse effects are rare, evenwith prolonged use. Common adverse effects are nausea and diarrhea,heartburn and indigestion, abdominal pain, and rash. Diflunisal can interact with a wide range of drugs to increase the risk of bleeding or peptic ulcers. The beneficial effects of antihypertensive drugsand diuretics may be decreased by diflunisal. IbuprofenIbuprofen is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug that was introduced in1967. Among the common brand names are Advil, Medipren, Motrin,Nuprin, PediaProfen, and Rufen. It is an effective treatment for thesymptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and gout. It also relievesmild to moderate discomfort of headache, menstrual pain, soft tissueinjury, and pain following an operation. Ibuprofen has fewer side effectsthan many of the other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. The mostcommon adverse effects are diarrhea or constipation and nausea orvomiting. Ibuprofen can interact with a wide range of drugs to increase the risk of bleeding and peptic ulcers. Ibuprofen can reduce the beneficial effects ofantihypertensives and diuretics. It can also increase theblood-sugar-lowering effect of oral antidiabetic drugs. IndomethacinIndomethacin was introduced in 1963. Common brand names areIndameth, Indocin, and Indocin SR. It is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatorydrug that reduces pain, stiffness, and inflammation. It is used in thetreatment of many arthritic conditions, acute attacks of gout, bursitis, andtendinitis. It has several potentially serious adverse effects, includinggastrointestinal disorders, severe headache, and dizziness, and it maymask the symptoms of infections. It is generally not given to people withpoor kidney function. Indomethacin can interact with a wide range of drugs to increase the risk of bleeding and peptic ulcers. Indomethacin can reduce the beneficialeffects of antihypertensive drugs and diuretics. It may increase theblood-sugar-lowering effects of oral antidiabetic drugs. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 112 Appendix IV Descriptions of Drugs Examined in ThisStudy NaproxenNaproxen is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug that was introduced in 1970. Common brand names include Aleve, Anaprox, and Naprosyn. Itreduces pain, stiffness, and inflammation. It is used primarily to relievemild to moderately severe pain associated with musculoskeletal injuries,acute and chronic gout, adult and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,osteoarthritis, menstrual cramps, and dental, obstetrical, and orthopedicsurgery. Gastrointestinal side effects are fairly common, and there is anincreased risk of bleeding. Naproxen can interact with a wide range of drugs to increase the risk of bleeding and peptic ulcers. The beneficial effects of antihypertensivedrugs and diuretics may be reduced by naproxen. PhenylpropanolaminePhenylpropanolamine, commonly known as PPA, has two principal uses.It works as a decongestant by reducing the inflammation and swelling ofblood vessels in the nose, thus relieving stuffiness and nasal congestion incolds, hay fever, and sinusitis. Phenylpropanolamine is also used inweight-reduction products. It acts as an appetite suppressant. Among thecommon brand names are Acutrim, Dexatrim, Prolamine, Propagest, andRhindecon. Overall, adverse effects are rare. However, concern has beenraised about the drug as a cause of dangerously high blood pressure,kidney disease, heart muscle damage, heart rhythm abnormalities, andseizures. Other sympathomimetic drugs (those producing an effect comparable to that produced by stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system) canincrease the risk of adverse effects if taken concurrently withphenylpropanolamine. Phenylpropanolamine can reduce theblood-pressure-lowering effect of antihypertensive drugs. Monoamineoxidase inhibitors dangerously increase the risk of high blood pressurewhen taken with phenylpropanolamine. PromethazinePromethazine is an antihistamine that was names include Anergan, Phenazine, Phenergan, Prorex, andProthazine. Its principal use is as a single drug product to providesymptomatic relief in allergic disorders, to control nausea and vomiting,and to produce mild sedation. Common side effects are drowsiness andlethargy, dry mouth, and blurred vision. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 113 Appendix IV Descriptions of Drugs Examined in ThisStudy Promethazine is used in combination with analgesics, such as aspirin and codeine, to enhance their pain-relieving actions by producing mildsedation. It is also used in cough mixtures for its drying effect. All drugsthat have a sedative effect are likely to increase the sedative properties ofpromethazine. Antacids can reduce the absorption of promethazine fromthe stomach, thus reducing its effect. RanitidineRanitidine is an antiulcer medication that was introduced in 1981. It ismarketed under the brand name Zantac. Ranitidine is used primarily in thetreatment of peptic ulcer disease. It works by inhibiting the secretion ofstomach acid and thus creating a more favorable environment for thehealing of peptic ulcers. Ranitidine also reduces discomfort andinflammation from reflux esophagitis. Headache is the most commonadverse effect. As ranitidine promotes healing of the stomach lining, thereis a risk that it may mask stomach cancer. It is therefore usuallyprescribed only when the possibility of stomach cancer has been ruledout. There are no known interactions with other drugs. This means that ranitidine can be taken with other medications without reducing itseffectiveness or that of the other drug. SulindacSulindac is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug that was introduced in1976. It is marketed under the brand name Clinoril. Sulindac is usedprimarily to relieve mild to moderately severe pain and inflammationassociated with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, acute and chronicgout, and bursitis, tendinitis, and related disorders. It has not beencompletely established how the drug works. Indigestion, nausea andvomiting, diarrhea, and constipation are fairly common adverse effects.There is also a risk of stomach bleeding or peptic ulcer. Sulindac can interact with a wide range of drugs to increase the risk of bleeding and peptic ulcers. The beneficial effects of antihypertensive anddiuretic drugs may be reduced by sulindac. Concurrent use of sulindacwith oral antidiabetic drugs can increase the blood-sugar-lowering effectof these drugs. TerfenadineTerfenadine is an antihistamine that was introduced in 1977. It is marketedunder the brand name Seldane. Its main use is in the treatment of allergic GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Nonprescription Drugs Page 114 Appendix IV Descriptions of Drugs Examined in ThisStudy rhinitis, particularly hay fever. Allergic skin conditions may also be helped by terfenadine. It works by reducing the intensity of the allergic responseby blocking the action of histamine after it has been released fromsensitized tissue cells in the eye, nose, and skin. 2 Terfenadine differs from older antihistamines in that it has little or no sedative effect on the centralnervous system. Nausea and loss of appetite occur occasionally withterfenadine. There are concerns about persons with heart or liver diseaseusing the drug. Other side effects are very rare. Terfenadine can increase the sedative effects on the central nervous system of anti-anxiety drugs, sleeping drugs, antidepressants, andantipsychotic drugs. The anticholinergic effects (lowered blood pressureand increased motion of the alimentary canal and other hollow organs) ofterfenadine are likely to be increased by all drugs that also have theseeffects. There is a risk of a dangerous rise in blood pressure if terfenadineis taken within 14 days of monoamine oxidase inhibitors. TheophyllineTheophylline is a bronchodilator that was introduced in 1929. Somecommonly used brand names are Slo-Bid, Slo-Phyllin, Theo-24, andTheo-Dur. It has two main actions. First, theophylline relaxes and dilatesthe airways in the lungs. Second, it stimulates breathing and the heart rate.Theophylline is used primarily in the treatment of asthma. It is also helpfulin heart failure. It is sometimes given to premature infants who are proneto attacks of apnea (stopped breathing). Treatment with theophylline mustbe monitored because the effective dose is very close to the toxic dose.Common adverse effects are agitation, dizziness, and nausea and vomiting.Some drugs increase the level of theophylline in the blood while othersdecrease it. 2Histamine is a stimulant of gastric juice, a constrictor of smooth muscle including that of the bronchi, and a dilator of arterioles and capillaries. GAO/PEMD-95-12 Pharmacist-Controlled Drugs Page 115 Appendix V The Florida Pharmacist Self-Care Consultant Law The Florida Pharmacist Self-Care Consultant Law went into effect on October 1, 1985. It gives pharmacists the authority to prescribe specificmedications without the approval of a physician. It is stated in Florida law(Fla. Stat. Ann. S. 465.186) that the formulary (that is, the list of drugs apharmacist can prescribe) may include products falling within thefollowing categories: any medicinal drug of single or multiple active ingredients in any strengthswhen such active ingredients have been approved individually or incombination for OTC sale by FDA, any medicinal drug recommended by the FDA Advisory Panel for transfer to OTC status pending approval by FDA, any medicinal drug containing any antihistamine or decongestant as asingle active ingredient or in combination, any medicinal drug containing fluoride in any strength, and any medicinal drug containing lindane in any strength. Any drug that is sold as an OTC product may not be included in the formulary. Florida Board of Pharmacy rules 21S-27.220 and 21S-27.230 state that \"A Pharmacist may order and dispense from the following formulary, subject to the stated conditions: (1) Oral analgesics for mild to moderate pain: magnesium salicylate/phenyltoloxamine citrate, acetylsalicylic acid (Zero order release, long acting tablets), choline salicylate andmagnesium salicylate, IBUPROFEN (no more than 400 mg per dosage unit for minor painand menstrual cramps limited to a six (6) day supply for one treatment).
