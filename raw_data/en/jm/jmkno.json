Minimizing the effective focal spot size of the X-ray source can significantly improve the spatial resolution and the quality of the sample images, which is critical and important for the performance of HHM CT. The objective of this study is to present a 9 MeV HHM CT prototype based on a high-average-current photo-injector in which X-rays with about 70m focal spot size are produced via using tightly focused electron beams with 65/66m beam size to hit an optimized tungsten target. In digital radiography (DR) experiment using this HHM CT, clear imaging of a standard 0.1 mm lead DR resolution phantom reveals a resolution of 6 lp/mm (line pairs per mm), while a 5 lp/mm resolution is obtained in CT mode using another resolution phantom made of 10 mm ferrum. Moreover, comparing with the common CT systems, a better turbine blade prototype image was obtained with this HHM CT system, which also indicates the promising application potentials of HHM CT in non-destructive inspection or testing for high-density Digital radiography (DR), Microfocus X-ray computed X-ray focal spot DOI: 10.3233/XST-210960 Journal: [Journal of X-Ray Science and Technology](https://content.iospress.com:443/journals/journal-of-x-ray-science-and-technology), vol. 1, pp. 1-12, 2022 IOS Press, 6751 Tepper 2300 [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5221333e3721123b3d2122203721217c313d3f) For editorial issues, like the status of your submitted paper or proposals, write to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7613121f0219041f171a361f1905060413050558181a) IOS Press Nieuwe Hemweg issues, permissions, book requests, submissions and proceedings, contact the Amsterdam office protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#721b1c141d321b1d0102001701015c1c1e) 10 8446 7947 [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d7b4bfbeb9b697beb8a4a7a5b2a4a4f9b4b9) For editorial issues, like the status of your submitted paper or proposals, write to "}
