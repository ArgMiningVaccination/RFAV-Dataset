Here are 3 tips to help build and keep a healthy immune system: 1. Good gut health may be key. Most doctors now believe that up to 80 percent of your immune system is in your gut. Consider consuming whole, unprocessed foods rich in antioxidants to support your health. A healthy diet is the precursor to reducing inflammation and encouraging good gut bacteria that helps establish a strong immune system. Focus on fiber-rich vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains and healthy fats. Be kind to your liver too. It's responsible for filtering the blood of toxins and waste. 2. Reduce your stress level. Yes, easier said than done. However, here's why it's important: Stress affects your body's immune response. It causes you to produce extra levels of cortisol and cytokines, which trigger inflammation. It can decrease the number of white blood cells available to fight infection, leaving you at risk for cold sores and colds. In addition, if you are stressed you are probably not getting enough sleep and eating right which trickles into neglecting other healthy habits that boost immunity. 3. Detox by Design You are exposed to over a million toxins everyday. The skin is a detoxifying organ. When we are exposed to toxins the body may purge toxins through the pores of your skin causing acne in patterns that we can trace to with our Skin Mapping technology. These toxins impact our body's immune system and skin in significant ways.
