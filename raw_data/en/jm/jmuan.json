The mission of Source Medicine is to pioneer the development of, provide access to, and scientifically validate Source Resonances for the benefit of people, plants, animals and the earth. The Work Of Source Medicine - Source Medicine is a new well being approach very similar to homeopathy and based on many of its principles and practices. - It is a way of tapping into the vital essence of life to create Source Resonances in the form of sounds to support well being and inner awakening. - This process was originally devised by [Peter Chappell](#Video_About_Source_Resonance_with_Creator_and_Inventor,_Peter_Chappell_)in Ethiopia in 2002, and has been collaboratively evolved since then with Dr. Leilani van Koten. - Source Resonances have been shown to be highly effective in supporting wellbeing and recovery from infection in rural, traditional cultures, for instance for for people exposed to infectious disease like HIV, malaria, leprosy etc. See [www.arhf.nl](http://www.arhf.nl). for details of African projects and the watch the [video below](#A_Story_of_HOPE_&_LOVE_-_An_Answer_to_Malaria,_AIDS_and_Trauma_in_Africa_). - For use in the west and industrialized societies, Source Medicine sound resonance audio files can be used as a standalone therapy, integrated along with classical and clinical homeopathy as an additional support or used alongside a range of therapeutic approaches. - All life experiences are an opportunity for conscious evolution - all illness as a \"wake-up call\" to help us on our path to higher consciousness, both individually or collectively. - Often an illness highlights some unresolved infection or trauma, or inherited family pattern (referred to as the miasm in homeopathic medicine. - Source Resonances (SR Audio Files) are designed to support us in evolving through the effects of these unresolved issues so that we can wake up more fully to who we truly are.
