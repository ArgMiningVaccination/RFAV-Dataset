All in all, there are major shifts underway, and the country might end up as a country-sezed conservapedia talk page. Since Poland is a wonderful case study, with all the shock therapies and political drama, I feel updating the page on it (the content right now is woefully outdated) would be a good thing to bother oneself with. I'd do that myself, but, well, I'm afraid of putting too much moonbat bias in there. Also, I'd welcome updates on Hungaria (Orban's governance requires attention; at times, he's legit sending the demi-Hitler waves), but I don't feel knowledgeable enough to opine on it in detail. Any resident Hungarians in here?

See what you can do ;-) [Avengerofthe BoN](/wiki/User:Avengerofthe_BoN)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Avengerofthe_BoN)) 22:38, 26 October 2015 (UTC) - I know we've got one but, as I've said, I don't feel knowledgeable enough to say something genuinely worth hearing. And then there's the bias. Well, one of the reasons I'm wanting more on Orban is his role in the European migrant crisis (which is greater than the space devoted to it in the article on Orban would suggest). He's been a huge influence on nationalists and xenophobes in other EU countries that used to belong to that other camp during the Cold War. Probably the reason most news featuring him (at least, those that reach me) are either blatant hagiographies or emotive dismissals, and both contain relatively little of substance. - PS: I'm thinking about updating the politics part of the page on Poland for starters, but I'm wondering - should defunct parties, parties that receded into obscurity, and parties that receded to obscurity and were dissolved after their leaders committed suicide (*cough* Samoobrona *cough*)be removed from the roster, or should they be superseded by currently active ones? On the one hand, they led to the current situation, but on the other hand, so did the ones before them, and enumerating all the parties active in Poland since 1989 would fill the RW server three times over.

I'd attribute her surge in the polls to the positive media coverage Clinton has been receiving lately ever since the Dem debate, since positive/negative media coverage of a candidate usually leads to better/worse standing in the polls. Biden's exit from the race also helped Clinton since Biden was disproportionately taking voters from Clinton.

If that is indeed the case, I would like to know which these are. Apparently calling attention to a discussion - even if relevance for the wiki as a whole is assumed - is a thing not generally done or only done in rare circumstances... (e.g. a major coop case). What else is there? While the issue came up with regards to I/P, I think it is a general one, but Mona reverted me, because (well judge for yourself)... The point is: What should RW care more about and why: de facto (e.g. North and South Korea are de facto two separate countries in some state of cold war) or de jure (e.g. ugh... both not recognizing the other and the \"police action\" that was the Korean war never having ended... or something)? In my humble opinion the de facto situation should at least be mentioned and as we are not a blog of legal experts (much less experts in the types of law that matter to our mission), we might go a bit lightly on the de jure side of things.

On the other hand, you've already used the very best argument I can think of; \"Misgendering her isn't just disrespectful, but downright dangerous!\" If your mother cares that little for your girlfriend's well-being, well, argue about how disrespectful she's being to you by misidentifying your orientation and making up such ridiculous stories to dicredit your choice of partner.

The gaps between Homoeopathy and Gamergate, or laetrile and My Little Horsie, or oil-pulling and Gaza are so wide that to make any claim that RW has any sort of focused mission laughable.

The gaps between Homoeopathy and Gamergate, or laetrile and My Little Horsie, or oil-pulling and Gaza are so wide that to make any claim that RW has any sort of focused mission laughable. But nobody wants that, and so we're stuck with a sprawling bunch of articles, some of which do actual good work that is hard to find anywhere else, but most of which are snarky, half-assed second-rate Wikipedia articles or places for people to grind an axe over a topic that is only tangentially related to any sort of core mission. Peace. @AH: What about stuff like Holocaust denial, which doesn't necessarily rely on scientific data as such, but historical data?

Something like The Amazing Athiest.

His page is currently little more than an erudite Encyclopedia Dramatica troll job. But i like that, i want more of that (For those, such as him, so clearly deserving of such). But i also like the clear headed and rational framing that pervades the vast majority of pages here.

It argues that modern conservative voting trends over abortion are not an organic backlash against Roe v. Wade, but rather a result of thirty-plus years of campaigning by a relatively small number of people within the religious wrong. Evidence it uses includes data from forty years of General Social Surveys run by UC Berkeley. This data shows that until the 1980s, conservative stances on abortion were more or less in line with their liberal and moderate counterparts, only increasing in the 1980s, peaking during the Bush 43 administration, and decreasing slightly since 2010. I would like for it to be made into its own article, since that is where it would likely receive the most views.

So, it has value in that sense as a shortcut that should never have been taken. But in that case, it was actually the Japanese Unit 731 experiments that had the most strategic value, in particular because the US got its mitts on them before the Soviets. The data was considered a strategic advantage, exposing the activities of Unit 731 would make the data public, and having it be made public would destroy that advantage, so the US ended up being complicit in covering up the extent of the crimes against humanity Unit 731 committed. Even to the point where the command staff that had overseen the crimes against humanity went on to have long and distinguished careers in the Japanese civil service and the medical profession. It's probably the greatest shame of WWII-era US policy.

Bernie Sanders on Charlie Rose[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive248&action=edit\u00a7ion=29)] This is likely to be very unpopular, but reading the [Bernie Sanders](/wiki/Bernie_Sanders) hagiography here I figured I might as well. After watching him on Charlie Rose, other than being Not Hillary Clinton (which is certainly a positive) I can't say I understand what people here love about this guy. Anyone can rant about \"teh evul 1%\" and declare anyone who is actually successful in life a Certified Enemy of AmericaTM, it doesn't mean that being especially good at doing so makes one qualified to be the president. Listening to his tirades, you'd think that no one with a lot of money had ever done anything good with it; evidently Bill Gates never got the message that total lack of charitable work and complete self-absorption are prerequisites to becoming a billionaire, perhaps Sanders was going to let him and Melinda in on that. To use another example, the idea that the government is going to make college free sounds nice but is so patently unworkable that it's DOA. The US isn't Europe, and unless he wants such a low percentage of people to go to college (which he doesn't seem to, although I personally don't think that's a bad idea) it's yet another pile of money added onto the national debt.

[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive248&action=edit\u00a7ion=33)] Have you ever noticed the ridiculous claim that reactionary social views such as racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, whorephobia, junkiephobia, drug prohibitionism, welfare-shaming, anti-choicery and police brutality are more common among the working class than among the privileged, propertied class of fascist oppressor scum? Supposedly the rich are \"socially liberal\" whereas the proletariat support right-wing authoritarian values. This is completely and utterly ridiculous. Communist, anarchist and atheist movements (excluding right-wing, Islamophobic \"atheists\" who are thoroughly bourgeois, and aren't really atheists because there is one religion they never criticize - Judaism) have always drawn the vast majority of their support from the proletariat and the peasantry, with the only remotely non-poor elements being the progressive intellectuals. The aristocrats, the bourgeoisie and the wealthy oppressors were horrified by the rise of Marxist atheism, and led fascistic crusades for \"God and country\". Very few proletarians voted for Hitler, and even fewer of the unemployed, whereas most of the petty bourgeoisie and virtually all the grand bourgeoisie did. Sane with Mussolini, Franco, Pinochet and other Christofascist reactionaries - their support came overwhelmingly the oppressors - the more privileged the oppressor, the stronger their support for fascism. Virtually all proletarians opposed them. Groups like the KKK and Neo-Nazis are stereotyped as composed of \"poor white trash\" but the reality is their supporters are mostly wealthy businessmen and fascistic pig-cops and military officers. A quick look at any white supremacist website will show this. Support for leftist and socialist movement mostly comes from workers, welfare recipients, immigrants, prisoners and other good classes who do not deserve to perish in a revolutionary holocaust the way the rich do. Support for the \"religious right\" comes overwhelmingly from the middle and upper classes, and the proletariat are far less likely to go to church than the bourgeoisie and always have been. In recent years, ballot measures in US states show that the higher someone's income and the lighter their skin, the more likely they are to vote in favor of bans on abortion, gay marriage and marijuana. Even when the proletariat is Christian, it is because of things like Black Liberation Theology - \"family values\" Xtianity has virtually no proletarian support. These things aren't called \"bourgeois morality\" for no reason - it's the idea that the bourgeois is socially liberal that is ridiculously absurd. Is it time to get over these absurd myths about supports of reactionary values and racism being \"poor white trash\" and admit what they really are - privileged, wealthy, aristocratic bourgeois fascist oppressors?

Based on the way the Broncos D dominated Rodgers, I'd venture to say they win the Super Bowl and send Peyton out to his retirement like a champ, similar to Bettis and Ray Lewis.

Even if Manning sucks, the defense could carry him ala Ravens 2000 defense with Trent Dilfer. They need a strong running game of course, but being a game manager with a stellar D ain't a bad thing. And Manning's definitely got the football IQ to manage a game to his advantage and not wear out his dead arm. Remember, the year Manning won his only Super Bowl, he practically sucked in the playoffs minus the game vs. the Patriots. I think it was like 6 TDs and 7 INTs that post season because the defense carried him against KC, Baltimore, and Chicago. And the Broncos D is good enough to carry him.

A dilemma.[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive248&action=edit\u00a7ion=41)] To start off with, I have severe nut allergies. Usually, I have to meticulously search the ingredient labels for any incriminating ingredients, and even the facility and equipment the item is made on. So when food is specifically nut-free, I'm especially happy. Unfortunately, such food is usually everything-free (gluten-free, wheat-free, dairy-free, etc.) as well. Even GMO-free. Now, I don't want to support companies that advertise GMO-free as a virtue, but they are often the only foods that are guaranteed to be nut-free. So I am presented with a dilemma: support the GMO-free industry, or obsessively scan labels for any hint of trouble? What do I choose? What do I do? [107](/wiki/User:Utter_Lunacy) [Ag47](/wiki/User_talk:Utter_Lunacy) 21:24, 4 November 2015 (UTC) - Do you really have a choice? Aren't nut allergies potentially fatal? I feel your pain, by the way. As someone who is somewhere between a vegetarian and a vegan (being a vegan is just too damn hard, and I sometimes eat meat, mostly for social reasons like at Christmas dinner; the way I figure it being >90% \"better\" is \"good enough\") I often buy \"organic\" food. As I see it, buying organic food is definitely the \"lesser of the evils\", but I wish I didn't have to, and avoid it if I can but this is not always possible (for example, all variants of tofu that I can buy are \"organic\"). The annoying thing is that organic food has a few things going for it (mostly on the long-term sustainability of some farming methods), which is dwarfed by the woo :-/ - I had similar troubles finding a decent massage therapist a few years ago, as almost all also offer woo-based treatments (reflexology, cupping, etc.) ...

And yet, no major company that I know of seems to care about making foods nut-free. I reserve a disproportionate amount of my anger for Little f***ing Debbie. When I was growing up, our school cafeterias would often stock tons (and by tons, I mean tons) of Little Debbie snacks, seemingly not caring that I was being excluded. As such, I grew up hating that calm face on those packages. It's as though the company was a corporate sponsor of SCPS or something. But I digress. Companies have their priorities wildly skewed.

This is why a psychotic person acting on his delusions, or a person brought up brainwashed in a strict religious or political system adhering to those dogmas, is still being rational to the fullext extent of the term by allowing themselves to be led by the information they posses. Indeed, we can only ever be led by the information we actually possess, and no matter how twisted our information is, we can all agree that just overtly acting in opposition to that total body of information can't ever be rational. So; being in love doesn't make you irrational. It's fully rational to be in love and act on that information. Irrationality, however - both for you as a lover and for the psychotic person or the religious nut - means: when people are provided access to new information that enriches their total body of information (or \"evidence\") yet they still maintain their old trains of thought and action despite their evidence, or information, having been updated to reflect a different situation. Which, in your case, would be equivalent to you finding out that she doesn't love you back but still acting and reasoning identically to the way you did when you just knew you were in love, and her take on it was undetermined still.

It entirely depends on how you do it. \"hey baby...I've been thinking about you every day...\" would very likely come across obsessive. \"Hey...remember when x happened (x=something funny), it popped into my head the other day and I thought it would be nice to call you and see how you were doing..\" may not. - As per having Asperger's, I read a novel called The Rosie Project...about a professor with Asp. looking for love.

I don't have any experience with these so can't really offer any advice on them, but it might be worth looking into if you're eager to meet girls. The most important thing is to try & take things one step at a time, not get obsessed over what might happen with somebody you've met, & not creep her out by coming on too strongly. There can be a tendency for people who haven't had much relationship experience, especially for people with OCD & similar conditions, to invest too much emotionally & 'fall in love' too easily (sometimes even with people you barely know), which could make you mess things up more easily with somebody you like & will make the disappointment more painful when you do. I'm speaking largely from my own experience, but I'm guessing from what you've told us that some of this may apply to you too. Try to get perspective on your feelings & not let them get out of control: when you feel that you're 'in love' with someone (who doesn't feel the same way about you) think about whether it's really about her, or more about you & how you feel about not getting something that you want so much. If you really struggle with these kinds of emotions, you could look into counselling or therapy (or talk to your therapist about it if you're already in therapy for Asperger's etc). Finding people who like you will be easier the more you like yourself. It's good to be aware of your flaws (especially where love & relationships are concerned) but don't be too negative about yourself as a whole, & don't try too hard to compete with or compare yourself to other people.

I'm not really good with social skills in general, as I have ADHD, Anxiety, and Asperger's... a devastating mix when trying to talk to girls you don't already know. - 3 years with no contact, getting in touch at this stage, no matter how innocently, is going to look obsessive. useful advice beyond the obvious generalities is difficult as your perspective, her perspective, our (limited) perspective are going to differ. There really is no useful advice beyond the 'try not to obsess', but you know, try not to obsess. Try to come to terms with any kind of relationship you had is in the past. It will still be painful but you'll be moving on. I'm sure you know or have been told this before, buts all that can be done. - That really sucks...big time...sorry to hear this. Please try and learn from the lesson and not fall into the MRA trap (blaming everyone but your own bad luck and possibly perhaps maybe your approach, and become a douchebag woman-hating sleaze-ball). It's losing the friendship that hurts most...no? If you think you could realistically still be friends, let her know that very clearly and hope she is also willing to try. If not, then tactfully let her know you are still interested, assuming you can handle the very possible rejection and perhaps she will too. If not, it all really really sucks, the pain will slowly go away and with luck, new horizons will come.

[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive248&action=edit\u00a7ion=64)] I buy a lot of reggae/dancehall/dub music, and for the past few years I've been at least peripherally aware that almost every release I've bought has been produced in the UK. I only recently found out why. In Jamaica, they've more or less exterminated modern dancehall with [regulations aimed at curbing \"violent\" music](http://gawker.com/5158644/jamaica-bans-jamaican-music). A lot of the artists I'd formerly enjoyed have been reinventing themselves (or at least trying to) as roots reggae artists with modern, sparse production which in my opinion pretty much sucks. Of course they do have a gun violence problem in Jamaica, and a lot of reggae (used to?) glorify drug use, murder and homophobia. But then again, so does a lot of hip hop.

Considering the obviously extensive planning that went into this horrendous attack, and the fact that they struck almost as soon (on the hour) as the ISIS loss of territory and manpower was confirmed. Rafiq also made some good (and to the educated, obvious) points by being very clear that we separate Islam and Islamism, a separation my muslim friends share fully (tokenism intended). He also bravely pointed out that we understand that islamism and jihadism, in its violent Salafist and Wahabist forms, is a collection of truly shitty and anti-human hate ideologies, all of which we need to resist as harsly as we do Nazism.

The difficult path to a solution, I believe, has to be in large part an intellectual and educational one, and an effort of enlightenment. Most muslims are moderates, and moderates can still be reasoned with (with any hope of success). It wasn't for naught that I left this link in the first place, of which I am now reminded. It may not go so far as to sum up my views on the subject, but it comes damn close. And despite parts one may object to, there ARE parts that are absolutely brilliant. I'm not here to hand out proverbial fliers, but since the question was just posed to me by you as it was, I'm not going to pause for a second - and instead flat out [link it again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WOAAKMA6Hk), and I suggest you watch it, Sir. These are not easy questions, but there's no solution for anyone without an end to religious fundamentalism. And in the end, the fundamentalists are wrong about us, and about the world. That's not enough to neuter them (far from it), but it is enough to spur endless resistance to them. Since, you know, they're wrong. For all their terror and destruction, philosophically their game is up, as it has always been. They may think they have God on their side, but we have something far greater - reality. And the fundamentalist worldview will not last, ultimately - largely by their own making. Acts like this do not only risk to spur people into extremism, but it will turn good people off from it. And the vast majority of muslims fall in that category, as I mean it precisely here. This is not a system of thought that sane people can share with madmen knowingly, and that will be made blatantly clear to said moderates. And that link is one step on that path (though, here Harris is preaching to the choir). But still, as with the moderate muslims - it's about providing reason to reasonable people. And don't shoot the messenger in case you're not a Harris fan - I know I'm rightfully conflicted about the man. But as an adult, I don't let that color the contents of that particular speech.

Thanks, Mona! [You mean to tell this if you want to read a rant Gooniepunk posted on Facebook about what happened in France| | | I'm going to re-post my thoughts on the terrorist attack on France here (shamelessly copy-pasted from Facebook): So let me start my response to the terrorist attacks in France by saying that I'm going to be raw and uncensored in this post, so if you get this far and feel you may be offended by strong anti-religious sentiment, now is your time to stop reading. Beyond that, this Facebook is a free speech zone, and you are welcome to post a response. Let me say that I used to not have a problem with religion in general. I used to buy the line that \"Oh, they're just extremists. The real members of the religion are not that way.\" I bought this after learning about Jonestown when I was in school. I bought this after David Koresh (granted I was only, 9 IIRC, but I remember vividly when it happened). I bought this after Heaven's Gate. I bought this after Matthew Shepard was murdered. I even bought this after 9/11 (by this time, I considered myself an agnostic). I used to buy that religion wasn't the problem, but that religious extremism was the problem. Then we found out the Catholic Church covered up for pedophiles while pretending to be a beacon of morality. And anti-gay legislation was drafted and passed in various states in my US until, and even after, the legalization of same-sex marriage. Muslim terrorist attacks have continued relentlessly throughout the world and some of the new generation of Muslim terrorists have even come from my backyard in Riverside, Minneapolis. And Benjamin Netanyahu has continued to stoke the fire of Islamic extremism by proclaiming Israel's own form of manifest destiny, while treating Palestinians just as horribly George Custer (and his predecessors and successors) treated Native Americans (i.e: they're savages with no right to a homeland). My point being here is that I have become something I never thought possible: I have become an antitheist. This is a level above atheist, because I am now convinced that, not only, is there no apparent God, but that religion itself is THE source of evil. How many more \"bad ones\" do we need to excuse in order for this supposed \"God\" to actually do something that isn't evil? Penn Jillette said something to the effect of, when commenting on the Catholic priest sex abuse scandal, that if your God is a god who protects pedophiles, then maybe you should question if yours is really moral. I extend this to Islam: if people like ISIL really are the \"bad ones\" then prove it. Don't just denounce them. No. Organize an army just as radical as theirs that is in opposition to them. Why should Russia and the United States et al have to take care of ISIL while every other goddamn Islamic country (I'm looking at you, Saudi Arabia) sits on their hands? Wipe that smile off your face, Christianity. I'm calling you out, too. I'm sick of you letting people like Eric Rudolph get away with murder. I don't care how evil you think abortion is, until you make murdering abortion providers just as bad or worse than abortion, you have nor moral standing here. Until you stop opposing laws that prohibit discrimination and harassment against LGBT people, and until you stop allowing yours to blame rape victims for being raped, you are every bit as bad as ISIL. Call these fuckers out for the shit they are, or we have nothing to discuss. Same with Jews for not calling out Netanyahu for being the Andrew Jackson of Israel. Same with Zoroastrians, Buddhists, Hindus, and every other group with religious nutters as a part of them. Until you stop apologizing for extremists by watering down what they do (\"I don't support gay bashing, but I don't support the choice to be homosexual\" as an example), then YOUR RELIGIONS AND YOUR GODS ARE EVIL! Plain and simple. </rant> I commend you, Gooniepunk. Until every religious person gets their shit together, and calls out the extremists of every religion they are a part of, the world will continue to be a cesspool of human filth and evil. When the Church that my family believed in, supported, looked up to, and gave hope to them, was revealed to be living an entire damn facade covering up child abuse, it occurred to me that religion is nothing but hell, and serves no purpose other than to subjugate others.

So while you have crazies fighting crazies, it still doesn't excuse the fact that religion begot the crazies. \"THE source of evil\"? I disagree. I've been an atheist for more than 20 years now and for a while I tended to believe that, too. But now? \"The\" source of evil is human nature. Humans are basically shit. If you get rid of religion, humans will find another reason to hate each other, no problem. Get rid of religion and people will believe other irrational nonsense, because that's human nature. Rationality is something learned much later - but it does not replace our basic nature, just cover it. We are completely irrational at heart. I do not defend religion because it's, at best, stupid nonsense, and at worst another reason for hate and murder, but I do not believe anything would change if we got rid of it. It's just a symptom, an expression of the basic problem \"human nature\", but not the core problem itself. -- [Irian](/wiki/User:Irian) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Irian)) 07:53, 14 November 2015 (UTC) - No doubt great evil has been done in the name of various religions. But, not all religions are equal in this regard. You can't blame Wiccans for what happened in Paris. Indeed, when was the last time a Wiccan terrorist committed mass murder? If you look at the Quran, it is full of the idea that evil people deserve to die (i.e. death penalty for this, death penalty for that.) Once you believe evil people deserve to die, you just need to convince yourself that certain people are evil (even if it is a whole country), then you feel justified in killing them. (And in case anyone feels I am picking on Islam, the Torah is just as bad, so this argument condemns Christianity and Judaism too.) But, where in Wicca is the idea that anyone deserves to die? Although Wicca has no scriptures as such, I've read many books on Wicca, and I never saw anything in any of them like \"God/dess says these people deserve to die\". So let's not tar all religions with the same brush.

I guess what matters here with regard to religion is its intentions or driving goal. Is religious subjugation the primary goal, as we see in the Daesh's goal of a Caliphate, or is religion used for more secular, legitimate reasons like rectifying an injustice or ending a foreign invasion/occupation? So, I think that distinction is essential before condemning groups with certain religious leanings or labels, because there are variations.

It is an exceedingly unlikely prospect. Every religion is different, and some religions are far more likely to develop religiously motivated violence or terrorism than others. Beliefs matter. @ChrisAmiss, Of course there are decent Muslims, who whatever bad potentials exist in their religious tradition, don't follow those potentials. But I think any religion with the death penalty in its scriptures (the Abrahamic religions, but also found in some Hindu scriptures, and I'm sure some other religions too) are more likely to produce terrorist atrocities than a religion whose scriptures/tradition lacks this element.

I mean, sure, Iran has sponsored several terrorist organisations, but they all fight for quite explicit quasi-national goals in the Middle East, rather than the global jihadism espoused by the various Sunni terrorist groups that have targeted the West since the 1990s (here, I'm excepting some more localised jihaddies, such as the GSPC, which targeted France in the late 1990s/early 2000s during the horror show in Algeria). While Iran is certainly not my kind of regime and needs to be tackled in its bid for regional power, putting it on the same level as Saudi Arabia when discussing support for terrorism against the West is simply bunk. It's the Saudis who need to decide whether they want to ride the global jihaddi crazy train or actually do something to curb the activities of jihaddi groups, and not just when they target the Saudi regime. So far, Saudi signals have been mixed, to say the least. While the Saudi regime has condemned terrorist attacks, it's hard to see where it has actually worked to help prevent them, and when Saudi Arabia began to use the same blunt instrument (military intervention) that has, until now, yielded mixed results (to say the least) when used by Western states fighting \"terrorism\", the Saudis targeted, of all places, the already dysfunctional and civil war ravaged Yemen trying to depict this stepping up of the Saudi/Iranian proxy war in that country as a strike against \"terrorism\".

They cited Syria and President Hollande's bombing decisions there. That is not a justification -- no more than the Catholics in the IRA were justified in blowing up London department stores because of British oppression. Religion becomes the unifying system for people who believe, rightly or wrongly, that they are fighting the Other, who is attacking them. (Yes, ISIS blathers about establishing a fucking Caliphate, but that's their organizing goal. It's not remotely achievable. They are pissed about French bombs in Syria.) I make these points because it is easy to ascribe all of this violence to religion, but this terrorism is at it's base political. If Westerners don't grapple with the actual causes of Muslim terrorism -- if it misidentifies the primary causes -- it isn't going to adopt effective policies for addressing the problem.-- [-Mona-](/wiki/User:-Mona-) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:-Mona-)) 13:11, 14 November 2015 (UTC) - not gonns lie, I was expecting you to blame Israel &/or Netanyahu.

ISIS: eliminate the \"gray zone\"[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=RationalWiki:Saloon_bar/Archive248&action=edit\u00a7ion=77)] Apparently, one purpose of attacks like these is that ISIS feels they are forcing Muslims worldwide -- but especially in Western lands -- to abandon liberal and democratic ideals, and \"alliances\" with Christians, Jews and secularists. ISIS describes such Muslims as [residing in a \"gray zone.\"](https://archive.is/VE0jj#selection-459.1-463.388) They calculate that crackdowns on Muslims after terror attacks will radicalize these Muslims and drive them to \"the truth\" of ISIS. The U.S. and allies who lied their way to war in Iraq created the mess in which the ISIS mold grew.

Reacting to the Paris atrocities with yet more troops, bombs and drones can be expected to fix this? Based on what rational analysis?

Didn't work. Of course, a lot less collateral damage when the GSG9 and legal system dealt with the RAF. Dropping bombs is a bit more imprecise, which will, probably, mean they have more of the effect RAF was after. In short: what RAF and daesh and other terror organisations usually WANT is the state to strike back hard, and preferably indiscriminately, in the hope that it'll radicalize more people.

I may very well be wrong, I am sure someone will correct if I am, but I do not believe the west had such a problem with radicalisation with al Qaida. At least pre 9-11. It seems obvious to me the on going war on terror and all the evils that entails is very powerful recruiting tool for such groups. I make no claims as to understand all that Isis does , but it seems to me that what happened in Paris is the realisation of all the fears intelligence agencies have been harping on about - our radicalised Muslim youth returning from Syria to spread their jihad. In the uk, the government have been pushing for ever more intrusive surveillance that I feel sure these events will allow them to push through, while its anti radicalisation has been accused of creating radicals.

Prior to bin Laden, the Qutbi plan was \"take out near enemy (rulers of Islamic countries that weren't religious enough, i.e., all of them, but especially Egypt and Saudi Arabia), then the far enemy (any non muslim ruler of a place that was once Islamic, i.e., Spain, the rest of Serbia, India/Kashmir, parts of Russia, and yes Israel), and then conquer the world. Bin Laden came in and said that rather than going after Saudi Arabia first, go after the US first because it supports Saudi Arabia and props up a lot of Islamic countries, and if the US falls so does Saudi Arabia. The reason al Qaeda hates the West is not because of the West's actions in the mid-east but because the West stabilizes parts of the mid-east that al Qaeda wants unstable.

In the name of God the most gracious the most merciful Exactly four years ago this month I was finishing my work shift at a local hospital. As I was walking to my car I was approached by two federal agents. They said that I had a choice to make: I could do things the easy way, or I could do them the hard way. The \"easy \" way, as they explained, was that I would become an informant for the government, and if I did so I would never see the inside of a courtroom or a prison cell. As for the hard way, this is it. Here I am, having spent the majority of the four years since then in a solitary cell the size of a small closet, in which I am locked down for 23 hours each day. The FBI and these prosecutors worked very hard-and the government spent millions of tax dollars - to put me in that cell, keep me there, put me on trial, and finally to have me stand here before you today to be sentenced to even more time in a cell. In the weeks leading up to this moment, many people have offered suggestions as to what I should say to you. Some said I should plead for mercy in hopes of a light sentence, while others suggested I would be hit hard either way. But what I want to do is just talk about myself for a few minutes. When I refused to become an informant, the government responded by charging me with the \"crime\" of supporting the mujahideen fighting the occupation of Muslim countries around the world. Or as they like to call them, \"terrorists.\" I wasn't born in a Muslim country, though. I was born and raised right here in America and this angers many people: how is it that I can be an American and believe the things I believe, take the positions I take? Everything a man is exposed to in his environment becomes an ingredient that shapes his outlook, and I'm no different. So, in more ways than one, it's because of America that I am who I am. When I was six, I began putting together a massive collection of comic books. Batman implanted a concept in my mind, introduced me to a paradigm as to how the world is set up: that there are oppressors, there are the oppressed, and there are those who step up to defend the oppressed. This resonated with me so much that throughout the rest of my childhood, I gravitated towards any book that reflected that paradigm - Uncle Tom's Cabin, The Autobiography of Malcolm X, and I even saw an ehical dimension to The Catcher in the Rye. By the time I began high school and took a real history class, I was learning just how real that paradigm is in the world. I learned about the Native Americans and what befell them at the hands of European settlers. I learned about how the descendents of those European settlers were in turn oppressed under the tyranny of King George III. I read about Paul Revere, Tom Paine, and how Americans began an armed insurgency against British forces - an insurgency we now celebrate as the American revolutionary war. As a kid I even went on school field trips just blocks away from where we sit now. I learned about Harriet Tubman, Nat Turner, John Brown, and the fight against slavery in this country. I learned about Emma Goldman, Eugene Debs, and the struggles of the labor unions, working class, and poor. I learned about Anne Frank, the Nazis, and how they persecuted minorities and imprisoned dissidents. I learned about Rosa Parks, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, and the civil rights struggle. I learned about Ho Chi Minh, and how the Vietnamese fought for decades to liberate themselves from one invader after another. I learned about Nelson Mandela and the fight against apartheid in South Africa. Everything I learned in those years confirmed what I was beginning to learn when I was six: that throughout history, there has been a constant struggle between the oppressed and their oppressors. With each struggle I learned about, I found myself consistently siding with the oppressed, and consistently respecting those who stepped up to defend them -regardless of nationality, regardless of religion. And I never threw my class notes away. As I stand here speaking, they are in a neat pile in my bedroom closet at home. From all the historical figures I learned about, one stood out above the rest. I was impressed be many things about Malcolm X, but above all, I was fascinated by the idea of transformation, his transformation. I don't know if you've seen the movie \"X\" by Spike Lee, it's over three and a half hours long, and the Malcolm at the beginning is different from the Malcolm at the end. He starts off as an illiterate criminal, but ends up a husband, a father, a protective and eloquent leader for his people, a disciplined Muslim performing the Hajj in Makkah, and finally, a martyr. Malcolm's life taught me that Islam is not something inherited; it's not a culture or ethnicity. It's a way of life, a state of mind anyone can choose no matter where they come from or how they were raised. This led me to look deeper into Islam, and I was hooked. I was just a teenager, but Islam answered the question that the greatest scientific minds were clueless about, the question that drives the rich & famous to depression and suicide from being unable to answer: what is the purpose of life? Why do we exist in this Universe? But it also answered the question of how we're supposed to exist. And since there's no hierarchy or priesthood, I could directly and immediately begin digging into the texts of the Qur'an and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad, to begin the journey of understanding what this was all about, the implications of Islam for me as a human being, as an individual, for the people around me, for the world; and the more I learned, the more I valued Islam like a piece of gold. This was when I was a teen, but even today, despite the pressures of the last few years, I stand here before you, and everyone else in this courtroom, as a very proud Muslim. With that, my attention turned to what was happening to other Muslims in different parts of the world. And everywhere I looked, I saw the powers that be trying to destroy what I loved. I learned what the Soviets had done to the Muslims of Afghanistan. I learned what the Serbs had done to the Muslims of Bosnia. I learned what the Russians were doing to the Muslims of Chechnya. I learned what Israel had done in Lebanon - and what it continues to do in Palestine - with the full backing of the United States. And I learned what America itself was doing to Muslims. I learned about the Gulf War, and the depleted uranium bombs that killed thousands and caused cancer rates to skyrocket across Iraq. I learned about the American-led sanctions that prevented food, medicine, and medical equipment from entering Iraq, and how - according to the United Nations - over half a million children perished as a result. I remember a clip from a '60 Minutes' interview of Madeline Albright where she expressed her view that these dead children were \"worth it.\" I watched on September 11th as a group of people felt driven to hijack airplanes and fly them into buildings from their outrage at the deaths of these children. I watched as America then attacked and invaded Iraq directly. I saw the effects of 'Shock & Awe' in the opening day of the invasion - the children in hospital wards with shrapnel from American missiles sticking but of their foreheads (of course, none of this was shown on CNN). I learned about the town of Haditha, where 24 Muslims - including a 76-year old man in a wheelchair, women, and even toddlers - were shot up and blown up in their bedclothes as the slept by US Marines. I learned about Abeer al-Janabi, a fourteen-year old Iraqi girl gang-raped by five American soldiers, who then shot her and her family in the head, then set fire to their corpses. I just want to point out, as you can see, Muslim women don't even show their hair to unrelated men. So try to imagine this young girl from a conservative village with her dress torn off, being sexually assaulted by not one, not two, not three, not four, but five soldiers. Even today, as I sit in my jail cell, I read about the drone strikes which continue to kill Muslims daily in places like Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen. Just last month, we all heard about the seventeen Afghan Muslims - mostly mothers and their kids - shot to death by an American soldier, who also set fire to their corpses. These are just the stories that make it to the headlines, but one of the first concepts I learned in Islam is that of loyalty, of brotherhood - that each Muslim woman is my sister, each man is my brother, and together, we are one large body who must protect each other. In other words, I couldn't see these things beings done to my brothers & sisters - including by America - and remain neutral. My sympathy for the oppressed continued, but was now more personal, as was my respect for those defending them. I mentioned Paul Revere - when he went on his midnight ride, it was for the purpose of warning the people that the British were marching to Lexington to arrest Sam Adams and John Hancock, then on to Concord to confiscate the weapons stored there by the Minuteman. By the time they got to Concord, they found the Minuteman waiting for them, weapons in hand. They fired at the British, fought them, and beat them. From that battle came the American Revolution. There's an Arabic word to describe what those Minutemen did that day. That word is: JIHAD, and this is what my trial was about. All those videos and translations and childish bickering over 'Oh, he translated this paragraph' and 'Oh, he edited that sentence,' and all those exhibits revolved around a single issue: Muslims who were defending themselves against American soldiers doing to them exactly what the British did to America. It was made crystal clear at trial that I never, ever plotted to \"kill Americans\" at shopping malls or whatever the story was. The government's own witnesses contradicted this claim, and we put expert after expert up on that stand, who spent hours dissecting my every written word, who explained my beliefs. Further, when I was free, the government sent an undercover agent to prod me into one of their little \"terror plots,\" but I refused to participate. Mysteriously, however, the jury never heard this. So, this trial was not about my position on Muslims killing American civilians. It was about my position on Americans killing Muslim civilians, which is that Muslims should defend their lands from foreign invaders - Soviets, Americans, or Martians. This is what I believe. It's what I've always believed, and what I will always believe. This is not terrorism, and it's not extremism. It's what the arrows on that seal above your head represent: defense of the homeland. So, I disagree with my lawyers when they say that you don't have to agree with my beliefs - no. Anyone with commonsense and humanity has no choice but to agree with me. If someone breaks into your home to rob you and harm your family, logic dictates that you do whatever it takes to expel that invader from your home. But when that home is a Muslim land, and that invader is the US military, for some reason the standards suddenly change. Common sense is renamed \"terrorism\" and the people defending themselves against those who come to kill them from across the ocean become \"the terrorists\" who are \"killing Americans.\" The mentality that America was victimized with when British soldiers walked these streets 2 \u00bd centuries ago is the same mentality Muslims are victimized by as American soldiers walk their streets today. It's the mentality of colonialism. When Sgt. Bales shot those Afghans to death last month, all of the focus in the media was on him-his life, his stress, his PTSD, the mortgage on his home-as if he was the victim. Very little sympathy was expressed for the people he actually killed, as if they're not real, they're not humans. Unfortunately, this mentality trickles down to everyone in society, whether or not they realize it. Even with my lawyers, it took nearly two years of discussing, explaining, and clarifying before they were finally able to think outside the box and at least ostensibly accept the logic in what I was saying. Two years! If it took that long for people so intelligent, whose job it is to defend me, to de-program themselves, then to throw me in front of a randomly selected jury under the premise that they're my \"impartial peers,\" I mean, come on. I wasn't tried before a jury of my peers because with the mentality gripping America today, I have no peers. Counting on this fact, the government prosecuted me - not because they needed to, but simply because they could. I learned one more thing in history class: America has historically supported the most unjust policies against its minorities - practices that were even protected by the law - only to look back later and ask: 'what were we thinking?' Slavery, Jim Crow, the internment of the Japanese during World War II - each was widely accepted by American society, each was defended by the Supreme Court. But as time passed and America changed, both people and courts looked back and asked 'What were we thinking?' Nelson Mandela was considered a terrorist by the South African government, and given a life sentence. But time passed, the world changed, they realized how oppressive their policies were, that it was not he who was the terrorist, and they released him from prison. He even became president. So, everything is subjective - even this whole business of \"terrorism\" and who is a \"terrorist.\" It all depends on the time and place and who the superpower happens to be at the moment. In your eyes, I'm a terrorist, and it's perfectly reasonable that I be standing here in an orange jumpsuit. But one day, America will change and people will recognize this day for what it is. They will look at how hundreds of thousands of Muslims were killed and maimed by the US military in foreign countries, yet somehow I'm the one going to prison for \"conspiring to kill and maim\" in those countries - because I support the Mujahidin defending those people. They will look back on how the government spent millions of dollars to imprison me as a \"terrorist,\" yet if we were to somehow bring Abeer al-Janabi back to life in the moment she was being gang-raped by your soldiers, to put her on that witness stand and ask her who the \"terrorists\" are, she sure wouldn't be pointing at me. The government says that I was obsessed with violence, obsessed with \"killing Americans.\" But, as a Muslim living in these times, I can think of a lie no more ironic. -Tarek Mehanna 4/12/12 Americans arrogantly go about our business as if we should be able to invade, bomb, shoot, drone, topple governments, support dictators -- whatever we want -- and when relatively powerless members of our victim group become angry and fight back, we get all self-righteous and rant about their benighted religion.

The cause of this atrocity was not France's policy towards Muslims or Muslim or Arab countries or anything else like that; the cause was an evil religious ideology. Remember that France opposed the Iraq war, voted for Palestine to be recognised as a observer state at the UN (resolution 67/19). There is nothing anti-Muslim about bombing Daesh in Syria, considering that other Muslim countries, e.g. Jordan, are bombing it too, and that Daesh is a downright evil organisation which needs to be destroyed. It is true that France has some difficulties with integrating integrating immigrant minorities, including Muslims, and members of these minorities face prejudice and discrimination, but that doesn't in any way justify or excuse or explain this act - ask the question, do Muslim countries do a good job of integrating minorities, especially non-Muslim ones? Do minorities (including non-Muslim minorities, or different branches/sects of Islam) face prejudice and discrimination in Muslim countries - yes, and in many cases far worse than Muslims or other immigrants face in France - consider Shi'a and non-Muslims in Saudi Arabia, Baha'is in Iran, Ahmadiyya in Pakistan. The answer to this atrocity is not for France to change its policies in any way, but to respond to Daesh aggression with absolutely merciless annihilation.

And, it is true that ISIS does not have grievances against France that are the same as Islamists (and Muslims per se) have against the United States. But that said, their motives for the Paris terrorism are political. Will McCants (of the Brookings Institute) described their purpose this way: \"I guess if this were just about an attack in Europe, you might say that it is in reprisal for the attacks being carried out in Syria and Iraq. I don't see this as necessarily part of the propaganda effort or the war with al-Qaeda, because they've already succeeded in attracting far, far more recruits.Given the target of a major enemy in Europe, in light of attacks on Russian civilians and an Iranian ally in Lebanon, it seems to me that this has to do with the war to expand its territory in Syria and Iraq.

To quote from the 2004 Report of the Defense Science Board that Rumsfeld commissioned: Today, however, the perception of intimate U.S. support of tyrannies in the Muslim World is perhaps the critical vulnerability in American strategy. It strongly undercuts our message, while strongly promoting that of the enemy. If there is one overarching goal they share, it is the overthrow of what Islamists call the \"apostate\" regimes: the tyrannies of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Jordan, and the Gulf states. They are the main target of the broader Islamist movement, as well as the actual fighter groups. The United States finds itself in the strategically awkward \u2014 and potentially dangerous \u2014 situation of being the longstanding prop and alliance partner of these authoritarian regimes. Without the U.S. these regimes could not survive. And: Muslims do not \"hate our freedom,\" but rather, they hate our policies. The overwhelming majority voice their objections to what they see as one-sided support in favor of Israel and against Palestinian rights, and the longstanding, even increasing support for what Muslims collectively see as tyrannies, most notably Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Pakistan, and the Gulf states. Or: Furthermore, in the eyes of Muslims, American occupation of Afghanistan and Iraq has not led to democracy there, but only more chaos and suffering. U.S. actions appear in contrast to be motivated by ulterior motives, and deliberately controlled in order to best serve American national interests at the expense of truly Muslim self-determination. [...] ..the critical problem in American public diplomacy directed toward the Muslim World ... is a fundamental problem of credibility.

When we do that, we generate terrorists. \"how could the US not simply let the Islamists use the Palestinians as cannon-fodder like they do now, amirite?\" Non sequitur. The U.S. pays for Israel to steal from, oppress and slaughter Palestinians. This pisses of Mulisms and generates more terrorists. \"Do they mean by 'Muslim self-determination' the beheading of Kurds, Yezidis, Shiites, gays, 'uppity' women, alcohol-drinking men/women or something else?\" They mean staying out of their nations' business. When we don't do that we generate more terrorists. \"You see, in most countries of the Western World, people make fun of any and all religions.\" Yes, we do. That's our culture. But when we gleefully heap ridicule on the religious beliefs of a people we are bombing, invading and whose tyrants we support, that pisses them off even more -- and generates more terrorists.

In those terms, Sanders would be far left, the Democrats as a whole somewhere between centre-left/centre/centre-right, the GOP establishment would be right and the Tea Party far right. Now my personal opinion is that the Democrats, overall, is a right political party, mainly based on its attitude to redistribution which places it as something of a social liberal party, though with a huge caveat for its tendency to go along with tough on crime and extended government powers in the name of fighting terrorism. Similarly, social liberal parties in other countries tend to support, for instance, gay marriage and similar \"leftist\" policies in the area of social issues or \"values politics\", while at the same time preferring a relatively small scale of redistribution and lower taxes when it comes economic policies, though still higher levels of taxation/redistribution than classical liberal or libertarian parties. By contrast, conservatism is extremely hard to pin down as it depends far more on the national context, conservatism being a necessarily eclectic ideology (depending on what is there to \"conserve\" to begin with).

When asked during the last debate about her coziness with Wall St., banksters, and the huge corporate donations to her campaign, she claimed Big Money loves her simply because of how she responded to 9/11. The [Editors weren't having it](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/11/16/opinion/hillary-clinton-botches-wall-street-questions.html?_r=0&referer=): Twitter exploded with demands to know what campaign donations from big banks had to do with New York's recovery from 9/11. Answer: little to nothing. Since 2001, she and Bill Clinton have earned more than $125 million for speeches, many of the most lucrative made before financial groups. That does not account for the millions given directly to her campaign, and to political action committees backing her. Nearly 15 years after the 2001 attacks, Mrs. Clinton was earning more than $200,000 for a 20-minute speech. Most of those took place behind guarded doors. But one can guess that she and the financial executives were not still talking about 9/11. She also tossed in the non sequitur that 60% of her campaign donations are from woman, and about that I give not a shit.

Fear-mongering is a very effective political strategy and contrary to popular belief its use is not confined to the right wing. The left in my own country (USA) used it against Dubya, the Indian left uses it against Narendra Modi and Haaretz is using it against Netanyahu. Now, being a leftist (well, at least in the US) I tend to believe that all of these politicians would love to go and establish fascist dictatorships in their respective countries if they could. But history has shown that in order for anyone to take power in that way they have to have overwhelming domestic and especially military backing plus at least some unequivocal international support. Netanyahu does not have any of those things, so implying that he will soon establish a fascist dictatorship and that the next election will be the last one is kind of irresponsible (though given the trajectory that Israeli society (in particular) is on I am not surprised that Haaretz published it, after all I certainly would have).

What if the only blacksmith for miles around catches a fatal disease? The whole village suffers, so there are indeed victims of Heinrich Smith's infidelity. And if Heinrich is having sex with a man, it's even more likely he'll get sick. Drugs harm the person using them, and the whole village will suffer if the only miller snorts himself into a coma. For a crime to be truly victimless, it has to actually not do any harm to anyone, not just only harm the person engaging in it. - I don't care about extramarital/homosexual sex or drug use now, so long as only the person(s) doing it only harm each other, because people are easily replaceable. And besides, some of that is fun; we all have our vices. But if we are on a colony ship with only 50 humans and absolutely everyone needs to survive in order for anyone to survive, the rules will be different.

The Depression bottomed in 1933, and sharply turned around with the implementation of the New Deal. Things steadily improved until 1937, where GDP and earnings were similar to the pre-Depression high (recovery in unemployment was not as dramatic, but it was improving). The reversal of policies from budget cuts (since things seemed to be going well, and opponents gonna oppose) led to promptly worsening conditions. Some New Deal-ish policies were instituted in response, and things started recovering again, but things only clearly got better than 1937 a few years later from the buildup and entry to WWII (the largest deficit spending, lowest unemployment, and fastest GDP growth in US history). The what is easily conveyed, and the why can be summed up rather simply. But some people think that ideology is preferable to research as a source of information on the past, so political opinions are notoriously difficult to sway.

Several years ago he could have won when economics and inequality were on everyone's mind but now that popular discourse has shifted to social issues he will no longer stand a chance. To many of you, the protesters at places like Mizzou and other universities are justified in both their anger and their demands, but to most of the electorate in this country, they look like a nightmare strait out of the 1970s, except this time thankfully without the violence. It is foolish to believe that the majority of this country has moved on from those years of societal chaos. I was not alive during the seventies but almost every single person who I know well who was alive during that decade still votes with those years in the back of their mind. Or so I have deduced; after all I cannot imagine why my father and bunch of other people who I know who are center left, would have voted for Bush Sr. in 1988 if they didn't have those memories floating around in the back of their head. Mark my words if he goes up against anyone but Trump this election will end the same way as the Bush-Dukakis election.

If Trump, any Democrat will win. - I suspect he is. Voters here as elsewhere are looking for a candidate with a moral center. The other question ought to be 'is Hillary Clinton electable?' I find her appeal as a candidate simply incomprehensible. If she is the nominee she will generate no enthusiasm and many Democratic leaning voters will simply stay home. Hillary is exactly the opposite of what voters seem to be looking for now, a candidate who changes positions at will based on the results of the latest polls and focus groups. - [Smerdis of Tl\u00f6n](/wiki/User:Smerdis_of_Tl%C3%B6n), [LOAD \"*\", 8, 1](/wiki/User_talk:Smerdis_of_Tl%C3%B6n). 17:18, 21 November 2015 (UTC) - I agree with Smerdis. With Hillary's recent Anti-ISIL strategy of more broad bombing and ground troops (which could mean the more rationale position of using special forces) I would probably not turn out in support, but in fear of anyone the Republicans choose. I definitely disagree that people aren't thinking about income inequality; it's more of the establishment Democrats don't care or even favor the status qou.-- [Owlman](/wiki/User:Owlman)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Owlman)) 17:31, 21 November 2015 (UTC) - I agree with Smerdis and Owlman. If people did not care about income inequality and how the system seems rigged - not only against the poor but also against the other socioeconomically disadvantaged such as women and black people - Bernie Sanders would not now be polling at around 30% in the democratic primary. While it's true that he currently isn't polling as well among minority voters, I believe the reason is due to a lack of focus instead of a lack of ability. And as the state primaries draw nearer, he will improve that focus accordingly. - As far as the general election goes, I also agree with the sentiment that Hillary Clinton would possibly have a more difficult time than Bernie Sanders. No one actually seems that excited about her beyond \"first female president\", whereas Bernie actually seems to be drawing the same kind of heart-felt enthusiasm that Barack Obama did in 2008. And whereas she has been mired in mostly manufactured controversies over the past 20 years, he's a bit fresher on the scene and has shown in his recent speech on democratic socialism that he can defend himself just as well as she can. Hell, he's linked his policies to FDR and the economic views espoused by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., which is more than she has done to justify and explain the context behind her positions. - People's feelings on either side of the primary seem to be that a vote for Hillary would mostly just be a shoe-in vote against the Republicans while a vote for Bernie is actually a vote for Bernie and the types of policies they would actually like to see implemented. And I think that that kind of enthusiasm could make all the difference in the general election. People who normally don't vote would engage in the process - some of them for the very first time after years or even a decade or more of inaction - and increase the voter turnout, leading to bigger gains for the Democrats in Congress than they would probably see otherwise.

That was a huge part of why the Dems were so successful that year -- his rallying of the youth/activist/antiwar vote, the people who wanted to see a saner US foreign policy, an alternative to the Republican Party of War. While he has a handful of praiseworthy accomplishments -- ending legalised torture, the nukes treaty with Iraq, and Cuba come to mind -- Obama has largely done the opposite of what he said he would do. Instead, he has radically expanded drone warfare; has been unable to meaningfully end either war in Iraq or Afghanistan, expanded state surveillance of the citzenry, and has stuck his successor not only with ISIS and a shooting war in Syria, but also the clusterfuck that is Yemen, and the clusterfuck that is Libya. The Dems cannot run hard against Obama's record (especially so Clinton) and present the people who were a big part of his success with a viable alternative to a permanent war footing and continued erosion of domestic rights. Look for a lot of the college kids and other active types who rang doorbells and manned phone banks to stay home next year. Peace.

I absolutely hate how they stayed home during the midterms last year. But this is a presidential election year, and for once they actually have a candidate who is actually representing the things that they've been complaining about all of this time. They seem to be just as fired up and ready to go now as they were for Obama in 2008, and their candidate is telling them at every chance he gets that he needs their help. And they repeat that fact to their critics and their allies alike non-stop. - You're going to need a lot more than just something that amounts to \"lazy kids\" if you want to convince people to disbelieve the signs that are out there. I hate their apathy too, but I can't deny the enthusiasm and self-critique that I've seen coming from them over the past few months, which has translated to Bernie Sanders thus far reaching 30% in the polls after all of the more cynical people like the two of us said that he probably wouldn't even make it that far. And yes, I was cynical about his chances too. But I've since changed my opinion in light of all of that. [Eoan](/wiki/User:Eoan)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Eoan)) 07:43, 22 November 2015 (UTC) - And as far as the foreign policy goes, I think that Bernie Sanders has that base covered better than Hillary Clinton does as far as it applies to the youth vote without also pissing off the establishment. He has acknowledged that we probably won't be able to completely avoid getting involved in conflict, and his proposal to deal with that is to create an international organization like NATO with the sole purpose of fighting terrorism and addressing its root causes. He said that Russia and the Middle Eastern countries will be invited in, and that he will press for the later to lead the effort against ISIL with the western world providing support. - I honestly think it's a brilliant idea because it would allow countries like Sweden and Finland to join in the initiative without having to go through the difficult political discussions at home about the possibility of joining NATO, not to mention its potential to help diffuse the tension with Russia. And I think that younger voters would be willing to accept those positions because of how they perceive Hillary Clinton's proposals to be more \"hawkish\", as it were. [Eoan](/wiki/User:Eoan)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Eoan)) 07:55, 22 November 2015 (UTC) - Bernie Sanders strikes me as being the last angry man and not much else, while Hillary Clinton is a slimy snake who wouldn't know integrity if it slapped her in the face.

There would be no point in prepping for them; take a nuclear war, mankind would be stuck underground and eventually run out of food before radiation levels went down to safe levels.

This point is actually often raised by the (likely majority of) preppers who are of the militia/libertarian/freemen persuation - they see it as an example of how hard-working John Galts like themselves are having their work stolen from them by the NWO. Meanwhile, emergency hoarding legislation exists equally - if not entirely - to prevent large freelance entities such as the armed forces, religious organisations (especially those that own compounds and guns), various corporations and even that same guv'mint from hoarding supplies. It's a legislation that aims to redistribute to individual families from whoever has it gathering dust, no matter how many guns they have to claim it's theirs. Though I put very, very little stock in any zombie apocalypse concept (to put it nicely), there is a general point to be made about numbers in any massive catastrophy event - as Penn & Teller put it (paraphrased); \"In these catastrophy scenarios, people always claim that 90-95% of the population of the world is gonna die, yet they never figure that they are gonna end up among the bodies.

Ironically, this said friend is a hardcore New Ager who claims to be so spiritual, enlightened, and pro-Eastern Wisdom compared to everyone else.

Not all of [this essay](https://medium.com/bad-words/how-the-left-failed-liberalism-6f8ed02ebb55#.yhyoj5j9s) speaks for me. (Certainly in an American context I am far more left than right and do not remotely wish to see a \"balance\" between the two; the right in the U.S. is a freak show.) But this is true: What I will call the New Leftism has recently fought tooth and nail for the noble cause of...gender free bathrooms. But it has been notably ineffective at mobilizing towards a single goal which truly matters in broad political or economic terms (yes: that means to the average household). The harsh truth is this. While you might win gender-free bathrooms, without a government to invest in the sets of rights and obligations that underpin them (for example, the actual bathrooms, the roads, the electricity, the taxes, the courts, etc), such a victory is merely an exercise in vanity. ... What do religious fundamentalists, gated-community dwelling wannabe oligarchs, and New Leftists have in common? A lot more than you might think at first: all want to approve the books their neighbours read, the films they watch, the words they say, the signs in their backyards. All want safe spaces, where threats cannot intrude. All want control over culture as it is \u2014 not to reorder society with a new set of institutions entirely (i.e., basic income, debt-free education, open universities, whatever). Surveillance states want \"protest free zones\", and Political Correctness wants \"safe spaces\". Evangelicals want warning labels on everything, New Leftists want \"trigger warnings\". ... Why is it that college organizers can organize no-platforms (i.e., ban) speakers they find threatening...for crimes against the people like using the wrong language, terms, phrases...but not organize actual large-scale political demonstrations against serious issues that matter? Can you remember the last time there was a series of huge marches on Washington for a single issue solely concerning youngs...who are borked like no generation in modern history? I can't.

People have to accept and agree with any defense/argument that's put out there...? - Dendlai, it's absolutely unhinged to see anything racist in Erika's email. To think reacting by demanding the woman's resignation is reasonable, to reject all her overtures to smooth things over -- to react as if all of that is other than outrageous is itself outragous. In the 60s and 70s college students fought to be treated like adults and not have the university behave as in loco parentis. Now, some of you want to bring the nannies back, not to patrol sex lives and partying, but rather to act as if the KKK might be lurking in College Masters at Yale. You know, there is an actual problem with white supremacy booming in the U.S., but it isn't fucking at Yale. Jesus.-- - (yeah I got hit by that too, looks like we were all editing at the same time). The situation is even more ludicrous online, because-- with things like Anita Sarkeesian's videos, for example, which have that same reaction from these types of people, these guys could just... Y'know. Not watch them, if it upsets them so much? It's a really weird trend. It's a little more understandable when it's happening on colleges, but most of the aggression I've heard about has seem to have been caused by... The people complaining about criticism being censorship. - - [re-adding 'cause an edit by Paravant removed it] Nothing I've read about this thing talks about people being assaulted or spat on. The worst thing mentioned in the linked articles is \"yelled at\". \"Criticized\" is the common thing, which thin-skinned people, it seems, can't handle. - Presumably because they're expecting freedom from being assaulted in the name of \"safe spaces\"? - \"The Dean of the College Office/Office of Student Life\" and so on. Seems like the kind of people who should talk about this. That some thin-skinned students took it as an order (illiteracy), and instead of arguing just... Didn't want to think, is a bit sad. Why is it whenever people cricize things they consider racist/homophobic/etc, they're accused of wanting to stop free speech? Because that's what I see more often than not: people confusing free speech with freedom from criticism. - So where was the part where that excused the PC brigade from, by letter of the law, assaulting people who attended a conference? I don't believe there's an \"I'm offended\" defense for spitting on people. - Well, you missed the parts of her e-mail discussing appropriation in a rather inane way. But furthermore, you underscore what's so bad about her e-mail: The original e-mail, literally, just asked students to think. Erika then goes on to say \"No! Don't let people ask you to think! Instead, think!\". Huh? Nothing about the original was the university telling people what they could wear. It was just a lot of people whined that \"I don't want to think... Why is the university telling me what to do?\" - That wasn't her email at all. Erika's email was \"I don't know what costume is right or wrong, only that I shouldn't mandate right or wrong. Think for yourselves, like grown-ups. Because if the university can tell you 'no offensive outfits', nothing prevents the university from telling you 'no miniskirts'.\" - (ec) The triviality of the issues involved (Halloween costumes? Really?) is annoying, but isn't the real problem. It's the focusing of so much bitterness at soft targets that annoys me more than anything else. Every one of these fusses underlines the general helplessness and powerlessness of the left in the USA. If I were an evil right wing mastermind, I'd make sure that identity politics and labelling kept the left divided and perennially agitated over silly symbolic stuff. It's just like keeping the rubes whose grievances are genuine stirred up about gays, guns, abortion, and Jesus. The more worked up they get about that stuff, the less they'll focus on us. - FFS, students were demanding the resignations of both Erika and her husband. Hundreds [signed a letter](http://downatyale.com/post.php?id=430) totally mischaracterizing her email and then denouncing her for crimes she didn't commit. At a rally about this manufactered controversy a student declares she wants an apology and that Erika's email means Yale is: \"not a home. It is no longer a safe space for me. And I find that incredibly depressing. This was once a space that I was proud to be a part of because of the loving community.\" This was a popular sentiment. Is this a toddler, or a young adult?-- [-Mona-](/wiki/User:-Mona-) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:-Mona-)) 06:41, 1 December 2015 (UTC) - It's because the Christakises (Christakes?) were overly tactless in their approach to a request that white Yale students not dress in blackface, wear Native American regalia, or other Halloween costumes that are racially insensitive and they were doing so in their position as Resident Faculty. Maybe this student expected Yale not to house people who think that blackface is freedom of expression instead of you completely disregarding someone's emotional state over being told that \"racism is a form of free speech\".\u2014Ryulong ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Ryulong)) 07:27, 1 December 2015 (UTC) - [EC]Dunno the number of students asking for her or her husbands resignation (and the articles are veeeery vague on that). The letter you link to doesn't mischaracterise her e-mail in my opinion, but is a pretty good description of what she said (and doesn't ask for any resignations, it just states the signatories views on Erika's letter and behaviour). The one manufacturing the controversy was, definitely, Erika. An e-mail was sent out asking students to think, no more, no less. Erika and others go on a rampage claiming \"censorship\". Uh. No. And debates about safe spaces I've found to be generally meaningless, since people overall don't know what the concept means and make up straw men to debate it (as an aside: asking for a college campus to be free of racism isn't something I think is too much to ask. Really).

Last election, we barely even had one because nobody was that interested in running. Currently, David is the only active RW user on the board, with one user explicitly resigned recently, one retired and two mostly inactive. Of our officers, both are LANCB users. So David is functionally the only person on the board. The question has been raised if we should even have elections for it (since the position, while largely not very active, has potential major responsibilities), or if we should just have David appoint people who are interested and he thinks would be good, which would morph into the board sustaining itsef. So... opinions before we restart the electioneering again?-- [\"Paravant\"](/wiki/User:Paravant) [Talk](/wiki/User_talk:Paravant) & [Contribs](/wiki/Special:Contributions/Paravant) 05:23, 1 December 2015 (UTC) - I'm on the board.

No need to worry. @EmeraldCityWanderer What? I stated the truth. Do note that Castaigne didn't deny it. He long ago told me he's not pro-Israel; my documentation of facts unflattering to Zionism are not why he's hostile to me (or so he says). No. He said he hates Zionists and Palestinians both and thinks the best \"solution\" would be for them all to die. On my archived talk page: This is kind of funny, considering I am not a Zionist. My actual favored solution is for one side to genocide the other, so this conflict ends permanently - and I don't care which side does it. Or, we could turn the entire area and the surrounding 100 miles into a glass plain. That would successfully conclude the argument for BOTH sides... And here, he's said he loathes idealists. Well, that's pretty much me. And finally, you should know by now that I can back up my claims, and when I've erred I promptly admit it. For example, I once said Castaigne called me a \"cunt.\" He didn't. It was 142BoN he called a \" mincing fucking cunt.\" On the Zionism talk page; I was part of the discussion. But it was not me he hurled that gem at. So, I have conceded I misremembered his gross behavior as having applied to me, when it was another. He's a crank, and a pretty malignant one.-- [-Mona-](/wiki/User:-Mona-) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:-Mona-)) 02:38, 1 January 2016 (UTC) - It's a shame that Rationalwikiwiki no longer exists so that the uninvolved can keep track of all this.
