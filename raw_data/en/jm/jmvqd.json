They work to remove obstacles to health a nd stimulate self -healing mechanisms. Naturopathic education in cludes training in the same biomedical and diagnostic sciences as allopathic (MD) and osteopathic (DO) physicians. In addition, NDs learn nutrition, botanical medicine, and traditional global healing methods. NDs are trained to treat the whole person \u2014their treatment protocols are tailored to suit each patient and place a strong emphasis on preventive care , nutrition, and self -care. Naturopathic P hysicians collaborate with other branches of medicine and refer patients to conventional healthcare practitione rs as needed. Although new to many Americans, naturopathic medicine began in the late 19th century and came into its own in the United States in the early 1900s. Education & Licensure To practice as an ND , you must attend a naturopathic medical school accredited by the Council on Naturopathic Medical Education (CNME ). Students must complete a 4 year medical program after their undergraduate degree. Graduates of these medical program s are eligible to practice in any state in which they meet the licensing requirements. Not all states allow naturopathic physicians to practice the full scope of their field. Even in states where naturopathic is not fully recognized, NDs can still practice but will be limited to the treatments allowed by the state. NDs must also pass a board exam (the NPLEX) to be eligible for licensure at the end of their training. Preparation Generally naturopathic schools expect to see you have spent time observing (shadowing) a naturopath ic physician and/or a holistic healer (e.g. an acupuncturist or ayurvedic healer) . Naturopathic schools seek applicants who are curious, capable, flexible, and imaginative who also have empathy and integrity. As several of the healing methods used by naturopaths are based in traditional healing met hods, a healthy respect for the variety of cultures in the world is needed. Prospective students should also have a strong belief in the efficacy of natural medicine. Also highly recommended are anatomy and physiology, biochemistry, botany, developmental p sychology, biomedical ethics, philosophy of science, and public speaking. All required courses m ust have a minimum grade of C. Additional information on each college's requirements can be found on their websites.
