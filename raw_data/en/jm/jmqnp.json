For Texans receiving the vaccine through Baylor Scott & White, all second doses will be administered within the clinically recommended six-week window, and as close as possible to the 21-day (Pfizer) or 28-day (Moderna) guidance. An 8-week interval may be optimal for some people age 12 years and older, especially for males age 12 to 39 years. A shorter interval (three weeks for Pfizer-BioNTech; four weeks for Moderna) between the first and second doses remains the recommended interval for: people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised; adults age 65 years and older; and others who need rapid protection due to increased concern about community transmission or risk of severe disease. - What do I do if I miss my vaccination appointment or need to reschedule?

Your MyBSWHealth account can also help you get virtual care for a variety of health needs. You can also schedule a same-day appointment or begin an [eVisit](/specialties/virtual-care)through the app. Receiving the COVID-19 vaccine - Do I need the COVID-19 vaccine if I've already had COVID? Yes. People who have gotten sick with COVID-19 may still benefit from getting vaccinated. Due to the severe health risks associated with COVID-19, and the fact that re-infection with COVID-19 is possible, people may be advised to get a COVID-19 vaccine even if they have been sick with COVID-19 before. However, if you have active symptoms of COVID-19, it is not recommended you get the vaccine until you are no longer symptomatic. In addition, if you have received convalescent plasma or monoclonal antibodies as part of a positive COVID-19 treatment, it is recommended you wait 90 days to receive the vaccine. - I'd like to receive the (Pfizer/Johnson & Johnson/Novavax vaccine specifically. Can you schedule me with a location having this specific vaccine? We are receiving allocations of Pfizer and Moderna, but cannot guarantee a particular vaccine's availability at a particular site, as the state determines where vaccines are distributed. Please continue to check our website and your MyBSWHealth account for the latest updates. At this time, we do not have supplies of the J&J or Novavax vaccines. - Do both doses of an mRNA vaccine need to be from the same manufacturer? Yes. If you received the first dose of a two-dose vaccine from one manufacturer (Pfizer or Moderna), you must receive the second dose from the same manufacturer. - Which lasts longer: immunity from getting COVID-19 or protection from the COVID-19 vaccines? The protection someone gains from having an infection (called \"natural immunity\") varies depending on the disease, and it varies from person to person. Because this virus is new, we don't know how long natural immunity might last. Current evidence suggests that getting the virus again (reinfection) is uncommon in the 90 days after the first infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. We won't know how long immunity lasts after vaccination until we have more data on how well COVID-19 vaccines work in real-world conditions. Experts are working to learn more about both natural immunity and vaccine-induced immunity. CDC will keep the public informed as new evidence becomes available. - Do I need to wear a mask and avoid close contact with others if I have gotten two doses of the vaccine? Yes. Not enough information is currently available to say if or when CDC will stop recommending that people wear masks and avoid close contact with others to help prevent the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. Experts need to understand more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide in real-world conditions before making that decision. Other factors, including how many people get vaccinated and how the virus is spreading in communities, will also affect this decision. We also don't yet know whether getting a COVID-19 vaccine will prevent you from spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to other people, even if you don't get sick yourself. While experts learn more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide under real-life conditions, it will be important for everyone to continue: - Wearing a mask over your nose and mouth - Staying at least 6 feet away from others - Avoiding crowds - Avoiding poorly ventilated spaces - Washing your hands often - Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time as another vaccine? Yes, COVID-19 vaccines and other immunizations may now be administered without regard to timing. This includes simultaneous administration of COVID-19 vaccines and other vaccines on the same day, as well a co-administration within 14 days. About the COVID-19 vaccine - How do I know the COVID-19 vaccine is safe? Approving safe vaccines and making sure they work is up to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC Advisory Committee and other groups look at available information about a vaccine and make informed decisions about the risks and benefits of using it. We also have an internal team of experts who review available data before we recommend it. - Can the COVID-19 vaccine make me sick with COVID-19? No. None of the authorized and recommended [COVID-19 vaccines or COVID-19 vaccines currently in development in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines.html)contain the live virus that causes COVID-19. This means that a COVID-19 vaccine cannot make you sick with COVID-19. There are several different types of vaccines in development. All of them teach our immune systems how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19. Sometimes this process can cause symptoms, such as fever. These symptoms are normal and are a sign that the body is building protection against the virus that causes COVID-19. Learn more about [how COVID-19 vaccines work](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/how-they-work.html). It typically takes a few weeks for the body to build immunity (protection against the virus that causes COVID-19) after vaccination. That means it's possible a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and still get sick. This is because the vaccine has not had enough time to provide protection. - Will a COVID-19 vaccine alter my DNA? No. COVID-19 vaccines do not change or interact with your DNA in any way. The vaccines teach our cells how to make a protein that triggers an immune response. They cannot affect or interact with our DNA in any way. Instead, COVID-19 vaccines work with the body's natural defenses to safely develop immunity to disease.

The Food and Drug Administration and Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices review the safety data for vaccines. We also have an internal team of experts who review available data. We will have more details and data to share as specific vaccine information is published. Side effects that have been reported with the vaccines include: - Injection site pain - Tiredness - Headache - Muscle pain - Chills - Joint pain - Fever - Injection site swelling - Injection site redness - Nausea - Feeling unwell - Swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) There is a remote chance the COVID-19 vaccine could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to one hour after getting a dose of the vaccine. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include difficulty breathing, swelling of your face and throat, a fast heartbeat, a bad rash all over your body, dizziness and weakness. For information on adverse reactions, please review the FDA fact sheets for the [Moderna vaccine](https://www.fda.gov/media/144638/download)and/or the [Pfizer vaccine](https://www.fda.gov/media/167212/download). Special note: On April 24, 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration recommended resuming use of the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine for persons 18 years of age and older in the U.S., as the benefits outweigh the risks. However, based on guidance from the CDC and FDA, women under the age of 50 should be aware of this rare adverse event and know that there are other COVID-19 vaccine options available for which this risk has not been seen. According to the CDC, there is a plausible causal relationship between J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and a rare and serious adverse event\u2014blood clots with low platelets (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS). This adverse event is rare, occurring at a rate of about seven per 1 million vaccinated women between 18 and 49 years old. For women 50 years and older and men of all ages, this adverse event is even more rare. For three weeks after receiving the vaccine, you should be on the lookout for possible symptoms of a blood clot with low platelets. These include: - Severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision - Shortness of breath - Chest pain - Leg swelling - Persistent abdominal pain - Easy bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin beyond the injection site Seek medical care right away if you develop one or more of these symptoms and inform your provider if you have received the J&J COVID 19 vaccine and the date. As with any vaccine, if you experience an emergency, call 911 or go to the nearest hospital. - Do the COVID-19 vaccines have any bad drug interactions? For information on adverse reactions, please review the FDA fact sheets for the [Moderna vaccine](https://www.fda.gov/media/144638/download), [Pfizer vaccine,](https://www.fda.gov/media/167212/download) [Johnson & Johnson](https://www.fda.gov/media/146305/download)and [Novavax](https://www.fda.gov/media/159897/download)vaccines. - If I've had severe allergic reactions to vaccines in the past, can I get the COVID-19 vaccine? Possibly. However, if you have had severe reactions in the past to IV medications or vaccines, you will need to be observed for 30 minutes post-vaccination. If you are receiving a two-dose vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna), the second dose is not recommended if you have a severe allergic reaction to the first dose. If you have an immediate allergic reaction to the first dose, we recommend you speak with your physician before proceeding with the second dose. - Is the COVID-19 vaccine safe for pregnant and breastfeeding women? According to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, pregnant and breastfeeding women are not excluded from receiving the vaccine, but they should consult their physician prior to being vaccinated. - Is it a live vaccine? None of the COVID-19 vaccines currently in development in the United States use the live virus that causes COVID-19. There are several different types of vaccines in development. However, the goal for each of them is to teach our immune systems how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19. Sometimes this process can cause symptoms, such as fever. These symptoms are normal and are a sign that the body is building immunity. Learn more about [how COVID-19 vaccines work](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/how-they-work.html). About vaccines in children - Is the COVID-19 vaccine safe for children? Yes. The FDA and the CDC have determined that the known and potential benefits of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in individuals 6 months of age and older outweigh the known and potential risks, supporting the vaccine's use in kids. The pediatric vaccines are a smaller dosage. For more information, [view our vaccine resource guide](/-/media/project/bsw/sites/bswhealth/documents/covid19/covid-19-vax-algorithm.pdf?sc_lang=en&hash=164C3509B64947B272A81A7E469FDDAA). [You can also visit the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html). - Are pediatric vaccines the same dosage in all age groups? Dosing depends on your age and vaccine brand. To learn more, [visit the CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/children-teens.html). About the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine - I had the J&J COVID-19 vaccine. Should I be concerned? What should I do? According to the CDC, there is a plausible causal relationship between J&J/Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine and a rare and serious adverse event\u2014blood clots with low platelets (thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, or TTS). However, after reviewing all available safety data, the CDC and FDA recommend use of this vaccine resume given that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks. This adverse event is rare, occurring at a rate of about 7 per 1 million vaccinated women between 18 and 49 years old. For women 50 years and older and men of all ages, this adverse event is even more rare. For three weeks after receiving the vaccine, you should be on the lookout for possible symptoms of a blood clot with low platelets. These include: - Severe or persistent headaches or blurred vision - Shortness of breath - Chest pain - Leg swelling - Persistent abdominal pain - Easy bruising or tiny blood spots under the skin beyond the injection site Seek medical care right away if you develop one or more of these symptoms and inform your provider if you have received the J&J COVID 19 vaccine and the date. As with any vaccine, if you experience an emergency, call 911 or go to the nearest hospital. Be sure to review the revised [fact sheet](https://www.fda.gov/media/146305/download). - Why did the pause end? After a thorough review of all available data, the CDC, FDA and ACIP overwhelmingly agreed that the benefits of the J&J vaccine far outweigh the risks for those recommended to receive it. The pause allowed the CDC to communicate with healthcare providers and re-emphasize the importance of reporting severe events in people who have received this vaccine, as well as how to report such events. The pause also gave experts time to carefully review all available data and conduct a risk-benefit analysis around the use of this vaccine. Detecting these rare adverse events tells us that the systems in place to monitor the safety of these vaccines are working. - Are there safety concerns with the other vaccines? No. According to the CDC, there are no known safety issues with the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines after more than 210 million doses administered as of April 23, 2021. The vaccine and individuals who are pregnant, breastfeeding or trying to get pregnant - I'm pregnant. Should I get the COVID-19 vaccine? For most people, getting the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible is the safest choice. The information in this section will help you make an informed choice about whether to get the vaccine while you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant. - What should pregnant patients know about COVID-19 and the vaccines? COVID-19 seems to cause more harm in pregnant women than in women of the same age who are not pregnant. The risks of getting a COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy are thought to be small but are not totally known. You should consider your own personal risk of getting COVID-19. If your personal risk is high, or there are many cases of COVID-19 in your community, it probably makes sense for you to get the vaccine while pregnant. But whether to get the vaccine during pregnancy is your choice. - What are the benefits of getting the COVID-19 vaccine? COVID-19 is dangerous. It is more dangerous for pregnant women as COVID-19 patients who are pregnant are three times more likely to end up in the intensive care unit (ICU), three times more likely to be on a ventilator and at increased risk of dying due to COVID-19. There is an increased risk of stillbirth and preterm birth. The COVID-19 vaccine will prevent the vast majority of COVID-19 infections. As COVID-19 infections go up in our communities, your risk of getting COVID-19 goes up too. The COVID-19 vaccine has no live virus. The COVID-19 vaccine does NOT contain ingredients that are known to be harmful to pregnant women or to the fetus. Many vaccines are routinely given during pregnancy and are safe (for example: tetanus, diphtheria and flu). A study published recently in [The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology](https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378%2821%2900187-3/fulltext)shows the vaccines are not only safe and effective for pregnant and breastfeeding women, but they may also offer some protection for their babies. When researchers compared the antibody levels to those of women who had been sick with COVID-19 during pregnancy, the antibody levels in response to the vaccine were higher. But perhaps the most exciting discovery: Antibodies were also found in umbilical cord blood and breast milk. - What do the experts recommend for pregnant and breastfeeding patients and those trying to conceive? COVID-19 is very dangerous and can spread very easily. Because of this, the vaccine is recommended for those pregnant and breastfeeding and those trying to conceive (including those undergoing fertility treatment). - The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine strongly recommends that pregnant individuals have access to COVID-19 vaccines. They recommend that each person have a discussion with their healthcare professional about their own personal choice. - The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that the COVID-19 vaccine should not be withheld from pregnant individuals who meet criteria for vaccination. - Because there are no studies of pregnant women yet, there are no clear recommendations for pregnant women. This is standard for any new drug and not due to any particular concern with COVID-19 vaccines. [The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology](https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378%2821%2900187-3/fulltext)shows the vaccines are not only safe and effective for pregnant and breastfeeding women, but they may also offer some protection for their babies. - What are the risks of getting a COVID-19 vaccine? The COVID-19 vaccine has not yet been tested in pregnant women. Together, the vaccines were tested in over 70,000 people and there were no serious side effects. Although they were not tested in pregnant women, some who received a vaccine in the clinical trials did get pregnant. There have been no reports of any problems with these pregnancies, and they are continuing to be monitored. We do not have data on whether the vaccines work as well in pregnancy as it did in the study of non-pregnant individuals. Be aware that people getting the vaccine will probably have some side effects. Although there were no serious side effects reported, many people had some side effects within three days of getting a vaccine, including injection site reactions like sore arm, fatigue, headache, chills and fever. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends using acetaminophen during pregnancy if you have a fever (temperature > 100.8). This medication is safe to use during pregnancy and does not affect how the vaccine works. - What else should I think about to help me decide? Make sure you understand as much as you can about COVID-19 and about the vaccine. Ask a trusted source, like your doctor. Also, think about your own personal risk of getting sick from COVID-19. If you are at a higher risk of getting COVID-19, it probably makes sense to get the vaccine. - What about breastfeeding? The Academy for Breastfeeding Medicine reports that there is no reason to believe that the vaccine affects the safety of breast milk. When we have an infection or get a vaccine, our bodies make antibodies to fight the infection. Antibodies formed from vaccines given during pregnancy do pass into the breast milk and then to the baby to help prevent infections. Since the vaccine does not contain the virus, there is no risk of breast milk containing the virus. - What if I am thinking about becoming pregnant or actively trying to become pregnant? Experts recommend patients who are planning to conceive or undergoing fertility treatment should be offered a vaccine based on CDC eligibility criteria. Since the vaccine is not a live virus, there is no reason to delay pregnancy attempts because of vaccination administration or to defer treatment until the second dose has been administered.
