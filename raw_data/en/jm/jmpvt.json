I am interested in how we can apply fundamental concepts in chemistry, aided by computational and statistical tools, to understand biomolecular recognition, specifically protein-protein interactions, and the factors driving their specificity. My doctoral research done at NCBS focused on using molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structure and dynamics of Toll-like receptor (TLR) proteins, an important component of immune signaling. During my postdoctoral research, I moved on to study repebodies, protein-based scaffolds comprised of leucine-rich repeats, that specifically bind to different regions (epitopes) on the interleukin-6 (IL-6) protein. We developed a computational method, Epibin, to group these repebodies into bins based on their epitopes. Our work on this led us to form a hypothesis about the residues driving their specificity, which was confirmed using in vitro experiments. This study was extended to antigen-antibody interactions, which are a type of protein-protein interactions. Antibodies serve as a valuable model system for investigating binding specificity due to their high variability and diverse specificities. As part of the team behind the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB), I attempted to investigate the contributions of various sequence-based and 3D structure-based features in correctly predicting which antibodies are likely to bind to the same epitope. Using different combinations of these features, we tested the performance of machine learning classifiers on different datasets of antigen-antibody complexes to accurately predict pairs of antibodies targeting the same epitope. In addition to the IEDB, I have also been involved with the Coronavirus Immunotherapeutic Consortium, a global consortium, to systematically analyze anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for identifying relationships between different types of functional properties and to understand which antibody features best correlate with, and in turn, predict their protection. In this presentation, I will discuss about the projects I have worked on and what we can learn from these findings. Apart from my research, I will also discuss about my experiences as a person with profound hearing loss and explain the crucial importance of early identification of hearing loss and its role in developing spoken language skills. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Remarkably, the frequency of recurrence of infections in the urinary tract is markedly higher than in any other mucosal tract. The underlying reason is an aberrant adaptive immune response which fails to completely clear bladder bacteria, allowing intracellular bacterial persistence for long periods of time. We attribute this defect to the en masse exfoliation of bladder superficial epithelial cells, a unique phenomenon that invariably occurs during urinary tract infections (UTIs), which exposes the underlying tissue to toxic salts, urea and ammonia in urine. We have discovered that the adaptive immune response, particularly the Th2 response, plays a hither to unappreciated role in driving bladder epithelial recovery. We have found that with each successive UTI, the Th2 driven bladder epithelial repair machinery becomes activated and more adept at rapid epithelial repair. However, this hyper response is at the expense of Th1 immune response which is essential to achieve bacterial clearance from the bladder. Thus, there appears to be a cycle of bacterial infection followed by incomplete bacterial clearance leading to reinfection. We have found that we can break this cycle of bladder infection and reinfection by vaccinating the bladder with an efficacious bacterial vaccine along with a Th1-driving adjuvant which promotes efficient bacterial clearance without impeding efficient bladder repair. Vaccinating the bladder using a catheter is a novel but powerful strategy to prevent recurrent of UTIs, at least in animal model systems. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Light sensing systems are highly diverse in function and physiology and have evolved multiple times under varying selective pressures. While visual systems have been studied extensively, light sensing can occur in an extraocular manner as well and extraocular light sensing is grossly understudied despite its abundance. We have discovered that the planarian flatworm is an excellent model organism for the study of extraocular light sensing systems. Although primarily known for their remarkable regenerative ability, planarians possess multiple light sensory systems with distinct characteristics, varying functions, and dynamic interactions. Their visual system consists of simple cup-shaped eyes coupled to a brain. These eyes are capable of sensing visible light and can also efficiently discriminate small differences in light intensity. Planarians also exhibit UV light avoidance mediated by photoreceptor cells dispersed all over their bodies. This response is robust, reflex-like, and persists even after decapitation of these worms. These photoreceptors in addition to mediating movement are also capable of arousing animals from sleep-like states during which they are unresponsive to visible light. This thesis presents the discovery of yet another extraocular light sensing system in planarians, capable of mediating visible light avoidance in eyeless worms. This behavior is driven by a small array of photoreceptors located in their brains. The nature of the opsin sensor and the photoreceptor driving this behavior have also been explored in this thesis. Interestingly, in addition to mediating phototaxis, these photoreceptors also regulate asexual reproduction by fission in planarians. Finally, this thesis also presents the development of an optical RNA biosensor that has been used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. These sensors were developed in response to the global Covid-19 pandemic. They were used to develop a method that presents a simple yet accurate color/luminescencebased assay for diagnosing Covid-19 that can be deployed even in low-resource settings. Overall, the work in this thesis serves to advance our understanding of extraocular light sensing systems but also identifies multiple opsin proteins with interesting properties. This also paves the way for the development of these proteins as optogenetic tools using synthetic biology based approaches. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| The process of hematopoiesis is known to be orchestrated by inputs from the nervous system. For example, the sympathetic nervous system guides the mobility of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to and from the bone marrow. This demonstrates the reliance of the blood system on neurotransmitters for manifesting downstream functions. While we appreciate the signaling aspect of neurotransmitters during hematopoiesis, an understanding of the intracellular requirements of these molecules is unexplored. The thesis work conducted is an endeavor to fill this gap. A substantial part of my work has aimed to understand the role of a monoamine, dopamine, in governing blood progenitor proliferation during Drosophila larval development. The myeloid-like blood progenitor population, harbored by the lymph gland, utilizes the dopamine modules of synthesis, sensing by receptor Dop2R and transporter DAT, for sustaining its proliferation. Hence, dopamine serves as a mitogenic cue for the blood progenitors and operates dually. It controls an early S-G2 phase transition by employing an intracellular route and a later G2-M phase progression through a receptor-based sensing module. The intracellular dopamine (iDopamine) levels regulate cyclin E expression in the progenitors to enable an S-G2 phase progression. Therefore, the levels of iDopamine facilitate the cell cycle coordination of the blood progenitor population during lymph gland development. In the wild, the presence of parasitic wasps poses a threat to the survival of Drosophila larvae. Upon wasp infection, the larva mounts an immune response by forming lamellocytes, a blood cell type. This program of generating lamellocytes is unlocked via the internalization of GABA by the blood progenitors, driving a metabolic pathway called GABA shunt. Physiologically, pathogenic wasp odor sensing elevates intracellular GABA (iGABA) levels in the blood progenitors, which results in a heightened immune response. Hence, iGABA acts as a metabolic cue to induce lamellocyte formation post-wasp infection. In summary, this thesis work showcases neurotransmitters as metabolites employed by the blood progenitors for proliferation and cell fate control. References: 1.

In my talk I will describe a type of patterned developmental cell death that happens within the insect CNS on the grandest of scales. The developing nerve cord of insects contains segmentally repeated arrays of identifiable neural precursor cells, called neuroblasts, each of which produces a distinct lineage of neurons. Neuroblasts repeatedly bud off ganglion mother cells, which divide once to generate two daughters, an 'A' cell and a 'B' cell. These divisions result in two distinct half-lineages that we term 'hemilineage A' and 'hemilineage B'. Previous data from our lab described that a common fate within one of the two hemilineages is programmed cell death by apoptosis. Such hemilineage-based patterned death appears to be critical for controlling both neuronal sub-type diversity and segment-specific differences in circuitry. I will describe our recent molecular work exploring the role that the pro-apoptotic genes, Reaper, Hid, Grim and Sickle (RHGs) play in hemilineage-based death in Drosophila. These data suggest combinatorial RHG expression is required for the removal of specific hemilineages. Alongside this, I will present data on the wingless fly, Braula coeca, which shows that hemilineage patterns of cell death are evolutionarily plastic. The novel patterns of cell death we find in Braula suggest that changes in the control of hemilineage-based death programs may be important for diversifying neuronal network structures during the evolution of new body plans and behaviours. | | Chromosome segregation is performed by the spindle, a dynamic machine composed of microtubules, motors, and other associated proteins (MAPs). We currently know a lot about the protein components what constitute the spindle. However, evolution has tuned these components differently in different organisms. I will present different strategies that yeast, insect, and human cells have evolved to assemble the spindle for chromosome segregation. Understanding these different modes of spindle assembly may help fight cancer. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| In the development of multicellular organisms, cells with identical genomes differentiate into distinct cell types. This cellular differentiation process has often been picturized as balls falling down the epigenetic landscape, as originally proposed by Waddington: Balls start from the top of the landscape and as development progresses, they fall into distinct valleys corresponding to differentiated cell types. In modern biology, such landscapes are believed to be formed by epigenetic regulation, including DNA and chromatin modifications, which change feasibility of genes. Cells with pluripotency, such as embryonic stem (ES) cells, are located in the vicinity of the first branching point into the valleys because they can easily differentiate into different cell types with only slight stimuli. By contrast, differentiated cells regain pluripotency by overexpressing a few genes. Then, cellular reprogramming is often described as \"climbing\" the epigenetic landscape. Notably, differentiated cells can regain pluripotency by overexpression of a few genes. i.e., almost of epigenetic memories are erased by overexpression of a few genes. How differentiated cells return to such an unstable pluripotent state by much partial manipulation? Here, we provided the dynamical systems viewpoint of cellular differentiation and reprogramming. We considered cell model with the interplay between fast gene expression oscillation and slower epigenetic modification. As the simplest form of epigenetic modification, we adopt slow reinforcement feedback process. We showed that cell differentiation is described as proceeding along an unstable manifold, whereas cell reprogramming is unintuitively described as a strong attraction to such an unstable manifold. We have also provided the mechanism and condition for reprogramming by much partial manipulation (ex. Yamanaka four-actor). | | It is established that swift migration through tight interstitial tissue spaces by an armamentarium of cell types is conducted by malleable nuclear structures. However, molecular programs that instruct nuclear shapes remain to be revealed. Here I will present our recent observations indicating that loss of loop extrusion rapidly converts macrophage/granulocyte progenitors into cells that display a myriad of nuclear shapes, including horseshoe, ring, and hyper-segmented nuclear morphologies. The conversion of mononuclear to polymorphonuclear cells was accompanied by massive chromatin remodeling at enhancers that harbored cis-elements associated with neutrophil-specific transcription factors. Halting loop extrusion acutely activated the expression of genes encoding for factors that instruct neutrophil development, activation, migration, extravascular migration, inflammation and respiratory bursts to neutralize phagocytosed bacteria. Additionally, cessation of loop extrusion in bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors enriched for cells that express a macrophage transcription signature. These data indicate that loop extrusion programs regulate the nuclear shape and that halting loop extrusion acutely activates a neutrophil-specific gene program. We propose that modulating loop extrusion programs facilitate the migration of cells through densely populated tissues by instructing the assembly of distinct nuclear shapes whereas aberrant loop extrusion programs instruct alterations in nuclear morphologies to promote metastatic cell migration, aging, cardiovascular disease, and beyond. | | Archives at NCBS Public Lecture Series https://www.ncbs.res.in/events/apls 52nd edition Monthly talks framed around explorations in and around archives.

Paradox of the Press Plentiful yet Unviable, Plentiful yet Unfree Sevanti Ninan Friday, Jan 20 1 (Haapus), NCBS Details: https://bit.ly/apls-media Abstract: India currently has more privately-owned media than most countries in the world. Yet it has a crisis of both press freedom and viability. In this talk, I explore the reasons for this, tracing how and why the media industry expanded and grew in the decade of the 1990s. In the 1990s, growth in literacy, consumerism and advertising, and the advent of satellite television, all led to an expansion of print and television riding on post-liberalisation advertising. This dependence on advertising led to subscription revenues not being developed for either print or television. Today, however, there is not enough advertising to go round in the media glut. And consumers have grown used to not paying for the media they consume. India's press is only partly free because of the nature of media ownership. Corporate owners also own other businesses that are regulated by the government of the day. How effectively can you hold power to account when your company's owner is vulnerable to government pressure? Increased political ownership of media has eroded unbiased and independent journalism. And social media has given politicians direct access to voters. They rely less on the media as an intermediary, leading to greater intolerance of any criticism of them in the media. This is the paradox of the press in India today: plentiful yet unviable, plentiful yet unfree.

The activated fibroblast is a central player that drives fibrosis. Activated fibroblast exhibits enhanced migration, proliferation, contraction, and ECM production. However, this raises an interesting puzzle of whether the same fibroblast performs all the processes under the umbrella term \"activation\". Given the heterogeneity of fibroblasts in connective tissues, there are subpopulations of fibroblasts that perform specific functions under different regulatory controls. Using a transgenic mouse model of skin fibrosis, we found that the matricellular protein Mindin, secreted by the Snail transgenic the characteristic of distinct fibroblast subpopulations. Mindin induces migration and inflammatory gene expression in Sca1+ subpopulation of dermal fibroblasts in a Fyn kinase-dependent manner. On the other hand, Mindin increases the contractile behaviour and collagen production in the papillary CD26+ dermal fibroblasts via c-Src. Moreover, in the fibrotic microenvironment of the tumour stroma, we found that differential responses of resident fibroblast subpopulations to Mindin extend to the generation of functionally heterogeneous cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Lastly, we found that the F-spondin domain of Mindin is sufficient to recapitulate the effects of the full-length protein. Overall, this work highlights the importance of Mindin in mediating the cellular and signalling heterogeneity of dermal fibroblasts in skin fibrosis and cancer. | | |VC Link||Coordinator| Cardiomyopathies are complex heart muscle diseases with significant prevalence worldwide. Sarcomere-associated proteins mutations, metabolic impairment and modifier genes influence penetrance and expressivity of cardiomyopathy phenotype. In this context, it is crucial to understand the role of the above players in cardiomyopathy progression. No study has explored the effect of mutation on structural stability, metabolic perturbations across cardiomyopathies and disease-disease association of cardiomyopathies, consequently requiring in-depth analysis. As a part of my thesis work, we performed large-scale data analysis of cardiomyopathy to explore the above questions. In the first part of my thesis, we employ network biology to investigate cardiomyopathy's genetic interplay with other diseases and uncover the molecular players underlying these associations. We predict a set of candidate genes in cardiomyopathy by exploring the DIAMOnD algorithm on the human interactome. Utilizing heart-specific mouse knockout data and disease tissue-specific transcriptomic data, we screen prominent candidates that show abnormal heart phenotype, including NOS3, MMP2 and SIRT1. We next report how these candidate genes form associations across different diseases and highlight the predominant association with brain, cancer and metabolic disorders. In the second part, we present the analysis of transcriptome data to understand metabolic perturbations across primary cardiomyopathies. As a high-energy demanding engine, the heart utilizes fatty acids, glucose, amino acid, lactate and ketone bodies for energy to meet its requirement. However, continuous myocardial stress and cardiomyopathies drive towards metabolic impairment that advances heart failure (HF) pathogenesis. In this study, we utilized RNA-seq datasets to profile global changes in the above diseases and performed Gene set analysis (GSA). Our analysis demonstrates that arachidonic acid metabolism (AA) genes are significantly perturbed across cardiomyopathy. In particular, the arachidonic acid metabolism gene PLA2G2A interacts with fibroblast marker genes and can potentially influence fibrosis during cardiomyopathy. The third part of the thesis focuses on Cysteine and glycine-rich protein 3 (CSRP3), a dual-role mechanosensor that shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm in cardiac myocytes. It reportedly interacts with proteins within the Z-disc, including -actinin, titin-binding protein telethonin and transcription factors like MyoD. Mutations in the human CSRP3 gene exhibit dominant dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) phenotypes. Previous studies have shown that disease-causing mutations were predominantly localized to LIM domains. In this study, we devise a rapid in silico screening protocol that creates a mutational landscape map for all possible allowed and disallowed substitutions in CSRP3 LIM domains. This map provides structural and functional insights into the stability of LIM domains of CSRP3. To assess the prediction from the map, we performed MD simulations of WT, L44P (disease-mutant) and L44M (neutral). Our study suggests that the hydrophobic core region is significantly altered to the wild type. In summary, our integrated computational analysis broadens the understanding of the genetic associations of cardiomyopathies. References | | As animals move in complex environments, higher-order cognitive computations in the hippocampus\u2014a brain region critical for navigation\u2014reflect an internal map of the external world. This map is represented by the firing of single neurons at specific locations in the environment (i.e., place cells) and the population activity rhythmically fluctuating at ~8Hz. Thus, during navigation, hippocampal neural activity corresponds to rhythmic and sequential spatial representations at, behind, or ahead of the actual location of the animal. The act of navigation, in turn, critically depends on locomotion; however, current accounts suggest a dissociation between hippocampal spatial representations and the details of locomotor processes. In my postdoctoral work, I evaluated the possibility that hippocampal spatial representations and ongoing steps are synchronized with each other by simultaneously monitoring them at fast timescales during behaviour. We have found that the forelimb stepping cycle in freely behaving rats is rhythmic and peaks at ~8 Hz during movement, matching the ~8 Hz organization of information processing in the hippocampus during locomotion. We also discovered a precisely timed coordination between the time at which the forelimbs touch the ground ('plant' times of the stepping cycle) and the hippocampal representation of space. Notably, plant times coincided with hippocampal representations closest to the actual position of the animal, while in-between these plant times, the hippocampal representation progressed toward possible future locations in the behavioural arena. This synchronization was specifically detectable when animals approached upcoming spatial decisions. Taken together, our results reveal a dynamic coordination on a timescale of tens of milliseconds between central cognitive representations and peripheral motor processes. This coordination engages and disengages rapidly in association with cognitive demands and is well suited to support rapid information exchange between cognitive and sensory-motor circuits. | | Cellular function results from a myriad of chance encounters between proteins and other molecules. Precise regulation of cellular activities emerges from the spatial and physicochemical boundaries set by the cell, but how this happens is still an active topic of research. We are interested in understanding how proteins in the cell know when and where they need to be. Single-molecule fluorescence microscopy techniques, where individual copies of a particular protein can be tracked, offer unique insight on protein activity and the intracellular environment. In my lecture, I will describe how my group applies single-molecule microscopy to the study of live cells. I will talk about two ongoing projects in our lab: the study of the activity of the bacterial replisome - the machinery in charge of replicating the genome -; and the regulation of cell size homeostasis in budding yeast. In the first case, I will describe how subunit turnover in the bacterial replisome occurs and speculate on how turnover provides a functional advantage for genome integrity. In the second, I will describe how a dynamic interaction between transcription factors and chromatin senses cell size and controls the start of the cell cycle. In both cases, I will highlight the importance of protein dynamics, how they are modulated, and how are they exploited to generate order in the cell. | | Multiscale modeling, both data-driven (e.g. machine learning) and mechanistic (e.g. molecular dynamics MD or monte carlo MC) are now routine for equilibrium modeling of (macro)molecular or particle cluster assembly in diverse scientific scenarios. They take as input geometry of the assembling units (flexibly tethered rigid collections of atom centers), together with the assembly-driving pair-potentials (internal) energy (or corresponding force field), incorporating an implicit solvent. The outputs are (a) binding affinity and hotspot residue prediction, (b) paths and kinetic transition network generation and (c) optimal assembly landscape design solutions. Overall, while prevailing methods have not reached the limits of accuracy for meeting the modeling challenges, we have reached the limits of efficiency, usability and scalability of the methods and data representations, to take advantage of the availability of massive amounts of data and computational resources. The talk will propose to address these challenges by building on the recent, distinctive EASAL methodology (Efficient Atlasing, Search and sampling of Assembly Landscapes). While complementing prevailing approaches, the methodology exploits landscape geometry/topology, through the lens of recent and ongoing developments in discrete geometry and rigorous algorithmic complexity analysis. EASAL is a scale-independent algorithm suite with a stand-alone, opensource prototype implementation - under vigorous ongoing development. Ongoing work building on EASAL has demonstrated the methodology\\'s markedly distinct capabilities:(i) minimal, refinable representation of potential-energy basin topology, permitting fast path sampling and kinetic transition network generation (ii) upto 3000X coverage efficiency against prevailing MC sampling for helix assembly and against a competing free energy method for particle cluster assembly; and (iii) multiscaling via hybridization of mechanistic and data-driven methods, leading to a rapid, data-driven EASAL prediction of hotspot residues for virus capsid assembly that was experimentally validated. | | The ability to organize chromatin both functionally and spatially inside the nucleus is a fundamental aspect of eukaryotic genomes. Principal mechanisms for interphase nuclear organization include chromosome folding, chromosome compartmentalization and nuclear peripheral tethering. My talk will focus on understanding the functional relevance of these organizational features and how a nonrandom spatiotemporal genome organization helps the cells to faithfully propagate chromatin features during cell division and determine cell-fate. In a typical eukaryotic cell, the repressive heterochromatin domains preferentially locate at the nuclear periphery, but its biological significance remains unclear. I will discuss my recent findings using the fission yeast S. pombe, a well-established model system for studying epigenetic gene silencing and 3D genome organization, where I identified a conserved mechanism by which a peripheral subdomain enforces stable gene repression and maintains heterochromatin in a heritable manner. I will show you how an RNA-processing complex tethers heterochromatin domains to a nuclear rim protein Amo1 (NUPL2/NUP42 in mammals) and how this Amo1 subdomain enriches for factors that preserve parental methylated histones to promote spreading and epigenetic inheritance of the repressive chromatin state. I will briefly discuss how this pathway may emerge as a common theme in higher eukaryotes and has major implications for understanding stable gene repression at the nuclear periphery in mammals. Finally, I will present my future goal to leverage the powerful genetic system provided by the S. pombe along with mammalian models to uncover regulatory molecular mechanisms and functional consequences of genome organizational features such as chromatin folding and compartmentalization during development and diseases such as cancer. | | Navigating from one location to another in search of food, shelter, or a mate is critical for the survival of both animals and humans. Successful goal-directed navigation requires estimating one's current position in the environment, representing the future goal location, and maintaining a map of the environment that preserves the topological relationship between positions. In addition, we often need to implement similar navigation strategies in a continuously changing environment, thereby necessitating a certain degree of invariance in the underlying spatial maps. Previous research has identified neurons in the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortices that fire specifically when an animal visits a particular location, implying the presence of a spatial map in the brain. However, this spatial map specifically encodes the current position but not the future goal location of an animal. Also, the hippocampal spatial map depends on the behavioral context whereby changing the room or shape of the arena results in the formation of a new map orthogonal to the previous one. These observations raise the question, how does the brain fulfill the cognitive requirements necessary for goal-directed navigation? Our research has uncovered a novel spatial map in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) that represents an animal's future spatial goal and preserves topological relationships of positions in space while largely maintaining context invariance. We recorded the activity of OFC neural ensembles from rats trained to perform a goal-directed navigation task in an arena with multiple reward locations. We observed that OFC neurons exhibit distinct firing patterns depending on the animal's goal location, and this goal-specific OFC activity originates even before the onset of the journey. Further, the difference in the ensemble firing patterns representing two target locations is proportional to the distance between these locations in physical space, implying the preservation of spatial topology in the OFC. Finally, carrying out the task in different rooms and across arenas with different geometrical shapes revealed that the spatial mapping of target locations in the OFC is largely preserved and that the maps formed in two different contexts could be aligned by a simple linear transformation. Taken together, the OFC forms a topology-preserved schema of spatial locations that is used to represent the future spatial goal. Our results point to the OFC as a potentially crucial brain region for planning context-invariant goal-directed navigational strategies. | | Diet is a major driver of the gut microbiome, yet the microbiome-mediated mechanisms that link diet to various diseases are poorly understood. Research in my laboratory focuses on discerning these mechanisms and the underlying immunological processes via interactions of the microbiome with the colonic mucus barrier, which serves as the first line of defense against the invading pathogens. Since the modern human diet includes significantly reduced dietary fiber, my lab seeks to understand how the fiber-deprived gut microbiome impacts our health and contributes to disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, food allergy and multiple sclerosis. Our broader goal is to identify the microbial biomarkers that could be targeted using dietary therapeutics - this gut microbiome engineering would help to strengthen the mucosal barrier and to improve health. 11:30 AM, Thursday, Feb 09, 2023 | Haapus (LH1)Seminar by Dr Krishna Melnattur on 'Sleep is plastic and supports plasticity' 11:30 AM, Monday, Feb 13, 2023 | InstemAuditorium100SeaterInformal Talk by Dr Emma Verver on 'Tractor beams and single molecules: How to visualize and manipulate single biomolecules in real-time ' 05:00 PM, Thursday, Feb 16, 2023 | Haapus (LH1)Public Lecture by Dr Kurush Dalal on 'Why do we eat what we eat?' 02:00 PM, Monday, Feb 20, 2023 | Haapus (LH1)Informal Talk by Dr Vishnu M Saraswathy on 'Regulation adult neurogenesis and axon regrowth during spinal cord regeneration' 10:15 AM, Tuesday, Feb 21, 2023 | Haapus (LH1)Seminar by Dr Anusha Shankar on 'Cold physiology and -omics in the tropics' 02:30 PM, Tuesday, Feb 21, 2023 | InstemAuditorium100SeaterSeminar by Dr Reena Singh on 'Regenerative Medicine for unmet clinical needs -
