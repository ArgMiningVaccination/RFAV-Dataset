But what really works?", "sitename": "ABC News", "date": "2016-08-26", "cleaned_text": "/ Having the flu is awful \u2014 it means days in bed, time off work, calling in favours from family and friends and often a cough that lasts weeks. Naturally, you want to avoid getting sick and there is no shortage of vitamins and supplements claiming to help you do so. But how useful are these in preventing colds and flu? And is there anything else you can do to boost your immune system? Dr Penny Burns is a GP in Sydney's Inner Western suburbs who sees plenty of people with seasonal illnesses. She said getting sick did not necessarily mean your immune system was not doing its job. \"When we talk about boosting our immune system, what we really mean is we want to get sick less,\" she said. But Dr Burns said it was normal and natural to have a number of colds every year (most of us get about four each year) and this did not mean your immune system had failed. \"Because you get coughs, colds and flu, it doesn't mean your immune system is not working. Every time you recover your immune system has done a great job. It's recovery that shows the immune system is working well,\" she said. Dr Burns likened the concept of boosting your immune system to wanting to improve the performance of your car. \"There are so many components to your car. Which aspect do you mean? Is it tyre pressure or brake fluid? If it's tyre pressure, then you need to know if it's right for this particular road,\" she said. So it is hard to pin down what the concept of boosting the immune system really meant, she said, or even what the best level of functioning is. \"It's an impossible question to answer,\" she said. But you do not want your immune system working overtime either \u2014 as that is when you can run into problems, such as allergies, anaphylaxis or autoimmune diseases. \"You don't want your immune system to be too good because it can kill,\" she said. So it is a fine balance. \"Similar to the concept of 'good enough' parenting. We need a good enough immune system to keep us well in the environment we live in. We don't know what perfect is,\" she said. Healthy lifestyle Although it is hard to pin point what exactly a \"good immune system\" looks like, that does not mean you cannot do anything to improve your chances of staying healthy. Maintaining good general health can help your immune system, Dr Burns said. This includes: - Getting adequate sleep - Getting regular exercise - Eating a good healthy diet with lots of micronutrients. Malnutrition is known to affect immunity - Drinking alcohol in moderation and quitting smoking Stress can also have an impact on your immunity. Studies have shown that [chronic stress can affect the immune system](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361287/) and increase the chance of some diseases \u2014 so it is important to [do what you can to manage stress](http://www.abc.net.au/health/features/stories/2015/03/30/4207513.htm). Vaccinations and supplements [Vaccinations are an important way to boost your immunity](http://www.abc.net.au/health/library/stories/2003/05/22/1918384.htm) and they do not weaken the immune system, Dr Burns said. They give you a \"jump-start\" on fighting infections. \"We know immunity weakens with age, which is why people over 65 are given free flu vaccination,\" she said. \"Herbs and vitamins are important to include in a healthy diet, but we don't know if supplements work.\" It is also important to be careful when taking vitamins and supplements \u2014 [it is possible to overdose on them](http://www.abc.net.au/health/talkinghealth/factbuster/stories/2013/12/03/3903806.htm). There is some evidence that taking [zinc tablets within 24 hours of cold symptoms starting may help reduce the severity of symptoms](http://www.abc.net.au/health/features/stories/2014/05/02/3993580.htm) and how long they last. But no-one knows the best dose, formulation or how long you should take it. \"Echinacea has long been talked about as an immune booster, but the proof is not yet there,\" Dr Burns said. She said there was [some evidence that echinacea may be helpful](http://www.abc.net.au/health/library/stories/2014/04/22/3987485.htm) in treating or preventing colds. But there is no clear evidence on how that would work in practice, the best formula to take, what dose to take or how long it needs to be taken in order to be effective. "}
