These two are the most authenticated & most sought after treatment regimens of eastern medicine. A lot of stress is being laid on use & up gradation of these two systems even at the global level. The two have been recognized by WHO as authenticated treatment procedures. New researches & clinical trials are highlighting usefulness of these systems on various diseases & even such medical conditions which do not find any nomenclature in conventional medicine. These two systems have so much in common with regard to basic principles and yet have distinct treatment techniques which find references in both the systems. We have inculcated Acupuncture in our practice after one year of certificate course in Acupuncture where we thoroughly gathered & understood theoretical aspect & went through exhaustive practical training which is so important in any interventional medical procedure. As each of us has a unique prakriti, so for us each patient even with same symptoms is different whose prescription requirements may differ from another. In our center the patient is thoroughly examined as per ayurvedic & acupuncture principles and then the best possible prescription is recommended. We use most authenticated Ayurvedic medicines (we are authorized dealers for ARYA VAIDYA SALA MEDICINES of KOTTAKAL, KERALA) and as for Acupuncture we are using authenticated Chinese made stainless steel single use needles. Our diagnosis considers the diseases not only on the basis of their nomenclature but as syndromes (i.e. group of signs & symptoms based on physical conditions in body & in nature). We have been working on large & varied syndromes which closely resemble the following diseases: Sciatica, Lower Back Pain (Lumbago), Disc Slip (Prolapse Intervertebral Trigger Thumb, Frozen Shoulder, Trigeminal Neuralgia, Cervical Spondylosis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis, Insomnia, Dementia, Mania, Schizophrenia, Depression, Addiction & Substance Abuse, Epilepsy, Anxiety, Suicidal Tendencies, Irregular & Painful Periods, Primary & Secondary Infertility In Both Males & Females, Polycystic Ovary Disease, Low Libido (Sexual Weakness), Leucorrhea, Sinusitis, Migraine, Paralysis, Constipation, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Asthma, Deafness, Eczema, Psoriasis, Acne, Blemishes & Other Skin Conditions & Various Medical Conditions Of Eyes.

Visited Dr. Ravi Dewan (Ayurveda) For TREATMENT FOR PAIN & ACHESAcupuncture Happy with: Doctor friendlinessExplanation of the health issueTreatment satisfactionValue for money Feeling and understanding the pulses is an art that is mastered over a lifetime. Dr Ravi felt for the rate, rhythm, strength and presence of pulses on each wrist, listened to the my symptoms, medical history and family health history too, asked me about my body odors and the tastes I experience, examined the tongue for colour, markings and coating, noting the corresponding organ systems that are affected. Hence, the diagnosis itself was elaborated and healing followed by the acupuncture treatment. He is precisely able to detect imbalances before they become pathological. Dr Ravi is a good listener, very knowledgeable and very interested in helping one lead a healthier life. There's nothing magical about acupuncture, it works by activating the body's own self-healing mechanism by triggering specific points on the skin with needles. It's hard to put into words, but there's a distinct balanced and harmonious feeling after every needing session. My heartfelt thanks to Dr Ravi Dewan!
