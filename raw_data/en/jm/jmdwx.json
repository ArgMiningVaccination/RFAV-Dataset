We've all heard the term \"clean eating' and many of you have considered it but you're not sure how to start eating clean especially when you have kids! Today's post will give you the full scoop on clean eating basics, food lists, and yummy recipes and [help you get started.](https://www.laurafuentes.com/exclusive-clean-eating/) Since writing this post, we've had so many amazing conversations with readers about [clean eating for families.](https://www.momables.com/eating-clean/) We recently recorded a podcast about it which you can listen to below or on your favorite podcast app. What is Clean Eating In short, clean eating involves choosing whole foods and avoiding processed, artificial foods. It's not a diet but lifestyle and one that can be shared with the whole family. Related: [Read more about what it means to eat clean here. ](https://www.laurafuentes.com/what-is-clean-eating/) In preparing fresh, whole food based meals you will automatically add more nutrition to your diet while eliminating any unnecessarily added fats, sugars, and \"junk\" often found in processed foods. Cleaning up the foods we eat results in boosted energy, a clearer mind, improved mood (for everyone in the family) and better overall health. This is what #winning looks like. Clean Eating Basics Instead of pre-packaged meals, snacks, and fast food, clean eating encourages fresh, home-cooked meals made with all-natural sources of vegetables, fruit, proteins, healthy fats, and grains. It's also a shift from our fast-paced culture of convenience foods to a more focused approach on mealtimes. This means that instead of drive-thru's and prepackaged foods, meals will be prepared in the kitchen so you know exactly what is being served. This, of course, takes planning and preparation for ALL meals, which is nothing to sneeze about when you are feeding a family but I'm living proof that you don't need to spend hours in the kitchen every day to eat clean! [This blog post is dedicated to helping families successfully meal plan and prep fresh, whole-food meals for the week](https://www.momables.com/how-to-whole-30-meal-plan/) which I further discuss in this video: Clean Eating Meal Plan [If you're in search of a done-for-you clean-eating meal plan you'll find everything you need inside the Family KickStart Program](https://www.laurafuentes.com/family-healthy-eating-plan/). It's a 30-day clean eating program that will help eliminate processed foods and sugars from your family's diet. [Learn more here.](https://www.laurafuentes.com/family-healthy-eating-plan/) If today you're just looking for a few new recipe ideas to incorporate into your weekly meals, you'll find them in this post. But first, let's talk about clean eating food options. Clean Eating Food List All the Good Carbs: - Sweet potatoes - Regular potatoes - Corn - Beans - Oatmeal - Rice - Barley - Quinoa - Millet While some clean eating food lists include things like whole grain bread, pasta, and tortillas I have found that it's much more simple to keep a naturally gluten-free approach. This eliminates the extra time spent looking for a specific brand plus the extra cost! Naturally gluten-free means selecting foods that are already gluten-free; like rice and beans, for example. Vegetables: All of them! Of course, organic is the better option but more costly and if that's too much I've found the Clean 15 and Dirty Dozen list helpful. In short, it's a great guide for which produce options are worth buying organic. Fruit: Same as veggies! You can enjoy any fresh, frozen, or dried fruit options (no sugar added). Meats and Seafood: - Chicken & turkey - Beef - Pork - Duck - Seafood & fish Eggs: Whether scrambled, poached, fried, baked, or hard-boiled, eggs help build some tasty breakfasts, lunches, and even breakfast for dinner, hello [savory oats!](https://www.laurafuentes.com/savory-oatmeal-bacon/) Full Fat Dairy: Contrary to early claims of full-fat dairy being bad for you, they actually container healthy fatty acids which their low-fat counterparts don't offer. Plus, low-fat/no fat dairy options often contain more sugar due to the lack of fat. - Milk - Cheese - Butter - Yogurt - Non-dairy milk- such as almond, cashew, flax, and oat! Coffee & Tea: You can still enjoy your cup o' joe but be sure to skip the milk products and sugar. Replace the usual cream with almond or coconut milk and you'll still be able to start your day right - with a cup of coffee in hand! Healthy Fats and Oils: Fats are essential for optimal brain, hormonal, and overall health. Here are are a few options perfect for cooking/consuming and all 100% clean. - Olive oil [Coconut oil](https://amzn.to/2Q5u7p9) - Avocado oil - Sesame oil - Ghee - Nuts & Nut butters- Make sure you purchase the real nut butter options, many come with added sugar and preservatives. - Seeds Things to Avoid When Eating Clean: You've probably already guessed pre-packaged snacks, candy, cookies, frozen meals, cereal, sauces, canned soups, granola/breakfast bars, but here are a few items you might not have thought about: - Bottled Salad dressings- many contain added sugars and preservatives - Pre-packaged lunch meat- Shocking but many lunch meats contain added sugar and fillers. I've found [this brand to be best for cold cuts](https://applegate.com/whole30?utm_source=Whole30&utm_medium=approved%20list)but you can also purchase sliced meat from whole roasted chicken, beef, and turkey in the deli section. - Vegan Substitutes- Often thought of as a healthy choice but many of these veggie burgers, \"chicken, and \"bacon\" are still highly processed and often contain excessive amounts of sodium. Clean Eating With Kids So you've decided to do a clean-eating lifestyle with the WHOLE FAMILY. No, you're not the only one and yes, it is totally doable! We all know kids can't go without their favorite foods and they don't have to because those foods can still be enjoyed by making smart ingredient swaps that eliminate the processed ingredients. Instead of buying bottled pasta sauce you'll [make your own pasta sauce](https://www.momables.com/crock-pot-tomato-sauce/). Kids can't live without pancakes and this healthy pancake recipe can be made ahead of time, frozen, and reheated.
