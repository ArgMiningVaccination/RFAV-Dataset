Saint. In this fine 1987 novel (later made into a very bad movie starring a miscast Chevy Chase) a thirty-four-year-old securities analyst is caught in an extraordinary scientific accident that renders him and a small sphericalchunk of New Jersey invisible. Like all good science fiction (although this one has little science), the compelling aspect is the \"What If?\" If this happened to you, how would you live? Work? Drive? Eat? Make a living? From at least the time of H.G. Wells, invisibility has been a recurring, and often appealing, deviceof science fiction and fantasy, from Star Trek 's Romulan/Klingon cloaking device to Harry Potter's cloak of invisibility. Invisibility also plays a role in the newmovie and classic novel The Hobbit. But that's all fiction. In their \"Treatise on Invisible Beings\" in this issue, Joe Nickell and James Mc- Gaha take a broadly encompassing look at claims of entities reputedly capableof invisibility. It is remarkable how widespread such ideas are in the real world.By invisible the authors don't mean transparent, camouflaged, obscured, or mi-croscopic but truly invisible: \"incapable of being seen by human vision in the vi- sual spectrum.\" Starting with a supposed \"invisible girl\" exhibited in eighteenth- century Paris, they roam over the entire topic: advanced technology (includingthe hoax Philadelphia Experiment), extra-dimensional realms, alien domains, the spirit realm, visionary experiences, \"Magick,\" and deistic power. Popular beliefnotwithstanding, they conclude\u2014not surprisingly\u2014that allegedly invisible en- tities are indistinguishable from imaginary beings. It is a revealing look at an en-tertaining topic that's not all it appears to be. This is the third time Nickell and McGaha have teamed up recently in the S KEPTICaL INquIRER . They wrote \"The Roswellian Syndrome,\" cover article, and \"The Exeter Incident Solved,\" a special report in ourNovember/December 2011 issue. Theirs is a cross-country collaboration. Nick- ell, a prolific investigator and writer, is of course our senior research fellow, based at our amherst, New York, headquarters. McGaha, an astronomer, retired mil-itary pilot, and uFO skeptic, has his own observatory in Tucson. In 1907, psychologist Oskar Pfungst published his now-classic expos\u00eb of Clever Hans, the supposed talking (and calculating) horse. The incident has sinceserved as case study of the perils of subconscious experimenter influence on an-imal or human subjects. But Clever Hans nevertheless had his successors, and inthis issue Stefano Vezzani tells the story of \"The Elberfeld Horses,\" which also turned many scientific heads with supposed mathematical powers but in fact rep-resented \"an archetypal instance of pseudoscience.\" There is much more in this issue, including a physicist's examination of Indian astrology, an inquiry into understanding believers' cognitive dissonance, a series of reports on our CSICon 2012 conference in Nashville, and many other columns, including Kenneth Feder's \"Help! I'm Being Followed by ancient aliens\" and Steven Novella's \"Herbs AreDrugs,\" the latter being another re- minder that herbal supplements are a dangerous and unregulated big business. \u2014K ENDRICK FRazIER Skep ti cal In quir er THE MAG A ZINE FOR SCI ENCE AND REA SON ED I TORKend rick Fra zi er ED I TO RI AL BOARD James E.

Box 703, Am herst, 14226-0703.March April 13 *_SI new design masters 1/31/13 9:52 AM Page 4Two years ago the prepublication re lease of a research paper by psychologist Daryl Bem claiming experimental evi- dence for precognition created a world- wide media stir and intense controversywithin the scientific and skeptical com-munities. Bem, of Cornell university, claimed that through nine experiments he had demonstrated the existence of precogni- tion, specifically the existence of \"con- scious cognitive awareness ...of a future event that could not otherwise be antic- ipated through any known inferential process.\" Essentially, he had claimed to have produced evidence that psychic abilities not only exist but can transcendtime and allow the future to reach back- ward to change the past. Informed critics of parapsychology were almost uniformly incredulous. al- though Bem is a respected psychologist, they found so many flaws in the researchprotocols and methods that in their viewthe conclusions had no validity. One of the most stinging re bukes came in the form of an ex tended, in-depth critique ofall nine experiments by Y ork universitypsychologist and CSI Executive Councilmember James alcock in the S KEPTICaL INquIRER NotParapsychology's Next Big Thing\" in thesame issue). alcock also concluded that the jour- nal that published Bem's study, the Jour- nal of Personality and Social Psy chology (JPSP), had done everyone a disservice by publishing this \"badly flawed research article.\" Parapsy chology and the journal's own reputation, he wrote, had been dam- aged, and the article's publication dis- served the public as well, \"for it only adds to [public] confusion about the existence of psi.\" Experiments attempting to replicate Bem's results were quickly conducted atvarious universities, but none were ac- cepted for publication by JPSP . In fact,it said it would not consider publishing replication failures. This fact raised morecontroversy and concern. Now the journal has had an apparent change of heart. It has finally publisheda set of experiments that attempted (andfailed) to replicate Bem's results. Seven experiments conducted by Jeff Galak of Carnegie Mellon university, Robyn a.LeBoeuf of the university of Florida, Leif D. Nelson of the uni versity of Cal- ifornia at Berkeley, and Joseph P . Sim- mons of the university of Pennsylvaniahave been published in JPSP's final issue of 2012 (Vol. 103, No. 6) under the title\"Correcting the Past: Failures to Repli- cate Psi.\" The article is lengthy, but the central conclusion is succinctly stated: \"across seven experiments (N= 3,289), we replicate the procedure of Experiments 8 and 9 from Bem (2011), which had orig- inally demonstrated retro active facilitation of recall. We failed to replicate that find- ing.\" They further conducted a meta- analysis of all replication attempts of the Bem experiments \"and find that the aver- age effect size (d = 0.04) is not different from 0.\" To put it even more directly (from the beginning of their conclusions section): \"We conducted seven experiments test- ing for precognition and found no evi- dence supporting its existence.\" How can their results be reconciled with Bem's? \"It is unclear how Bem could find significant support for a hy- pothesis that appears to be untrue,\" the authors say. They suggest such possibil- ities as what psychologists call Type I error\u2014a false rejection of the null hy- pothesis. They also point to concerns about researcher degrees of freedom, which also raise the likelihood of falsely rejecting the null hy pothesis. Whilemany experimental decisions are defen- sible, \"because their application is at thediscretion of the researcher examiningdata after the completion of the exper- iment, they can make a true effect moredifficult to discern. ... Researcher de- grees of freedom do not make a finding false . . . but they do make it much harder to distinguish between truth andfalseness in reported data.\" They end by quoting philosopher of science Karl Popper: \"an effect is not an effect unless it is replicable, and a sci- ence is not a science unless it conducts (and values) attempted replications.\" They do compliment Bem for encour- aging the independent replication of his experiments. alcock, who wrote SI's 2011 critique, has mixed feelings about the Galak et al. paper: While I am happy that they carried out this research and that it was pub- lished, I find it very odd that they fo-cused on Bem's studies as thoughFailure to Replicate Results of Bem Parapsychology Experiments Published by Same Journal KENDRICKFRAZIER Skeptical Inquirer | March/April 2013 5[ NEWS ANDCOMMENT Correcting the Past: Failures to Replicate Psi Jeff Galak Carnegie Mellon UniversityRobyn A.

We discuss some reasons for differences between the results in this article and those presented in Bem (2011). Keywords: psi, precognition, ESP, researcher degrees of freedom, meta-analysis Recently, Bem (2011) published an extremely thought- provoking article demonstrating the existence of precognition, a \"conscious cognitive awareness . . . of a future event that could not otherwise be anticipated through any known inferential process\" (p. 407). Through nine experiments, Bem found consistent support for the idea that people have such precognitive abilities. He sug-gested that these findings present examples of retroactive influ- ence, through which future events influence people's current re- sponses and that more broadly these findings are instances of psi phenomena,o r\" a n o m a l o u sp r o c e s s e so fi n f o r m a t i o no re n e r g y transfer that are currently unexplained in terms of known physical or biological mechanisms\" (Bem, 2011, p. 407). In his article, Bem (2011) acknowledged that psi is a contro- versial topic. He reported data suggesting that many, if not most, academic psychologists do not believe that psi phenomena exist. Indeed, the publication of Bem's research met with a wide varietyofr e a c t i o n si nt h ea c a d e m i ca n dp o p u l a rm e d i aa l i k e ,a n da l t h o u g h some reactions were supportive, many were skeptical (Carey, 2011a; Carey, 2011b; Wagenmakers, Wetzels, Borsboom, & van der Maas, 2011). In light of the skepticism surrounding psi and inanticipation of the reaction to his article, Bem suggested that psi researchers must conduct tightly controlled experiments that dem- onstrate psi and \"that can be replicated by independent investiga- tors\" (Bem, 2011, p. 407). Whereas Bem's article may indeedprovide the necessary tightly controlled experiments, the purpose of the current article is to conduct and to synthesize replications by independent investigators. Psi Phenomena The precognitive abilities reported by Bem (2011) emerged across a range of tasks. As one example, in Experiment 1, Bem (2011) asked participants to select whether a picture would appear on the left side of the screen or the right side of the screen. Participants' selections were accurate more often than chance would predict when the picture in question was an erotic one (butnot a neutral, positive, or negative one), suggesting that people have precognitive abilities to detect where erotic stimuli will appear. Precognitive abilities also manifested on more complicated tasks. For example, in Experiment 5, participants were asked tochoose which of two negatively arousing pictures they liked better. After this choice, the computer randomly selected one of the pictures to serve as the target picture, which then flashed sublim- inally on the screen from 4 to 10 times. Research on the mere- exposure effect suggests that subliminal exposure to a negativetarget increases liking of that target (i.e., causes habituation; Kunst-Wilson & Zajonc, 1980). Bem (2011) suggested that if people have precognitive abilities, their current liking of a negative picture would be enhanced by the fact that they will see that picture several times in the future (even though they have no known way of knowing that they will see it). Bem's results supported this prediction: When participants chose between neg- ative picture pairs, they were more likely to prefer the one that would later be selected to be the subliminally presented target. Perhaps the most straightforward and impressive demonstration of precognition emerged in Bem's (2011) Experiments 8 and 9, which documented \"retroactive facilitation of recall\" (p. 419). In these studies, participants saw 48 words and then were asked to recall as many of those words as possible. Next, participants weregiven a chance to practice a randomly chosen subset of the 48 words by, for example, retyping them and recategorizing them.

They were so poorly designed and so badly executed that the results do not merit the careful consideration that this research gives them. However, the experiments that Galak address, #8 and #9, were the best of a bad lot. Nonetheless, I am glad that they have done this research and that it is in print. It counters Bem's claims very nicely, without ruf-fling any feathers I guess. Ray Hyman, professor of psychology emeritus at the university of Ore gon and also a CSI Executive Coun cil member, is another longtime expert on such research.Here is his initial comment: The number and size of their experi- ments, the detailed analyses, along with their inclusion of several other studies which fail to replicate Bem, de- prive the parapsychologists of their standard excuses for dismissing failed replications. Bem and his supporters have one other excuse they can use. They can, and will, point to ways in which the Galak et al. experiments differ from Bem's experimental proto- col. The authors have anticipated thisand have adhered so closely to Bem's protocol, that whatever differences re- main appear trivial. Publication by JPSP of the Galak etal. paper may or may not bring to an end this latest dramatic claim of scientific evidence of the paranormal, but\u2014com- bined with the previous critiques\u2014it ap- pears to have dealt a serious blow. as al- cock emphasized in his 2011 critique (and as Hyman has often also stressed), over the past eighty-odd years this kindof drama has played out multiple times, and \"each time parapsychologists ulti- mately failed to persuade the scientific world that parapsychological phenom- ena (psi) really exist.\" Kendrick Frazier is editor of the S KEPTICAL INqUIRER . I was surprised to see a display for a prod- uct made and distributed by a companycalled Healing Hazel on the dispensarycounter of my pharmacy, a branch of theJean Coutu Group (PJC) Inc. in Montreal. The product is available as a range of necklaces and bracelets made of hazel-wood links (prices range from about$14.95-$24.95). The claims in the point- of-sale material and the brochure imme-diately set my quackometer pinging intothe red zone. according to Healing Hazel, \"Haz el - wood helps neutralize acidity throughout the body,\" and \"Its significant benefitshave long been utilized by First Nationspeople.\" It for most part\" Its website (www.healinghazel.com/) makes for interesting reading too, includ- ing the fact that they are now offering hazelwood/amber necklaces and bracelets promoted with similar claims: \"When amber is worn on the skin, the warmth of the body releases trace amounts of heal- ing oils which is [ sic] then absorbed into the blood stream [ sic]. It is a natural rem- edy for side effects associated with teething, such as redness in the cheeks, droolling [ sic], diaper rashes, swollen gums, etc.\" The McGill university Office for Sci-ence and Society looks into the claimsmade by hazelwood promoters on its in- formative (and highly entertaining) blogsite (http://blogs.mcgill.ca/oss/2012/03/ 02/can-hazelwood-or-amber-necklaces- help-with-the-pain-of-babies-teething). among its findings: Hazelwood, they say, has the medicinal property of neutralizing the body's acidity. and what do the amber neck- lace promoters claim as a mechanism for the miraculous work of their prod- uct? It releases succininic acid! It in- creases acidity! There are several layers of nonsense here. First of all, the body isn't acidic or basic. That concept makes no sense. Body fluids such as blood, sweat or urine can be acidic or basic, but not the body itself. as far as blood goes, it has to be alkaline with a pH between 7 and 7.4. If it wanders outside this range, it's a life-threatening situation. While it may be possible to slightly alter blood pH by diet, it certainly isn't possible to do so by wearing a necklace. Healing Hazel offers no proof or sci- ence, cites no properly conducted con- trolled double-blinded placebo studies, and offers no links to credible sources thatcould back up its claims. Clearly, by placing this on the counter of the dispensary, the pharmacy was tac- itly endorsing the product. I brought my concerns to the attention of the branchowner, who is also a pharmacist. I toldhim I don't have a problem with people who choose to waste their money on use- less\u2014or at best unproven\u2014products, but placing this display on the counter of the dispensary undermined customer confi- dence in the credibility of his pharmacy. He immediately agreed and told me that the hazelwood products would be moved elsewhere forthwith. He ex plained that much as he would like to, he couldn't remove them altogether because the pur- chase had been made by his head office\u2014the Jean Coutu Group. But he did add that he refuses to sell homeopathic prod- ucts in his pharmacy. In conclusion, the McGill blog puts it best: There is no science here, just some tes- timonials, the same as one might get for any intervention be it a hazelwood or amber necklace, or a suppository made from earwax collected by albino virgins from Ethi opian mountain goats by the light of the full moon .... What makes people buy into such folly? It's the packaging. The necklaces come wrapped in a mix of scientific il- literacy, simple credulity and wishful thinking. What the blog doesn't say is that any one of us can make a difference. arguing with true believers is usually a waste of time, but taking a small action where it might actually get results can be well worth the effort.

Bent Spoon Awarded to Homeopath GURMUKHMONGIA For thirty years, the australian Skep tics have annually presented the Bent Spoon award in mockery of prominent pseudo- science. Richard Saunders, president of the australian Skeptics, says that he's proud to be involved with this important tradition: The Bent Spoon is awarded each year by the australian Skeptics to the per- petrator of the most preposterouspiece of paranormal or pseudoscien- tific piffle. It's meant as sort of a light hearted award, although it does have a serious side to it. Take the winnerof the 2012 Bent Spoon award: Fran Sheffield of Home opathy Plus. Nowthis is a group who advocates the useof Home opathy instead of vaccinesfor polio or whooping cough ormeningitis or anything you care to mention. They also claim that you can use Home opa thy to treat domes- tic violence, a bizarre claim indeed. If the Bent Spoon award helps shed light on the activities of these people, then it's well worth it. alternative health advocates have often been the recipients of this award, including several anti-vaccination advo- cates such as Dr. Viera Scheibner, the company Gentle Heal Pty Ltd, and Meryl Dorey of the infamous austral - ian Vaccination Network. almost half of the Bent Spoon awards have been given out to promoters of \"alternative health\" practices, demonstrating just how widespread they are.The award itself is constructed from a polished and glossy chunk of gopher wood that (it is said) originated from Noah's ark. affixed to this piece of wood is a spoon that (many believe) may have been used during the Last Supper. The spoon has been bent into a graceful curve by unexplained energies that are (suspected to be) un known to science. The Bent Spoon award was first given out in 1982 to Tom Wards, a noto- rious \"psychic\" who made many predic- tions of world events that were remark- able for their inaccuracy. The latest recipient of the Bent Spoon award, Fran Sheffield, is a homeopath based in New South Wales who managesMarch April 13 *_SI new design masters 1/31/13 9:53 AM Page 78Volume 37 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirerthe Homeopathy Plus website. Sheffield has, on more than one occasion, com- pletely ignored sanctions from the Ther- apeutic Goods administration that wouldforce her to take down misleading adver-tisements and replace them with a severestatement of retraction. One outrageous claim from the Homeopathy Plus website is that home- opathy \"treats excesses of human behavior,\"including victims and perpetrators of do-mestic violence. The website also labels thewhooping cough vaccine as \"unreliable,\" and advises visitors to the website to \"hot- foot it to your local homeo path if you arestruggling with whooping cough.\" approximately one in twelve aus- tralian babies (8 percent) has not been fully immunized. For herd immunity to take full effect, this number needs to be lowered. Herd immunity is extremelyimportant for children who are not ableto receive proper immunization. These children rely on herd immunity to keep them safe. In November, the australianacademy of Science distributed a book-let that dispelled the myths about vacci-nation in an attempt to convince parentsto do the right thing for the health of their children. The australian Skeptics also hope that their Bent Spoon award will bring some much-needed attention to this issue. Theaward was presented at a dinner duringthe australian Skep tics' national conven- tion. In addition to the Bent Spoonaward, the australian Skeptics also gaveout the 2012 Skeptic of the Y ear award. This more desirable award went to the lobby group Friends of Science in Medi- cine in recognition of their efforts to chal- lenge australian universities that providecourses in medical pseudoscience, such as acupuncture, naturopathy, re flexology, and chiropractic.

Before there were celebrity atheists, there was Paul. Paul did not appear on the Col bert Re- port, did not write bestsellers, and did not travel on coast-to-coast book tours. But Paul did something deeper and more fundamental that paved the way for those of us that came after him. Paul, first of all, changed the world's view of what it meant to be a champion of secularism and science. He did not define himself as an atheist, in terms of something we should notbe lieve in, but rather as a humanist, in terms of things we should believe in. In his various hu- manist manifestos, Paul laid out a posi-tive agenda for a defensible, enlightened, moral worldview, one that did not de- pend on dogma or supernatural agents, but that laid out a moral vision and agenda that we could positively believe in and work to fulfill. Paul also built institutions: brick and mortar institutions but also magazines and book imprints and associations thatoutlived him and that carried his mes- sage to a much greater audience than any single person could have done on his own. So, in mourning Paul's passing, we certainly can't comfort ourselves with the thought that he's up there looking down on us, or that we'll meet him again someday. Paul would be the last person that would tolerate such bromides. But we can comfort ourselves with some-thing deeper: that Paul left us a world that was better for his efforts.

It is a well-established practice in medical research but has not been formally practiced in parapsychology or academic psychology. Prospective registration makes a planned experiment a matter of public record, which prevents the suppressionof results that do not come out the way the experimenters hoped. Registration includes the specific hypotheses thatare planned, which prevents experi-menters from adapting the experimen- tal hypotheses to match the results orreporting results for only the analyseswith favorable outcomes. Medical jour- nals increasingly require registration of studies as a condition for publication. The value of study registration forparapsychological experiments has been discussed many times, but a reg- istry has not previously been available. This study registry provides an oppor- tunity to demonstrate that the experi- ments are free of common biases in ex- perimental research. These biases can be very difficult to detect without prospective registration. Registration isvaluable for experiments conducted by skeptics as well as for experiments by proponents of the paranormal. The KPu study registry webpage is at http://www.koestler-parapsychol-ogy.psy.ed.ac.uk/TrialRegistry.html. Other options for study registration may becomeSuniTThTavailable in the future. The KPu registry webpageSuniTThTis also intended to serve as a resource that will provide information about otherSuniTThT registrationoptions as they become available.

Long Island Chicanery: Old Tricks in a New Package BRYANFARHA James van Praagh. Sylvia Browne. John Edward. It's starting to sound like a broken record, but make wayfor the next in a long list of alleged psychics who have hit it big with the media\u2014S\"\u00e0 eresa Caputo. You proba-bly know her from the Long Island Medium , a popular television show on S\"\u00e0 e Learning Channel (TLC). To no skeptic's surprise, TLC in recent years has been using the word \"learning\" very loosely (although I credit theirsister network, Discovery Channel, for airing critical-thinking shows likeMythbusters ). Long Island Medium is yet another show devoid of scientic scrutiny by TLC, most assuredly be-cause of the almighty dollar. Whilethe show is now enjoying its secondseason, its inaugural season netted 1.3million viewers per episode. Forgive me for describing Ca- puto's methods using the same old terms and phrases you've heard in de- scribing those of the others men-tioned in the previous paragraph\u2014 subjective validation, shing, cold reading, and warm reading\u2014but that's what it is. S\"\u00e0 eresa Caputo likes to give pre- sumably \"impromptu\" readings (al- though I don't assume that anything is genuinely impromptu in an edited program). She does this by giving readings while she is out and about doing her daily errands and such.

S\"\u00e0 e employees got a more de- tailed reading, like she did in a coee shop with an employee's mother in oneepisode (\"Your mother\u2014she told meshe was a seamstress\"). Why would thisbe? While I can't be certain of this, itcould be that the employee is likely present in the establishment each time Caputo visits the retailer and she could be nding out information in advance. Don't many employees have name tags?Hmmm. Of course, the general reading(cold reading, in fact) elicited tears sinceit was a heart-warming message. But what psychic's record is com- plete without incorrect assertions aswell? On Anderson Live, Caputo asked a man in the audience\u2014knowing his wife had died\u2014\"Is that your wedding ring [from your wife]?\" S\"\u00e0 e man replied, \"No, it's my mother's.\" Caputo waswrong. Regarding furniture, Caputoasked the man, \"Do you still have thechair?\" to which the man replied, \"No.\"Wrong again. Caputo continues, \"Didshe have an issue with her legs prior to her passing?\"\u2014the man replies, \"No.\" Wrong yet again. adept at shing (ask- ing a question to a large group of peo- ple, hoping that just one will answerpositively), she cleverly asked the entireaudience (250 to 300 people) if some-one they knew had an issue with their legs\u2014so the failure was overlooked and attention was diverted to someone on the other side of the studio. S\"\u00e0 is happened with lightning speed, so the inaccuracies were unnoticed by most. She commented to another person whose mother had passed, \"So when you would sit with mom [when you felt her spirit], you would feel the presence of others who had departed\u2014is that correct?\" S\"\u00e0 e audience member shook her head \"no.\" Once again, wrong. Sometimes even shing to the masses fails and psychics really wind up withegg on their faces\u2014like Caputo didwith yet another Anderson Live audience member: \"So who was buried in a red dress?\" Complete silence. Ouch. ques- tioning another audience member (whohad lost her mother), \"Is your dad alsodeparted as well?\" She responded, \"Yes.\"Caputo says, \"So know that they are to- gether.\" S\"\u00e0 is made the audience mem- ber feel comforted. But there's a prob-lem with this exchange. If Caputo knew that they were together, why did sheneed to ask if her father had departed? Caputo was busted, but I'm sure loyal believers would dismiss the failure. S\"\u00e0 is train of logic (or illogic) is sim- ilar to what she said at the start of oneof her TLC programs: \"When I told myhusband I was a medium, he didn'tknow what to say.\" Wanting the viewerto believe she had to tell her husbandshe was a psychic after being married several years is a hard pill to swallow. He couldn't gure it out for himself? It also doesn't square with her saying on An- derson Live that she has been psychic all her life. If so, her husband should have known from the get-go. Hmmm. Now for the million-dollar question: Why does S\"\u00e0 eresa Caputo receive so many disconrming answers from the subject being read when she's a guest onother television shows, yet more con- rming answers when on her own pro- gram? Do I really have to answer this, or can I just say that it's much easier fora magician to do card tricks when they're using their own deck of cards? But what about some of the appar- ently amazing things she's done, likeconvincing a group of skeptics that she has true psychic ability? Did you hear about this one? S\"\u00e0 ere has to be a catch, right? as it turns out, according to CSIweb columnist Karen Stollznow, the \"skeptics\" were a group of Caputo's hus- band's friends in the motorcycle shop where he was employed. Her husband's friends. So why is she so popular? First, she has the same fast-paced speech and rapid-re readings that helped John Edward to fame. S\"\u00e0 is is a huge advan- tage because it doesn't give the person being read time to calculate hits and misses. But it sure seems like there have been many hits. S\"\u00e0 erefore, there are more readings to be subjectively vali- dated in a shorter amount of time, lead- ing to perceived accuracy (even though the rate of hits is poor). Second, she has a novel twist in that her TLC gig is, es- sentially, a reality show. Recall the im- promptu readings of strangers (in the David Blaine and Criss angel tradi- tion). again, I'm not staking my pay- check on these being truly impromptu encounters, but at least the illusion of such has been created. It's a fresh twist for a psychic television show. Same song\u2014dierent verse. S\"\u00e0 eresa Caputo won the Pigasus award for Performance from the James Randi Educational Foundation in 2012. Performance is the operative word. as for S\"\u00e0 e Learning Channel, what have we really learned? Now, for the saddestpart of all: Why do so many peoplewant to watch it? as usual, it tells us more about ourselves than it does Ca- puto or TLC.

So it was re- freshing when, after a multiyear hiatus, CSI got back into the conference scene in October 2011 with its CSICon con- ference in New Orleans. That proved a fun intellectual idea fest (see reports in our March/april 2012 issue). It wasgood to be back. For the 2012 confer-ence (October 25-28), CSI moved the CSICon site north to Nashville, an-other lively location, and the talks, sym- posia, and surrounding events garnered generally great reviews from partici- pants. The irrepressible Richard Wise man, the u.K. psychologist and CSI Fellow, emceed throughout the conference withhis usual effervescent wit.

George Hrab then enter- tained with his unique combination ofguitar and skeptical wit. (all this was preceded by two pre- conference workshops, one by the Skep -chicks applying skepticism to everydaynonsense, one on conducting investiga-tions.) The conference was off to a fine start. I was able to hear most sessions(I missed a couple of individual speak-ers). Some highlights I found memo-rable follow. Biologist P. z. Myers is most known for his outspoken attacks on religion, but at CSICon for the second year in a row,he surprised many by giving a straight science talk. The first part dealt with dif- fering rates of evolution. \"Selectionworks best in very large populationswith a low mutation rate,\" he said.\"Small populations with a high muta-tion rate are dominated by chance.\"Lest we think humans are numerous in biological terms, he quickly disabused.Humans have \"a small population,\"about 7 \u00d710 9.In contrast Pelagibacter, which make up half of all bacterial plankton in the ocean in summer, number about 2 \u00d71028. \"So in humans, selection is not the prime pressure for change.\" Recent research into the gorilla genome shows, to the surprise of some, that \"in 30 percent of the genome go- rillas are closer to humans or chim- panzees than the latter are to each other.\" He then described how that agrees with calculations in what's calledcoalescent theory, a population geneticsmodel for tracing genes back to com- mon ancestors. The anti-evolutionDiscovery Institute, Myers said, claims that the gorilla genome research messesup the human genetics connections tothe great apes. \"That's hilarious,\" Myerssaid. \"These people don't have a god- damned clue about evolutionary biol- ogy. They are dead wrong.\" Psychologist James alcock led off a session on Belief and Memory with a survey about belief, noting that beliefs are a dynamic production and can beproduced very quickly. Some beliefs are based on reason and carefully assembledevidence, but many are based on socialconstructions (we rely on the perceptionsand reactions of others we trust) and feeling. The \"feeling of knowing\" is anemotion and is not tied to knowledge and may have nothing to do with reality.as for belief and disbelief, assessment is a two-stage process. We automatically believe new information before we assessit. Judging it comes later, if at all. The brain processes content information and veracity information separately. He re- visited \"The Belief Engine\" he wrote about in SI many years ago (\"we are a belief-generating engine\") and endedby emphasizing again that some beliefscorrelate with reality, and some do not. Psychologist Elizabeth Loftus noted that beliefs can begin to feel like mem- ories, \"then we have false memories.\" She described some of her and colleagues' ground-breaking experiments demon- strating that beliefs can be implanted. She also gave examples of prominentpolitical figures recalling false memories, noting, \"no one is protected from having false memories.\" She also emphasizedthe notorious unreliability of eyewitness testimony, noting the Innocence Project has used DNa evidence to overturn 225 wrong ful convictions, \"most based on faulty memories.\" She facetiouslyproposed that the oath administered to witnesses testifying should be changed to: \"Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, or whatever you think you remember?\" March April 13 *_SI new design masters 1/31/13 9:53 AM Page 1314Volume 37 Issue 2 | Skeptical InquirerNeuroscientist Indre Viskontas praised the value of storytelling as a memory aid (\"to remember details of a past event,make them part of a great story\") butnoted that remembering is a reconstruc-tive process that is often the functionalequivalent of imagining. In \"Is Paul Dead?\" investigator Mas - simo Polidoro gave one of the most en- tertaining talks, a multimedia feast of imagery and music and sounds play- fully exploring the persistent idea that Paul McCartney of the Beatles is dead.\"What is going on here?\" Polidoro asked. \"There's no evidence of a pre- planned hoax. ... You start with an idea, and you look for proof. It can be anything. and it always works.\" another hilarious session featured Richard Wiseman, Jon Ronson (author of The Men Who Stare at Goats , made into the movie with George Cooney), and Rebecca Watson re counting theirCSI \"Paranormal Road Trip.\" In thisjourney earlier that week by car from CSI headquarters in amherst, New York, to the Nashville conference site looking for \"paranormal\" adventures they encountered a lot of \"haunted houses\" but nothing paranormal. Wise -man did find himself gobsmacked dur-ing a visit to the underground lair inKentucky of a leading collector of magic memorabilia (\"a cave full of magic\"). There, neatly shelved eighty feet under-ground, he found one of only fifteenfirst editions of a 1902 book, The Expert at the Card Table , by someone known only by the pseudonym S.W. Erdnase. The book was far ahead of its time, said Wise man, \"the best sleight of hand ever.\" \"We still don't know who wrote that book,\" Wiseman said. \"It is a realmystery.\" The group's planned visit to the Creation Museum in Kentucky didn'thappen. Recounted Watson: \"They said yes, you can film. But you can't make fun of us. We ended up skipping it.\" That evening, at the CSI Hallo ween Party, Wiseman was presented his ear- lier-announced CSI Balles annual Prize in Critical Think ing (SI, September/October 2012), for the best skepticalbook of the year, Para normality : Why W e See What Isn't There. On first thought the CSI Halloween Party might seem a strange venue for awarding Wiseman hisprize. But maybe it all does fit. He seemed to relish it. Sara Mayhew, the writer/illustrator of Manga-style graphic novels (see her cover article in the March/april 2012S KEPTICaL INquIRER ) gave another en tertaining talk, illustrated with herdrawings. \"I want to create a fandom- type feeling for skeptics and scientist heroes,\" she said. She noted that these comic versions of anime are a multimil- lion-dollar art form with a high female readership, about 70 percent in the u.S. \"Good role models present a variety of different people. Manga does that. The visit by Richard Wiseman, Jon Ronson, and Rebecca Watson to the Creation Museum in Kentucky didn't happen. Recounted Watson: \"They said yes, you can film. But you can't make fun of us. We ended up skipping it.\"March April 13 *_SI new design masters 1/31/13 9:53 AM Page 14Skeptical Inquirer | March/April 2013 15Having more female role models is good for young men and males as well.\" She said one can apply the same goal to sci- ence role models. \"My goal is to combine my love of sci- ence and critical thinking with this emo- tional art form for people to connect.\" Like Indiana Jones (\"a cool scientist role model\") or the women in her stories, \"Weneed more of these epic stories,\" but in- stead of \"faith\" and \"believe\" as themes, seen too often in other epics, \"we can havea message of, 'How do we know about the world?' in an honest way. We need heroes who think their way out of crises, who care about the truth.\" With two strong statements\u2014\"Just be- cause you call something science doesn'tmake it so\" and \"There is no scientific ev-idence against evolution,\" Eugenie C. Scott of the National Cen ter for Science Education began her report on the current status of evolution-creation disputes. at their root is that creationists mistakenly believe that \"evidence against evolution equals evidence for creation,\" thus their continual attacks on evolution and theirevolving strategies for undermining its teaching. Statehouse legislatures are a prime tar- get. about forty \"Evidence against Evo- lution\" bills, also called \"academic free- dom\" bills, exist in various stages. Two have passed, in Louisiana and Ten nessee. Creationists are masters at distorting the meaning of words. \"If you see 'bal- anced' and 'evolution' on the same page, you know you are looking at a creationistdocument.\" Other euphem isms to look out for are \"full range of and learners does them favors.\" Most all these latest bills avoid men- tioning religion, stress free speech, advo- cate teacher protection if teaching \"alter- natives\" to evolution, and use permissive language (\"allow\" not \"require\"). \"They are very clever the way they set up these bills.\" What to do? Inform yourself, pay at- tention to your legislature and state and local school boards, and support good sci- ence standards and teaching. as for the CONFERENCE REPORT] \"What harm does it do?\" That is the perennial challenge hurled at skeptics. What harm is there in people credulously believing in things that aren't true, that are too good to be true? When it comes to economic fraud crimes, the harm is self-evident. Money is lost, lots of it. Sometimes one's life savings, sometimes entire fortunes. Psychologist Anthony Pratkanis, of the University of California, Santa Cruz, is deeply involved in this issue, and he gave a powerful presentation on the weapons of fraud\u2014how cons and criminals scam the public. Amer icans alone lose $40 bil- lion a year in telemarketing fraud, $110 billion in fraud generally. Worldwide, the totals are staggering. There is no evidence for the myth of the weak victim. The weak and the strong are taken. And the evidence indicates that seniors are less susceptible, not more; they are just targeted more. Victims are more likely to have experienced a nega-tive life event. And contrary to what you might expect, victims are more, not less, financially literate. They think they are im- mune. That makes everyone susceptible. Social influence is the weapon in fraud crimes, Pratkanis emphasized. He showed parts of a training video, \"Weapons of Fraud, \" detailing how scam artists tailor their pitch to what makes you vulnerable. (\"It's like cold reading. \") Theykeep and share records of phone conver- sations. They use such weapons as phan- tom fixation (something you would likethat is completely unavailable), social proof (\"other people are winning\"), false scarcity (about this rare 1860 coin, \"There are only four left in the world\"), authority, reciprocity, and a whole litany of others. Can we stop it? Pratkanis de scribed a project he and his psychologist col- leagues have been working on with the FBI and other law enforcement authori- ties. It is called Santa Monica's Reverse Boiler Room. It involves identifying victims before the con is completed, calling them, and warning them. The reverse call center sends out prevention messages, giving people a coping strategy. Ethical safeguards have been put in place, and the FBI is on-site to monitor. Victims are debriefed. Does it work? \"It has cut the victim- ization rate in half, \" says Pratkanis. \"This is the first demonstration of an effective deterrent to this crime. ... Forewarning works. \" As a scientist, Pratkanis says he finds this work \"exhilarating. \" But as a human being, \"I got depressed. We can see how it [scamming] works. Yet it keeps going on and on. \" His advice to others? \"Develop those skeptical skills. Keep asking those crit- ical questions. \" \u2014K.F .

Lindsay's somewhat critical review of Mooney's book in SI.) My introduction was a shorter form of what became my editorial \"Can We Have Civilized Con versa tions about Touchy Science Policy Issues\" in our Jan - uary/February 2013 issue. Mooney, knowing he was much the target of the ensuing two talks, began by noting that he is a science journalist covering the research on the subject. \"I'm reporting on the research. So if you don't like the conclusions, don't blame me, blame the science.\" He reiterated that those studies show that \"there's something unique about Re pub licans' view of science,\" and it involves \"not just denial of science\" but \"denial of reality.\"He maintained that liberals and conser-vatives \"have different personalities.\" Without even considering political con-tent, key conservative traits are consci- entiousness and order and stability while a key liberal trait is openness to new experience and new ideas. These traits explain much about the different parties' political views and their atti- tudes toward science. In his view con- servatives' need for \"cognitive closure\" and a tendency toward authoritarian certainty and black-and-white views is antithetical to scientific thinking. Dan Kahan, a professor of law and of psychology at Yale university, was first up.The essential problem all are concerned about, he said, is \"the failure of valid and amply disseminated science to persuade.\" He offered \"one good explanation\" and four \"not so good\" explanations.The good explanation, said Kahan, is what he calls \"identity-protective cog-nition.\" It is simply this: \"People have group allegiances that make them inter- pret science findings in different ways.\" Those ways consistently go in the direc- tion of the values that protect their group identity. Other, not-so-good ex- planations include science denial, mis- information, a rationality deficit, and authoritarian personality. Science de- nialism fails as an explanation becauseviews are divided along lines consistent with their group. People of each party \"count someone as an expert when he has positions consistent with their cul- tural outlook.\" Both parties believe in being guided by a scientific consensus, \"but they disagree on what that consen-sus is.\" Lindsay recounted the evidence he amassed in his SI review calling intoquestion Mooney's key conclusions. He concluded that one problem is that many of the studies Mooney cited may actually not be measuring conservatism. unfortunately, the session's time ran out before Mooney could give any real response, other than to say that he dis- agreed with virtually all of Lindsay's criticisms. Nevertheless, after the ses- sion they were seen sitting at a table to- gether in what seemed amiable conver- sation, so perhaps, in this setting at least, the civility sought in the title of my SI editorial prevailed. In his \"The Science of Medicine\" column in the November/December2010 S KEPTICaL INquIRER ,Yale School of Medicine physician Steven Novella wrote tellingly about \"The Misunder -stood Placebo,\" and in his talk he re- turned to that topic. The so-called placebo effect is a sub- jective-only effect, he said, not an objec- tive one. It is manipulated by psychol- ogy only, not physiology. Most placebo effects are illusory effects that depend upon belief in getting traction. as for Novella, What other option is there?\" So-called \"placebo March April 13 *_SI new design masters 1/31/13 9:53 AM Page 16Skeptical Inquirer | March/April 2013 17 CONFERENCE REPORT] medicine\" exploits the confusion about placebos. It makes vague use of the term \"healing\" and plays into the branding and marketing of \"comple- mentary and alternative medicine\"(see adjacent sidebar about the pseu- doscience in medical schools). an ex-ample of the exploitation of placebo confusion is the often heard statement that \"acu punc ture works\u2014as a placebo.\" That, the outcome was nega- tive.\" So what's the harm? Ex tolling a \"installing bizarre, unsci- entific, mystical, nonscientific beliefsin patients.\" In case you didn't know it, the world was supposed to end on De-cember 21, 2012. The myth of an im- pending apocalypse on that date\u2014 drawing on everything from the Mayan calendar to supposed Sumer- ian or biblical predictions, to worries about comets or the nonexistent planet Nibiru, to pole shifts, planetary alignments, and solar flares\u2014infectedcredulous websites across the Internet and worried the hell out of a signifi- cant share of the world's population (10 percent of americans, according to a Reuters poll). Things got so bad that in the first week of December theRussian government put out an an- nouncement that the world would not end later that month, and in the united States NaSa did much thesame thing. Come to think about it, as I write up these notes in mid December, it's probably all for naught, but in the oft chance the world continues after the winter solstice, I'll continue. Planetary scientist David Morrison, as SI read- ers know, has been at the forefront of trying to rebut these rumors, provid- ing accurate scientific information through NaSa's \"ask an astrobiolo- gist\" website, CSI's website, and in ar- ticles and other forums. He spoke at CSICon Nashville. The whole thing would be silly and laughable except that Morrison gets pained messages from childrenA problem of serious concern to skeptics these days is the rapid perfusion of pseudo- science into medical schools. This practice is eagerly promoted by proponents of so-called alternative medicine and increasingly allowed by a medical education culture not alert to what's at stake. Prominent physicians in the skeptical movement brought the practice into the spot- light in a major CSICon symposium on the problem. One good label for the infiltration of pseu- doscience into medical schools is \"Quacka- demic Medi cine, \" a term coined by physicianRobert W. Don nell. In the CSI symposium, can- cer surgeon David Gorski, who edits the Sci- ence-Based Medicine website, used that term approvingly. He noted that quackery has un- dergone a linguistic evolution, a \"major re- branding of quackery. \" What forty years ago was properly called \"unscientific medicine\" began to be called, in the 1970s and 1980s, \"alter- native medicine. \" (He considers that simply \"unproven\" and \"often, disproven\" practices.) \"Com ple mentary and Alter n ative Medicine\" (CAM) came along in the 1990s, and now there is another rebranding: \"Inte icine = science + magic. \" Major medical schools like the University of Maryland and George town have been integrat- ing CAM throughout their curriculum and even into basic science courses. This has proven popular. \"Bioener getic medicine\" is another new term, allowing the teaching of such non- scientific concepts as a \"vital force\" and \"qi. \" \"This is the foot in the door . . . like the Trojan Horse, \" said Gorski. Har vard, Michigan, and the Cleve land Clinic are all welcoming these intrusions of questionable medical concepts into their curricula. Often the cry is heard to \"treat the whole patient. \" \"This pisses me off, \" said Gorski. \"That's what doctors already do, \" he notes. \"And it cre- ates a false dichotomy: You don't need to use quackery to 'treat the whole patient. '\" He and other concerned physicians see an increasing hostility toward science-based medicine. One commentator even has called evidence-based healthcare \"micro fascism. \" Contributing to the problem is the relative indifference of most physicians, what Gorski refers to as a \"shruggie, \" a person who doesn't care. \"Most doctors just don't care. \" \"SkepDoc\" Harriet Hall, a frequent SI con- tributor, said what's happening in medical schools is a reflection of what's happening in society overall. The view is, in short, \"We don't need no stinkin' intellectuals\" and \"We don't need no education\u2014we have Google. \" Other factors include the ideas that positive thinking makes it so and \"my facts are as good as any others, \" a distrust for authority, looking for an easy solution, postmodernism (truth is rela- tive), and a rising acceptability of doctor- bashing. She told the story of a retired physician who took up acupuncture and soon found it working on everything. Wrote this doctor:\"There is nothing like personal experience toconvince one of an effect. \" Hall noted that he made a litany of common mistakes: confir- mation bias, using biased sources, not rec- ognizing how charisma can influence your view, cherry-picking the data, not under- standing why science is necessary, relying on personal experience, the cause-effect fallacy,'Quackademic Medicine': Teaching Pseudoscience in Medical Schools David Gorski and other concerned physicians see an increasing hostility toward science based medicine. One commentator even has called evidence-based healthcare \"micro fascism.\" March April 13 *_SI new design masters 1/31/13 9:53 AM Page 17the ancient wisdom fallacy, and relying on the personal experience of others. \"The plural of anecdote is not evidence, \" Hall commented. She lamented that critical thinking is not taught in medical schools. Kimball Atwood, another frequent contrib- utor to SI and to Science-Based Medicine, re- iterated Gorski's view that misleading lan- guage contributes to giving nonscientific and pseudoscientific medical practices a free pass. Terms such as \"allopathic, \" \"holistic, \" \"complementary, \" \"alternative, \" \"integrative, \" and \"Western\" all mislead. Atwood raised a reasonable question: \"Why discuss implausible claims at all?\" He believes medical schools should teach sci- entific skepticism. There are also important lessons in the history of medicine that can be taught, like the downfall of bloodletting and the \"pre-scientific practices\" that persist today, such as homeopathy, where teaching about Avogadro's number could help stu- dents understand homeopathy's innate im- plausibility. Skepti cism, with its emphasis on logical fallacies and its insistence that clear thinking should trump pseudoscience, has great value. As for worries that it may be impolite or impolitic to raise such issues, Atwood said, \"Clear thinking should not be sacrificed on the altar of politeness. \" It is a question of medical ethics, he em- phasized: \"Implausi ble treatments are uneth- ical. Deceptive placebos are unethical. And human studies of highly implausible claims are unethical. \" Eugenie C. Scott was the only non-physi- cian who spoke. As executive director of the National Center for Science Education (and a physical anthropologist) she has great con- cerns about allowing more and more pseu- doscience into medical schools. \"It will mise- ducate students, \" she said. As for academic freedom, that is important, she noted, be- cause it allows teachers to teach unpopular ideas and to challenge students. But there is also \"academic judgment, \" she insisted. \"The issues are quite profound. \" The S KEPTICAl INQUIRER plans a future article on how nonscientific concepts are making their way into the education of physicians. \u2014K.F. 18Volume 37 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirerso caught up in these beliefs that they tell him they are contemplating sui- cide or killing their pets to spare themfrom the devastation. Morrison recounted some of these messages and the \"conflation of a va-riety of threads\" of non-fact-basedbelief about all of it. \"None of these 'facts' is true,\" he emphasized. \"No scientist supportsany of these claims. None of these stories is covered in newspapers or TV.\" It has been almost entirely an Internet phenomenon. as for a supposed galactic align- ment, \"I don't know what an align-ment is. It's not a term used by as- tronomers. There is no alignment in December. There is no core of fact tothis. These things are not going to happen.\" Says Morrison: \"It's all part of a mindset that believes in prophecy.\" Morrison labels this new outlook \"Cosmophobia\u2014the fear of the end ofthe universe.\" People who believe it are getting all their \"information\" onY ouTube and elsewhere on the Inter -net. The problem has been exacerbated by the fact that \"science shows on cableTV have gotten a lot worse.\" assumingshort attention spans, the trend now,even on mainstream channels, is to be \"hyper-exciting,\" with explosions, im -pacts, and so on every ninety seconds. The conspiracy meme doesn't help, says Morrison. \"People afraid of the government in one area have spread it to every topic.\"Sharon Hill, using lively illustra- tions, spoke on \"How to Think about Weird News.\" Hill, a geologist bytraining, does the Doubtful News blog and writes a column on CSI's website called \"Sounds Science-y.\" (an SI ar-ticle on that subject by Hill appeared in our March/april 2012 issue.) \"I'm a 'weird news' junky,\" she said. \"Weird news is my favorite conversa-tion topic.\" Weird news makes for a good story, she says: \"Mystery is mon- gered. The wow factor is stressed. ... TV and entertainment is our new mis- information highway.\" She considers the main audience for her Doubtful News site \"the criticalthinking community.\" The topics she examines are endless, the sources piti- ful: \"Real things entwined withwrongness.\" Videos are hoaxed, birdsfall from the sky, strange sounds are heard, dead carcasses of normal ani- mals are claimed to be demonoids or monsters. She has a whole category called \"underwater mysteries.\" Then there are the quack cancer cures, al-ways a problem for science-mindedskeptics (\"There is almost no way towrite about them without sounding heartless\"), bogus consumer products, and emotional appeals.

He dedi- cated his talk to CSI founder PaulKurtz, who, Lilienfeld observed, \"wasalways respectful and gentlemanly.\" Lilienfeld, a psychologist and mem- ber of the CSI Executive Council,spoke on \"The Great Myths of PopularPsychology.\" He noted that \"even forour brightest students, it's a confusing world out there.\" The pop psychologyindustry perpetuates myths, and no oneis immune. For instance, 77 percent ofhis students begin by believing thatschizophrenics have \"multiple person-alities,\" 63 percent think memory is likea video camera, 47 percent say memo- ries don't change, and 61 percent thinkhypnosis is useful in solving crimes. This \"na\u00fcve realism\u2014the belief that theworld is exactly as we see it\"\u2014is exem-plified by the belief that eyewitness ob-servation is always correct and in theoften-heard (and often exactly wrong) phrases \"seeing is believing\" and \"Iknow what I saw.\" Lilienfeld ranged over a variety of examples of selective perception and memory, including illusory correlations(such as the repeatedly debunked ideathat psychiatric admissions increase during the full moon) where \"our brainsare making the correlation.\" He endedby bringing up the troubling implica-tions of some recent research. Debunk-ing can be effective, these studies show,but it can also have backfire effects, re-inforcing beliefs instead of disabusingpeople of them. \"We need more than debunking; we need alternative ac-counts. ... Spend more time telling what's true, not what's false.\" It was good advice and a fine way to end a memorable conference. The next CSICon will be at the same time next year (October 24-27, 2013) in Seattle/Tacoma.

Kendrick Frazieris a member of the CSI Exec- utive Council and editor of the S KEPTICAL INqUIRER . CONFERENCE REPORT] Gender issues continue to gain attention and generate controversy. Good science, critical inquiry, and clear thinking all can help illuminate, not exacerbate, the issues. A morning session on gender issues ex- plored the degree to which psychological differences between the sexes exist and to what degree they are hardwired or the re- sult of culture. Richard lippa of California State Uni- versity, Fullerton, offered a thought ful exam- ination of Janet Hyde's argument that there are not that many differences. He first looked at psychological differences. In the dimensions of agreeableness and neuroti- cism, women tend to be more highly repre- sented. In the domain of mental illness,males tend to have such disorders as autism, mental retardation, reading disor- ders, and Tourette's syndrome, while women experience more depression by a 2:1 ratio and also tend to have more bipo- lar, panic, and conversion disorders. Among personality disorders, males tend muchmore than females to be antisocial or so- ciopaths. \"So there are big differences in psychology, \" he said. As for overall intelligence, any differ- ences are small. One area where differ- ences arebig is along the people-things di- mension. Men tend always to be more interested in things-oriented occupations, women in people-oriented occupations, and studies show that holds true over fifty- three nations. As for social behaviors, men tend to be more aggressive (10:1 male: fe- male ratio of murderers). Overall, between men and women, he said studies show that some differences are small, some differences are moderate, and some differences are large. Psychologist Carol Tavris (author of such books as The\u00adMismeasure\u00adof\u00adWomen) next took the stage. \"That was a terrific talk, \" she said of lippa's presentation. \"I have no dif- ferences with it. So I'm going to leave now!\" The audience laughed. She proceeded. She called for perspective (\"either/ or thinking is not going to get us anywhere\") and a sense of history. She noted that women have come a long way since 1960. She reiterated, \"I completely agree withRichard re garding psychological differ- ences. \" But she said many sex differences have flipped over in the past decade or two. \"The problem is stereotypes . \" She cau- tioned against \"taking snapshots that as- sume differences at any time tell us about fundamental\u00ad differences. \" Another caution is that in surveys \"what people sayhas little to do with how they behave .... You don't see the major differences when you look at behavior . \" As an example, she said if you define aggression as \"intention to harm, \" you don't see sex differences. \"We just express it in different ways. ... Women are likely to ru- minate more than men. \" As for brain differ- ences, there are indeed many anatomical and activity differences in men/women brains, but it all comes down to \"so what?\" She pointed to three general problems with generalizing about brain differences: There is no correlation with behavior, brains are complex, and each brain is unique. What is the future of sex differences, and where are we going from here? Tavris summarized things this way. A lot in society is changing. It's women who are getting the educations. We are seeing huge differ- ences in economic status. Women are now earning more, getting better educated, and getting better jobs, so many are delaying marriage. \"The whole planet is becoming Sweden, \" is how she put it. Changes are being caused by the global economy and circumstances. A memorable moment came when a man in the audience concerned about how to think about gender differences asked Tavris for advice about raising his daughter. She replied succinctly: \"Enjoy the ones thatmatter, ignore the rest. \" \u2014K.F.\u00adGender Issues in Science: What's Different, What's Not?

Discover.\"), in Manches- ter, England, March 10-11, 2012\u2014 where I was the closing speaker and acryptozoology panelist\u2014I went on aninvestigative jaunt with British skepticand investigator Hayley Stevens andher father andy, who is a photographerand professional driver and guide. HereI focus on the Scotland portion of ourtour, beginning with the enduring case of the Loch Ness Monster. The Lair Located in the Scottish Highlands, and stretching for almost twenty-threemiles, is a narrow, trench-like basin, 227 meters in depth at its deepest point,holding the greatest volume of freshwater in all of Britain. S\"\u00e0 is is theworld's most famous lake, Loch Ness, home to the world's most famous\u2014and least terrifying\u2014legendary lake mon- ster. \"Nessie\" is best known from a 1934 photograph, showing it as a long- necked, small-headed, plesiosaur-likecreature but in fact proving to havebeen a hoax made by photographing a small model (Nickell 1995, 242). Now, it is not true that Loch Ness is unique among Scottish lakes, or even nearly so, in having a resident monster. Whereas one writer claims there are only two others in Scotland, Loch Morar and Loch Tay, Ronald Binns (1984, 183n) observes that there are\"not three but dozens of 'Lochs naBeiste,'\" including one we had lunchbeside, Loch Lomond. admittedly thatlake has little monster tradition, consis-tent with the statement of a gentleman we encountered there; he announced emphatically that there was \"no mon-ster.\" He is probably correct, although some locals speak of \"Lomonda\" who never caught on (\"Balloch and LochLomond\" 2006). Loch Ness is of coursea dierent story. Water Kelpies S\"\u00e0 e earliest recorded encounter with Nessie is told in e Life of St. Columba. Supposedly Columba (a Christian mis- sionary, 521-597 CE) sent a man toswim across the River Ness to retrieve a boat, when he was approached by the monster. S\"\u00e0 e future saint quickly \"formed the sign of the cross in the empty air\" and commanded the crea- ture to go back, whereupon it fled. S\"\u00e0 atis a saint's legend\u2014one of a genre of narratives that are intended to demon- strate the power of God and that are notoriously incredible. Moreover, the account was written circa 700 CE, wellover a century after the events they pur- port to describe (Shine 2006, 6; Coul- son 1958, 134). Many Scottish legends tell of kelpies or water-horses, supernatural watercreatures that prey on humans. \"S\"\u00e0 eir trick,\" states Stuart McHardy, in his Tales of Loch Ness (2009, 52), \"was to ap- pear as a wandering horse and induceone or more humans to climb on theirbacks. S\"\u00e0 en they would make straight for their watery home and dive in, their supernatural powers keeping the hu-mans on their backs as if glued.\" (See also Leach 1984, 573.) Today, kelpies are relegated to the distant past, but as recently as July 1, 1853, the Inverness Courier reported the sighting of two strange animals. Some thought a single sea serpent was coiled at the surface, while others suspected a pair of whales or large seals.

Looking back, it is easy to see that any of several creatures might havegiven rise to water-horse sightings\u2014inaddition, of course, to actual horses andponies! Other possibilities are the oc-casional swimming roe deer, which lacktrue antlers but instead have short dou- ble-pronged horns (Binns 1984, 191- 93), and the its longmuzzle. Says naturalist adrian Shine(2006, 28), \"If ever a sh had a horse'shead it would certainly be the Stur-geon.\" Rounding Up Suspects On our four-day excursion to Loch Ness, we found the locals to be quite playful regarding the \"monster.\" For ex- ample, at the Glen Ord distillery where I told a tour guide we had come to the area to hunt Nessie, the woman quipped that we were quite right to make a distillery our \"rst stop.\" In booking passage on a sonar-equipped boat to tour the loch, I asked if this were where we got our hunting license for the monster, to which a ticket sellerdead-panned that we would have better luck hunting Nessie on land\u2014meaning where the toy creatures are sold. and on the boat itself, when I wondered aloud whether rifles would be available to Nessie hunters, a boat hand quickly an- swered that, no, harpoons would be is- sued \"when needed.\" More seriously, we made several in- quiries. an information ocer in In- verness told us she had seen seals in the River Ness, which passes through the city, linking the loch with the North Sea. Seals are among the monster lookalikes that are endemic either to the Loch or its environs. although the sturgeon is now almost extinct in Scot- tish waters, one could have occasionally entered the loch to become, say, the \"huge sh\" of 1882. additional deer, long-necked waterbirds, bobbing logs, boat wakes, wind slicks, and more (Shine 2006). S\"\u00e0 en there is the large European otter ( Lutra lutra ). Otters resemble seals, and both are able to appear on land. However, otters also appear in rivers and lakes that are not accessibleto seals. S\"\u00e0 e otter's long neck and un-dulating movements can give it a mon-sterlike look (Binns 1984, 186-91).

Iconography S\"\u00e0 e iconography (or study of images) of the Loch Ness Monster is illuminat-ing. From St. Columba's \"WaterBeast\"\u2014with \"gaping mouth and with great roaring\"\u2014and Scottish folklore'shorse-headed kelpie, to the plesiosaur-like creature of the 1934 hoax photo, the monster has continued to evolve. Ithas since been described as six to 125feet in length; shaped like a great eel ofa creature with up to nine humps; col-ored silver, gray, blue-black, black, or brown; ns, mane, horns, or tusks (Binns 1984; Gould 1934). No doubt the extremely diverse de- scriptions are explained by the dier- ences in asthe S\"\u00e0 einfamous 1934 hoaxed photo obviouslydid much to influence the developingportrait, although paleontologists have since postulated that plesiosaurs were unable to raise their long necks (Shine 2006, 11). In Figure 1, I have com- pressed the iconography of Nessie into a single humorous image that, I trust, makes an eective point. Nessie Hunters at the Loch Ness Exhibition Centre in Drumnadrochit, we received the gener- ous attention of adrian Shine, the ven- erable naturalist and Loch Ness expert, who has been a Nessie hunter since 1973. S\"\u00e0 e Centre is brilliantly con-ceived, a wonderful science museum disguised as a Nessie exhibit. It teaches continental drift, evolution, perception, and a number of other scientic matters while skeptically\u2014but tactfully\u2014dis- cussing the famous monster. Shine'sbook Loch Ness supplements the tour with fascinating data and pictures\u2014in-cluding one that remarkably recreatesthe previously mentioned 1934 hoaxed photo (2006, 11).

My at- tention has therefore been drawn back tothe fundamental tenets of the \"strongprogramme\" in the sociology of scientic knowledge, also known as SSK. One of its founders, David Bloor, summarizedthem as follows: 1. [S\"\u00e0 e program] would becausal, that is, concerned with theconditions which bring about be-lief or states of knowledge. Nat- urally there would be other typesof causes apart from social oneswhich will cooperate in bringingabout belief. 2. It would be impartial with respect to truth and falsity, ration-ality or irrationality, success or failure. Both sides of these di- chotomies will require explana-tion. 3. It would be symmetrical in its style of explanation. S\"\u00e0 e same types of causes would explain, say, true and false beliefs.4. It would be reflexive. In prin- ciple its patterns of explanation would have to be applicable to sociology itself. Go ahead, re-read the list and see ifyou can spot the problem. It's number three, the clause about symmetrical ex- planations. To see why, consider thecase in which we are trying to explain why young-Earth creationism is a fa-vorite position among the americanpublic, contrasting it with why the sci- entic community at large thinks in-stead that Earth is billions of years old. as a philosopher of science, I would want to invoke an asymmetry in the two cases: the rst is an instance of pseudoscience, the second of actual sci-ence. S\"\u00e0 e rst belief is\u2014to the best of our knowledge and abilities\u2014wrong,while the second one is at least approx- imately correct. You would think that part of the explanation for the dier- ence between the two beliefs has to dowith the truth of the latter and the fal- sity of the former (in agreement, inci- dentally, with the second part of num-ber one above). If so, then scientists be- lieve in an old Earth because the bestevidence available to us points to the truth of that belief. On the contrary, the fact that a large section of the american public believes in a young Earth is epis- temically anomalous (i.e., it doesn't have rational standing based on evidence),and it is therefore likely to have socio-logical (and psychological) explana- tions, for instance of the type traced by sociologist Richard Hofstadter in his1964 classic, Anti-Intellectualism in American Life. S\"\u00e0 is sensible solution is precluded to the SSK approach by the symmetryclause. S\"\u00e0 e idea is further explained bysociologist Trevor Pinch: \"We ask not why science is more true than other ac- counts of the world . . . but rather howdo scientists reach agreement ahem, yes\u2014but[THINKING ABOUT SCIENCE MASSIMO PIGLIUCCI Massimo Pigliucci is professor of philosophy at the City University of New York, a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and author of Answers for Aristotle: How Science and Philosophy Can Lead Us to A More Meaningful Life. His essays can be found at rationallyspeaking.org. The Proper Role of Sociology of Science The fact that a large section of the American public believes in a young Earth is epistemically anomalous (i.e., it doesn't have rational standing based on evidence), and it is therefore likely to have sociological (and psychological) explanations.March April 13 *_SI new design masters 1/31/13 9:53 AM Page 2324Volume 37 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirershouldn't (approximate, provisional) truth gure somewhere into that ac- count? No, says Pinch, because \"We try to avoid explaining the emergence of truth by reference to its truthfulness be- cause such explanations are circular.\" Now, avoiding circularity is a com- mendable goal, most certainly in linewith anything a reasonable philosopher would suggest. But if you go back to the quotes above you may notice a sleight of hand: Bloor's goal (shared by Pinch) is to explain belief , not truth . If so, then there is no circularity at all involved inexplaining some beliefs by invoking their (likely) truth, and indeed in distin-guishing them from other beliefs on the basis that the latter are (likely) untrue. Why wouldn't proponents of the SSK adopt this time honored and eminentlycommonsensical approach to belief for-mation, then? Because they would have much less to say about scientic knowledge, the most prized of their targets. after all,sociologists are typically in no position (as in fact acknowledged on several oc- casions by both Bloor and Pinch) to ad- judicate disputes in natural science. S\"\u00e0 at's the job of the natural scientiststhemselves, as well as the meta-job, soto speak, of philosophers of science (in their role of epistemologists). S\"\u00e0 e scope of sociology, then, would be limited to the (partial) explanation of why somepeople happen to believe things that are not true. apparently, this respectable and indeed useful contribution of soci- ology is not enough for proponents of SSK, who wish to arrogate for them- selves a much broader role, one that they cannot justify other than by invok- ing the symmetry postulate, thus be-coming the lightning rod for the scorn of scientists and philosophers of science alike. (and, I would hope, of skeptics!) None of the above argues for not doing sociology of science, of course. Scientists themselves\u2014either individu- ally or as a group\u2014sometimes do holduntrue beliefs for nonrational reasons, and sometimes do so for decades (just think of eugenics, or Piltdown man). In those cases science and philosophy of science can point out why such beliefs were epistemically unwarranted but cannot explain why they were held, at times widely, nonetheless. S\"\u00e0 at explana- tion becomes then the province of psy- chology (for individual beliefs) and so- ciology (for socially widespread beliefs). S\"\u00e0 e resulting picture is one where nat- ural scientists, philosophers, psycholo- gists, and sociologists work together toprovide a full account of both true and untrue (or, to be more precise, warranted and unwarranted) human beliefs.

S\"\u00e0 e Fox aliate in Denver, KDVR, seems de- termined to prove them correct. OnNovember 8, they broadcast a video ofan ill-dened, very fast-moving object that they described as a mys- obviously an insect\u2014proba- bly a fly. KDVR received some supposed \"uFO\" videos from a man who doesnot want to be identied, which to anyseasoned reporter should immediately raise a red flag. S\"\u00e0 e videos were taken on a hilltop in Federal Heights, at 84th ave. and Federal Blvd., looking south toward downtown Denver. S\"\u00e0 e \"uFOs\" appear at least several times a week, weare told, usually around noon to 1 PM (perhaps not coincidentally, around the warmest part of the day when most fly-ing insects become more active). S\"\u00e0 e anonymous photographer, who has been lming these objects for months, believes that the uFOs are being \"launched\" from someplace around56th ave. and Clay St. in Denver, which is a residential area. S\"\u00e0 e \"uFO\" is said to be flying too fast to be seen by the naked eye, and it's necessary to slow down the video. S\"\u00e0 e object is seen to dive down toward the ground, between the ground and the camera (for example, at 1:29 into the video; also at 1:40 and 2:40). as in thecase of other fly uFO videos, we are not shown the entire, unedited video. If we were, it would very likely be obvious how small the object is when it is seen clearly against the nearby ground. S\"\u00e0 e \"investigative reporter\" Heidi Hemmat contacted an aviation expert, Steve Cowell, who is described as \"a former commercial pilot, instructor andFaa accident prevention counselor.\"as far as I can tell, these qualications have nothing to do with optics, videophotography, still photography, insects, or, for that matter, uFOs. Cowell pro- claimed, rather self-evidently, that theobject was no kind of aircraft, helicop-ter, or bird. Hemmat said that Cowell also proclaimed that it wasn't an insect,although he later disputed this. S\"\u00e0 e Faa and NORaD were consulted,and both reported that there was no air trac in that area. \"and it's not a bug,\"said Hemmat, \"people keep saying it's abug.\" Perhaps you should investigatethat possibility? But no, an \"expert\" has spoken, and Hemmat would never question that. If I had a nickel for every time some \"expert\" said something idi- otic about uFOs, I'd be rich. KDVR sent its own cameraman to the spot, and he, too, photographed at least one fly. S\"\u00e0 is was taken as conr-mation that mysterious uFOs are in-deed buzzing around Denver on a reg- ular basis. S\"\u00e0 is story is a serious contender for the stupidest news reportof 2012, although there is a lot of sticompetition for that honor. CNN and other news outlets soon picked up the story as well. Obviously delighted by all the atten- tion its tabloid story received, on No- vember 20 KDVR did a second report on the fly uFO (http://tinyurl.com/KDVRfly2). S\"\u00e0 is time they consulted an entomologist, Mary ann Hamilton, Sheaffer's \"Psychic Vibrations\" column has appeared in the S KEPTICALINQUIRERfor more than thirty years; its high- lights have now been published as a book (Create Space 2011).

S\"\u00e0 e shape isinconsistent with an insect.\" She doesnot say whether she is familiar withstill-frame video representations ofout-of-focus moving objects. Mean-while, skeptics from the Rocky Moun-tain Paranormal Research Society wentto the supposed uFO spot and foundplenty of people already sitting there, looking for uFOs themselves! S\"\u00e0 ey setup a video camera and recorded flyuFOs too. One uFO even flew be- tween the camera and a cardboard screen they had set up about ten feet away (http://tinyurl.com/bpoq44v). S\"\u00e0 at's a tiny uFO indeed! uFO author Leslie Kean noted on her Facebook page, \"S\"\u00e0 e object in these[KDVR] videos looks like the one fromChile at the El Bosque aF Base.\" S\"\u00e0 is is the Chilean fly uFO video she hasbeen promoting as being perhaps \"thecase uFO skeptics have been dreading\"(see this column, SI, July/august 2012). It started a huge controversy as even many uFO proponents argued it was just a bug. It only took months of analysis and twotrips to Chile to meet with the promoters of the celebrated fly uFO video, the CEFaa, the Chilean equivalent of the american Faa, but she nally has reached a conclusion: there is no conclusion (http://tinyurl .com/keanfly2). One uFO \"photo ex- pert\" concluded it was indeed a bug, while another concluded it couldn't possibly be one. Kean is quite contentto pronounce the identity of the object unknowable, a controversy at the fringes of scientic knowledge: \"Each of us can form our own opinions aboutsomething that science cannot deter-mine, or we can simply accept that wewill likely never know.\" absurd! S\"\u00e0 is is not rocket science\u2014the object is just a fly, and it turns up on other videostaken at the same spot! at least Kean did nally throw in the towel October 17 on Facebook con- cerning the now-confessed Belgianhoax photo from Petit-Rechain (see this column, SI, January/February2012). Touted as solid uFO evidence in her book UFOs: Generals, Pilots and Government Ocials Go On the Record,she concedes, \"Yes, this photo seems to be a fake, unfortunately. Belgian re-searchers have looked into it. I have toupdate this in my book.\" Well, I guessthat's a step in the right direction. S\"\u00e0 ere are still a few dozen other uFO cases in her book that need to be acknowl- edged as mistakes or as hoaxes, but thenshe wouldn't have much of a book left. * * * S\"\u00e0 ere are new developments in the fa-mous supposedly uFO-related disap- pearance of Fredrick Valentich, a twenty-year-old pilot in australia. On October 21, 1978, he was piloting aCessna 182L light aircraft over Bass Strait. He intended to land at King Is- land and return to Moorabbin airport. However, he never made it to King Island, 127 miles away. Some of the nal exchanges between Valentich(DSJ) and Melbourne Flight Services (FS; Robey) are as follows (from Wiki - pedia): 19:06:14 DSJ: Melbourne, this is Delta Sierra Juliet. Is there anyknown trac below ve thou- sand? FS: Delta Sierra Juliet, no known trac. DSJ: Delta Sierra Juliet, I am, seems to be a large aircraft below ve thousand. 19:06:44 FS: Delta Sierra Juliet, What type of aircraft is it?

Neither Valentich norhis aircraft was ever seen or heard from again. at last we have some new informa- tion on this puzzling case: \"adelaide re-searcher Keith Bastereld has been fol- lowing the case since the disappearance in 1978, but had been told by the Gov-ernment in 2004 the ocial le had been lost or destroyed. He 'found' itwhen searching through an online Na-tional archives index on an unrelatedtopic. S\"\u00e0 e le has since been digitizedand uploaded on the archive's website\"(http://tinyurl.com/butdpmv). So we have skeptic Keith Bastereld to thank for the recent government\"document dump\" that makes this newinformation available. Bastereld ex- plains that the newly released les re- veal that \"parts of aircraft wreckage with partial serial numbers were foundin Bass Strait ve years after the disap-pearance.\" also, one pilot searching atthe right time and place saw debris thatappeared to be from a Cessna, but be-fore he could get a good x on its posi-tion it apparently sank. S\"\u00e0 is makes itextremely likely that Valentich's aircraftsimply crashed into the water in thedarkness. S\"\u00e0 ere is a nice summary of these ndings in Bastereld's blog entries ofJune 28, July 3, and august 24, 2012 (http://ufos-scienticresearch.blogspot.co.uk/). Y ou can download the rstset of documents from scribd (http:// tinyurl.com/c95hmza). From the doc-uments: a number of reports of a fast moving brilliant white light were received from various parts of the country. Mt Stromlo observatory advised that the night of the 21st was the peak of the meteorite stream with 10-15 sightings perhour achieved. S\"\u00e0 e question of why Valentich took this somewhat risky night flight is a sepa- rate matter. according to Wikipedia: His stated intention was to fly to King Island in Bass Strait via Cape Otway, to pick up passen- gers, and return to Moorabbin.However, he had told his family, girlfriend and acquaintances thathe intended to pick up craysh. During the accident investiga- tions it was learned there were no passengers waiting to be pickedup at King Island, he had not or- dered craysh and could not havedone so because craysh were not available anyway. So clearly Valentich was being evasiveabout something. His stated explana-tions for making his night flight do not check out. also, it turns out that Valen-tich was a uFO \"True Believer,\" and hence probably inclined to assume any- thing is a \"uFO\" if he could not imme- diately identify it. He actually worried about what to do if a uFO attackedhim! Various air safety organizations, in- cluding the aircraft Owner and Pilots association, have a pilot education les- son titled 178 Seconds to Live ; you can watch it as a video at http://tinyurl.com/178seconds. S\"\u00e0 e title comes froma study that found (using flight simula-tors, of course) that when non-instru- ment rated pilots are placed in situa- tions where they cannot see the groundor the horizon, nearly all of them gotinto a fatal spiral and crashed, with anaverage time-to-crash of 178 seconds.Watching this video made my blood run cold, but it's absolutely realistic. S\"\u00e0 is is exactly the situation Valen- tich found himself in when darkness fell on that moonless night (as did John F. Kennedy Jr. in 1999). assuming thathe became disoriented and thought that Venus, or perhaps a meteor, was a uFO\u2014he says it was \"orbiting\" him\u2014we would expect him to crash in about 178 seconds. He actually survived 374seconds from the time of his rst uFO report until crashing. Valentich had a\"Class Four Instrument Rating,\" but we know he was not watching his instru- ments; his eyes were xed on the \"uFO\" he was describing. We also learn from Wikipedia that Valentich had twice applied to enlist in the Royal australian air Force but was rejected because of inade- quate educational qualications. He was a member of the air Training Corps, determined to have a career in aviation. His stu- dent pilot license was issued 24 February 1977 and his privatepilot license the following Sep-tember. Valentich was studying part-time to become a commer- cial pilot but had a poor achieve-ment record, having twice failedall ve commercial license exam-ination subjects, and as recent asthe previous month had failedthree more commercial license subjects. He had been involved inflying incidents, straying into a controlled zone in Sydney (forwhich he received a warning) and twice deliberately flying into cloud (for which prosecution wasbeing considered). I would never knowingly get into an aircraft with a pilot like that\u2014and es- pecially not for a night flight over water! We can be quite sure of what happened to the incautious Valentich, even if we cannot say why he made that fatal flight. nAlso, it turns out that Valentich was a UFO \"True Believer,\" and hence probably inclined to assume anything is a \"UFO\" if he could not immediately identify it.March April 13 *_SI new design masters 1/31/13 9:53 AM Page 27Herbal supplements are big busi- ness. In the united States alone, 2011 sales of all herbal products were estimated to be $5.3 billion (Blu -menthal et al. 2012). Meanwhile the in- dustry has managed to maintain a \"mom and pop\" image to the public, therighteous underdog constantly under attack by Big Pharma. In reality, the herbal product industry is just anotherdrug industry, one selling products thatare poorly regulated and likely don't work for their claimed indications. There are already a fair number of scientific studies looking at various herbal products for specific indications. There is nothing inherently implausibleabout the usefulness of plant-based remedies. Many modern drugs are de- rived from plants. Plant parts containmany substances, some of which are pharmacologically active and can be ex- ploited for medical use. The deception inherent to the herb - al product industry, in my opinion, is the notion that herbs are somethingother than drugs. This is closely tied to the naturalistic fallacy: the idea that a substance that is \"natural\" (a poorly de- fined concept) is somehow magically safe and effective. In reality, herbs often contain mul- tiple active ingredients that potentially have drug-like activity in the body. These drugs are often poorly under- stood, may not even be identified, and exist in highly variable doses within herbal products (Wurglics et al. 2001). Herbs have drug-drug interactions and the same potential for side effects and toxicity as any drug, mitigated only by the fact that herbal products generallycontain low doses of active ingredients. Some popular herbal products have been studied in standard placebo-con- trolled trials, and they have generally not fared well. a recent scientific study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association , for example, looked at the drug silymarin for the treatment of liver disease due to chronic hepatitis C that has not responded to standardtherapy with interferons (Fried et al. 2012). Silymarin is an extract of milk thistle, an herb commonly used to treatliver disease. There have now been large, double- blind clinical trials of echinacea and cold symptoms (Barret et al. 2002; Tay- lor et al. 2003; Turner et al. 2005), Gingko biloba and memory loss or alzheimer's disease (Snitz et al. 2009),black cohosh and hot flashes (Newton et al. 2006), saw palmetto and benign prostatic hypertrophy (Tacklind et al.2009), and others. Even St. John's Wort, which is supposed to be a big herbal remedy win, has been shown to have no effect on moderate or severe depression (although the jury is still out on minordepressive symptoms; see Hypericum Depression Trial Study Group 2002). Many of these studies were funded by the National Center for Comple-mentary and alternative Medicine(NCCaM). Despite this string of negative studies, the herbal remedy industry continues to rake in billions of dollars every year. Large, rigorous, and negative studies seem to have little impact on the sales of herbal products overall (although theymay affect the relative popularity of spe- cific herbs to some extent). To make matters worse, in the united States herbal drugs were essen- tially deregulated in 1994 by the Di- etary Supplement Health and Educa-Herbs AreDrugs 28Volume 37 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirer[ THE SCIENCE OF MEDICINE STEVEN NOVELLA Steven Novella, MD, is assistant professor of neurology at Yale School of Medicine, the host of the Skeptics' Guide to the Universe podcast, author of the NeuroLogica blog, executive editor of the Science-Based Medicine blog, and president of the New England Skeptical Society.

Herbs are now regulated more like food rather thandrugs. Further, a special category ofhealth claims, so-called structure func-tion claims, was carved out for supple-ments. Companies can market herbswithout any prior approval from the FDa or need to provide evidence ofsafety or effectiveness. They can even claim that their product supports the structure or function of the body insome way, as long as they don't mentiona specific disease by name. This amounts to a massive loophole easilyexploited by any savvy marketer. The deal that DSHEa and NCC - aM made with the public was this: Letthe supplement industry have free reignto market untested products with unsup-ported claims, and then we'll fund reli-able studies to arm the public with sci-entific information so they can makegood decisions for themselves. This \"ex- periment\" (really just a gift to the supple- ment industry) has been a dismal fail-ure.The result has been an explosion of the supplement industry flooding the marketplace with useless products andfalse claims. Part of the problem is that negative studies are too easy to dismiss. In everycase the supplement industry finds some reason to minimize the implica- tions of the studies showing their prod- ucts do not work, instead preferring to cherry pick small and unreliable studies with positive results. No study can pos- sibly address every possible permuta-tion of how an herb can be used. For example, herbal apologists may claim that the dose was not highenough, the wrong part of the plant was used, the preparation was not correct, or the treatment population was wrong in some way. For echinacea they claimed that the wrong cold viruses were used. There is always something they canpoint to. Of course, this logic works both ways: if it's so difficult to find the right preparation for the right condi-tion, then how do they justify sellinghighly variable products to the generalpopulation with broad claims? How are the \"traditional\" uses of herbal products derived in the first place?The impression that is often given is that centuries of successful traditional use is behind many herbal product claims, but this is often a modern marketing fiction. It seems reasonable to require man- ufacturers and marketers of herbalproducts to prove that their products are safe and effective for whatever it is they claim they treat. Not only is thisnot required under DSHEa, compa- nies can continue to market their herbs with claims that have been contradicted by major scientific studies funded bytaxpayer dollars. as with many things, the marketing of herbal products is largely based on ideology and a compelling narrative rather than actual science and evidence.For the most part consumers are left totheir own devices to sort out whichproducts are likely to be useful. Finally, keep in mind that if an herbal product contains a useful active ingredient, it would likely be identified,purified, and properly studied. The bestresult is likely to come from taking aprecisely measured amount of a specificactive ingredient with known pharma- cokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as drug-drug interactions. Herbs are not only drugs, they are a mixture of various drugs of unknown dose, activity, and interactions, often with evidence that they do not work. It takes effective marketing to convince the public this is somehow better than taking highly purified and studied pharmaceuticals. n References Barrett, B.P ., R.L. Brown, K.

KRAUSE Kenneth W. Krause is a contributing editor and \"Science Watch\" columnist for the S KEPTICALINQUIRER. He may be contacted at krausekc@msn.com. In 1762, Rousseau characterized the human baby as \"a perfect idiot.\" In 1890, William James judged the in- fant's mental life to be \"one great bloom-ing, buzzing confusion.\" We've learnedmuch about early human cognition since the nineteenth century, of course, and the current trend is to assign well-expanded mental capacities to young children. Butintellectual battles continue to rage, forexample, over the possibility of an innate and perhaps nuanced moral sensibility. Indeed, psychologists split this past summer over the question of whetherpre-verbal infants are capable of evaluat- ing the social value of others. Back in 2007, Yale university researchers led byJ. Kiley Hamlin claimed to have demon-strated that infants can morally assess in-dividuals based on their behavior towardthird parties (Hamlin et al. 2007). S\"\u00e0 osendings were challenged last august,however, by postdoctoral research fellow Damian Scarf and his colleagues from the university of Otago in New zealand (Scarf et al. 2012). Hamlin's pioneering study deployed three experiments on six- and ten-month-old babies to test her team's hypothesisthat social evaluation is a universal andunlearned biological adaptation. In all tri- als, infants observed characters shaped like circles and either squares or triangles mov- ing two-dimensionally in a scene involv- ing an articial hill. Parents held their children during the program but were in- structed not to interfere. In experiment one, the characters were endowed with large \"googly eyes\"and made to either climb the hill, hinder the climber from above, or help the climber from below. With looking times carefully measured, the infants observed alternating helping and hindering trials. S\"\u00e0 e question here was whether witness-ing one character's actions toward an- other would aect infants' attitudes to-ward that character. When encouraged to reach for either the helper or the hinderer, twelve oftwelve six-month-olds and fourteen of sixteen ten-month-olds chose the helper. But might the babies have responded to supercial perceptual, rather than social, aspects of the experiment? For example, perhaps the infants merely preferred up- ward or downward movements. In an at- tempt to rule out that possibility, Hamlin modied a single test condition and gathered a second group of children. In experiment two, the object pushed was represented as inanimate. Its googly eyes were detached and it was never made to appear self-propelled. If the in-fants had chosen based on mere percep- tual events in the rst experiment, Ham-lin proposed, they should express ananalogous preference for the upward-pushing character in the second. But that didn't happen. Only four of twelve six- month-olds and six of twelve ten- month-olds picked the upward-pushingshape. So the team decided that three possi- bilities remained. S\"\u00e0 e infants might pos- itively evaluate helpers, negatively evalu- ate hinderers, or both. To determine which, Hamlin assembled a third groupof children, reattached the googly eyes, and altered the experimental design to include a neutral character that would never interact with the climber. In the nal experiment, children rst observed either a helper or a hinderer in- teract with a climber as in experiment one. S\"\u00e0 ereafter, they witnessed a neutral, non-interactive character that moved up- hill or downhill in the same way. When prompted to choose, infants reacted dierently toward the neutralshape depending on the character with which it was paired. Seven of eight babies in each age group preferred the helper to the neutral character and the neutralcharacter to the hinderer. Hamlin thusinferred that her subjects were fond of those who facilitate others' goals and dis- approving of those who inhibit them. \"Humans engage in social evalua- tion,\" the Yale researchers concluded, \"far earlier in development than previouslythought.\" S\"\u00e0 e critical human ability to distinguish cooperators and reciprocatorsfrom free riders, they agreed, \"can be seenas a biological adaptation.\" Having viewed recorded portions of these experiments, I felt compelled toquestion some of the program's mostbasic assumptions and methods. Can in- fants fathom, for instance, what articial landscapes represent, or what \"hills\" look like? Can they grasp the symbolic signi- cance of squares, triangles, and circlesadorned with \"googly eyes\"? although groundbreaking in its own right, Hamlin assured me that her 2007 study was built on a solid foundation of previous experiments employing both a hill and a helping/hindering paradigm. Numerous analyses, she insisted, have shown that infants will interpret eventwo-dimensional animations as real, and often attribute goals and intentions to basic shapes engaging in apparently self- propelled movement\u2014with or without articial eyes. I also wondered how the infants were \"encouraged\" to choose. In the video, characters were shaken by the person holding them. Could that have aected the outcome, perhaps combined with verbal inflection? Was one character ever held closer to an infant than the other, or at least closer to the infant's dominant hand?Innate Morality? Babies Weigh InMarch April 13 *_SI new design masters 1/31/13 9:53 AM Page 30Skeptical Inquirer | March/April 2013 31Her presenting colleagues, Hamlin answered, were always blind to the con- dition\u2014i.e., ignorant of which character was helper or hinderer for that particularbaby. So, if dierences in proximity oremphasis existed, their eects would havebeen divided randomly across subjects.also, she noted, parents were instructedto close their eyes during choice phases. Scarf responded quite dierently. He sees no reason to believe, for example,that six- and ten-month-olds would in-terpret Hamlin-esque displays as land-scapes, or that they would be familiarwith the concept of a hill. Nor could theydistinguish between helping and hinder-ing, he argued. and while infants may at-tribute intentions and goals to animateobjects, he added, no convincing datasuggests they might assign relevant feel-ings to them as well. Five years passed before Scarf 's team would oer a conflicting explanation\u2014the \"simple theclimber and either the or the hin- derer, and second, a \"positive bouncing\"when the climber and helper reached thehill's summit. Rather than rendering complex social evaluations, Scarf proposed, Hamlin's ba- bies may have simply been reacting to avisual commotion. S\"\u00e0 e hinderer was per- ceived negatively, he hypothesized, be-cause it was associated only with an aver-sive collision. S\"\u00e0 e helper, by contrast, was viewed more positively because it waslinked with an optimistic bouncing inaddition to a collision. To test their suspicions, the New zealanders devised two experiments. In the rst, eight ten-month-olds would be presented with googly eyed characters on a Hamlin-esque stage. Scarf would elim- inate the climber's bounce on help trials and then pair the helper with a neutral character. If infants choose based on so- cial evaluation, he reasoned, they should select the helper. But if infants nd the helper/climber collision aversive andreact instead via simple association, they should pick the neutral character. In the second experiment\u2014this timeinvolving forty-eight ten-month-olds\u2014 the team would manipulate whether the climber bounced during help trials (at the top), hinder trials (at the bottom), or both. S\"\u00e0 ey would then present the chil- dren with a choice between hinderers and helpers. again, Scarf proposed, if in- fants choose based on social evaluation,they should select the helper universally. But if driven by simple association in- stead, they should select whatever char- acter was present in the trials when bouncing occurred, and show no prefer- ence in the bounce-at-both-top-and- bottom condition. S\"\u00e0 e results were striking. In the rst experiment, seven of eight children chose the neutral character over the colliding and non-bouncing helper. In the secondexperiment, twelve of sixteen picked the helper in the bounce-at-the-top condi- tion, another twelve of sixteen opted for the hinderer in the bounce-at-the-bot- tom condition, and an equal number (eight of sixteen) chose the helper and hinderer in the bounce-at-both condi- tion. associa- tion explain Hamlin's 2007 results without resorting to the comparativelycomplicated notion of an innate moralcompass. In fact, he continued, his results were entirely inconsistent with Hamlin's core conclusions. Infants do notperceive collisions between hinderers and climbers as qualitatively dierent from those between helpers and climb ers, andthey do not prefer helpers regardless of bounce condition.Invoking Darwin, Scarf claimed to add momentum to a movement in devel- opmental psychology toward more par-simonious interpretations of infant be- havior. S\"\u00e0 ere is much \"grandeur in the view,\" he philosophized, that complex adult cognitive abilities can be discoveredthrough a more sober comprehension of \"these simple beginnings.\" On august 9, 2012, Hamlin\u2014now at the university of British Columbia\u2014posted her team's unyielding response. Generally, they found Scarf 's bythe New zealanders' attempt to recruitDarwin\u2014who \"wrote extensively aboutthe powers (and the limits) of our inborn moral sense\"\u2014to their cause. Hamlin criticized Scarf 's experimental design as well, and his failure to adequately address results she had obtained and published after 2007. By Hamlin's lights, Scarf 's stimuli had diered from her own in ways that left the climber's goal\u2014and thus the insinu- ation of being helped or hindered\u2014un- clear. First, the googly eyes attached toScarf 's climber were not xed in an up-ward gaze. Second, Scarf 's climbermoved less organically, as if able to climb easily without the helper's assistance. Hamlin also emphasized that she had replicated the 2007 results in studies in- volving no climbing, colliding, or bounc- ing whatsoever. In 2011, for instance, she found that infants prefer characters whoreturn balls to others who drop them Can infants fathom, for instance, what artificial landscapes represent, or what \"hills\" look like? Can they grasp the symbolic significance of squares, triangles, and circles adorned with \"googly eyes\"?

This case holds some interest-ing real-world lessons about skepticism, credulity, journalism, and uFO believ- ers. I got involved in this case when Iwas asked by the Discovery Channel to research the case and write about it in a column for Discovery News (Radford 2012). The piece elicited interesting comments from readers. Several complained that other skep- tics and I had claimed to have solved the mystery without having done any inves- tigation. In fact I never claimed to haveinvestigated (or definitively solved) theDenver uFO video. Having had inves- tigation experience with in sects being mistaken for ghosts and uFOs, I merely provided some expert skeptical analysis and context to the claims, pointing outthe logical reasons why what was seen in the film was likely an insect instead of, for example, an extraterrestrial space- craft. Ask the Experts One person asked me, \"any chance that a real scientist can get some real high speed footage of that thing?SuniTThTThe cam- eras and lenses certainly are available, and it might actually be able to capturea clear image.\" This sentiment was echoed by others, and seems like com- mon sense. The problem is that, as a practical matter, few if any \"real scien- tists\" are eager to spend their time on this, especially those outside of Denver. Most probably have better things to do (such as holiday shopping, work, etc.) than to gather cameras, tripods, and other gear, locate the field in Denver, and videotape what are almost certainly insects. Preparing and executing this experiment could take several days of work for little benefit. It's not that the scientific community is ignoring or dis- missing it, as is often claimed. Believers in paranormal phenomena often say things like, \"Scientists should come investigate\" a given uFO or Big-foot or ghost sighting. Which working scientists, exactly, should take time offtheir jobs in cancer research, developing new energy technologies, or whateverimportant jobs they're doing, to spend an unpaid afternoon in a cold, empty field waiting for an insect to fly by? Of course if a scientist wants to conductsuch an experiment or investigation, their participation would be welcome and useful. Suggesting that scientistsshould look into these sorts of mysteries is a great idea in theory, but in the realworld most working scientists cannot simply take a day or more off work to in- vestigate a uFO video\u2014especially in cases like this where the explanation is pretty clear to everyone except uFO be- lievers and TV reporters. This is where skeptical investigation comes in\u2014almost always by non-scien- tists such as Joe Nickell, Robert Sheaf- fer, Jim underdown, me, and others. understanding critical thinking andhow science works is far less important than having an advanced degree in sci- ence or being a working scientist. Recreating the Video This raises a second investigative ques- tion: What is the value in a scientist or skeptical investigator going to the site with cameras? The videos had been shot months earlier, and by the time the story aired many of the bugs and insects were no longer active in Denver. There's little point in trying to replicate a video unless you can do it under identical (orA:[SKEPTICAL INQUIREE BENJAMIN RADFORD Benjamin Radford is a research fellow at the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and author or coauthor of six books, including Tracking the Chupacabra: The Vampire Beast in Fact, Fiction, and Folklore.

The context and environment at play on a summerafternoon is not the same as it would beon a winter night. In any event, dozens of locals\u2014as well as several Denver-area skeptics, including those from the Rocky Mountain Paranormal Soci- ety\u2014visited the field and noted the presence of bugs (and lack of uFOs) in the area. There's no harm done in trying to recreate the original videos, but it's un- likely that the result\u2014no matter howclosely replicated\u2014will satisfy the be- lievers. Even if an investigator provided an iron-clad case with multiple cameras, many uFO buffs would simply find reasons to claim that the videos are dif- ferent than the originals\u2014perhaps the\"uFOs\" moved slightly faster or slightly slower, or were a different color, etc. Such is the desire to believe. In fact, there are already several existing videosshowing what flying insects look like; you can find links and video at RobertSheaffer's Bad UFOs blog. another problem with this sugges- tion is that it has the burden of proofexactly backward: It is not up to skep-tics or scientists to prove that the uFOis likely an insect; it's up to those whoclaim that the image is of an unknownentity to prove that it's not an insect.There are times when an investigatorwill voluntarily assume the burden ofproof (I did it in my examination of the\"best case for psychic detectives\"; see\"The Psychic and the Serial Killer,\" SI,March/april 2010). But it's a slippery slope, and it's important for skeptics tomake clear to both the public and uFOclaimants where exactly the burden of proof lies. The default explanation is a naturalistic one\u2014in this case likely a bug\u2014not a supernatural or extraordi- nary one; it's not a spaceship until proven otherwise by camera-savvy sci- entists and skeptics. Alternative Explanations This case also illustrates an important issue in skeptical investigation: In order to get the right answers you have to ask the right questions. Heidi Hem mat, the reporter, made several investigative er- rors, including not considering alterna-tive explanations. How you understand and approach a mystery dictates howyou will investigate it. The reporter ac- cepted the uFO buff 's interpretation of the flying objects as being large and high above the city, so that's how the mystery was framed, and that guided the questions asked. On the other hand, if Hemmat had simply taken the footage at face value (there are dark,out-of-focus objects moving quickly atan unknown distance from the camera) that might have guided her to other ex- planations and experts. anomalous experiences and photo- graphs\u2014indeed all evidence\u2014does notarrive in the investigator's hands pure. Instead, the evidence arrives freightedwith opinions and interpretations fromeyewitnesses, researchers, and others.These interpretations of the evidence may turn out to be completely correct, completely wrong, or somewhere in be- tween. Because those opinions are often formed by little more than subjectiveopinion, desire to believe, credulity, or any number of other factors, it is impor- tant for an in vestigator to start fresh, stripping away the second-hand inter- pretations and assumptions, and begin with a blank slate. The evidence should be taken at face value to start, and each assumption should be checked for valid- ity before being accepted. In essence, much of investigation is merely decon- structing a theory to see if all the pieces of information really fit or make sense when assembled in a different way. Several readers complained that I and other skeptics had presented the fly ex- planation as definitive; one wrote, \"It is doubtful that Radford's insect explana- tion is as certain as he maintains.\" In fact, in presenting the skeptical viewpoint, Iwas careful to not go beyond the evi- dence, and qualified the explanation as likely\u2014not certain. This was clear from the headline (\"Denver uFO Likely Has Earthly Explana tion\") as well as the text (\"The most likely explanation? a bug or insect, probably a fly or bee.\"). Ironically, the only certainty ex pressed by anyone involved in the story was by the aviation expert, Steve Cowell, that KDVR put on the air, who categorically stated what the objects absolutely couldnot be: \"That is not an airplane, that is not a helicopter, those are not birds,\" he said. In an on-air voice-over, Hemmat also stated that Cowell was certain the objects were not bugs. Thus, contrary to the popular view of skeptical debunkers closed-mindedly dismissing the alien spacecraft theory outof hand as ridiculous and impossible, skeptics merely employed the principle of Occam's razor to the circumstances of the video and offered a plausible alterna- tive explanation. It was instead the uFO promoters and their experts who dis- missed the most likely theory out of hand, saying that bugs absolutely could not explain the video images. So who's being more open-minded: the skeptics who aren't ruling anything out as impossible but are merely pre-senting a likely alternative explanation that fits the facts, or the uFO believers who immediately conclude that bugs could not possibly be mistaken for the images and therefore must be some- thing unknown or mysterious? 1(See also Petrovic's Forum, p. 53.) Some criticized Hemmat and KD VR for incompetence and ratings-grab- bing, and while that may be partly true, it's easy for skeptics to forget that the general public (which, apparently, in- cludes TV reporters) does not have a good grasp of basic investigation tech-niques. This is why skeptical investiga- tion is so important. n Note 1. Some uFO believers rather disingenuously claimed that nobody mentioned in the KDVR re- port had claimed or implied that the uFOs were alien spacecraft, but merely \"unidentified flying objects.\" This is not only factually wrong (if the suggestion was not that the anomalies were air- craft or spacecraft, why were they said to be \"tak- ing off and landing\" in a specific part of town?) but also nonsensical: if all that's being claimed is that they are unidentified, then why the backlash against skeptics offering a logical explanation for the uFO?

In fact, the \"experiment\" was nothing but an outrageous hoax, perpetrated oncredulous researchers by one Carl M.allen, who also called himself Carlosallende. Born in 1925, allende wasconsidered brilliant but lazy and givento practical jokes. He later (1969) ad-mitted the invisibility claims were \"false ... the crazyest [ sic] pack of lies I ever wrote.\" Still later he retracted the con-fession, and the subsequent book and a1984 movie helped keep the hoax alive(Stein 1993, 176-77). But can we really be certain that no technology in this or another universe can ever be devised to cause invisibility? Well, we certainly can imagine such. \"However,\" according to Chambers Dic- tionary of the Unexplained , \"although there are many theoretical suggestionsas to how invisibility might be achieved, for the time being 'real' invisibility or perfect transparency ... remains firmly within the realm of science fiction\" (McGovern 2007, 347). (To all thosewho would, from their armchairs, opine, say, about theoretical physics, we wouldonly ask them to wait until they have ac- complished invisibility and then get back to us.) Extra-Dimensional Realms? But suppose invisibility already exists. One may hypothesize means by which an entity supposedly appears and disappears,such as a \"parallel universe\" (Sachs 1980, 84) or \"another dimension or space-timecontinuum\" (Sachs 1980, 239). However, these concepts also are unproven, and cases supposedly proving them typicallydo not withstand scrutiny. Consider, for instance, the case of Oliver Larch, whose disappearance on Christmas Eve 1889 is one for the an-nals of the incredible. Leaving theLarch family farmhouse on the out- skirts of South Bend, Indiana, to fetch water, the eleven-year-old boy was soonheard crying out in alarm. His parents and neighbors, who had gathered to sing to Mrs. Larch's organ music, rushedoutside. By lantern light the group fol-lowed Oliver's footsteps in the snowuntil, about halfway to the well, they abruptly ended! \"Because it defied log- ical explanation,\" writes Frank Edwards (1962, 103), \"the disappearance of thisboy was quietly filed away and forgot- ten.\" unfortunately, this story succumbed to investigation. Like another disappear- ance narrative\u2014that of Tennessee farmer David Lang, who in 1880 van-ished in full view of witnesses but whose voice could be heard faintly at the site over subsequent years\u2014the Larch story turns out to have been plagiarized froma trilogy of ambrose Bierce short stories. The bears obvious similarities to Bierce's \"Charles ashmore's Trail,\" just as the Lang yarn does to his \"TheDifficulty of Crossing a Field\" (Nickell1980; 1988, 61-73). at the end of his \"Mysterious Disappearances\" trilogy is apostscript in which he relates the theo-ries of an obvious crackpot who postu-lates, says Bierce, that \"in the visible world there are void places\" likened tothe \"cells in a Swiss cheese,\" that some- how explain disappearances (Bierce 1893). Alien Domains at some point, such thinking crosses over into the paranormal. Take extra - terrestrials, for example. alien beings are sometimes said to have the power of invisibility\u2014not unlike fairies and other magical beings (to be discussed later). But can we really be certain that no technology in this or another universe can ever be devised to cause invisibility? Well, we certainly can imagine such. March April 13 *_SI new design masters 1/31/13 9:53 AM Page 36Skeptical Inquirer | March/April 2013 37according to many witnesses, an extra- terrestrial may suddenly come into view,or vanish in an instant, while others re-port similar behavior of uFOs. Somethink the disappearing craft simply \"re- turns to its original dimension\" (Sachs1980, 84), while there is also the impli-cation that, before and after it was per-ceived, it was invisible. a major proponent of invisible uFOs was Trevor James Constable\u2014a manwith strange ideas indeed. Consta ble stated in his book Sky Creatures (1978, 7- 8) that \"the main direction in whichuFO phenomena lead human inquiry\" is\"into the invisible.\" Constable an \"invisible [infrared] realm.\" They \"occa-sionally emerge into the visible portion spectrum,\" being sustained and pro- pelled by \"orgone energy\" (1978, 12, 18). Imagined by a crank named Wilhelm Reich (1897-1957), orgone energy issaid to be \"life energy.\" It supposedlycauses stars to twinkle, produces light- ning other static electric phenom- ena, and animates dowsing rods\u2014among many other functions. In the human body it purportedly rechargesred blood cells through breathing and provides sexual energy (Gardner 1957,250-262). Constable notwithstanding,Reich's orgone proved to be imaginaryand, after Reich ignored an injunctionagainst selling his allegedly curative butworthless Orgone accumulator boxes,he was tried, fined, and sentenced to twoyears in prison, where he died (Randi1995, 222). Constable proposed that there were two main types of uFOs: 1) actual living\"critters\" that inhabit Etheria, an invisi- ble world of the atmosphere (just as fish live in the sea), and 2) inanimate craft piloted by Etherean intelligences\u2014bothpropelled of course by orgone energy (Constable 1978; Sachs 1980, 71). He claimed to have captured both types on infrared film, but his work seems doubt- ful in the extreme, has never been con- ducted or reported in any responsible scientific manner, and has not been replicated by mainstream science. Not surprisingly, he rants against \"official sci- ence\" for in\"organized obscurantism and ridicule\" (Constable 1978, 15-17). However, to the extent scientists have engaged in ridicule of uFOs, cranks like TrevorJames Constable have mostly them-selves\u2014and their runaway imagina-tions\u2014to blame. Spirit Realm Some claim that a person does not re- ally die at death but instead becomes a ghost or spirit, supposedly formed of energy, and lives on, invisibly, in thatstate. as with aliens, some speak of an \"invisible realm\" for spirits (Guiley 2000, 356). Proof, however, is lacking.Moreover, we know from the science ofneurology that when the brain dies,brain function ceases; any energy given off by the body necessarily dissipates. Nevertheless, \"ghost hunters\" purport to detect such energy using gadgetry\u2014electromagnetic-field meters, thermalimaging cameras, and so on\u2014but that approach is just so much pseudoscience (Nickell 2006). Some claim the invisible entity may be viewed psychically . That is to say, a spirit of the dead, for instance, may be seen by a \"medium\"; or an angel, deity,or the like may be perceived by a \"vi- sionary.\" Invariably, however, such seersare revealed to have fantasy-prone per- sonalities (Wilson and Barber 1983;Nickell 1995, 40-42, 157, 162, 167, 176, 211-14), or they appear to be halluci- nating (Nickell 2007, 80, 245-55, 260- 62) or both\u2014assuming they are notoutright charlatans. There is no con- vincing scientific evidence that anyonehas psychic powers of any kind\u2014hence James Randi's longstanding offer of a substantial reward to anyone who canprove he or she has such abilities under scientifically controlled conditions(Randi 1991, 151-53). Consider Mary ann Winkowski, for example. The real-life model for the central character in the fantasy TV se- ries Ghost Whisperer, Winkowski claims to see and talk to earthbound spirits(not those who have supposedly \"crossed over\" to the Other Side). Since she was a child of four, she says, she hasbeen able to \"see\" the dead at funerals even though they are invisible to others.She maintains that the spirits \"smoke, comb their hair, change their clothes\u2014all those things we always do too. OnlyI've never been able to figure out wherethey get the stuff from\" (Winkowski 2000, 150). as a child, Winkowski had what seem to have been imaginary playmates,although she insists they were notimaginary. as an adult she claims to re-ceive special messages from paranormalentities and frequently encounters ap- paritions\u2014as well as exhibiting numer- ous other traits consistent with being aclassic fantasizer. There is a distinct lack of objective evidence for her claims thatspirit entities exist (for instance, ananomaly in a client's photo, supposedly depicting spirit energy, was actually caused by the flash rebounding from the camera's wrist strap). The evidence strongly suggests in - stead that Winkowski is simply partic- ipating in encounters of her own imag- ination (Nickell 2010). Therefore, the source of the \"stuff \" that puzzles her\u2014 the inanimate objects that are seen in the possession of apparitions that sup- posedly represent lifeenergy\u2014is clear. as Tyrrell (1973) noted, apparitions ofvisibly rendered invisible people invari- ably wear clothes and are accompanied by objects\u2014just as they are in dreams\u2014 because the items are necessary to theapparitional drama. In other words, theinanimate objects, like the entities themselves, are imaginary. Visionary Experiences? as to the perceptions of reputed vision- aries, similar problems present them- selves. Take Joseph Smith, for instance, March April 13 *_SI new design masters 1/31/13 9:53 AM Page 3738Volume 37 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirerthe Mormon founder who claimed to receive instructions from an entity, anangel of God named Moroni. He ap-peared at Smith's bedside and told himhow to find a holy account, written ongold plates and now known as the Bookof Mormon. Regarded by many as a veritable confidence man, and certainlya person with an extraordinary propen-sity to fantasize (Wilson and Barber1983), Smith appears to have experi- enced common \"waking dreams\" (hyp- nagogic hallucinations) thetwilight between sleeping and waking(Nickell 2004, 296-303). Or consider the famed Catholic vi- sionary, Lucia Santos, who at age ten wasone of three shepherd children who en-countered the Virgin Mary at Fatima,Portugal, in 1910. She and her seven-year-old cousin Jacinta Marto thedazzling apparition, radiant in whitelight, and Lucia convinced Jacinta's brother Francisco to eventually \"see\" her too. Only Lucia ever talked to the Virgin,who supposedly appeared on the sameday during each of several months, yet remained invisible to the onlookers. as it happened, Lucia was a precocious, imaginative, and charismatic child who had earlier apparitional experiences. Clearly a fantasizer who manipulated the other children (Nickell 2009), she was, her mother said, \"nothing but a fake who is leading half the world astray\" (qtd. in zimdars-Swartz 1991, 86).magick? During the witch craze of the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries, it was sometimes reported that devils called incubuses were either \"visible or invisible.\" Supposedlythey would copulate with \"witches,\"whereupon, although the female was said to be in the throes of ecstasy, the incubus was not visible, yet at other times \"ablacke vapor of the length and bignesse of a man\" was allegedly seen to departfrom her. Reginald Scot repeats suchtales in his Discoverie of Witchcraft ([1584] 1972, 43-44), albeit with pro- found skepticism. according to other legends, witches are themselves said to have the power ofinvisibility\u2014as well as of flying, shape- shifting, astral projection, clairvoyance,and other supernatural powers (Guiley1991, 647-50). Then again, according togypsy lore, a man could become invisi-ble to witches by doing as follows: \"He must rise before the sun, turn all his clothes inside out and then put them on. Then he must cut a green turf andplace it on his head. Thus he becomesinvisible, for the witches believe he is under the earth, being themselves ap-parently bewitched by this\" (Leland 1995, 148). Occasionally, invisibility magic even purports to make someone invisible from himself . usually, however, the intent is to prevent others from seeing him. Onesuch fourteenth-century charm involves reciting Genesis 19:11: \"and they smote the men that were at the door of thehouse with blindness. ...\" This is predi- cated on the belief that holy writ will casta spell of blindness over others\u2014though that is not really the same, even if it did work, as actually becoming invisible(Cavendish 1970, 11:1453). Y et a medieval grimoire offered a spirits.\" Reputedly, \"You will beable to traverse the bosom of the seas, the bowels of the earth. Likewise you will be able to sweep through the air,nor will any human act be hidden fromyou.\" \"say only: Benatir, Caracrau, Dedos, Etinarmi\" (Wedeck 1961, 47). among the magical items reputed to make their bearer invisible are variouscloaks, amulets, rings, and potions.These may be found in folktales and legends (McGovern 2007, 347). ac - cord ing to one folklore authority (Leach1984, 526-27), \"Some beings, gods andghosts and angels, need no such para-phernalia to appear and disappear, but dwarfs and men must have some talis- man to do the trick.\" Behind all such claims and practices is the belief in magic\u2014the attempt to use spells, offerings, invocations, or the like to supplant natural processes. Whereas the latter constitute the do- main of science, magical thinking\u2014theopposite of science (Randi 1995, 193)\u2014 is rooted in superstition. Interestingly, throughout folklore certain entities that supposedly have the power of shapeshifting (the ability to alter their shape) also typically have the power of invisibility. Such reputed shapeshifters include ghosts, spiritual entities, monsters, witches, and others(Leach 1984, 1004-1005). a good ex- ample is the vampire, which may trans- Interestingly, throughout folklore certain entities that supposedly have the power of shapeshifting also typically have the power of invisibility.

Shapeshifting's link Various demigods and deities through- out history have been attributed powerover visibility. In Greek mythology,Perseus, for instance, son of zeus andDana\u00e8, wore a helmet that conferred in-visibility. This helped him become vic-torious over the snake-haired monsterMedusa whom he decapitated (Mc-Govern 2007, 347). Some gods, like those of early Hin - du literature, were not only invisible but\"could assume any visible form at will tofavoured worshippers\" (Hastings 1914,7:405). This was also true of the god ofthe Bible. It was in order to be seen thathe appeared to Moses in the form of aburning bush (Exodus 3:2-4). In New Testament passages are references to\"the invisible God\" (Colossians 1:15)and to \"the invisible things of (Ro-mans 1:20). according to the Encyclopedia of Re- ligion and Ethics (Hastings 1914, 7:404): The attribute of invisibility is one which is shared by gods, spirits, demons, the dead and the region of the dead, or the world of the gods, while the power of becoming invisi- ble belongs to those beings as well as to certain mortals. Where invisibility was ascribed to gods or spirits, one simple reason probably was that in the case of most of them, apart from animal-gods or worshipful parts of nature, they were in fact unseen. and that brings us back to our orig-inal point, that allegedly invisible enti- ties\u2014popular belief notwithstanding\u2014 are indistinguishable from imaginary be- ings. That is, an invisible entity necessarily means an immaterial one, one that therefore can exist only as aproduct of the imagination. n Notes 1. Invisible: Not seen in the visible electro- magnetic spectrum (VES) (wavelength from 400nm to 690nm; frequency from 750THz to 435THz). Light is electromagnetic radiation(EMR), i.e., energy emission (oscillating trans- verse wave) produced when charged particles(electrons) are accelerated. The quantum of EMR is the photon. 2. Transparency: The condition of allowing some light (EMR) to pass through. 3. Camouflage: Concealment against back- ground environment by resembling the back- ground and disrupting patterns and edges. Certain technological claims of invisibility\u2014using meta- materials, nanotubes, crystal prisms, and mirrors to create a two-dimensional illusion\u2014are nothing more than static active/adaptive camouflage. 4. again, light is EMR (see n. 1). 5.

March April 13 *_SI new design masters 1/31/13 9:54 AM Page 3940Volume 37 Issue 2 | Skeptical InquirerThe Elberfeld Horses They were the most important of Clever Hans's heirs. Their story is an archetypal example of the intertwinement that often exists between pseudoscience and the paranormal. STEFANO VEZZANI On the other hand, the Elberfeld horses did not enhance our knowledge of science or psychology, and no classic book was dedicated to them. as a con- sequence, they have almost been forgot- ten. They deserve to be remembered, however, because the events in which they were involved are an archetypal in- stance of pseudoscience. as several au- thors pointed out at the time, the story of these animals is also an exemplary il- lustration of the intertwinement that often exists between pseudoscience and the paranormal. Clever Hans, the Progenitor In 1900, Wilhelm von Osten of Berlin set out to educate his horse, Hans, to prove his revolutionary theory: If horses were educated like children, the funda- mental intellectual resemblance be- tween them and people would surface. He educated Hans applying the same pedagogical principles then used in ele- mentary schools and taught him bymeans of a blackboard and verbal expla- nations. allegedly, Hans learned to do arith- metic and understand spoken and writ- ten German. For instance, if he was asked \"What is three times four?,\" he tapped the ground twelve times with his hoof. Moreover, Hans was able to \"talk,\" as he had learned to represent each let-ter by tapping a certain number of times. Von Osten started exhibiting Hans in public in 1904, and very soon theThe story of Clever Hans, the reasoning horse, is very well known. What is less known is that several other clever animals followed Hans soon after. The most prominent among them were the \"Elberfeld horses.\" Clever Hans is still remembered because he was the ob- ject of a study that represented one of the highest achieve- ments in experimental psychology up to that time and which Oskar Pfungst (1907) detailed in a classic book. Pfungst's discovery of the \"Clever Hans effect\" has changed the way in which many experiments are conducted in fields where there is an interaction between the experimenter and an animal or human subject. Figure 1. The horse Zarif, one of the Elberfeld horses, attends a lesson by Krall (source Krall 191 2).March April 13 *_SI new design masters 1/31/13 9:54 AM Page 40Skeptical Inquirer | March/April 2013 41horse, known by the nickname of \"Kluge [Clever] Hans,\" became famous throughout the world. a heated contro-versy opened up between skeptics andbelievers, and it soon became clear thatit could only be settled by conductingexperiments on Hans. a multidiscipli-nary scientific commission delegatedthe psychologist Oskar Pfungst to un-dertake the experiments. Most of Pfungst's experiments con- sisted of two conditions: a condition\"with knowledge\" and another \"withoutknowledge.\" In the first case, the exam-iner knew the answer to the question heasked Hans; in the second, he did not.Pfungst proved that Hans answered cor-rectly only in the \"with knowledge\" tri-als. It was as if Han's did not work theanswer out by himself but rather read itin the examiner's mind. In fact, whetheror not Hans could hear the questionseemed irrelevant. Moreover, Hans managed to answer correctly only when he could see the ex-aminer. This suggested that he was ex-ploiting some visual cues coming fromthe examiner. Indeed, Pfungst ascer-tained that the examiner unconsciously stooped very slightly immediately afterhaving asked a question. When Hanssaw this movement, he started tapping.When the horse reached the correctnumber of strokes, the examinerstraightened up. Hans perceived this movement and stopped tapping. On December 9, 1904, the scientific commission proclaimed that Hanscould not reason and that rather thanbeing educated he had been trained, al- beit unintentionally. Public discussion about Hans then came to an end. according to most accounts, the story ended here. as a matter of fact, however, it continued when in 1905 von Osten made contact with one of the very few people who had not accepted Pfungst's explanation: Karl Krall, a wealthy jeweler from Elberfeld (nowWuppertal). Sensation at Elberfeld Krall inherited Clever Hans upon the death of his owner in 1909. However, Hans had become almost unmanageableand Krall resolved to \"educate\" two other stallions, Muhamed and zarif. He began delivering daily lessons to them applying von Osten's methods. Krall (1912) explains that the work was worth his while as the horses, afterthey had learned to communicate by tap- ping, like Hans, manifested capabilitiessuperior to those of any child. after thir- teen days, Muhamed could already addand subtract, and after twenty he couldmultiply and divide. Soon, the horses alsolearned to work out roots in a few sec- onds, something beyond Hans's capabil- ity, and to solve complex equations such as 4536 - 1849 * 196 - 144. They also learned to understand spoken andwritten German and French, and to\"speak\" German. as with Hans, eachletter was represented by a number. 1 In time, two other horses joined Muhamed and zarif: H\u00e0nschen andBerto. These equines were to go down in history as the Elberfeld horses. The education of the horses contin- ued for a couple of years substantially as a private matter. However, little by little, the news spread and many people asked to see the horses at work. There were scientists among these people and a few of them were so impressed that they persuaded Krall to write a book (Mac - kenzie 1912). The book appeared in 1912 with the title Denkende Tiere (Thinking Animals) and was more than 500 pages long. Krall was a strong science enthusiast. Nevertheless, his book was un orthodox The scientific commission proclaimed that Hans could not reason and that rather than being edu- cated he had been trained, albeit unintentionally. Clever Hans performs for a crowd.March April 13 *_SI new design masters 1/31/13 9:54 AM Page 4142Volume 37 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirerfrom a scientific perspective, a point several critics did not fail to notice. Onthe other hand, it also re ceived enthusi-astic comments. Wil helm Ostwald, theNobel laureate for Chemistry in 1909, expected that it would mark \"as clearlythe beginning of a new chapter in the doctrine of man's place in nature asDarwin's chief work did in its day\" ( Na- eminent psychol- wrotethat the publication of Krall's book \"iscertainly the most sensational event thathas ever happened in animal psychologyand possibly in psychology at large.\" On the whole, Krall's book had a wide-reaching effect, and the Elberfeldhorses soon became even more famousthan Hans had been in his time. A Controversy Ensues Krall and his followers founded the Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Tierpsychologie (Society of animal Psychology) in 1912 and thejournal Tierseele (Animal Mind ) in 1913, two entities entirely dedicated to reasoninganimals. Robert Y erkes, the well-knownamerican psychologist and primatologist,was a of the Like von Osten, Krall believed that the horses \"have re-ceived a real education, and have learn -ed to think like us\" (Mackenzie 1912).as with Hans, however, explanationsbased on telepathy were also put for- ward: perhaps something was being transferred directly from the brains ofthose present to the brains of the horses(Clapar\u00efde 1913). Many personalities journeyed to El- berfeld. after the influential neurologistLudwig Edinger had seen the horses, he began supporting Krall's theories pas-sionately. a number of zoologists, too, embraced the cause of the horses, for ex- ample, H. Kraemer, P. Sarasin, H.E. ziegler, and K. Gruber, a scholar of the occult (Gruber 1930). The prestigious biologist Ernst Haec kel wrote to Krall: \"Your careful, critical experiments con-vincingly prove the existence of reason in animals, something I have never doubted\" (Clapar\u00efde 1912).However, there were also many sci- entists and intellectuals who thought that the attention the Elberfeld horses were getting in the intellectual and sci- entific community was unwarranted.Most important, at the IX Inter nationalCongress of zoology held in Munich in 1913, twenty-four scientists signed astatement of protest regarding the diffu- sion of Krall's theory (Cla par\u00efde 1913).Skeptics believed that the Elberfeld horses had simply been trained, like Hans, and that their performancescould be explained by Pfungst's theory. It is significant that there were experts in horse training among the skeptics (e.g., von M\u00e1day 1914) but not among the believers. I am particularly familiar with the Italian writings, which are very represen-tative of the European literature in gen- eral. The Genoese biologist William Mackenzie was the most active Italianadvocate of Krall's theory and was often cited in the international debate. Someof his many articles on the subject ap -peared in journals dedicated to the para- normal. In the 1950s, Mackenzie was chairman of the Italian Society ofMetapsychics. Roberto assagioli also became an enthusiastic admirer of Krall after hav- ing journeyed to Elberfeld with Mac - kenzie in September 1912. He was atheosophist and became famous later on as the founder of psychosynthesis, a school of psychotherapy. One conceptof psychosynthesis is the transpersonal unconscious, from where paranormalpowers emanate. The psychiatrist Giulio Cesare Fer- rari was cautiously interested in the El- berfeld horses, mainly because he was an educator. He wrote that they proved\"the boundless possibilities of educa- tion\" and was sure that both intentionaland unintentional signs had to be ab-solutely ruled out. However, he ascribedthe achievements of the horses to their memory rather than to their intelligence (Ferrari 1914). The physician and psychologist Fa- ther agostino Gemelli was very critical,although he conceded that the problem did not admit of a simple solution(Gemelli 1913). above all, he lamented the absence of a serious inquiry aimed at verifying whether Pfungst's explana- tion of Hans's feats also applied to the Elberfeld horses. Luigi Siciliano (1914) and the psychi- cal researcher Cesar de Vesme (1912) be- lieved that the performances of the horses had a mediumistic explanation. Stefano Stefani (1913) claimed that the explana- to be found in telepathy. Pfungst's Theory Refuted? Skeptics insisted that the only way to es- tablish whether or not Pfungst's theory applied to the Elberfeld horses was to perform experiments using a \"without knowledge\" condition. The problem was, however, that Krall prevented skeptics from experimenting (e.g. Gemelli 1913). Pfungst (1912) himself lamented that Krall had rejected all three of his re- quests to study the horses. according to the believers, Pfungst's theory of unconscious signs hardly de- served to be mentioned. It was widely refuted by facts, as so many observers had testified after they had seen the horses with their own eyes. Clapar\u00efde(1912), for instance, made the followingwritten statement for Krall: \"The horsesanswered correctly under circumstancesthat absolutely rule out the hypothesis of intentional or unintentional signs. It seems certain to me that the aforesaidhorses really count the number of taps. ...\" 2In short, \"it can now be af- firmed that the reality and authenticity of Krall's results are certainly and definitely es- tablished \" (emphasis in original, assagioli 1912). In general, however, the evidence against Pfungst's theory consisted of an-ecdotes and testimonies, whereas strict experiments were wanting. Nevertheless, some experiments \u00e9 la Pfungst were undertaken by believers.Krall himself made a few, but he admitted in his book that they had substantiallyfailed. Several other experiments of this kind were performed by Krall's advocates.We are told that they succeeded, but usu-March April 13 *_SI new design masters 1/31/13 9:54 AM Page 42Skeptical Inquirer | March/April 2013 43ally in conditions un suited to a serious, controlled experiment. actually, theNobel laureate for Literature in 1911,Maurice Maeter linck (1914), performedan experiment that could be consideredquite satisfactory, if one accepts that hisaccount is reliable. alone with the horses,Maeterlinck randomly pulled three cardsout of a deck without looking at themand put them in front of each animal inturn. The horses \"communicated correctlythe sum of the cards by tapping.\" (More on this presently.) Maeterlinck (1914)dedicated to the Elberfeld horses a longchapter of a book that was wholly conse- crated to the occult. Clapar\u00efde managed to study the horses in March 1913 without Krall being present. unfortunately, no conclu-sion could be reached, as the horses an- swered almost all the questions incor- rectly\u2014independently of the knowledgethat the experimenter had of the an- swers. Krall assures us that another manmade experiments a few days after Cla-par\u00efde and that he obtained positive re- sults after he had made friends with thehorses. Krall maintained that the resultsobviously depended on whether the vis- itors \"are or are not liked by the horses\" (Clapar\u00efde 1913). A Magician Enters the Stage The possibility that any signals given may have been intentional was usually ruled out in very resolute terms. No body, not even the skeptics, doubted the ab- solute good faith of Krall (e.g., Gemelli 1913). as for the grooms, \"they really are two worthy and simple boys. They havea groom's mentality and are certainly nomathematics professors\" (Mackenzie 1912). Most important, the horses worked well even when Krall and thegrooms were not present, and thisseemed conclusive evidence. However, only an expert in deception can reliably ascertain whether a trick ex- ists or not. Indeed, the likely truth wasdiscovered only when an unspecified\"psychological party\" commissioned an investigation to be made by a profes- sional conjurer, the Danish F. Faustinus (the stage name of Faustinus Edelberg),who was given the opportunity to studythe horses closely in 1913. Two years later, Faustinus disclosed his findings in an article signed by Mller (1915)\u2014see also Sebeok (1982) for a thorough ac-count in We learn from Schumann (1916) that \"Mr. Faustinus Edelberg has al -ready helped Prof. a. Lehmann of Copenhagen in the debunking of so- called spiritistic mediums. He is be - lieved to be unusually skillful in 'mind reading' and it seems that, to this aim, he capitalizes on minimal unintentional movements.\" Krall (1916a) wrote later that Fausti- nus had tricked him into believing that he was \"an independent re searcher\" onlyinterested in truth. Hence, Krall had lethim perform some experiments with hishorses, \"as I have always done without any exception when I did not doubt the scientific integrity of the researchers.\" Faustinus found convincing evidence that albert, the only groom at that time,had swindled Krall. The conjurer startedbecoming suspicious when albert im-mediately spotted a mistake that Fausti- nus had deliberately inserted in a prob-lem that consisted of working out a fourth root. Next, Faustinus realized that Muha - med worked only if he could perceivealbert. Even when Faustinus had the impression that he was alone with Muhamed, albert was actually able to communicate with the horse from out-side the stable, even from a considerabledistance. When Faustinus preventedMuhamed from seeing albert, the horse stopped answering correctly. This could explain the accounts, including Maeter-linck's, regarding the horses answering correctly even when their questioner did not know the answers and was seem- ingly alone with them. Therefore, it seemed that albert pro vided Muhamed with signals, but which signals? Faustinus discovered that there was just one very simple and \"almost imperceptible\" signal. When asked a problem, Muhamed started tap- ping but stopped when albert shook hishead slightly but discernibly. In sum, there was \"a signaling in Pfungst's sense,the only difference being that here it isintentional\" (Mller 1915). after he had discovered the trick, Faustinus was able to make Muhamed give right or wronganswers as he wished. But albert was just a groom, so how could he perform very complex compu-tations so fast? Faustinus pointed out that a fully reliable system existed for working out three kinds of roots(square, cube, fifth) very easily. H\u00e0nschen and Berto also failed when they could not perceive albert's presence and so were almost surely controlled by him as well. Y et how, Fausti nus was un- able to discover. Cer tainly albert did not use the same technique with them thathe used with Muhamed. as for zarif,Faustinus could not undertake any ex- periment on him. as a matter of fact,\"zarif could only be used as a saddle horse already by the summer of 1913,\" as his performances had severely deterio- rated (Krall 1916b). The possibility that any signals given may have been intentional was usually ruled out in very resolute terms. No body, not even the skeptics,doubted the absolute good faith of Krall.March April 13 *_SI new design masters 1/31/13 9:54 AM Page 43Faustinus could not complete his in- vestigation because Krall forbade fur- ther inquiries when he ofthe in-complete, Faustinus's account appearstrustworthy, especially considering albert. 1916b) and ziegler (1916) tried to challenge Faustinus with various arguments, but above all theytried to discredit him as an un - trustworthy investigator. For in stance,ziegler (1916) wrote that it was surpris- ing that more credit was given to the\"conjurer and fortune-teller Fausti nus\"than to all the scientists who had mostaccurately observed the horses and hadtestified that there was no signaling in- volved. The highly regarded psychologistFriedrich Schumann (1916) replied toziegler is usually well [a person like Faustinus] is more suitable than 'learned' men for discover-ing the intentional or unintentional as-sistance of a groom.\" It seems that even in those days there was awareness that aconjurer is much better at debunking afraud than any scientist. Then the Great War came. In 1915, albert was recruited (Marbe 1916) and Krall dispensed with his stable, as \"it has become too heavy a weight for a singleman\" (Mitt. d. Gesell. f. Tierpsych. 1914- 1915). unfortunately, outside Germany Faustinus's investigations did not re -ceive the attention they deserved, andthe question of the intellectual capabil- ities of the Elberfeld horses remained officially open. For instance, the amer - ican psychologist Joseph Jastrow (1920) did not mention Faustinus in his highly skeptical article and wrote that \"therehas been no definitive examination ofthe Elberfeld horses.\" In any case, the controversy trickled to an end after the war. a silence de- scended over the Elberfeld horses, which from then on was broken occa- sionally but without anything new being added to the debate. For his part,Krall (1916b) tried to educate a new horse, the mare Jona, and kept speaking and writing about his horses of old. He insisted that they could reason but added that they were also capable of communicating telepathically in partic- ular conditions. He became more and more involved in parapsychology and spiritism (von den Berg 2008). Karl Krall died in 1929. a German dog, Rolf, also became very famous in the same years as the El-berfeld horses, and other sapient dogs came after Rolf. They were thought tobe even more gifted than the Elberfeldhorses but were not supported by lead-ing scientists. In general, the explana-tions of the believers drifted more and more toward the paranormal. Thosewho can read Italian can find their sto-ries chronicled in Vezzani (2010). n Notes 1. See Sanford (1914) for a more detailed ac- count in English of the performances of the horses. 2.

In 1963, the astrologer's advice, for exam-ple, led to a postponement of the wed-ding of the Crown Prince of Sikkim bya year. a day seen as generally auspi- cious can thus lead to a large number of weddings taking place, putting severe pressure on facilities like wedding halls, caterers, etc. Prediction of Events Western astrologers are generally taught that astrology is nonfatalistic and therefore not a good bet for pre-dicting events. Indian astrologers holdthe opposite view, and every astrologer worthy of the name must be able to make such forecasts. unfortunately, these predictions do not carry any con-trols. For example, B.V. Raman (1912-1998), publisher-editor of The Astrolog- Magazine , wrote that \"when Saturn was in aries in 1939 England had todeclare war against Germany\" (note the fatalism) in a work intended \"to presenta case for astrology\" (Raman 1992,119). However, this reasoning fails tonotice that Saturn was also in aries in 1909 and 1968 when nothing much happened other than overseas state vis-its by Edward VII and Elizabeth II, re-spectively. Indian astrologers often make ex - treme claims about Indian astronomy, as when The Astrological Magazine for March 1984 claimed uranus, Neptune,and Pluto had been discovered around 500 BC (Rao 2000, 36). But their claims about Indian astrology tend to be evenmore extreme, as in the august 25, 2003, Indian Express wherein Raj Baldev, who claimed to be \"an authority on the \"is a completescience\" where even one million billionth of a second \"makes a lot of difference.\"Skeptics might wonder at this, since it implies that the shadows cast on ancient sundials were routinely positioned to better accuracy than a hundred millionth of the diameter of an atom. Even at night. Can we believe it? Complexity without End Indian astrology is more complex thanWestern astrology, with countless au- thoritative aphorisms to cover every possible situation. Indeed, the fewWestern authors who have described it for Western use have typically requireddecades of study before proceeding. But as one of them has noted: \"This is of course natural for a society over 6,000years old whose elders have not only employed astrology but embraced it\" (Braha 1986, x). 2 and there is no Western equivalent to the ways in which those authoritative aphorisms can be modified via suitablychosen amulets, mantras, colors, gem- stones (yellow or blue sapphire is said to strengthen Jupiter or Saturn, respec- tively), and by performing yajnas (a spiritual ceremony involving offerings to fire performed by a Hindu priest). Ironically these modifications specified by the astrologer are essentially fatalisticways of achieving non-fatalistic out- comes.

But twenty-seven astrologers failed to perform better than chance when given forty horoscopes of intellectually bright subjects and mentally handicapped subjects. JAYANT V. NARLIKAR In the world of astrology, India has many claims to fame. It has an astrology fundamentally different from both Chinese and Western astrology,1possibly more part- and full-time astrologers than in the rest of the world put to- gether, and the world's longest-running English astrological monthly ( The Astrological Magazine 1895-2007). Its main government funding agency, the university Grants Com- mission, provides support for BSc and MSc courses in as- trology in Indian universities. and as for the general public, one finds almost universal belief in it.March April 13 *_SI new design masters 1/31/13 9:54 AM Page 4546Volume 37 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirerturns out to be the client's. But a little thinking shows that it is not as mirac-ulous as it may seem. Consider the fol- lowing scenario. after providing birth details during the first visit, the client is asked to returna few days later on the pretext that it willtake time to find his horoscope amongthe thousands held by the astrologer. While the client is away, the astrologer, based on the information supplied bythe client, writes his or her horoscope on a fresh palm leaf and soaks it in a slurry of coconut kernels and mango bark, both of which are rich in tannin. This givesthe palm leaf an ancient look (Prem- anand et al. 1993, 331). During the sec-ond visit the client is appropriately im- pressed that his/her horoscope turned up after so many centuries.Electronic Destinies In 1984, the first companies to offer computerized horoscopes appeared in India, seventeen years after they had started business in Europe. In twenty minutes (today, in just a few seconds) they could do the calculations that pre- viously took three months. a computerhoroscope may cost twenty-five rupees(about fifty cents) for an ordinary oneand fifty rupees (about $1) for a longer one, more in big cities or air-conditioned centers. Predictions cost up to 500 rupees depending on the number of years ahead(Rao 2000, 147). 3Many websites offer free horoscopes; see, for example,www.bestindiansites.com/astrology. as in the West, Indian astrologers immediately complained that the com- puter was devoid of intuition and expe-rience, and did not meet their clients' need to talk and vent their feelings. In- deed, about two decades ago an edu- cated young man committed suicide after a computer horoscope predictedtotal failure in everything he did (Pre- manand et al. 1993, 307). Never theless, as in the West, computer horoscopes seem here to stay. In 1989, I was showing a visitor around my newly established astron- omy center in Pune. at that time we had just set up our new computer and I explained its capabilities to the visitor. at the end, I waited for any questionsshe may have had. Yes, she did have a question: \"Does this computer cast horoscopes?\" The Ultimate Accolade The lobby for Indian astrology had its crowning glory when, in February 2001, the university Grants Commis - sion (uGC) decided to provide funds for BSc and MSc courses in astrology at Indian universities. Its circular stated: \"There is urgent need to rejuvenate the science of Vedic astrology in India . .. and to provide opportunities to get this important science exported to the world.\" actually, the phrase Vedic As- trology is an oxymoron since the prefix Vedic has nothing to do with the Vedas, the ancient and sacred literature of theHindus, which do not mention astrol-ogy. In fact, scholars agree that theusual planetary astrology came to Indiawith the Greeks who had visited Indiasince alexander's campaign in the third century BC. Within nine months of the uGC's announcement, forty-five of India's 200 universities had applied for the uGC grants of 1.5 million rupees (about $30,000) to establish departments of astrology. Of these, twenty were ac- cepted (Siddhanta 2001, 2). To those Indians who believe that astrological considerations influence the course of their business and family lives\u2014andthis category includes leaders of majorpolitical parties\u2014the uGC's decision might seem sensible if overdue. But the decision provoked outrage among India's academics, especially those in the science faculties. More than In 1989, I was showing a visitor around my newly established astronomy center in Pune.... At the end, I waited for any questions she may have had. Yes, she did have a question: \"Does this computer cast horoscopes?\" Indian horoscopes are a different shape from Western horoscopes, and their signs, houses, and aspects are cal- culated differently. They also differ in how they are interpreted . A Western-style interpretation focusing on the owner's personality and motivations would be rejected in India, where clients expect fortune-telling. March April 13 *_SI new design masters 1/31/13 9:54 AM Page 46Skeptical Inquirer | March/April 2013 47100 scientists and 300 social scientists wrote in protest to the government. Of the thirty letters-to-the-editor that ap- peared in the Indian science journalCurrent Science , most of them from sci- entists in university departments or re- search institutes, about half dismissed astrology as a pseudoscience, and aquarter felt that decisive tests wereneeded. against this, the rest felt therewas nothing wrong with funding some-thing that most Indian people believein. But the protests were without effectbecause, in Indian law, Vedic astrologyis seen as a scientific discipline. Nevertheless, in 2004, several scien- tists asked the andhra Pradesh High Court to stop the uGC from funding courses in Vedic astrology because itwas a pseudoscience, it would imposeHindu beliefs on the education system, 4 and it would reduce the funds availablefor genuine scientific research. How- ever, the court dismissed their case onthe grounds that it was not correct fora court to interfere with a uGC deci-sion that did not violate Indian law. In 2011, an appeal under the act that bans false advertising was made to theMumbai High Court. It was dismissedby the court arguing that the act \"doesnot cover astrology and related sciences.astrology is a trusted science and [hasbeen] practiced for over 4000 years. ...\" (as reported in The Times of India Feb- ruary 3, 2011). Failed Predictions To justify calling it a science, astrology must fulfil the basic requirement of ascientific theory\u2014it must make test ableand correct predictions. Here the per-formance of astrology in predicting the results of events has been very poor. The nearest we have are follow-ups to predictions of public events such as elections, where failure is the norm. For example, the elections in 1971 were a showdown between Indira Gandhi and her political opponents. The Astrological Magazine was filled with predictions by amateurs and professionals, most of whom predicted that Gandhi would lose. In fact, she won with an over-whelming majority. The 1980 elections attracted another frenzy of predictions, most of which sawGandhi losing. For example B.V. Raman (whom I discussed earlier), in arare departure from his usual vagueness, predicted that Gandhi's efforts to regainoffice \"may misfire. Her ability to influ- ence the Govern ment will be discon- certingly limited in effectiveness\" and the outcome \"may not see a stable Govern ment.\" an Indian horary astrol -oger (one who answers questions) pre- dicted that Gandhi \"can never becomethe Prime Minister.\" However, she wonwith a huge majority, was prime minis-ter, and formed a very stable govern-ment. also in 1980, at a large international conference organized by the Indian as- trologers Federation, both the president and secretary of the Federation pre- dicted a war with Pakistan in 1982,which India would win, and a world war between 1982 and 1984. allwrong! These examples and many more are given by Rao (2000, 113-122), who notes that no astrologer predicted Gandhi's assassination in 1984, andthat the golden rule seems to be \"pre-dict only those things which please the listener's ego.\" 5 Lack of Criticism In the West, books critical of astrology are not hard to find, but in India the re- verse is true. Some excellent books exist,such as Premanand et al. (1993) and Rao(2000), but all are hampered by a lack of Indian tests with which to counter true believers. Even Current Science had to wait until Manoj Komath's (2009) review, which drew heavily on Western sources such as the critical but user- friendly www.astrologyandscience.com. unfortunately, given the low level of in- come and high level of illiteracy of the masses, web sources may not be very ef- fective in general. uGC's funding of astrology might have been justifiable had Indian astrol-ogy ever been a source of new knowl- edge (it hadn't; see Siddhanta 2001, 13),or if its modus operandi had been veri- fied by controlled tests. But unlike as-trology in the West, where several hun- dred controlled tests have found no support commensurate with its claims (Dean 2007), astrology in India hadhitherto been without controlled tests,even though its focus on predicting yes/no events would make testing easy. 6 I will now describe a controlled test that my colleagues and I conducted recently. Our Experiment Our experiment was performed in the university city of Pune (formerly Poona) about 160 km (100 miles) southeast of Mumbai (formerly Bom - bay) in the state of Maharashtra, which is the second-largest in population and third-largest in area of India's twenty- five states. Pune itself has a population of about 3.5 million. For the experiment I was assisted by Professor Sudhakar Kunte from the Department of Statistics at Pune uni -versity, Narendra Dabholkar from theCommittee for the Eradication and Prakash Ghatpande a former professional astrologer whohas subsequently turned into a critic ofastrology. Indian astrologers claim that they are able to tell intelligence from a per-son's horoscope. So volunteers from the Committee for the Eradication of Su-perstitions went to different schoolsand collected the names of teenage school children rated by their teachersas mentally bright. They also collected names from special schools for the mentally handicapped. The destinies of these cases could hardly be more differ- ent, so they were ideal for testing the above claim. From the collected data weselected 100 bright and 100 mentally handicapped cases whose age distribu-tion is shown below. Breakdown by age of our 100 + 100 test cases. Abouthalf of the mentally handicapped cases are older than our bright teenagers, which could have provided cues but evidently didn't.March April 13 *_SI new design masters 1/31/13 9:54 AM Page 4748Volume 37 Issue 2 | Skeptical InquirerBirth details were obtained from their parents because birth certificates are rare in India. Professional Indian as-trologers routinely assume that birthdetails provided by parents are correct,so our procedure followed the norm. Each horoscope (birth chart) was cal-culated by one of us (PG) using com-mercial astrological software. all horo- scopes were coded and stored in safecustody by Professor Kunte at Puneuniversity, so that neither the experi-menters (our group of four) nor the as-trologers could know the identities ofthe individuals. Publicity We announced our experiment at a press conference in Pune May 12, 2008, and invited practicing astrologers to take part. We explained that each par-ticipant would be given forty horo- scopes drawn at random from our set of 200 and would have to judge whether their owners were mentally bright or handicapped. We also invited established astrological organizations to take part, for which they would be given all 200 horoscopes, a respectably large sample size. The press conference, which was re- ported in almost all local and regional newspapers, proved to be an efficientway to reach astrologers. Within a fewdays we received about 150 telephonecalls from astrologers all over Maha - rashtra expressing interest. We asked them to send us their names, experi- ence, and method of prediction used, together with a stamped self-addressed envelope for mailing the forty horo- scopes. They were then allowed one month for making their judgments. Indue course, fifty-one astrologers askedfor horoscopes, of which twenty-sevenfrom all over Maharashtra sent backtheir judgments. The rest did not tell uswhy they chose not to participate. Objections astrologers from the Pune and Maha - rashtra astrological societies expressed concern that, because the data had been collected by skeptics, the experiment would be biased. We assured them thatthe skepticism of data collectors had noactive role in running the experiment, and that the experiment was of the double-blind kind to make sure it was entirely fair. But they were not con- vinced, and tried (unsuccessfully) to dissuade other astrologers from partic-ipating. a month later, at a Pune astrological seminar, we explained that tests, indeedmany tests, are necessary if astrology isto establish itself as a science. The or- ganizer then said he could provide a set of ten rules that would tell whether ahoroscope's owner was mentally brightor handicapped, and urged the as- trologers present to participate in ourexperiment. In India, leading astrologers have their own astrological organizations, andso we wrote to those on our list (about a dozen) inviting them to judge all 200horoscopes. Two responded with expres- sions of interest, of which one sent in its judgment. The other remained silent. An Interesting Sub-Test although the Maharashtra astro logical Society had urged astrologers to boycott our experiment, its president kept meet- ing with us. among other things he gave us a rule for predicting sex and another rule for predicting intelligence, both of which he claimed were correct in 60 per- cent of cases. But when applied to our set of 200 horoscopes, the predictions were respectively 47 and 50 percent correct, which offers no advantage over pure guessing or tossing a coin. Results of Our Main Test Of the twenty-seven astrologers who participated, not all provided personal details, but fifteen were hobbyists, eight were professionals, nine had up to tenyears of experience, and seventeen had more than ten years of experience. So they clearly formed a competent group.Their average experience was fourteenyears. If the astrologers could tell intelli- gence from a person's horoscope, they would score at least twenty-eight hits out of forty. In fact the highest score was of twenty-four hits by a single as- trologer followed by twenty-two hits (by two astrologers). The remaining twenty-four astrologers all scoredtwenty hits or less, including one pro- fessional astrologer who found thirty-seven intelligent and three undecided (so none were mentally handicapped!), of which seventeen were correct. The average for all twenty-seven astrologers was 17.25 hits, less than the twenty ex-pected by chance (e.g., coin tossing) and well within the difference of \u00b1 3.16needed to be statistically significant atIf the astrologers could tell intelligence from a person's horoscope, they would score at least twenty-eight hits out of forty. . . .

Certainly no scientific theory would survive such a poor success rate! The institution whose team of as- trologers had judged all 200 horoscopes got 102 hits, of which fifty-one were bright and fifty-one were mentally handicapped, so their judgments were,again, no better than tossing a coin. Tragically, our statistician, Sudhakar Kunte, died in an accident in 2011, and the security he imposed on data storage has so far made it difficult for us to per- form further tests, such as whether the astrologers agreed on their judgments, whether they could pick high Iq better than low, and whether the three astro- logical methods used (Nirayan, Sayan,Krishnamurty) differed in success rate. We hope that the access to this data will eventually be possible. Only two tests of Western astrol - ogers have involved the judgment of in-telligence. In Clark (1961) twenty as-trologers averaged 72 percent hits forten cases of high Iq paired with cere-bral palsy, but this famous result couldnot be replicated by Joseph (1975),where twenty-three astrologers aver-aged only 53 percent hits for ten casesof high Iq when paired with the se-verely mentally handicapped. In any case the sampling error associated with N= 10 is more than enough to explain both results, which is consistent withthe dozens of other tests that have beenmade of Western astrology (Dean2007). It is also consistent with the fewtests of Western astrologers who prac-tice Vedic astrology, for example Dud- ley (1995). Conclusion Our experiment with twenty-seven In- dian astrologers judging forty horo- scopes each, and a team of astrologers judging 200 horoscopes, showed that none were able to tell bright children from mentally handicapped children better than chance. Our results contra- dict the claims of Indian astrologers andare consistent with the many tests of Western astrologers. In summary, our results are firmly against Indian astrol- ogy being considered as a science. 7Acknowledgments The Department of Statistics, Pune univer- sity, and the Inter-university Centre for as- tronomy and astrophysics, Pune, provided infrastructural support while this experi- ment was being conducted. a brief account appeared in Current Science 96(5), 641-643, 2009.

The end result was largely the Indian astrology still in use today, which exists in numerous schools disagreeing over details (most schools of astrology, Indian or Western, disagree over details). The main differ- ences from Western astrology are a preoccupation with reincarnation and karma, use of the sidereal zodiac instead of the tropical zodiac (they now differ by nearly one sign due to precession), ex- clusion of the non-classical planets uranus, Nep- tune, and Pluto in favor of the two lunar nodes Rahu and Ketu, use of twenty-seven lunar man- sions or nakshatras, and progressively smaller and smaller subdivisions of the signs (Dean et al. 1995 and Rao 2000). 2. Braha (1986, xiii) warns that the complexity can be dealt with only by intuition and experience, so Indian astrology cannot be properly learnt from books. But tests of Western astrologers have found that neither self-rated use of intuition nor experi- ence raise their success rate above chance (Dean and Kelly 2003). So why should Indian astrologers be any different? 3. at one time Rao ran a computer horoscope service but without predictions. It was \"only to prove to 'omniscient' astrologers that a confirmed anti-astrologer can also do what astrologers do, and with greater efficiency and knowledge.\" His charge for fooling you was thirty rupees. 4. according to ancient Hindu texts, each be- liever has 8,400,000 rebirths from which they are released only by attaining enlightenment. at say, fifty years per birth, and no change over time, the allocated rebirths span more than 400 million years, roughly the age of the earliest hominids. 5. More examples can be found in Prema nand et al. (1993) and also via Internet search engine, al- beit with a need to persevere in your searching. For starters, try searching for \" astrology michael prabhu .\" 6. But some come close. For example Rakesh anand (2010) used astrology to make several im- portant decisions in his life, but the results were disastrous. So he prepared horoscopes for twenty- four celebrities and nine personal friends, changed their names, and was able to get 101 astrologers from everywhere in far northern India to predict their life and events. But none succeeded. For ex- ample, they predicted no political career from the horoscope of George Bush and no big money from the horoscope of Bill Gates. He concluded, \"astrol- ogy is a misleading and useless superstition\" (6). He also offered a prize of one million rupees (about $20,000) to any Indian astrologer who could demonstrate that astrology works, so far with no takers. For details, visit www.godvslife.com. 7. Over the years I have made many publicstatements against the pseudoscience of astrology, which earned me a chapter titled \"The Narlikar Episode\" in a 348-page, 1998 book editor of The Astro- logical Magazine . Her book tries to show that sci- entific inquiry or \"scientific temper\" is prejudiced against astrology, and that critics are quite igno- rant of both science and astrology. The above chapter accused me of venturing into areas I had not investigated and was therefore ignorant of. For example, I had made the supposedly inexcus- able mistake of declaring that astrology was not a science. I hope the present investigation can set the record straight. References anand, R. 2010.

The reality, though, is that we must live in a world of believ-ers of superstition, religion, andSuniTThTpseu- doscience. We interact with these be- lievers all the time and, for the mostpart, their beliefs do not come into play in the interactions we have. Instancesoccur, however, when we find ourselveshaving to deal with someone whose be- liefs cross swords with our skepticism. Perhaps it comes up in a conversation at a party or social gathering. Maybe this person is a friend and the conver- sation has strayed into uncharted terri- tory, and we are surprised to find thatthe friend holds a superstitious or pseu- doscientific belief. We have different kinds of relation- ships with believers, from casual to in- timate. How we deal with believers de - pends, to some degree, on the depth and importance of our relationships with them. Before going further, we need to un - derstand what a believer is. Wiki pedia has a nice definition of belief that I happen to like and that I think serves my purposes well here:To \"believe in\" someone or some- thing is a distinct concept from \"be- lieve that.\" There are two types of be- lief in: Commendatory: an expression of confidence in a person or entity, as in, \"I believe in his ability to do the job.\" Existential claim: to claim belief in the existence of an entity or phenom- enon with the implied need to justifyits claim to existence. It is often used when the entity is not real or its exis-tence is in doubt. \"He believes in witches and ghosts\" or \"many children believe in fairies\" are typical examples.SuniTThT The difference between to believe in and to believe that is relevant in this context. We all have things that we be- lieve thatmight be, usually based on our knowledge, experience, and evidence. I can believe that the sun rises in the east because my knowledge (knowing how Earth rotates), my experience (havingseen countless sunrises), and the evi- dence (I can test this by using a com- pass to show that the sun does, indeed, rise in the east) tells me this is true. al- ternatively, I might believe that my son will be successful in a career as a sales-man because he has shown a particu- larSuniTThTtalent in persuading people to dothings he wants them to do. People who believe inthings are the ones I am discussing here. In particular, I am referring to people whose world- view and sense of identity are deeply tied to their belief insomething, be it religion, pseudoscience, or superstition. What makes many believers so staunch in their beliefs? Why do they persist in their beliefs, even in the face of reason, logic, and evidence? The rea- son I discuss here is cognitive disso- nance. Cognitive dissonance is a theory first proposed by Leon Festinger in the 1950s. Festinger theorized that when an indi- vidual holds two or more ideas that are related but inconsistent with each an- other, the inconsistency creates a state of discomfort (Harmon-Jones and Har- mon-Jones 2007). \"Because dissonance is uncomfortable, people will try to reduce it by changing one or both cognitions tomake them more consonant with each other\" (Festinger et al. 1956). Festinger famously tested his theory by studying a uFO cult that believed that there would be a great flood on De- cember 21, 1954, and that a flying saucer would save them. When the prophecy failed to transpire and De - cem ber 21 passed with no flood and noflying saucer, the members of the group became even more dedicated to their beliefs. The reasons were that most of them had gotten rid of all their posses- sions and had surrendered everything toUnderstanding Believers' Cognitive Dissonance Dealing with believers of superstition, pseudoscience, and religion can be difficult for skeptics because it is hard to understand why intelligent people believe in irrational things. Understanding cognitive dissonance theory can help skeptics understand the psychology of irrational belief and perhaps better deal with believers. JAMES WALKER Skeptics take great pleasure in talking and debating with each other. We spend hours every day on online skeptical forums, blogs, and websites. We meet to - gether at the pub, at meetings with our local skeptical groups, and at conferences.

They ra- tionalized the truth away by telling themselves that their sincere commit-ment stopped the flood from happen-ing, and that this proved that they wereright to believe.SuniTThT Festinger gave five conditions under which we expect to observe increasedfervor following the disconfirmation ofa belief: 1. a belief must be held with deep conviction, and it must have some relevance to action, that is, to what the believer does or how he be- haves. 2. The person holding the belief must have committed himself to it; that is, for the sake of his belief, he must have taken some impor- tant action that is difficult to undo.In general, the more important such actions are, and the more dif- ficult they are to undo, the greater is the individual's commitment tothe belief. 3. The belief must be sufficiently specific and sufficiently concerned with the real world so that eventsmay unequivocally refute the be- lief. 4. Such undeniable disconfirmatory evidence must occur and must be recognized by the individual hold- ing the belief. 5. The individual believer must have social support. It is unlikely that one isolated believer could with- stand the kind of disconfirming evidence we have specified. If, however, the believer were a mem- ber of a group of convinced per- sons who can support one another, we would expect the belief to be maintained and the believers to at- tempt to proselytize or to persuadenonmembers that the belief is cor- rect. Throughout history, there have been many examples of groups of people en- countering the above five conditions with the same results. Most we are un able to confirm with any certainty given the lack of record keeping and unwillingness of the participants of these groups to admit to failed prophecy. How ever, Festinger gave several examples in his book When Prophecy Fails , pro viding evidence to sup- port his theory. One of these groups was the Miller - ites during the nineteenth century inthe united States. They believed, based on a specific reading of the Bible, that the second coming of Jesus would occursometime between March 21, 1843,and March 21, 1844. Thousands ofpeople came to believe this prophecy, and many gave away everything they owned in preparation for the coming oftheir Lord. after the March 21, 1844, date passed, most of the Millerites lost their faith, but some searched the Bibleand found passages that they felt ex- plained why the original dates were in-accurate. Some Millerites concluded that Miller's interpretation was flawed and that it instead foretold of Christ's en- trance into the heavenly sanctuary rather than hisSuniTThT second coming. This group came to be called The adventists and they continued to believe that Christ's second coming was imminent,but they refused to set further dates forthe event. another fascinating example is that of Sabbatai zevi, a Jew in Smyrna in the seventeenth century who claimed to be the messiah and had thousands of Jew- ish followers throughout Europe. When he proclaimed he would soon fulfill his purpose and lead the Jews of the worldback to the Holy Land, \"The Jews ac-cordingly prepared seriously to return to their original home. In Hun gary they began to unroof their houses. In large commercial cities, where Jews took the lead in wholesale business, such as am-sterdam, Leghorn, and Ham burg, stag-nation of trade ensued\" (Festinger et al. 1956). The Sultan finally imprisoned Sab - batai in Constantinople because he had arrived there in an effort to force the beginning of his messianic missionwhere thousands of people hailed him as the messiah. Finally, in an effort to cope with the problem, without making a martyr of Sabbatai, the Sultan attempted to convert him to Islam. astonishingly enough, the plan succeeded and Sab - batai donned the turban. Many of the Jews of the Near East still kept faith in him. Explanations were in vented for his conversion and many contin- ued their proselyting, usually in places where the movement had not previ- ously been strong. a considerable number of Jews even followed his lead and became Moslems. His con-version proved to be too much for most of his followers in Europe, how- ever, and the movement there soon collapsed. (Festinger, et al. 1956) We can see by these examples how easily people can surrender everything they have, giving up possessions, rela- tionships, and family to pursue their be- liefs. The more they sacrifice, thegreater the cognitive dissonance and the stronger their belief becomes, even after failure of the prophecy is obvious. They become so invested in their be-liefs that they will latch onto any expla- nation, no matter how far-fetched, that reinforces their beliefs to which they have surrendered so much. We have seen modern examples of this phenomenon in groups such as Heaven's Gate and Reverend Jim Jones's Peoples Temple, where people willingly killed themselves and their children because they had literally invested everything\u2014 including their very beings\u2014into their belief system.March April 13 *_SI new design masters 1/31/13 9:54 AM Page 51We have seen modern examples of this phenomenon in groups such as Heaven's Gate and Reverend Jim Jones's Peoples Temple, where people willingly killed themselves and theirchildren because they had literally in-vested everything\u2014including their very beings\u2014into their belief system. Not even the idea of death was enough todissuade them; to the contrary, they saw death as part of God's plan for them and their eternal salvation. For the religious beliefs of the aver- age person, cognitive dissonance\u2014 while not nearly as strong as it may bein the above situations\u2014is very strong. People who believe deeply or people raised in certain belief systems have much of their sense of self invested inthose beliefs. The reactions of believers when their beliefs are questioned are varied, but often the knee-jerk reaction is to become defensive. They may engage in ad hominem attacks on the person ques- tioning their beliefs, or they may attackthe questioner's beliefs instead of ad-dressing the questions raised about their beliefs. They often engage in evangelistic activities with questioners, attempting to convince them of theirbeliefs by quoting scripture or appeal- ing to the authority of the Bible, the church and its leaders, or God himself. all of these arguments are, of course,common logical fallacies that use circu- lar reasoning to make their arguments: \"My belief in God must be right be-cause the Bible says so, and God wrote the Bible,\" is one such example. To engage a believer in a productive discussion about their beliefs, it helps tounderstand that the person may be suf- fering from significantSuniTThTcognitive disso- nance. I believe letting the person know that while I do not agree with their be- lief, I respect their right to say and be- lieve as they choose is very important. I do not mean that we, as skeptics, haveto respect their ideas, thoughts, or ac- tions, but we need to respect their rights to free expression and belief, and we should express to them our respect of those rights. In When Prophecy Fails , Festinger says: \". . . through the mocking and scoffing ofnonbelievers there is usually established a heavy commitment on the part of be- lievers . . . the jeering of nonbelieverssimply makes it far more difficult for the adherents to withdraw from the move- ment and admit that they were wrong.\"If we merely mock or make light of a believer's beliefs, without also ex - pressing our respect for their right to hold those beliefs\u2014no matter how ab- surd the beliefs may be\u2014we will most likely drive them deeper into their mindset. While we say that we want others to respect our beliefs, what we really mean is that we want them to re- spect us as individuals. The reality is that the only thing we need to respect in our dealings with anyone, including believers, is respect for their rights to hold and express their beliefs. Other than that, we should not feel bound to hold back on criticizing their beliefs. If, however, we show that we have respect for their rights to believe and express their beliefs, then we have the begin- nings of a meaningful discussion. n References Festinger, L., H.W. Riecken, S.

That aside, I decided to delve furtherinto this notion\u2014because I would hateto be too closed-minded to consider the possibility of being closed-minded (getyour head around that one!). I should mention that I am a skeptic and an atheist. I am also a psychologist and as such am well aware of the placeboeffect, confirmation bias, and other phe-nomena with which I work every day. Ithink science is wonderful because it's agreat way of getting to the truth and learning new things about ourselves and the world in which we live. My mother is also a psychologist, but this is where our mentalities part ways: she is into as- trology, alternative therapies, life energy, feng shui, and womb colds. She believes that science is a faith, just like religion. Her method of determining the truth behind these disciplines is not based on evidence because she does not trust \"re-search\" or \"science\" but rather on what sounds good to her. Or perhaps things her grandmother used to say. In her mind, I am closed-minded and she is open-minded. Could this be true?at least my mom and I can agree on one thing: being open-minded is some-thing worth striving for. But what ex- actly does being \"open-minded\" mean? Generally it means being open to con- sidering new and different ideas. This, Isuppose, is where people get confused about being \"open-minded\" and being \"gullible.\" Open-mindedness is not be-lieving everything you hear; it is having ahealthy middle-ground of acceptingsome things and rejecting others. Buthow do we determine which claims we should believe and which we should throw on the proverbial rubbish heap? The simplest way is to ask, \"How likely isthis to be true?\" This is where science canhelp us gather enough evidence to decide whether to accept or reject an idea. Without evidence, there is only the blind belief that something is true eventhough there is no proof to show that it is. But surely this is the very definition ofgullibility\u2014believing something withoutany good reason to do so. The more I thought about it, the more being gullibleseemed closed-minded, as there is noth-ing that can change your belief. Com- pared to this, science is the more flexibleoption\u2014if there is good evidence to con- tradict your view, then you must take onthe new way of thinking. History is full of examples of people collectively chang- ing their beliefs due to scientific findings: think evolution, the big bang theory, andclimate change to name a few. The Bron- tosaurus is now the apato saurus, and who can forget saying goodbye to Pluto'splanetary status? We used to treat chil- dren's ailments with morphine, believed that sick people needed to be bled, and thought that women became hystericalbecause their wombs were movingaround in their bodies. and scientific ev- idence against these beliefs is the reason we changed our minds. Now comparethis to people's faith in alternative reme- dies, astrology, or feng shui. My mother's belief in these practices will never budge because it is not based on any reliable foundation and thus cannot be disproved. Let me clarify one more thing. I still remember trying to predict my day by reading horoscopes. I also used to think that walking around barefoot might jeopardize my childbearing chances, and I even good-naturedly tried a few dropsof homeopathic solution here and there.I wasn't always averse to these ideas; I considered them, tried them, and then decided to reject them for lack of evi-dence that they worked.

My encounter exemplifies so much of what is wrong about the ancient astro-naut belief.

There's another thing justas fundamentally wrong here: There is noneed for a hypothesis of technologicallysophisticated aliens dispensing knowl-edge to ancient human beings. The archaeological record shows clearly that our human ancestors wereenormously intelligent and resourceful.They were more than capable of devel-oping sophisticated technologies ontheir own. Rather than exhibiting a pat- tern of new ideas appearing magicallyand without antecedents at ancient sites, the actual record shows lengthy devel-opmental sequences\u2014in the domestica- tion of plants and animals, the evolution of Egyptian pyramids, metallurgy, and so on. The development of these things didn't occur overnight; they weren't \"air-lifted\" to Earth from another planet. In- stead, the stories of these accomplish- ments are filled with the very human pattern of trial and error, fits and starts,missteps and leaps forward. To assume that the achievements of ancient humanity were made possibleby visitors from outer space is to grosslyunderestimate the intelligence and ca- pabilities of our ancestors and to ignore the enormously fascinating actual ar- chaeological record. and you don't need six fingers on each hand to understand that. n Skeptical Inquirer | March/April 2013 55 A dwelling of the ancient Sinagua people in the Coconino National Forest (top).

Cog wheel, F, and pinion, G, are rotated, while the right side of box, K, is lowered, so the ball, L, rolls to the right side of the box, K, in- creasing the weight on that right side ofthe box, K. as one end of the box, K, islowered, the left side of the box attached to the bellows, M, is raised, whereby all of the air is removed from the bulb, C, and lever tube, a, causing the bulb, C,to sink. The shorter arm, D, of the lever, a, is thereby raised, and the wheel, F, which has made a half revolution when the lever, a, and bulb, C, were raised, will now complete its revolution. The box, K, is tilted again, the ball, L, resting on it rolls to the left, compressing the bellows, M, and forcing the air into thebulb, C, and tubular lever, a, causing the same to rise, etc. In this way, the bulb, C, continues to rise and fall; ball, L, con- tinues to reciprocate between the ex- tremes of box, K; bellows, M, continues to expand and compress; cog wheel, F, continues to rotate; and shaft, H, con- tinues to turn in one direction. all of this supposedly goes on for an indefinitetime, without applying further energy to the system. Needless to say, an actual, working motor was never built. By the twentieth century, inventors graduated from mechanical devices to theories for conserving or creating en-ergy that relied on electricity and evennuclear power. In the last few years, for example, I have seen a proposed systemfor operating an electric car indefinitely without a battery charge, a symbioticelectric motor/generator system that will never run down, and a nuclear gen- erator that the inventor believed would last as long as its electrically conductive wires could be maintained at absolute zero, with zero resistance. On May 19, 1959, once again the Patent and Trademark Office granted apatent, No. 2,886,976 (Figure 2), for a perpetual motion machine. The inven- tor was Norman L. Dean and the patent title was \"System for Convert ing Rotary Motion into unidirectionalMotion.\" Through an elaborate system of gears, clutches, counterweights\u2014and, oh yes, electromagnets\u2014Deanconvinced the Patent Office examiner that his sky hook was patentable. Simply stated, Dean's invention in- cluded an oscillatory movement of a freely suspended inertia mass or of a plu- rality of such masses . . . produced by the rotation of a mass or masses around an axis or axes and by limit- ing the degrees of freedom of move- ment of said freely suspended mass or masses, and in which the oscilla- tory movement of the system pro- duces a continuous series of unidirec- tional impulses which may be transmitted to a suitable load device or which may act on the carrier of thesystem itself, without however react- ing on or otherwise influencing the frequency or amplitude of the said oscillatory movement. Dean's patent is not a testament to the principle that perpetual motion ma- chines work, but that, with enough electromechanical legerdemain, even people trained in technical fields can be fooled. The best way to handle an inventor who is convinced that his or her perpet- ual motion machine will work is for thepatent attorney to request a workingprototype. The next step is for the at-torney not to be surprised when the in- ventor doesn't return. n Mark Levy is a patent attorney with Hin man, Howard and Kat- tell in Bingham ton, New York.

Creationism, homeopathy, al - ternative medicine, and cold fusion areclearly pseudoscientific, but what aboutancient aliens, uFOs, alien abductions, Bigfoot, crystals, the Moon hoax, and many other claims investigated in the pages of the S KEPTICaL INquIRER ? are these examples of pseudoscience, just bad science, or perhaps not related to science at all? One definition of pseudoscience presents it as claims that are presented as scientific but do not adhere to valid scientific method. another describespseudoscience as the misuse of methodsthat seem scientific in order to undercut real science. In his excellent new book The Pseudoscience Wars: Immanuel Ve-likovsky and the Birth of the ModernFringe, Princeton historian Michael D. Gordin asserts that scientists only apply the label of pseudoscience\u2014which he defines as \"doctrines that are non-sci- ence but pretend to be, or aspire to be, or are simply mistaken for scientific\"\u2014 to ideas that they feel are threateningbecause of their public appeal. It is the way pseudoscience masquerades as real science and is used to attack real science that sets it apart from the easily dis- missed claims of cranks and charlatans. No advocate for an unorthodox per- spective ever calls his or her work pseu- doscience. This is a term of oppro- brium, assigned by scientists who are defending the consensus. Gordin notes that in practice, the term pseudoscience is generally reserved for ideas that are perceived as major challenges to sci- ence\u2014especially in the eyes of the pub- lic. Less threatening ideas are simply la-beled as bad science or non-science, on the assumption that they will self-de-struct and be quickly forgotten. Gordin's highly readable book ex - amines in detail several twentieth-cen-tury examples of pseudoscience. Majoremphasis is on the pseudocosmologist Immanuel Velikovsky. His examples are Trofim Lysenko, whonearly destroyed mid-century Russiangenetics, and the advocates for Biblicalcreationism who attempted to establisha scientific basis for a planet less than ten thousand years old. Lysenkoism wasa threat be cause of the personal support given by Stalin and the Soviet Commu- nist Party, which virtually outlawed re-search that challenged Lysenko andthereby had a strong negative impact onSoviet agriculture. In a sense, Lysenkocould be held responsible for the death of millions in the u.S.S.R. The cre- ationist authors who developed \"flood geology,\" primarily George McCready Price, Henry Morris, and John Whit-comb, have been (and continue to be) a threat because of support by Christian fundamentalists who use these ideas toattack evolutionary biology in particu-lar and science in general. Velikovsky isdifferent, in that he achieved substantial fame and influence on his own meritswithout the support of any organizedreligious or political institutions. Many readers of the S KEPTICaL IN- quIRER are familiar with the outlines of Velikovsky's rise and fall. Gordin hadaccess to the complete Velikovsky archives held by Princeton university,which he used to document many de- tails of this story. He places in context the \"Velikovsky affair,\" which dealt withthe opposition to his 1950 book Worlds in Collision. One of many controversies he illuminates is the question whether Velikovsky's book was reviewed (or ref- ereed) before publication. The fact isthat it was reviewed by several scientists who said, in effect, even though it wasbunk as science, the book was still likelyto be popular enough that its publica- tion would be a sound business deci-sion. That is exactly what happened. Scien tists excoriated the book for itsobvious failings, but many non-scientist reviewers lavished praise upon it. Thisdeep division between the \"two cul- tures\" of science and the humanities came as a shock to many scientists. Ve-likovsky, while of course pleased that his book rose to the top of the bestsellerlists, was also stung by its unanimous condemnation by scientists.

But this is only half the story. It seemed likely that for all the immediate popularity of his book, he would quicklybe forgotten. What makes this story sointeresting, what elevates Velikovsky tothe rank of true pseudoscientist, was theresurrection of interest in his work duringthe Vietnam War years, when he became a darling of the counterculture, gaining support among humanist scholars as wellas rebellious students. He was invited to speak on campuses, conferences were held to discuss his ideas, and his books again ascended the best-seller charts. Precisely because of his rejection by the scientific community, he became the symbol of the lone scholar defying the conservative es-tablishment. Gordin also explores the relationships between different pseudoscientists.

Had Kaplan succeeded in this task, he would have produced an ex- citing and interesting book. Instead, the book is lled with over-explanations, just- so stories, and college-level lm criticism, all leavened by one howling error. S\"\u00e0 e topics covered are arranged in rough chronological order. S\"\u00e0 us, the rst half of the book deals with monsters from ancient myths and legends such as theNemean lion, chimeras, the Minotaur, Medusa, Charybdis, and the like. But modern monsters are tossed in too\u2014 King Kong and the giant squid (the latterdoesn't really belong since it does exist). S\"\u00e0 e explanations for ancient beasts are often fairly reasonable. For example,monsters that are giant versions of already scary animals are scary because, well, agiant version of something already scary (e.g., a lion) is even scarier. Snakelike monsters are scary because snakes arescary in the rst place. Why do snakes, tothis day, generate fear? Kaplan argues, convincingly, that the fear of snakes is part of human's evolutionary heritage. S\"\u00e0 ey posed real danger as proto-humans evolved. So there is an advantage to avoiding snakes even if one has not had a direct scary experience with them.Flawed Look at Monsters TERENCE HINESbetween Velikovsky and the creationist positions of Price in The New Geology (1923) and Whitcomb and Morris inThe Genesis Flood (1961). all rejected the uniformitarian geology of theirtime. all sought to explain many geo- logical features in terms of recent cata- strophic events. and both sides soughtevidence to support or verify events inthe Old Testament, such as Noah's flood and the escape of the Israelites from Egypt. Velikovsky began corre- spondence with Price in 1951, and he sent the manuscript of his second book, Earth in Upheaval , to Price for his com- ments. Price replied that \"While I have not always been able to agree with some of the details. I have admired the hand- some way in which you have demol-ished Charles Lyell as well as [CharlesDarwin].\" Later in a review, Price de- scribed \" Earth in Upheaval as one of the most thought-provoking books ofmodern times.\" However, Velikovsky and the creationists soon fell into dis- pute. Velikovsky sought naturalistic ex-planations for the Bible stories, whilethe creationists preferred direct attribu- tion to acts of God. In the end, each side ostracized the other and went its own way, not acknowledging any com- monality of ideas. In his final chapter, Gordin turns to the new phase of pseudoscience, prac-ticed by a few rogue scientists them- selves. Climate change denialism is the prime example, where a handful of sci- entists, allied with an effective PR ma- chine, are publicly challenging the sci- entific consensus that global warming is real and is due primarily to human consumption of fossil fuels. Scientistshave watched in disbelief that as the ev-idence for global warming has become ever more solid, the deniers have been increasingly successful in the public and political arena. One has only to attend a meeting of atmospheric and climate scientists, such as the December 2012 american Geophysical union, to ap-preciate the overwhelming support and increasing sophistication of our under- stating of human-caused global warm-ing. at this gathering, thousands of sci-entists made hundreds of presentations of research results, ranging from the minutia of modeling the feedback of cloud formation on the greenhouse ef- fect to documenting the incredible rate of loss of arctic ice. Leaders of the sci- entific community made impassioned statements about the threat we face and the necessity for action. Yet outside the halls of science, polls show that half of americans deny the reality of climate change, while Senator Jim Inhofe re-cently announced not only that human induced climate change is a hoax, but also boasted, \"we have won\" in the court of public opinion.

Spiders, like snakes, continue to generate fear. Spi- ders, like snakes, posed a hazard to hu- mans while we were evolving. However, spiders, unlike snakes, did not serve as the basis for legends of any ancient monsters, as far as I know. Kaplan does occasionally go over- board by trying to come up with a specicexplanation for every little variation in a myth. For example, on pages 54 and 55there is a discussion of the possible factual basis of the \"cruel bellowing\" of the Minotaur. S\"\u00e0 ere is much discussion of caves and other geologic phenomena. But isn't it just simpler to explain the details of this, and other, myths as devices to make them scarier? Or, as amazon re- viewer sonabeta pointed out in a Novem- ber 20, 2012, review, \"People sometimesjust make things up.\" Similarly, on page 102 the discussion turns to dragons. S\"\u00e0 e question is whydragon myths are not consistent across time and place\u2014some with wings and some without, some breathing re andsome not. Well, dragons aren't real so why should all stories about them be consis- tent? Still, Kaplan's explanation for there-breathing part is plausible and I won't spoil it for the reader by giving it awayhere. Chapter 6 on \"Hauntings\u2014Demons, Ghosts, Spirits\" is long on description of these phenomena and short on explana- tions. Hypnogogic and hypnopompic hallucinations go unmentioned, although there is a brief discussion of sleep atonia and sleep paralysis. But the full power of hypnogogia\u2014with all of its attendant hallucinations\u2014to convince people that ghosts are real is not made clear at all. S\"\u00e0 is is a serious omission. S\"\u00e0 e book does contain one major and inexcusable howler in Chapter 7, a chap- ter dealing with vampires, zombies, and werewolves. Kaplan swallows hook, line, and sinker the long-refuted claim of Wade Davis that zombies are real and that they can be created by witch doctors using the poison tetrodotoxin (TTX), found, among other places, in the skinand internal organs of puer sh native to Haiti. In accepting Davis's claims Ka- plan ignores the overwhelming scientic literature that shows that 1) the \"zombie powder\" that Davis claims had TTX in it didn't and 2) even if it did, TTX in any quantity cannot produce zombies. TTXis a nerve poison that does not get intothe brain. In terms of motor control, it af- fects only the skeletal musculature. Its specic eect is to render victims para- lyzed, but it is not the sti (rigid) paralysis of zombie legend but a flaccid paralysis where muscles lose their tone. In addi-tion, in nonlethal doses TTX causes nau-sea and vomiting. S\"\u00e0 e idea that just theright dose of TTX could transform a per-son into a zombie and keep them thatway while they were walking aroundbeing productive slaves is absurd. and its absurdity has been known since the late1980s. Sadly, Kaplan obviously didn't getthe memo. For a more detailed discussion with appropriate references, see my article \"zombies and Tetrodotoxin\" in theMay/June 2008 S KEPTICaL INquIRER (vol. 32, no. 3, pp. 60-62). S\"\u00e0 e last few chapters change focus from creatures of ancient myth and leg- end to more recent creations, especiallyalien abductions and movie monsters. S\"\u00e0 e discussions here are quite poor, almostsophomoric, especially where moviemonsters are concerned. S\"\u00e0 e rst topic in Chapter 8, \"S\"\u00e0 e Created,\" is the golem.Here either through bad writing or igno-rance (or maybe both) Kaplan seems tostate that there was only one golem, in Prague, and the whole golem legenddates only from 1909. In fact, there is ample evidence that the golem legend ismuch, much older. S\"\u00e0 e New Standard Jewish Encyclopedia (Facts on File, 1992) notes that the legend dates from at least the fteenth century. S\"\u00e0 e Jewish Encyclo- pedia , vol. 6 (Ktav Publishing, 1964, reprint of the 1901-1906 edition) states that \"In the Middle ages arose the belief in the possibility of infusing life into a clay or wooden gure of a human being, which gure was termed a 'golem' by writers of the eighteenth century\" (p. 37). Sadly, missing from this chapter is any discussion of that most modern of myth- ical creatures, the chupacabra. S\"\u00e0 e cre- ation of the myth of this creature was ably told by Ben Radford in his 2011 book Tracking the Chupacabra . Chapter 9 is devoted to \"Terror Res- urrected\u2014Dinosaurs.\" Here Kaplan dis- cusses the recreation of our old thunder lizard friends in the movies and the pos- sibility for real recreation through use of dinosaur DNa, which, of course, is the theme of the movie Jurassic Park . S\"\u00e0 e dis- cussions of both the lm and dinosaur DNa leave much to be desired. Kaplan's critique of the problems with using DNato recreate a dinosaur does not come close to that of Desalle and Lindley in their 1997 book Science of Jurassic Park. Kaplan does nicely discuss the problems of recre- ating a species that would nd itself with-out its natural ecosystem to live in and would thus be conned to some sort ofenclosures. However, even here he stum- bles by an embarrassing acceptance of thecharacterization of chaos theory taken di- rectly from the movie\u2014a characteriza- tion that is typical Hollywood fantasy. In the lm the character Dr. Ian Malcolm (played by Je Goldblum) says that chaostheory means that \"biological systems are uncontrollable by [their] nature and therefore inherently threatening\" (p. 187). S\"\u00e0 us, no matter what protective measures are taken, any recreated dinosaurs willbreak free and terrorize the world. Or at least the local natives. S\"\u00e0 is is Hollywoodnonsense. It bears about as much rela- tionship to actual chaos theory as the view of quantum mechanics espoused by New age proponents does to actual quantum mechanics.

Both are based on experience, not science. Both usu- ally work to verify the practition- ers' preconceptions. Both are used to determine criminality. Both have been required for employ-ment.SuniTThTBoth give results that are ir reproducible and subject to in- terpretation.SuniTThT Both have been shown by controlled studies to be unreliable. and both are fashion- able and satisfying in their own time period. I was first alerted to the fraud of the \"lie-detector\" by two cases: a county assistant treasurer who was falsely accused of embezzle- ment, and a distraught widowerwho was falsely accused of mur- dering his wife. Both of these ac- cused \"failed\" a polygraph exam (whatever that means) and were immediately convicted in the newspapers, with their reputa- tions destroyed. They were both subsequently exonerated. The polygraph measures indicators of stress, and honest people who are falsely accused of heinous crimes are likely to \"fail\" the exam. On the other hand, hardened crimi- nals show little stress when theyare asked about their crimes. unlike phrenology, polygraph tests are still used and accepted by law-enforcement and govern- ment, and they are absolutely re- quired for a range of government jobs (FBI, CIa, and police agen- cies). What should you do when you are asked to take a \"poly- graph exam\" for a job or to prove your innocence of a crime? If you agree to take one, you are placing your reputation in the hands of a charlatan who can proclaim you to be guilty or innocent. If yourefuse, you are assumed to be guilty. I would like to see the CSI do a careful study and expose ofthe use of polygraphs as \"lie-de- tectors.\" The government should be pressured to abandon this modern-day form of phrenologyand use more reliable methods to evaluate the honesty of suspects and job applicants.

His answer? \"It isan enigma.\" No, it's not, as even a slight familiarity with the skeptical literature on uFOs and alien abduction would havemade clear.

Com-putational ability is certainly a necessary, but not a sufficient, con- dition for intelligence. It is espe- cially gratifying to see Pigliucci point to the inherent dualism in this theory (withSuniTThT Descartes's mind/body replaced by soft- ware/hardware). He goes on to say, \"There is no reason to believe that that's the way consciousness arises, and there are good reasons to think that it is instead a bio- logical process, tightly linked to other biological processes and substrates typical of the kind of animal we are.\" aristotle could hardly have said it better.SuniTThTHe ar- gued that psychology, the study of what makes us human, is a part of biology. and what makes us human is our soul (psyche),which is not something immate- rial (like mind for Descartes), but is rather the sum of capacities of the body: it is our ability to grow and take in nutrients (like plants), move and perceive (like animals) andSuniTThT understand and reason (as only we can). The re- alization that living bodies have capacities beyond the mere ex- tension of matter gives this bio- logical account of human intelli- gence a decided advantage over any kind of dualist account.Pigliucci has shown once morethat aristotle still lives. George Englebretsen Professor of Philosophy Bishop's Sherbrooke, quebec Massimo is marred by inaccuracies and pseudoskeptical rhetorical devices. He resorts to ad hominem attacks, ridicule, and ideological posturing to sidestep some important ques- tions. So what if Pigliucci finds it \"obscene\" for white men\" to \"salivate after their own mortal- ity.\" That's like arguing that global warming is a fraud be- cause al Gore flies around in private jets and makes millions of dollars from green energy com- panies. In both cases, the validity of the ideas is independent of the motivations of the advocates. Many things that critics have called obscene have come to pass,for better or for worse. It doesn't happen to be true that singulatarians as a group are rich white men. Many are impe- cunious students and struggling third-world programmers. Some of the women whose well- known work I find intriguing are Lisa Rein, Natasha Vita-More, anna Salamon, and HeatherKnight. Seminars led by Getnet aseffa, a singulatarian of color, in addis ababa, Ethiopia, have at- tracted as many as 700 partici-pants with scarcely a white face in the room. But why should that matter? White men from Silicon Valley have contributed a great deal to many fields and the ben-efits have spread to the rest of the world. Why should we care if Ray Kurzweil takes 150 vitamin tablets a day? This is just a per-sonal eccentricity not shared by other singularity researchers, and it is irrelevant to the scientific is- sues. and why does the fact that human intelligence is a biological process mean that computers can't achieve intelligence? Birds' and insects' wings are biological structures, tightly linked to other biological processes in their bod- ies, but that doesn't mean that airplanes need biological wings. and what's wrong with scientists trying to build something that has been anticipated in science fiction? Many important inven- tions were anticipated in fiction before they became reality. If Pigliucci wants to argue that superhuman computer in- telligence is a bad thing and we shouldn't build it, fair enough. Many singularitarians share his concern about the risks. Hugo de Garis has written a book about what he fears will be a war of ar-tificial intelligences. But it isdoubtful that there is any author- ity in the world that could effec- tively stifle scientific progress in this area. The same issue was raised about the atomic bomb, but that doesn't mean the science behind it was wrong. If Pigliucci believes that human intelligence is a universal ultimate that can never be sur-passed, that is more like a reli- gious or metaphysical conviction than a scientific conclusion. DoMarch April 13 *_SI new design masters 1/31/13 9:54 AM Page 6364Volume 37 Issue 2 | Skeptical Inquirerskeptics really want to use meta- physical assumptions such as Des cartes's distinction between rex extensa and rex cogitans to re- solve scientific questions? Very few singulatarians anticipate a purely symbolic mind anyway, many speculate about making the human body immortal, adding implants, or uploading the brain to robots. Future study is a risky busi- ness, not amenable to the rigors of laboratory science. There is the temptation to ridicule and reject scenarios we don't like, while giv- ing the benefit of the doubt to those that appeal to us. True skepticism needs to take a moreobjective stance. Trend extrapola- tion is an important tool for fu- turist analysis, and Ray Kurzweilhas collected the best evidence he could find on many important time series and published it in de- tail for others to criticize. He has pointed out the exponential na-ture of many of the trends and made some thoughtful projec- tions. They have been extensivelycriticized by a great many serious thinkers. If Gordon Moore has some disagreements with Kurz - weil about the application of\"Moore's Law,\" they deserve seri- ous consideration. But Pigliucci doesn't tell us what the differ- ences are, let alone why we should accept one view over the other. He just argues from authority. That shouldn't be good enoughfor the S KEPTICaL INquIRER . Readers looking for a serious examination of the questions Pigliucci has raised might be in-terested in these articles: 1) D. Chalmers, \"The Singularity: a Philo sophical analysis,\" Journal of Consciousness Studies 17:7-65, 2010 and S. Baum, B. Go-ertzel, and T from an Expert assess- ment,\" Technological Forecast ing and Social Change , Vol 78, No 1, January 2011, pages 185-195. Ted Goertzeltedgoertzel@gmail.com(Ted Goertzel recently re-tired as a sociology professorat Rutgers university.)Massimo Pigliucci's article about the Singularity seemed more like the author's personal beliefs rather than an in depth study of the alleged future event. Whereas I agree that there are people out there who go off the deep end, the likelihood of nonhuman in- telligence surpassing ours isn'tthat far fetched.SuniTThT Pigliucci and I differ regard- ing the limits of technology. Ihave been designing integrated circuits for over thirty years andhave seen Moore's law in action.While this can't continue end- lessly, we still have a way to go before we hit fundamental limits. Meanwhile, smart phones and other devices get \"smarter\" every year and, I would argue, their users get dumber. Historically, computers have been pursuing two main goals: more processing power and more memory. Nothing here suggests intelligence. When I was a teenager (in the 1950s), it was believed that a computer would be as intelligent as a human if it could beat a human at chess. That is now history. Of coursethe \"intelligence bar\" was then raised to favor humans. Cogni- tive science, combined with semiconductor technology, may yet give us super-human intelli- gence. Those who say that \"artificial\" intelligence is impossible could argue the same for biological in-telligence: we evolved from one-celled animals that couldn't think or reason. By logical extrapola- tion, neither can we. (Probablytrue!) Gregory L. Schaffer Senior IC Design EngineerCupertino, California Massimo Pigliucci objects Ray Kurzweil's projec-tions related to the Singularity. Pigliucci objects to the idea of human immortality, not because of some logical or scientific rea-sons (many of which have been given by others), but because it violates the plot of a particular science fiction series! That's justsilly, if not completely absurd! Do you really think science fiction is a completely accurate predictor of the future? Y ou must be awarethat there is a lot of science fic- tion where the robots do not try to take over the world and are helpers of humanity. Remember Data from Star Trek ? In one of the Trek movies, Data had the opportunity to become a Borg, but he declined. There are even anumber of movies where robots want to become human! Pigliucci also objects to up- loading one's mind or conscious- ness into another body. again, this has happened in many sci- ence fiction stories, so, it must be possible, right? Did you see Avatar ? His particular objection, \". . . they would likely find them- selves in a self-made hell.Human psychology evolved along side a body capable of sen- sations, emotions and so on\u2014not just pure thought.\" This makesme wonder if Pigliucci even read Kurzweil's books! Kurzweil spends much time discussing the parts and functions of a human body we would likely want to keep as well as those we would be willing to discard. Emotions and sensations are definitely among those he thinks we will want to keep. Not to say that Mr. Kurz - weil's predictions are necessarily better than any particular science fiction story, they're just not nec- essarily any less. Richard \"Gilligan\" uschold Port Orange, Florida Massimo Pigliucci responds: Predictably, my column on Ray Kurzweil and the (not likely to come) Singularity has generated a number of passionate responses. It seems to me, however, that several of these are off the mark. For in- stance, I did not argue on the basis of a sci-fi television series, I used said series to make fun of certain Singularitarian views. And speak- ing of making fun, clearly some readers of SI could use a bit more of a light-hearted spirit, since they ob- viously missed the difference be-tween arguments against the idea of a Singularity (several of whichare briefly sketched in the column) and ridicule directed to Kurzweil qua guru of what I regard as a pseudoscientific movement. The same readers very likely would not object to such ridicule were it di- rected to a purveyor of pseudo- science, which is what I regardKurzweil to be, in this respect. Also, to ask for an in-depth analysis in a single column seems to me to be rais- ing the bar ridiculously high, direct- ing criticism to a straw man (a log- ical fallacy, as you know). I never said that Singularitar- ianism is only the toy of rich white guys; I was referring in particular to the Singularity Institute gather- ings in Silicon V alley, which are the nerve center of the movement. And yes, skeptics should be interested alsoin the social aspects of the move- ments they criticize, just like\u2014for instance\u2014it helps realizing the connection between climate change denial and libertarian political po- sitions, without which one would be puzzled by why so many smart and scientifically literate people (includ- ing a good number of SI readers!) reject a notion backed by plenty of empirical evidence and accepted bythe overwhelming majority of the relevant scientific community. Finally, I never said that AI is impossible, only that it needs to take seriously the organic nature of the only type of intelligence we know of, our own. It is fine to gesture toward embodying intelligence in a robot, but talk of \"uploading\" one's own mind inside said robot is still fun- damentally dualistic, and as far as I can tell is based on a seriously mis- guided concept of what intelligence is. Computers have gotten much faster and their memory has in-creased dramatically, but there is not a shred of evidence that they have gotten anywhere near human intelligence because the latter isn't (simply) a function of speed of cal- culation and storage capacity. Skep- tics should pay attention to evi- dence, and Singularitarians\u2014so far\u2014have only wishful thinking and (some) science fiction on their side of the argument.[LETTERS TO THE EDITORMarch April 13 *_SI new design masters 1/31/13 9:54 AM Page 64Skeptical Inquirer | March/April 2013 65Curse That Painting! I believe Polidoro is incorrect in his explanation of the smiling portrait of Teresa Rovere (\"Curse That Painting!\" SI, Novem - ber/December 2012). almost all of us look through camera viewfinders and we know from experience that they do not dis- tort the image significantly. The true explanation is related to the level of detail or frequency of changes in detail, primarily lumi- nance, we have available. When looking at the picture of the image we have a lot of detail and can see the shape of the mouth. However, when looking at the image seen through the viewfinder, the detail is lost and the coarse shading is perceived differently. Y ou can get the same effect by simply backing away from the picture: as the detail disappears the smile appears. Y ou can find examples on the Inter- net and my favorite is of a picture that changes from Einstein to Marilyn Monroe as you move away; search the web for \"albert Einstein Marilyn Monroe\" and you'll soon find it. You can confirm that the viewfinder is not distorting the image by pointing it at graph paper; it will not be significantly distorted. Richard Turnock Toronto, Ontario, Canada I was living in South Yorkshire when the Curse of the Crying Boy story blew up in 1985, and I remember stories that copies of the painting had defied attempts to burn them. I came home one day and found my mother had been given a painting by a neigh- bor\u2014yes, it was the Crying Boy! ISuniTThTsoon had it on a backyard bon- fire\u2014because I thought it was ghastly kitsch, not because I be-lieve in curses\u2014and had no trou- ble at all in burning it!SuniTThT Ray WardLondon, u.K. Poll Data Alarming Kendrick Frazier'sSuniTThTassessment of the Gallup Poll's survey about u.S. beliefs on evolution (News and Comment, SI, Septem ber /Octo ber 2012) is a good exam- ple of the old saw \"there are lies, damnable lies, and statistics.\" While it is true that the survey indicated little change in the per- centage of americans who reject evolution, bad as that is, over a period of thirty years, it also re- flected an alarming development between 2011 and 2012, with the percentage of creationists jump- ing from 40 percent to 46 per- cent, while the believers in theis- tic evolution fell from 38 percent to 32 percent and the advocatesof evolution without God drop - ped from 16 percent to 15 per- cent, re versing a rising trend going back eleven years. Given the increased importance of sci- entific literacy in a world con- fronted by a myriad of complexproblems ranging from global warming to overpopulation, the fact that after the improve- mentsSuniTThTseen in 2011SuniTThTwe areSuniTThTback to the dismal levels of thirty years ago is hardly grounds for celebration. Dennis MiddlebrooksBrooklyn, New Y ork Race Real I was dismayed at Kenneth Krause's dogmatic statements about race (SI, July/au gust 2012), which I find not typical of the otherwise excellent articles in your fine magazine. He says, in essence, that one cannot distin- guish a black african from a blond Swede because intermar- riage can create intermediate points. Because one cannot find any particular point of demarca- tion, the end points are identical. This is absurd. Mr. Krause, do you like fried chicken? (Probably yes.) Do you like to eat raw chicken? (Proba-bly no.) Can you point to the precise instant when a raw chicken be comes a fried chicken?(Not likely.) There fore, according to Mr. Krause, the end points are identical because you cannot draw a line anywhere. If you re- ally believe that, Mr. Krause, I want to see you eat a raw chicken on camera. Don Dilworth dondilworth@myfairpoint.net The Shroud of Turin: An Artist's Perspective I am a professional artist who has studied human anatomy and painted several portraits. I do not believe that the face of Jesus on the Shroud of Turin is an anatomically accurate depiction of a real person. Several years ago, I met and spoke with Joe Nickell. Joe is an artist and skeptical in- vestigator who has studied theShroud of Turin extensively, wrote a book on the subject [which used anatomical, icono- graphic, and historical evidence to conclude that the elongated figureon the shroud was a work of French gothic art\u2014supported by a four- teenth-century bishop's report thatsuch an artist confessed\u2014Editors ], and appeared on numerous tele- vision programs. I told Joe that to me the image of Jesus's headon the cloth resembles a common medieval to early Renaissance stylized depic- tion of a person. Jesus's face ap- pears too large for the surround- ing size of the head, and his eyes are located too high. In addition to making faces too large, ama- teur artists tend to place the eyes about 2/3 to 3/4 up from the base of the chin to the top of the head. Human eyes are actually located close to the middle of the head. Check this out for yourselfnext time you look in a mirror! These common amateur and medieval artists' characterizations are based upon idealistic percep- tions, not upon an attempt to- ward anatomical accuracy or re- alism. also, a popular artistic styl- ization in the Middle ages to early Renaissance was the exag- geration of long, thin, Europeannoses. Observe the similarity of medieval paintings to that of the face on the shroud: long thin noses, disproportionately large faces compared to head size, and eyes placed high on the heads. These similarities clearly show that the face of Jesus on the shroud more closely resemblesthe stylized and anatomically in- accurate faces of medieval paint-ings than that of a real person. My observations are consis- tent with the hypothesis that theShroud of Turin is the work of a medieval artist. Robert a. RichertRichertart.comSuniTThT Ouch!
