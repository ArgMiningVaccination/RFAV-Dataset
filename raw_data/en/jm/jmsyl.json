LUAVPG PMB is an intravenous (through the vein) drug treatment for advanced non- small cell cancer with squamous cell type. This treatment is offered to people who have adequate kidney function and a good performance status.

Gemcitabine is an anticancer drug that belongs to a group of drugs call ed pyrimidine analogs . It work s by preventing the synthesis and repair of DNA that is needed for cancer cells to divide. Carboplatin is an anticancer drug that belongs to a group of drugs called platinums. It works by preventing the synthesis of DNA, RNA and proteins that are needed for cancer cells to divide. INTENDED BENEFI TS This treatment is being given to destroy and/or to slow down the growth of cancer cells in your body. This treatment can help with controlling some of the symptoms the cancer may be causing and may delay or prevent new symptoms from starting.

For each cycle, you will have the three drugs given to you intravenously (through the vein) on Day 1. Pembrolizumab is given first. The infusion lasts about 30 minutes. Gemcitabine is given next. The infusion lasts about 3 0 minutes. Carboplatin is given last. The i nfusion lasts about 30 minutes . On Day 8 of each cycle, you will only be given gemcitabine intravenously over 30 minutes. What will happen while I am being treated ? A blood test is done within one month of starting treatment. A blood test is also done be fore Day 1 and Day 8 of each cycle. The dose and timing of your treatment may be changed based on your blood test results and/or other side effects.
