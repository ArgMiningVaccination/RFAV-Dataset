The study is being run by the Oxford Vaccine Group , which is a part of the University of Oxford, on behalf of the sponsor , Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V . The purpose of this study is to collect long -term safety data from participants who received two experimental vaccines to prevent Ebola virus disease: Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA -BN- Filo. This may contribute to the future development of an Ebola vaccine. Up to approximately 5,500 participants will take part in this worldwide study . Who has reviewed and ap proved the study? The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has independently reviewed this clinical trial. The study has also been reviewed and approved by the South Central Oxford A Research Ethics Committee . The Research Ethics Comm ittee is an independent group of people responsible for reviewing clinical research, so as to protect your safety, rights, wellbeing and dignity. How long will I be in the study ? You will be i n this long-term safety follow -up study for about 5 years (60 months) . This includes the time you have already spent in the previous clinical study for Ebola vaccines Ad2 6.ZEBOV and MVA -BN-Filo. After un -blinding of the original study, if you received Ad26.ZEBOV and/or MVA -BN-Filo you will remain in this long -term safety follow up study. If you received placebo and have already been enrolled into this long -term safety follow -up study, you will be discontinued from further participation in this study. What happens during the st udy?
