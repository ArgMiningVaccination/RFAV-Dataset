But avant-garde eaters often serve as a testing ground for innovative foods, and what they like to eat now may be the trendy new food on the kitchen tables of mainstream eaters tomorrow. After all, foods that now appeal to millions of people, like yogurt, granola bars and rice cakes, were once favored by fringe eaters and available only in natural-foods stores. It is hard to say which unusual products will be the next foods to find their way into ordinary supermarkets. But suppliers and retailers say certain foods are selling so well that they may eventually have wide enough appeal to interest the big food companies. The impulse driving sales in natural-foods stores is an enduring one: the desire for health and long life. But unlike 20 years ago, there now are vast numbers of people of diverse economic means who are simultaneously discovering that mortality is not an abstract concept. \"There's a wave of baby boomers hitting the big 40, and their bodies are talking back,\" said John Goodman, the vice president for sales and marketing for Arrowhead Mills in Hereford, Tex., which makes organic grains, cereals, breads, flours and baking mixes. They are looking for foods that might help them live better and longer, he added, and they are looking outside the mainstream. To that end, sales are booming in foods that are fat free, or free of ingredients like milk and wheat that cause allergic reactions in many people. Organic ingredients are sought after, too, because many people consider them to be tastier, healthier and more ecological. Selling very well, too, are Chinese herbal and homeopathic remedies, said Frank J. Lampe, the editor of Natural Foods Merchandiser, a trade journal published by New Hope Communications in Boulder, Colo. But customers in natural-foods stores are also affected by the same forces that shape supermarket shoppers. Busy and not always willing to cook, they are seeking convenience, but with a twist: they are snapping up prepared products, both frozen and on the shelf, made of organic and natural ingredients, even if they are slightly more expensive than their mainstream counterparts. Manufacturers of natural foods, previously unsophisticated in the art of marketing, are now much more attuned to convenience and packaging. \"They are starting to think like big companies,\" said Kathy Ordan, the director of marketing for the Fresh Fields natural-foods stores in the Washington, D.C., area. Even cooking accessories are being made in natural but convenient forms. Fresh Fields, for instance, is selling charcoal made from wood in an instant, easy-to-light form with none of the chemicals found in the usual instant-light charcoal. Despite a concern with health, many people are not willing to give up snacks. \"Chips and popcorn and permutations thereof have gone bonkers,\" said Chris Kilham, a consultant to natural-foods companies. \"It's like walking down the snack aisle of a regular supermarket, but all the ingredients are good.\" Aside from organic blue-corn tortilla chips and organic air-popped popcorn, there are yogurt and green-onion potato chips made from unpeeled potatoes, and cheese puffs made from natural blue cheese and cheddar. Also flourishing are popcorn cakes, a new product similar to rice cakes. Cookies are also doing well, especially those by Health Valley, an Irwindale, Calif., company that makes a variety of natural foods. It has 19 varieties of cookies described as fat free, including flavors like raisin oatmeal and apple cinnamon. (Although they are labeled as fat free, that is accurate only for each serving, not for an entire package. One serving, or three cookies, contains less than 1 gram of fat.) Retailers said the quest to avoid foods that may cause allergic reactions is one of the largest factors affecting sales. \"More and more people who haven't felt good in a long time are finding that their doctors are telling them to give up wheat or milk,\" said Cate Conniff, the food-information manager for the six Bread and Circus natural-foods stores in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Shoppers can find pizza made with soy instead of mozzarella, ice cream made with rice instead of cream and bread and cereals made with grains other than wheat. Two of the most rapidly growing alternatives to wheat are spelt and triticum polonicum, popularly known as Kamut. Both are ancient grains in the wheat family with a slightly different chemical structure that makes them easier to digest for wheat-sensitive people. Arrowhead Mills introduced Kamut cereal six months ago and expects annual sales this year to be more than 360,000 boxes, a lot for a new organic cereal. Rudi's, a bakery in Boulder, came out with a spelt bread last October, and it is now the company's leading national line. The company, which has increased production from 1,000 loaves of spelt bread a month to 10,000 loaves, recently started making bagels and hot-dog and hamburger buns with spelt. There has also been a profusion of wheat-free pastas and grain mixes, with choices now available in rice and spelt, as well as other ancient grains like quinoa and amaranth. To some extent, they appeal to those who simply seek variety. Although the allergy connection has fueled the surge in nondairy alternative products, there is also a broader health goal: the reduction of fat and cholesterol. In most cases, the ingredient that substitutes for dairy products is soy. \"Soy-milk sales were up 40 percent last year,\" said Richard Youngman, the president of Stow Mills, a distributor in Chesterfield, N.H., that sells to more than 2,000 stores in the East. Also booming are soy products like burgers, hot dogs, chili, sloppy Joes and cold cuts. But some of the big-selling nondairy alternatives are made with rice, like Rice Dream frozen desserts and beverages. These products also appeal to a growing number of people interested in vegetarian dishes, especially those who want to send their children to school with lunches that do not contain meat but also do not saddle them with the label of peculiar food. \"Kids are ostracized if they pull out something that is obviously tofu,\" said Ms. Conniff, of Bread and Circus. In new natural-foods stores, the allocation of space makes it clear which areas are growing: there is much more space for frozen foods, where shoppers can now find healthy versions of typical American foods. \"Prepared dinners do very well,\" said Spencer Brown, who manages Integral Yoga, a natural-foods store in Manhattan that once carried almost no convenience foods. Selling especially well, many retailers said, are organic potpies and lasagna made by Amy's; Indian dinners made by Taj; pizzas without cheese, like Original Rice Crust Pizza and Pizsoy, and Veggie Pockets, enchiladalike sandwiches. Also popular are convenient foods sold on shelves, like cereals, organic canned tomatoes and juice blends, especially those with rain-forest ingredients -- juices from fruits that are grown in Central and South American rain forests, like guanabana, guava and star fruit. Retailers are also expanding bulk-bin space for customers more concerned about price. \"Economics has got something to do with it,\" said Mary Harvat, the director of purchasing for Texas Health Distributors, which sells primarily to the Whole Foods Markets chain. Bulk sales provide savings by eliminating packaging and advertising. But what about that blue-green algae? Some products in natural-foods stores are still considered fringe items, even if they are selling better than a few years ago. One such category, green food, includes algae that supposedly provide energy and strengthen immune systems. \"Five years ago, I only carried one green food,\" said Richard Antonelli, the sales manager for Cornucopia Inc., a wholesaler in Dayville, Conn. Now he sells tens of thousands of dollars worth of green foods; his newest offering is Klamath Blue Green Algae, harvested by Klamath Blue Green in Mount Shasta, Calif., from a lake in southern Oregon. But algae is still a very specialized food. Environmentalists need not worry yet that avid algae-eaters will upset the ecological balance. AVANT-GARDE GROCERIES THESE are some of the foods gaining popularity in natural-foods stores. AMARANTH: An ancient high-protein grain with a woodsy flavor that was popular with the Aztecs and is used in a number of cereals and breads. GREEN FOOD: A category that includes supplements made from various grasses and algae. The manufacturers say they are high in beta-carotene and improve mental and physical functioning. KAMUT: This is the name given by Bob Quinn to an ancient wheatlike grain. His family's company, Montana Flour and Grains in Big Sandy, Mont., is the main grower and promoter of Kamut. Mr. Quinn picked the name because he believed it was the ancient Egyptian word for wheat -- but later found out that it was not. Kamut has more protein than regular wheat. QUINOA: An ancient Incan grain with complete protein, quinoa has a slightly nutty flavor. RAIN-FOREST INGREDIENTS: Fruits that are grown in Central and South American rain forests, like guanabana, guava and star fruit, are especially popular now in juice blends. SPELT: An ancient grain in the wheat family, it can be tolerated by many people who are sensitive to the more common strain of "}
