Experience less physical, mental and emotional suffering in your life - today and everyday. We all experience areas in our lives where we struggle. Often, this struggle can be tracked back to our childhood experiences - to trauma in our adulthood that we haven't yet overcome or to dis-functional and unhealthy dynamics in our current personal or professional lives. Sometimes, this struggle continues on for years. We find ourselves stuck in repetitive patterns, way into our adulthood, and we suffer daily - but it doesn't have to be this way. There are a few ways I am helping women (and men!) to change their wellbeing for the better that you may be interested in learning more about - its all about finding hope, creating change and experience more peace with ourselves and in our lives. HOPE Identifying and therefore understanding what has been and still is shaping your reality, will give you instant release and make you feel much more comfortable in your skin immediately. CHANGE Once you are able to release energies that no longer serve you, your vibration will change to a higher level which will transform your perception of reality and create new experiences. PEACE A broad range of natural & ancient healing arts, that I have studied for years and have practiced globally, helps me to enable you to feel more peaceful, grounded and connected in your life. Sessions with April Choose various options of 1:1 sessions or apply for one of my programs and potentially transform your life forever! If you know that there is something that is holding you back, but you are not sure yet where to start or if energy work is for you, let's jump on a phone call and find out! Private Sessions are designed to relieve stress and dis-ease, clearing and removing energy cords, contracts, negative thought patterns, and emotional blocks that no longer serve you; patterns of self-limitation and self-sabotage are uncovered and released. Each and every time, it is amazing to see how many of my clients can totally change their physical, mental, and emotional lives through energy work. Energy healing with April Energy imbalance is a cause of a lot of issues; pain, anxiety, negative emotions and much more. I have been studying energy work and ancient healing arts for more than two decades all over the world. Exploring how our mind, our body and our soul are connected and how we can break through what is holding us back from living our best lives is my greatest passion. Reiki is a beautiful energy healing tool that can help cleanse your chakras and align your body, mind and soul. Learning Reiki is just like learning to meditate or doing yoga. Quantum Touch\u00ae is both amazing and magical the way it connects you with your breath and your body. Whether you simply want to learn how to heal yourself and others, such as your loved ones (two or four legged, animals respond wonderfully to Reiki!!) or if you work as a health care professional wishing to expand your skills - everyone can learn and do it. Classes take place in Modesto and Sonora, CA and online. "}
