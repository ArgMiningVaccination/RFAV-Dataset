The current guidelines suggest to take primary vaccination like bcg/ easysix/pentavac/ mmr on priority basis on time Precaution to b taken is to inform prior to visiting hospital n avoid crowding. Booster vaccination can b delayed The immune system is extremely important in an individual's system. A strong immune system helps to combat the invasion of foreign particles and consequently resists the diseases. Vaccination is such a context becomes imperative as it strengthens an individual's immunity. In vaccination, antigens or germs are given in very small doses. They stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to fight against that particular infection. Vaccinations are provided to both children to protect them from a number of diseases. However, different vaccinations are provided at different ages according to the susceptibility to diseases. Some of the vaccinations that are provided to newborns are: 1. Hepatitis B vaccine: This vaccination is given in order to prevent the child from having Hepatitis B. Hepatitis B is a liver disease that if persists can lead to liver failure or even liver cancer. This vaccine must be injected immediately after the birth of the baby. The first dose must be followed by administering a second dose within a span of a month or two. 2. Rotavirus Vaccine (RV): This vaccine, taken orally, prevents the infant from Rotavirus. This virus causes vomiting and diarrhoea in children that often leads to severe dehydration. This vaccine is administered within two to four months of the baby's birth. Sometimes, on a doctor's prescription, a second dose may be necessary for the sixth month. 3. Acellular Pertussis Vaccine and Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids: This is a combination of various vaccines that protects the child from tetanus and diphtheria. Newborns are extremely prone to diphtheria that causes fatal illness and sometimes even deaths in children. This vaccination thereby, is extremely important and must be administered within two or four months and must be followed up with secondary doses later under the doctor's supervision. [Polio](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/polio) is a potentially fatal infectious disease that causes [paralysis](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/paralysis).

Every year, World Polio Day is celebrated o October 24 with the objective of making the world free from this crippling disease.

Polio Vaccine: What You Must Know About Your Child's [Immunizations](https://www.lybrate.com/doctors-for-immunizations) The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that every child and infant gets vaccinated against [poliomyelitis](https://www.lybrate.com/medicine/poliomyelitis-oral-vaccine/health-feed) or polio. A shot of [inactivated](https://www.lybrate.com/medicine/inactivated-influenza-vaccine) IPV (polio vaccine) is given in the arms or the leg, depending on the child's age. Oral vaccines are also administered. Every child should receive four doses of the vaccine, one dose at each of the following stages - 2 months 4 months 6-18 months 4-6 years Sometimes, IPV may be administered in a combination vaccine along with other vaccines. In this case, the child might have to receive an additional dose of IPV, which is completely safe. Children travelling abroad where the risk of polio is slightly higher should complete the cycle of [vaccination](https://www.lybrate.com/topic/vaccination) before leaving. In case the child is unable to complete the cycle, an advance schedule is recommended as follows - 1 dose when the child is 6 weeks old or above A second dose after 4 weeks of the first one A third dose after 4 weeks of the second one A fourth dose after 6 months of the third one If the advance schedule cannot be fulfilled before leaving, the remaining doses must be administered in the foreign country, or after returning to the home country, at the recommended intervals. Additionally, children, who have completed the advance schedule successfully, should receive an IPV dose at age 4 or above, as long as it has been six months since the previous dose.

Vaccinations do not end with childhood. In many cases adults too need to be vaccinated against certain diseases. Some of them are: It is the first vaccine that the doctor will ask your child to get if he/she gets wound. Tetanus is a rare but severe condition which occurs when bacteria enter into an open wound. It can turn fatal if left untreated, so you need to follow the vaccination schedule in order to control the infection. Indulging in substance abuse (especially the ones that require injecting with syringes) increases the risk of tetanus. Causes This disorder is caused by the bacteria called 'Clostridium tetani'. The bacterium is known to survive for an extended period outside the body, and is found in places such as soil and the manure of cows and horses. The bacteria enter the body through a wound, multiply rapidly and then release a toxin. This toxin causes muscle spasms and stiffness, thus affecting your nerves. The bacteria can enter the body through cuts, burns, animal bites, body piercings and eye injuries. However, this disorder is not contagious. Symptoms The symptoms of this disease can take 5-20 days to develop fully in the body. Your child may experience symptoms such as a rise in the body temperature, sweating, rapid heartbeats, muscle spasms and stiffening of the jaw muscles. These symptoms will worsen if left untreated, eventually leading to cardiac arrest or suffocation in some cases. Treatment If your child has a wound, the first step is to administer an injection of tetanus immunoglobulin. Tetanus immunoglobulin contains antibodies that effectively kill the tetanus bacteria. In case the symptoms start, then the child might need to be admitted to a hospital. Here, antibiotics and muscle relaxants are administered and breathing support may also be provided if required. The preventive measure of this disorder is to be vaccinated against the 'tetanus' bacteria. The vaccine consists of five injections that are administered in a specific order. Once the entire course has been completed, it usually provides lifelong protection against the tetanus bacteria. "}
