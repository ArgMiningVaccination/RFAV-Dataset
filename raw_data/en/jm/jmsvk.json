Prevalence rates of ASDs are reported to have increased in the last decade, raising concern amongst researchers, service providers, policymakers, and families. While current aetiological research is exploring the interface between genetic and environmental factors, exposure to heavy metals, in particular mercury has retained public interest. methods .

Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are neuropsychiatric disorders that include Autistic Disorder, Asperger syndrome and Pervasive Developmental Disorders - Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) (DSM-IV-TR) (American Psychiatric Association (APA), 2000). Reported prevalence rates of ASD are inconsistent across the literature and may range from 10.1/10,000 to 64.9/10,000 (Bryson, Clark, & Meng, & McLean-Heywood, 2006; Ouellette-Kuntz et al., 2006). Prevalence rates are reported to have increased in the last decade raising con - cern amongst researchers, service providers, policymakers, and family members (Ouellette-Kuntz et al., 2007; Rice et al., \u00a9 Ontario Association on Developmental Disabilitiesv.18 n.1 Autism and Mercury Exposure 21 2007). A review of 43 epidemiological studies revealed that only a small fraction (0% to 16.7%; mean = 5.9%) of the cases of Autistic Disorder could be related to any known aetiologic - ally significant medical condition (Fombonne, 2005). While current aetiological research is exploring the interface between genetic and environmental factors, exposure to heavy met - als, in particular mercury, has retained public interest (Hertz-Picciotto et al., 2006). This paper aims to improve critical thinking towards stud - ies investigating the causal link between ASD and exposure to mercury by applying the nine criteria for causality as defined by Hill to the literature related to these associations (Hill, 1965). Hill's criteria include: (1) the strength of the association, (2) the consistency of the observed association, (3) the specificity of the association, (4) the temporal relationship of the association, (5) a biological gradient or dose- response curve, (6) the biological plausibility, (7) the coherence with the current knowledge, (8) experimental or semi-experimental evi - dence, (9) and the analogy with similar evi - dence. The strength and the consistency of the association are two criteria that must invariably be considered to prove causation (Hill, 1965). Other criteria might be difficult to establish or irrelevant to the nature of the observed associa - tion, but should nevertheless be systematically examined. If evidence exists for the remaining seven criteria, conclusions may be drawn with-out hesitation, although the lack of evidence does not nullify a causal association. In neuropsychiatry, four of Hill's nine criteria are considered critical to assess causality: the strength of the association (criterion 1), the consistency of the observed association (crite - rion 2), the biologic rationale (criterion 6), and the temporal relationship of the association (cri - terion 4) (van Reekum, Streiner, & Conn, 2001). Arguments of a biologic gradient (i.e., severity of symptoms increases with exposure; criteri - on 5) and specificity of the relation between the causal agent and the outcome (criterion 3) may not be feasible to prove, since symptom severity is difficult to determine and multiple causal fac - tors are generally identified for one neuropsy - chiatric disorder. Coherence with known facts (criterion 7) and analogy with similar evidence (criterion 9) might add to our understanding of the association; however, aetiological under - standing in neuropsychiatry is still limited and a lack of evidence to prove these three criteria is not sufficient to rule out the causal relation - ship. Experimental studies (criterion 8) provide greater evidence of a causal link but may be unethical to perform in neuropsychiatry since it is unconceivable to induce some form of brain dysfunctions experimentally in humans. criteria for causation Between mercury and ASD Mercury is just one of a handful of heavy met - als that have been suggested as environmental contributors to the development of ASD. The heightened public interest regarding the until-recent presence of thimerosal (a mercury-based preservative) in widely distributed vaccina - tions amongst other sources of exposure raises concern over the insufficient evidence tying the heavy metal to the manifestation of ASD. In this next section, a brief comment is made on issues relevant to each of Hill's nine crite - ria regarding the association between ASD and mercury. criterion 1: Strength of the Association The strength of an association is the statisti - cal or clinical significance of the association, is observed in a well-defined population but does not occur to the same extent in an appropriate control group. Case-definition, sample size and statistical power are thus crucial to determine the strength of an association. Differences in participant selection and identification pro - cedures across studies are key methodologi - cal issues that must be considered. ASD was first introduced in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-III) in 1980 (American Psychiatric Association (APA), 1980) and subtypes and diagnostic criteria have been revised several times since (DSM-III-R; DSM-IV; DSM-IV-TR) (APA,1987; APA, 1994; APA, 2000). Two- to threefold variation in the prevalence rates of ASD can result from apply - ing different diagnostic criteria to the same survey data (Kielinen, Linna, & Moilanen, 2000). Social and demographic characteris - tics of the cases with ASD may also influence study results. Attention should be given to the participants' gender as the male: female ratio JoDD22 cobigo et al. is approximately 4:1, with a more pronounced difference among individuals with intellectual disabilities (Fombonne, 2005). To appraise the multiple factors that could impact the strength of the observed association, a systematic review of the literature on ASD and exposure to mer-cury was conducted. Systematic reviews are designed to assess the strength of the observed associations as they help in collecting and cri - tiquing relevant methodological information in all selected studies. criterion 2: consistency of the observed Association An assessment of consistency requires deter - mining whether the association has been repeatedly observed by different persons, in different places, circumstances and times (Hill, 1965). Methodological issues may explain dis - crepancies, but if no reason justifies discrepan - cies, evidence seriously undermines the argu - ment of causation (van Reekum et al., 2001). Systematic reviews are particularly useful in assessing consistency across studies while tak - ing into account methodological issues. criterion 3: Specificity of the Association Although evidence remains limited, ASD is known to be partially determined by genetic factors (Leonard et al., 2010). Specificity of the association is not confirmed, but it does not constitute a necessary criterion for causation in neuropsychiatry (van Reekum et al., 2001). Consequently, this third criterion is not rel - evant to the study of the association between ASD and exposure to heavy metals. Other cri - teria must be considered. criterion 4: temporality The time of exposure to the potential agent must occur prior to the onset of the symptoms. The method used to estimate cases exposure to mercury is crucial in making assumptions about temporal sequence. Multiple sources of exposure to mercury may exist, and there is difficulty in assessing the risk of ASD with prenatal or early childhood exposure. Relying on biomarkers to estimate mercury exposure offers the advantage of measuring exposure from all possible sources, but not all of them can provide information on past exposures (World Health Organization (WHO), 2006). Mercury accumulates in the bones and teeth, and can be excreted through sweat, nails, urine and feces. Measurement of heavy metals from body tissues is not only affected by tissue-specific half-lives, but also may largely be a result of differential accumulation and excre - tion capabilities and mechanisms amongst dif - ferent populations (Axel Weiner & Nylander, 1995; Holmes, Blaxill, & Haley, 2003; Kern, Geier, Adams, & Geier, 2010). The reported half-lives of mercu - ric compounds in blood and body tissues are variable. Data from five publications found the half-life of methyl mercury in blood or hair to range from 45 to 70 days (Al-Shahristani Collier, 1982; Smith et al., 1994). Therefore, prenatal and early childhood expo - sures are not likely to be identified through blood or hair mercury levels measured later in life. Mercury levels in bones and teeth provide more information on past exposure compared to blood or hair levels. Modelling may also be used to estimate exposure (WHO, 2006). This relies on available information on the concen - tration of mercury in air, water or soil along with information on when, where and how individuals might have been exposed to the metal. Where data are available, this indirect method can provide a measure of exposure prior to the onset of symptoms of ASD thereby respecting the temporality criterion in studies of risk factors. However, information on expo - sure and cases of ASD typically comes from different sources and this may lead to impre - cise or unreliable data. criterion 7: coherence with Known Facts Mercury is primarily released in the environ - ment as a result of human industrial activ - ities and, consequently, human exposure has increased since industrialization. Mercury exists as a range of organic and inorganic mat - ters that vary in toxicity and persistence in liv - ing organisms. Methyl mercury is an organic compound much more toxic than pure metal v.18 n.1 Autism and Mercury Exposure 23 mercury itself, and has the ability to migrate across cell membranes and accumulate in liv - ing organisms (Environment Canada, 2010a). Children are disproportionately more vul - nerable to chemical toxicants as their meta - bolic pathways are comparatively immature (Landrigan & Garg, 2002). An additional vulnerability in children is their rapid pace of neurodevelopment and the incompletely formed blood brain barrier which then makes the developing brain much more susceptible to any toxic insults (WHO, 2006). Ingestion of methyl mercury in foods is the most prevalent pathway of exposure to mercury in human populations (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2006). Thimerosal, a mercury-containing anti-microbial preservative, is used in vaccines and immunoglobulins around the world, but efforts have been made to decrease its use. In the U.S.,\"thimerosal has been removed from or reduced to trace amounts in all vaccines routinely recommended for chil - dren 6 years of age and younger, with the excep - tion of inactivated influenza vaccine\" (FDA, 2010). In Canada, most vaccines do not contain thimerosal; the only thimerosal-containing vac - cine in routine use in the infant immunization schedules of some Canadian jurisdictions is the hepatitis B vaccine (Health Canada, 2007). See also the Public Health Agency of Canada (2007) for a list of other vaccines, including the multi - vial influenza vaccine, that contain thimerosal. criteria 6 and 9: Biological Plausibility and Analogy with Similar evidence Chronic exposure to mercury can cause dam - age to the brain, spinal cord, kidneys and liver, even at a very low level (Environment Canada, 2010b). Exposure to mercury while in the womb can lead to neurodevelopmental prob - lems in children. Damage to the developing brain following mercury exposure is wide - spread. Excess exposure may inhibit brain transport mechanisms and critical enzymes of normal neuronal development and appears to involve oxidative stress mechanisms and impairment of microtubule assembly (Aschner & Aschner, 1990; D. A. Geier, King, Sykes, & Geier, 2008). Teratogenic effects on the foetus vary depending on the developmental stage at the time of exposure, although no exposure level is completely safe (Sadler, 2004). criteria 5 and 8: Biological Gradient and experimental or Quasi-experimental evidence Mercury poisoning is characterized by symp - toms similar to autistic traits such as an indif - ference to others, irritability, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive traits (WHO, 2007). Furthermore, a decrease in the severity of ASD-like symptoms in children suffering from mer - cury poisoning has been observed following the substitution of metabolites implicated in crucial mercury detoxification pathways (che - lation therapy) (James et al., 2004). Given that the putative association between ASD and exposure to mercury is plausible, evidence is required to assess the strength and consistency of this association to establish caus - ality. Temporality between the exposure and the onset of symptoms is also a critical criterion that requires attention. Studies on the potential link between ASD and exposure to mercury are presented and discussed with these three essential criteria in mind. materials and methods A systematic review was used to examine the hypothesized link between ASD and mercury exposure. The guidelines from the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD, 2008) were followed to identify, analyze and compare rel - evant studies. Study Identification and Selection Studies were identified through several sourc - es. Databases EBM Reviews - Cochrane DSR, ACP Journal Club, DARE, and CCTR) were searched for publications from 1980 to 2010 inclusive, with combinations of keywords such as autism, per - vasive developmental disorders, and mercury. The starting date of 1980 was chosen as it cor-relates with the first introduction of ASD in the DSM (American Psychiatric Association, 1980). JoDD24 cobigo et al. Citations from chosen articles and relevant reviews were hand-searched. Grey literature not published commercially or indexed by major databases was searched to include unpublished articles, reports, and conference abstracts valu - able to the systematic review, so as to minimize publication bias (CRD, 2008). Grey literature was identified through a Google and Google Scholar search and by visiting autism-related research society websites (Autism Canada Foundation, the Autism Research Centre, the Autism Research Institute, the Autism Society Canada, the Autism Society of America, and the Autism Spectrum Disorders - Canadian-American Research Consortium). Titles and abstracts were screened to select rel - evant papers based on the list of criteria pre - sented below (all inclusion and exclusion cri - teria were applied to identified papers). Papers were included if they examined: the relationship between exposure to mer - cury and ASD, a hypothesized source of exposure, prenatal or otherwise, a sample population of individuals with ASD. Exclusion criteria were set in order to provide the best available evidence and avoid flaws in the appraisal of causal relationships between mercury exposure and ASD, particularly regarding the strength and consistency of the association, as well as its temporality. Papers were excluded if they: reported measurement of mercury from body tissues without reporting upon sources and/or exposure status of participants, recruited cases amongst persons diagnosed with mercury poisoning, failed to report the use of appropriate statis - tical analyses testing a stated hypothesis. We also excluded review papers and articles reporting findings from ecological studies. Systematic reviews summarize, compare and analyze findings from original papers. We excluded ecological studies from this review to help with analyses and comparisons. Their population-based design requires a different approach to extract data, appraise their quality and analyze their findings. Data extraction and Quality Assessment A data extraction form was tailored to suit the review questions. Information regarding the purpose, methods and results of each study was collected. Samples and population charac - teristics including age, gender and diagnoses, as well as location, sample size and selection methods were recorded into common catego - ries to facilitate cross-study comparisons. Quality assessment served to determine if results were unduly influenced by method - ological bias and provided an indication of the strength of the presented evidence (CRD, 2008). Factors used to assess the quality of the includ - ed studies were: sample selection, case identi - fication, measurement of exposure to mercury, including the ability to determine temporality between onset of the symptoms and exposure. High quality studies confirmed case status fol - lowing all or part of the Canadian best practice guidelines for the diagnosis of ASD (Nachshen et al., 2008). These guidelines recommend the use of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnostic criteria and the combination of clinical judge - ment and standardized assessment tools. The Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS) (Lord, Rutter, & Couteur, 1994; Lord, 2002), the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) (Lord et al., 1994) and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) (Schopler, Reichler, & Renner, 1988) are the rec - ommended instruments. Clinical judgement requires significant training and experience. An interdisciplinary approach is also recom - mended. Studies that assessed exposure using objective criteria consistent across both cases and controls were deemed to be of high qual - ity. Furthermore, as the aim of the review was to determine whether mercury exposure could be a risk factor for ASD, high quality studies had to be able to demonstrate that exposure occurred prior to the first symptoms of ASD, that is during pregnancy or early childhood. v.18 n.1 Autism and Mercury Exposure 25 Table 1.

Results From 523 papers identified through database searches, only 146 articles investigated the link between mercury exposure and ASD. Ten stud - ies were retained for final analysis (Figure 1). These studies are summarized in Table 1. Three of the ten papers found significant cor - relations between increased mercury expo - sure and ASD diagnosis (Adams, Romdalvik, Ramanujam, & Legator, 2007; Adams, Romdalvik, Levine, & Hu, 2008; Holmes et al., 2003), one of which (Adams et al., 2007) also found a significant correlation between ASD and a lower exposure to mercury. However, methodological issues could explain the lack of both consistency and strength of the association. Case definition differed between studies. Some included participants with any diagnosis of ASD, while others limited their study popula - tion to individuals with \"autism.\" None of the studies met the criteria for diagnostic validity. They did not report using standardized diag - nostic methods to confirm ASD case status. However, little information is available in the published papers to appraise accurately the diagnostic validity. Diagnostic validity is there - fore questionable in all of the reviewed studies. The diagnostic criteria applied in studies may impact the results by changing the study popu - lation (Kielinen et al., 2000). Selection of comparison groups is also crucial when exploring differences between popula - tions. Two papers (Adams et al., 2008; Holmes et al., 2003) used age-matched controls, while only Holmes et al. employed gender matching. Gender ratios in cases deviated from the 4:1 male: female ratio expected to exist in the base population with ASD, and all studies reported using imbalanced case: control ratios. None of the studies controlled for pica, although per - sons presenting with this condition have been shown to be at higher risk of exposure to heavy metals (Rutter & Taylor, 2002). A common methodological flaw in vaccine studies was observed: so-called \"controls\" are not controls in the scientific sense.

Study selection process.JoDD30 cobigo et al. vaccines, \"controls\" were most commonly those who were not receiving vaccinations known to contain thimerosal, but still received some level of vaccination (Hviid et al., 2003). Studies look - ing at vaccination during pregnancy selected controls that did not receive any vaccination. Sample sizes were generally small with cases varying between 16 and 425 participants, and controls between 11 and 733 participants. Thus, some of the studies may not have had sufficient statistical power to detect differences between cases and controls, and this may explain observed discrepancies. The review identified only three studies that could establish mercury exposure prior to the clinical onset of symptoms typical of ASD (Croen, Matevia, Yoshida, & Grether, 2008; Holmes et al., 2003; Miles & Takahashi, 2007) by investigating potential sources of exposure limited to the prenatal period. Discussion It remains clear that evidence is lacking in the case of mercury-induced ASD pathologies. More stringent methods of study conduction need to be established and strictly adhered to before claims regarding any potential role of the heavy metal in the clinical onset of ASD may be made. The strength and the consistency of the observed association must be considered when examining causality (Hill, 1965). The reviewed studies failed to establish both of these crite - ria. Consequently, it is impossible to confirm or nullify the hypothesis of an aetiological link between ASD and exposure to mercury without addressing these methodological flaws. Future research should assess mercury expos - ure using methods that allow for the investiga - tion of the timing between exposure and the onset of symptoms. In addition, given the high variability in the levels of the exposure and the expected diversity in genetic susceptibil - ity to ASD, larger sample sizes are needed to detect such associations with adequate power. Alternatively, statistical modelling using data from existing databases on chemical and heavy metal concentrations in the air, water or soil during participants' in utero development and early childhood offers an inexpensive approach for the identification of populations which appear to be at high risk for ASD due to mercury exposure. Ideally, such databases would capture mercury exposure from mul - tiple sources (Adgate et al., 2004; Sax, Bennett, Chillrud, Kinney, & Spengler, 2004). Well-characterized cases and matched controls could then be sampled from these populations so as to measure mercury in calcified tissues. In addition to temporality and power issues, consideration needs to be given to case defin - ition. An independent diagnostic assessment is advised to better describe the sample and exclude children who do not meet diagnos - tic criteria when assessed using best practice guidelines. However, confirming diagnoses using a standardized approach represents many challenges for researchers, and might not be feasible. A confirmed diagnosis of DSM IV aut - ism by a paediatric neurologist or development - al paediatrician is the most feasible procedure, unless one is part of an extensive clinical team that also does research. Similarly, sibling and relative controls should be used with caution, as genetic vulnerabilities are already known to be involved in the aetiology of ASD. Studies on siblings may still be highly relevant, but com - parison groups should either be exclusively composed of siblings or of unrelated children. Complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors are now considered to be involved in the aetiology of ASD. As a con - sequence, future research investigating these underlying interactions is strongly recom - mended. None of the reviewed articles con - sidered genetic factors in their analyses. The Childhood Autism Risks from Genetics and the Environment study (CHARGE) (Hertz-Picciotto et al., 2006) is an ongoing population-based study collecting information on 1,000 to 2,000 cases and controls. Information is col - lected about the children's social, intellectual and behavioural development, their exposure to chemicals in the environment at home and elsewhere, their medical history, their diet and other aspects of their lives, before and after birth. Findings from this investigation are promising to shed light on the aetiology of ASD. In conclusion, the risk of developing and being diagnosed with an ASD as a result of mercury exposure remains unclear because of methodo -v.18 n.1 Autism and Mercury Exposure 31 logical flaws in the studies conducted to date. Rigorous research is needed to provide adequate information to families, clinicians and decision-makers. They must be provided with up-to-date, critically appraised information to help them make informed decisions. One additional issue that one might consider addressing is whether the public should really wait until hazard - ous effects of a potentially toxic substance are proven beyond a doubt before one should make the effort to reduce mercury intake or exposure, especially for babies and young children, and pregnant or nursing mothers.

Key messages From this Article People with disabilities : We don't know yet what causes autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Exposure to pollutants, in particular mercury, could be one of the causes, but the research to-date is too weak to demonstrate a link. Professionals and policymakers: Being well- informed on the current evidence on the aetiolo - gy of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is crucial to adequately answer questions from persons with ASD and their parents, and to develop pol - icies to prevent the exposure to causal agents. This paper provides information to improve critical thinking towards published research of the link between ASD and exposure to mercury. References Adams, J. B., Romdalvik, J., Levine, K.
