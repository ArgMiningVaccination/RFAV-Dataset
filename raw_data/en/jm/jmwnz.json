Standards of medical care are determined onthe basis of all clinical data available for an individual patient and are subject to change as sci-entific knowledge and technology advance and practice patterns evolve. These parameters ofpractice should be considered guidelines only. Adherence to them will not ensure a successfuloutcome for every individual, nor should they be interpreted as including all proper methodsof care or excluding other acceptable methods of care aimed at the same results. The ultimatejudgment regarding a particular clinical procedure or treatment plan must be made by the psy-chiatrist in light of the clinical data presented by the patient and the diagnostic and treatmentoptions available. This practice guideline has been developed by psychiatrists who are in active clinical prac- tice. In addition, some contributors are primarily involved in research or other academicendeavors. It is possible that through such activities some contributors, including work groupmembers and reviewers, have received income related to treatments discussed in this guide-line. A number of mechanisms are in place to minimize the potential for producing biasedrecommendations due to conflicts of interest. Work group members are selected on the basisof their expertise and integrity. Any work group member or reviewer who has a potential con-flict of interest that may bias (or appear to bias) his or her work is asked to disclose this to theSteering Committee on Practice Guidelines and the work group. Iterative guideline drafts arereviewed by the Steering Committee, other experts, allied organizations, APA members, andthe APA Assembly and Board of Trustees; substantial revisions address or integrate the com-ments of these multiple reviewers. The development of the APA practice guidelines is notfinancially supported by any commercial organization. More detail about mechanisms in place to minimize bias is provided in a document avail- able from the APA Department of Quality Improvement and Psychiatric Services, \"APAGuideline Development Process.\" This practice guideline was approved in June 2003 and published in November 2003.

The following guide is designed to help readers find the sections that will be mostuseful to them. Part A, \"Assessment, T reatment, and Risk Management Recommendations,\" is published as a supplement to the American Journal of Psychiatry and contains the general and specific rec- ommendations for the assessment and treatment of patients with suicidal behaviors. Section Isummarizes the key recommendations of the guideline and codes each recommendation ac-cording to the degree of clinical confidence with which the recommendation is made. SectionII discusses the assessment of the patient, including a consideration of factors influencing sui-cide risk. Section III discusses psychiatric management, Section IV discusses specific treatmentmodalities, and Section V addresses documentation and risk management issues. Part B, \"Background Information and Review of Available Evidence,\" and Part C, \"Future Research Needs,\" are not included in the American Journal of Psychiatry supplement but are pro- vided with Part A in the complete guideline, which is available in print format from AmericanPsychiatric Publishing, Inc., and online through the American Psychiatric Association (http://www.psych.org). Part B provides an overview of suicide, including general information on itsnatural history, course, and epidemiology. It also provides a structured review and synthesis ofthe evidence that underlies the recommendations made in Part A. Part C draws from the pre-vious sections and summarizes areas for which more research data are needed to guide clinicaldecisions.

The development process is detailed in the document \"APA Guideline Devel-opment Process,\" which is available from the APA Department of Quality Improvement andPsychiatric Services. Key features of this process include the following: \u007f A comprehensive literature review\u007f Development of evidence tables\u007f Initial drafting of the guideline by a work group that included psychiatrists with clinical and research expertise in suicide and suicidality \u007f Production of multiple revised drafts with widespread review; six organizations and more than 60 individuals submitted significant comments \u007f Approval by the APA Assembly and Board of T rustees\u007f Planned revisions at regular intervals Relevant literature was identified through a computerized search of PubMed for the periodfrom 1966 to 2002. Keywords 34,851 citations were found. After limiting thesereferences to literature published in English that included abstracts, 17,589 articles were screenedby using title and abstract information. Additional, less formal literature searches were con-ducted by APA staff and individual members of the work group on suicidal behaviors throughthe use of PubMed, PsycINFO, and Social Sciences Citation Index. Sources of funding werenot considered when reviewing the literature. This document represents a synthesis of current scientific knowledge and rational clinical practice on the assessment and treatment of adult patients with suicidal behaviors. It strives tobe as free as possible of bias toward any theoretical approach to treatment. In order for the readerto appreciate the evidence base behind the guideline recommendations and the weight thatshould be given to each recommendation, the summary of treatment recommendations is keyedaccording to the level of confidence with which each recommendation is made. Each rating ofclinical confidence considers the strength of the available evidence and is based on the best avail-able data. When evidence is limited, the level of confidence also incorporates clinical consensuswith regard to a particular clinical decision. In the listing of cited references, each reference isfollowed by a letter code in brackets that indicates the nature of the supporting evidence. Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS /L50776 A. DEFINITIONS AND GENERAL PRINCIPLES 1. Coding system Each recommendation is identified as falling into one of three categories of endorsement, in- dicated by a bracketed Roman numeral following the statement. The three categories representvarying levels of clinical confidence regarding the recommendation: [I] Recommended with substantial clinical confidence. [II] Recommended with moderate clinical confidence.[III] May be recommended on the basis of individual circumstances. 2. Definitions of terms In this guideline, the following terms will be used: \u007f Suicide\u2014self-inflicted death with evidence (either explicit or implicit) that the person intended to die. \u007f Suicide attempt\u2014self-injurious behavior with a nonfatal outcome accompanied by evidence (either explicit or implicit) that the person intended to die. \u007f Aborted suicide attempt\u2014potentially self-injurious behavior with evidence (either ex- plicit or implicit) that the person intended to die but stopped the attempt before physicaldamage occurred. \u007f Suicidal ideation\u2014thoughts of serving as the agent of one's own death. Suicidal ideation may vary in seriousness depending on the specificity of suicide plans and the degree ofsuicidal intent. \u007f Suicidal intent\u2014subjective expectation and desire for a self-destructive act to end in death. \u007f Lethality of suicidal behavior\u2014objective danger to life associated with a suicide method or action. Note that lethality is distinct from and may not always coincide with anindividual's expectation of what is medically dangerous. \u007f Deliberate self-harm\u2014willful self-inflicting of painful, destructive, or injurious acts without intent to die. A detailed exposition of definitions relating to suicide has been provided by O'Carroll et al. (1). Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

SUICIDE ASSESSMENT The psychiatric evaluation is the essential element of the suicide assessment process [I]. During the evaluation, the psychiatrist obtains information about the patient's psychiatric and othermedical history and current mental state (e.g., through direct questioning and observationabout suicidal thinking and behavior as well as through collateral history, if indicated). Thisinformation enables the psychiatrist to 1) identify specific factors and features that may gener-ally increase or decrease risk for suicide or other suicidal behaviors and that may serve as mod-ifiable targets for both acute and ongoing interventions, 2) address the patient's immediatesafety and determine the most appropriate setting for treatment, and 3) develop a multiaxialdifferential diagnosis to further guide planning of treatment. The breadth and depth of the psy-chiatric evaluation aimed specifically at assessing suicide risk will vary with setting; ability orwillingness of the patient to provide information; and availability of information from previouscontacts with the patient or from other sources, including other mental health professionals,medical records, and family members. Although suicide assessment scales have been developedfor research purposes, they lack the predictive validity necessary for use in routine clinical prac-tice. Therefore, suicide assessment scales may be used as aids to suicide assessment but shouldnot be used as predictive instruments or as substitutes for a thorough clinical evaluation [I]. Table 1 presents important domains of a suicide assessment, including the patient's current presentation, individual strengths and weaknesses, history, and psychosocial situation. Infor-mation may come from the patient directly or from other sources, including family members,friends, and others in the patient's support network, such as community residence staff ormembers of the patient's military command. Such individuals may be able to provide informa-tion about the patient's current mental state, activities, and psychosocial crises and may alsohave observed behavior or been privy to communications from the patient that suggest suicidalideation, plans, or intentions. Contact with such individuals may also provide opportunity forthe psychiatrist to attempt to fortify the patient's social support network. This goal often canbe accomplished without the psychiatrist's revealing private or confidential information aboutthe patient. In clinical circumstances in which sharing information is important to maintainthe safety of the patient or others, it is permissible and even critical to share such informationwithout the patient's consent [I]. It is important to recognize that in many clinical situations not all of the information de- scribed in this section may be possible to obtain. It may be necessary to focus initially on thoseelements judged to be most relevant and to continue the evaluation during subsequent contactswith the patient. When communicating with the patient, it is important to remember that simply asking about suicidal ideation does not ensure that accurate or complete information will be received.Cultural or religious beliefs about death or suicide, for example, may influence a patient's will-ingness to speak about suicide during the assessment process as well as the patient's likelihoodof acting on suicidal ideas. Consequently, the psychiatrist may wish to explore the patient's cul-tural and religious beliefs, particularly as they relate to death and to suicide [II]. It is important for the psychiatrist to focus on the nature, frequency, depth, timing, and per- sistence of suicidal ideation [I]. If ideation is present, request more detail about the presence orabsence of specific plans for suicide, including any steps taken to enact plans or prepare fordeath [I]. If other aspects of the clinical presentation seem inconsistent with an initial denial ofsuicidal thoughts, additional questioning of the patient may be indicated [II]. Where there is a history of suicide attempts, aborted attempts, or other self-harming behav- ior, it is important to obtain as much detail as possible about the timing, intent, method, andconsequences of such behaviors [I]. It is also useful to determine the life context in which theyoccurred and whether they occurred in association with intoxication or chronic use of alcoholor other substances [II]. For individuals in previous or current psychiatric treatment, it is help-ful to determine the strength and stability of the therapeutic relationship(s) [II].

In general, thepsychiatrist should assign a higher level of risk to patients who have high degrees of suicidalintent or describe more detailed and specific suicide plans, particularly those involving violentand irreversible methods [I]. If the patient has access to a firearm, the psychiatrist is advised todiscuss with and recommend to the patient or a significant other the importance of restrictingaccess to, securing, or removing this and other weapons [I]. Documenting the suicide assessment is essential [I]. Typically, suicide assessment and its documentation occur after an initial evaluation or, for patients in ongoing treatment, when sui-cidal ideation or behaviors emerge or when there is significant worsening or dramatic and un-anticipated improvement in the patient's condition. For inpatients, reevaluation also typicallyoccurs with changes in the level of precautions or observations, when passes are issued, and dur-TABLE 1.

As with the level of detail of the suicide assessment, the extent of documentation at each of these times varies with the clinical circumstances. Communicationswith other caregivers and with the family or significant others should also be documented [I].When the patient or others have been given specific instructions about firearms or other weap-ons, this communication should also be noted in the record [I]. /L50776 C. ESTIMATION OF SUICIDE RISK Suicide and suicidal behaviors cause severe personal, social, and economic consequences. Despitethe severity of these consequences, suicide and suicidal behaviors are statistically rare, even in pop-ulations at risk. For example, although suicidal ideation and attempts are associated with increasedsuicide risk, most individuals with suicidal thoughts or attempts will never die by suicide. It is es-timated that attempts and ideation occur in approximately 0.7% and 5.6% of the general U.S.population per year, respectively (2). In comparison, in the United States, the annual incidence ofsuicide in the general population is approximately 10.7 suicides for every 100,000 persons, or0.0107% of the total population per year (3). This rarity of suicide, even in groups known to be athigher risk than the general population, contributes to the impossibility of predicting suicide. The statistical rarity of suicide also makes it impossible to predict on the basis of risk factors either alone or in combination. For the psychiatrist, knowing that a particular factor (e.g., ma-jor depressive disorder, hopelessness, substance use) increases a patient's relative risk for suicidemay affect the treatment plan, including determination of a treatment setting. At the sametime, knowledge of risk factors will not permit the psychiatrist to predict when or if a specificpatient will die by suicide. This does not mean that the psychiatrist should ignore risk factorsor view suicidal patients as untreatable. On the contrary, an initial goal of the psychiatristshould be to estimate the patient's risk through knowledgeable assessment of risk and protectivefactors, with a primary and ongoing goal of reducing suicide risk [I]. Some factors may increase or decrease risk for suicide; others may be more relevant to risk for suicide attempts or other self-injurious behaviors, which are in turn associated with potentialmorbidity as well as increased suicide risk. In weighing risk and protective factors for an indi-vidual patient, consideration may be given to 1) the presence of psychiatric illness; 2) specificpsychiatric symptoms such as hopelessness, anxiety, agitation, or intense suicidal ideation;3) unique circumstances such as psychosocial stressors and availability of methods; and 4) otherrelevant clinical factors such as genetics and medical, psychological, or psychodynamic issues [I]. It is important to recognize that many of these factors are not simply present or absent but instead may vary in severity. Others, such as psychological or psychodynamic issues, may con-tribute to risk in some individuals but not in others or may be relevant only when they occurin combination with particular psychosocial stressors. Once factors are identified, the psychiatrist can determine if they are modifiable. Past his- tory, family history, and demographic characteristics are examples of nonmodifiable factors. Fi-nancial difficulties or unemployment can also be difficult to modify, at least in the short term.While immutable factors are important to identify, they cannot be the focus of intervention.Rather, to decrease a patient's suicide risk, the treatment should attempt to mitigate or strengthenthose risk and protective factors that can be modified [I]. For example, the psychiatrist may at-tend to patient safety, address associated psychological or social problems and stressors, aug-ment social support networks, and treat associated psychiatric disorders (such as mooddisorders, psychotic disorders, substance use disorders, and personality disorders) or symptoms(such as severe anxiety, agitation, or insomnia). /L50776 D. PSYCHIATRIC MANAGEMENT Psychiatric management consists of a broad array of therapeutic interventions that should beinstituted for patients with suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors [I]. Psychiatric management Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

For permission for reuse, visit APPI Permissions & Licensing Center at http://www.appi.org/CustomerService/Pages/Permissions.aspx.Assessment and Treatment of Patients With Suicidal Behaviors 13includes determining a setting for treatment and supervision, attending to patient safety, and working to establish a cooperative and collaborative physician-patient relationship. For pa-tients in ongoing treatment, psychiatric management also includes establishing and maintain-ing a therapeutic alliance; coordinating treatment provided by multiple clinicians; monitoringthe patient's progress and response to the treatment plan; and conducting ongoing assessmentsof the patient's safety, psychiatric status, and level of functioning. Additionally, psychiatricmanagement may include encouraging treatment adherence and providing education to thepatient and, when indicated, family members and significant others. Patients with suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors should generally be treated in the setting that is least restrictive yet most likely to be safe and effective [I]. T reatment settings and condi-tions include a continuum of possible levels of care, from involuntary inpatient hospitalizationthrough partial hospital and intensive outpatient programs to occasional ambulatory visits.Choice of specific treatment setting depends not only on the psychiatrist's estimate of the pa-tient's current suicide risk and potential for dangerousness to others, but also on other aspectsof the patient's current status, including 1) medical and psychiatric comorbidity; 2) strengthand availability of a psychosocial support network; and 3) ability to provide adequate self-care,give reliable feedback to the psychiatrist, and cooperate with treatment. In addition, the bene-fits of intensive interventions such as hospitalization must be weighed against their possiblenegative effects (e.g., disruption of employment, financial and other psychosocial stress, socialstigma). For some individuals, self-injurious behaviors may occur on a recurring or even chronic ba- sis. Although such behaviors may occur without evidence of suicidal intent, this may not alwaysbe the case. Even when individuals have had repeated contacts with the health care system, eachact should be reassessed in the context of the current situation [I]. In treating suicidal patients, particularly those with severe or recurring suicidality or self- injurious behavior, the psychiatrist should be aware of his or her own emotions and reactions thatmay interfere with the patient's care [I]. For difficult-to-treat patients, consultation or supervisionfrom a colleague may help in affirming the appropriateness of the treatment plan, suggestingalternative therapeutic approaches, or monitoring and dealing with countertransference issues [I]. The suicide prevention contract, or \"no-harm contract,\" is commonly used in clinical prac- tice but should not be considered as a substitute for a careful clinical assessment [I]. A patient'swillingness (or reluctance) to enter into an oral or a written suicide prevention contract shouldnot be viewed as an absolute indicator of suitability for discharge (or hospitalization) [I]. In ad-dition, such contracts are not recommended for use with patients who are agitated, psychotic,impulsive, or under the influence of an intoxicating substance [II]. Furthermore, since suicideprevention contracts are dependent on an established physician-patient relationship, they arenot recommended for use in emergency settings or with newly admitted or unknown inpa-tients [II]. Despite best efforts at suicide assessment and treatment, suicides can and do occur in clin- ical practice. In fact, significant proportions of individuals who die by suicide have seen a phy-sician within several months of death and may have received specific mental health treatment.Death of a patient by suicide will often have a significant effect on the treating psychiatrist andmay result in increased stress and loss of professional self-esteem. When the suicide of a patientoccurs, the psychiatrist may find it helpful to seek support from colleagues and obtain consul-tation or supervision to enable him or her to continue to treat other patients effectively andrespond to the inquiries or mental health needs of survivors [II]. Consultation with an attorneyor a risk manager may also be useful [II]. The psychiatrist should be aware that patient confi-dentiality extends beyond the patient's death and that the usual provisions relating to medicalrecords still apply. Any additional documentation included in the medical record after the pa-tient's death should be dated contemporaneously, not backdated, and previous entries shouldnot be altered [I]. Depending on the circumstances, conversations with family members may Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

In the aftermath of a loved one's suicide, family members themselves are more vulnerable to physical and psychological disorders and should be helpedto obtain psychiatric intervention, although not necessarily by the same psychiatrist who treat-ed the individual who died by suicide [II]. /L50776 E. SPECIFIC TREATMENT MODALITIES In developing a plan of treatment that addresses suicidal thoughts or behaviors, the psychiatristshould consider the potential benefits of somatic therapies as well as the potential benefits ofpsychosocial interventions, including the psychotherapies [I]. Clinical experience indicates thatmany patients with suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors will benefit most from a combinationof these treatments [II]. The psychiatrist should address the modifiable risk factors identifiedin the initial psychiatric evaluation and make ongoing assessments during the course of treat-ment [I]. In general, therapeutic approaches should target specific axis I and axis II psychiatricdisorders; specific associated symptoms such as depression, agitation, anxiety, or insomnia; orthe predominant psychodynamic or psychosocial stressor [I]. While the goal of pharmacologictreatment may be acute symptom relief, including acute relief of suicidality or acute treatmentof a specific diagnosis, the treatment goals of psychosocial interventions may be broader andlonger term, including achieving improvements in interpersonal relationships, coping skills,psychosocial functioning, and management of affects. Since treatment should be a collabora-tive process between the patient and clinician(s), the patient's preferences are important to con-sider when developing an individual treatment plan [I]. 1. Somatic interventions Evidence for a lowering of suicide rates with antidepressant treatment is inconclusive. However,the documented efficacy of antidepressants in treating acute depressive episodes and their long-term benefit in patients with recurrent forms of severe anxiety or depressive disorders supporttheir use in individuals with these disorders who are experiencing suicidal thoughts or behav-iors [II]. It is advisable to select an antidepressant with a low risk of lethality on acute overdose,such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or other newer antidepressant, and toprescribe conservative quantities, especially for patients who are not well-known [I]. For pa-tients with prominent insomnia, a sedating antidepressant or an adjunctive hypnotic agent canbe considered [II]. Since antidepressant effects may not be observed for days to weeks aftertreatment has started, patients should be monitored closely early in treatment and educatedabout this probable delay in symptom relief [I]. T o treat symptoms such as severe insomnia, agitation, panic attacks, or psychic anxiety, ben- zodiazepines may be indicated on a short-term basis [II], with long-acting agents often beingpreferred over short-acting agents [II]. The benefits of benzodiazepine treatment should beweighed against their occasional tendency to produce disinhibition and their potential for in-teractions with other sedatives, including alcohol [I]. Alternatively, other medications that maybe used for their calming effects in highly anxious and agitated patients include trazodone, lowdoses of some second-generation antipsychotics, gabapentinor divalproex [III]. If benzodiazepines are being discontinued after prolonged use, their dosesshould be reduced gradually and the patient monitored for increasing symptoms of anxiety, ag-itation, depression, or suicidality [II]. There is strong evidence that long-term maintenance treatment with lithium salts is associ- ated with major reductions in the risk of both suicide and suicide attempts in patients with bi-polar disorder, and there is moderate evidence for similar risk reductions in patients withrecurrent major depressive disorder [I]. Specific anticonvulsants have been shown to be effica-cious in treating episodes of mania (i.e., divalproex) or bipolar depression (i.e., lamotrigine), Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Con- sequently, when deciding between lithium and other first-line agents for treatment of patientswith bipolar disorder, the efficacy of lithium in decreasing suicidal behavior should be takeninto consideration when weighing the benefits and risks of treatment with each medication. Inaddition, if lithium is prescribed, the potential toxicity of lithium in overdose should be takeninto consideration when deciding on the quantity of lithium to give with each prescription [I]. Clozapine treatment is associated with significant decreases in rates of suicide attempts and perhaps suicide for individuals with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Thus, clozapinetreatment should be given serious consideration for psychotic patients with frequent suicidal ide-ation, attempts, or both [I]. However, the benefits of clozapine treatment need to be weighedagainst the risk of adverse effects, including potentially fatal agranulocytosis and myocarditis,which has generally led clozapine to be reserved for use when psychotic symptoms have not re-sponded to other antipsychotic medications. If treatment is indicated with an antipsychotic first-generation antipsychotic agents [I]. ECT has established efficacy in patients with severe depressive illness, with or without psy- chotic features. Since ECT is associated with a rapid and robust antidepressant response as wellas a rapid diminution in associated suicidal thoughts, ECT may be recommended as a treatmentfor severe episodes of major depression that are accompanied by suicidal thoughts or behaviors[I]. Under certain clinical circumstances, ECT may also be used to treat suicidal patients withschizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or mixed or manic episodes of bipolar disorder [II]. Re-gardless of diagnosis, ECT is especially indicated for patients with catatonic features or forwhom a delay in treatment response is considered life threatening [I]. ECT may also be indi-cated for suicidal individuals during pregnancy and for those who have already failed to tolerateor respond to trials of medication [II]. Since there is no evidence of a long-term reduction ofsuicide risk with ECT, continuation or maintenance treatment with pharmacotherapy or withECT is recommended after an acute ECT course [I]. 2. Psychosocial interventions Psychotherapies and other psychosocial interventions play an important role in the treatmentof individuals with suicidal thoughts and behaviors [II]. A substantial body of evidence sup-ports the efficacy of psychotherapy in the treatment of specific disorders, such as nonpsychoticmajor depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder, which are associated with in-creased suicide risk. For example, interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitive behavior therapyhave been found to be effective in clinical trials for the treatment of depression. Therefore, psy-chotherapies such as interpersonal psychotherapy and cognitive behavior therapy may be con-sidered appropriate treatments for suicidal behavior, particularly when it occurs in the contextof depression [II]. In addition, cognitive behavior therapy may be used to decrease two impor-tant risk factors for suicide: hopelessness [II] and suicide attempts in depressed outpatients[III]. For patients with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, psychodynamic therapyand dialectical behavior therapy may be appropriate treatments for suicidal behaviors [II], be-cause modest evidence has shown these therapies to be associated with decreased self-injuriousbehaviors, including suicide attempts. Although not targeted specifically to suicide or suicidalbehaviors, other psychosocial treatments may also be helpful in reducing symptoms and im-proving functioning in individuals with psychotic disorders and in treating alcohol and othersubstance use disorders that are themselves associated with increased rates of suicide and sui-cidal behaviors [II]. For patients who have attempted suicide or engaged in self-harming be-haviors without suicidal intent, specific psychosocial interventions such as rapid intervention;follow-up outreach; problem-solving therapy; brief psychological treatment; or family, couples,or group therapies may be useful despite limited evidence for their efficacy [III].

ASSESSMENT OF PATIENTS WITH SUICIDAL BEHAVIORS /L50776 A. OVERVIEW The assessment of the suicidal patient is an ongoing process that comprises many interconnected elements (Table 1). In addition, there are a number of points during patients' evaluation andtreatment at which a suicide assessment may be indicated (Table 2). The ability of the psychiatrist to connect with the patient, establish rapport, and demon- strate empathy is an important ingredient of the assessment process. For suicidal patients whoare followed on an ongoing basis, the doctor-patient relationship will provide the base fromwhich risk and protective factors continue to be identified and from which therapeutic inter-ventions, such as psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies, are offered. At the core of the suicide assessment, the psychiatric evaluation will provide information about the patient's history, current circumstances, and mental state and will include directquestioning about suicidal thinking and behaviors. This evaluation, in turn, will enable thepsychiatrist to identify specific factors and features that may increase or decrease the potentialrisk for suicide or other suicidal behaviors. These factors and features may include developmen-tal, biomedical, psychopathologic, psychodynamic, and psychosocial aspects of the patient'scurrent presentation and history, all of which may serve as modifiable targets for both acuteand ongoing interventions. Such information will also be important in addressing the patient'simmediate safety, determining the most appropriate setting for treatment, and developing amultiaxial differential diagnosis that will further guide the planning of treatment. Although the approach to the suicidal patient is common to all individuals regardless of di- agnosis or clinical presentation, the breadth and depth of the psychiatric evaluation will varywith the setting of the assessment; the ability or willingness of the patient to provide informa-tion; and the availability of information from previous contacts with the patient or from othersources, including other mental health professionals, medical records, and family members.Since the approach to assessment does vary to some degree in the assessment of suicidal chil-dren and adolescents, the psychiatrist who evaluates youths may wish to review the AmericanAcademy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry's Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treat- ment of Children and Adolescents With Suicidal Behavior (4). In some circumstances, the urgency of the situation or the presence of substance intoxication may necessitate making a decision tofacilitate patient safety (e.g., instituting hospitalization or one-to-one observation) before all rel-TABLE 2.

Furthermore, when working with a team of other profes- sionals, the psychiatrist may not obtain all information him- or herself but will need to provideleadership for the assessment process so that necessary information is obtained and integratedinto a final assessment. Since the patient may minimize the severity or even the existence of hisor her difficulties, other individuals may be valuable resources for the psychiatrist in providinginformation about the patient's current mental state, activities, and psychosocial crises. Suchindividuals may include the patient's family members and friends but may also include otherphysicians, other medical or mental health professionals, teachers or other school personnel,members of the patient's military command, and staff from supervised housing programs orother settings where the patient resides. /L50776 B. CONDUCT A THOROUGH PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION The psychiatric evaluation is the core element of the suicide risk assessment. This section pro-vides an overview of the key aspects of the psychiatric evaluation as they relate to the assessmentof patients with suicidal behaviors. Although the factors that are associated with an increasedor decreased risk of suicide differ from the factors associated with an increased or decreased riskof suicide attempts, it is important to identify factors modulating the risk of any suicidal be-haviors. Additional details on specific risk factors that should be identified during the assess-ment are discussed in Sections II.E, \"Estimate Suicide Risk,\" and III.H, \"Reassess Safety andSuicide Risk.\" For further discussion of other aspects of the psychiatric evaluation, the psychi-atrist is referred to the American Psychiatric Association's Practice Guideline for Psychiatric Eval- uation of Adults (5). Additional information on details of the suicide assessment process is reviewed elsewhere (6, 7). 1. Identify specific psychiatric signs and symptoms It is important to identify specific psychiatric signs and symptoms that are correlated with anincreased risk of suicide or other suicidal behaviors. Symptoms that have been associated withsuicide attempts or with suicide include aggression, violence toward others, impulsiveness,hopelessness, and agitation. Psychic anxiety, which has been defined as subjective feelings ofanxiety, fearfulness, or apprehension whether or not focused on specific concerns, has also beenassociated with an increased risk of suicide, as have anhedonia, global insomnia, and panic at-tacks. In addition, identifying other psychiatric signs and symptoms (e.g., psychosis, depres-sion) will aid in determining whether the patient has a psychiatric syndrome that should alsobe a focus of treatment. 2. Assess past suicidal behavior, including intent of self-injurious acts A history of past suicide attempts is one of the most significant risk factors for suicide, and thisrisk may be increased by more serious, more frequent, or more recent attempts. Therefore, it isimportant for the psychiatrist to inquire about past suicide attempts and self-destructive behav-iors, including specific questioning about aborted suicide attempts. Examples of the latterwould include putting a gun to one's head but not firing it, driving to a bridge but not jumping,or creating a noose but not using it. For each attempt or aborted attempt, the psychiatristshould try to obtain details about the precipitants, timing, intent, and consequences as well asthe attempt's medical severity. The patient's consumption of alcohol and drugs before the at-tempt should also be ascertained, since intoxication can facilitate impulsive suicide attemptsbut can also be a component of a more serious suicide plan. In understanding the issues thatculminated in the suicide attempt, interpersonal aspects of the attempt should also be delineated.Examples might include the dynamic or interpersonal issues leading up to the attempt, signif-icant persons present at the time of the attempt, persons to whom the attempt was communi-cated, and how the attempt was averted. It is also important to determine the patient's thoughts Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

It is also helpful to inquire about past risk-taking behaviorssuch as unsafe sexual practices and reckless driving. 3. Review past treatment history and treatment relationships A review of the patient's treatment history is another crucial element of the suicide risk assess-ment. A thorough treatment history can serve as a systematic method for gaining informationon comorbid diagnoses, prior hospitalizations, suicidal ideation, or previous suicide attempts.Obtaining a history of medical treatment can help in identifying medically serious suicide at-tempts as well as in identifying past or current medical diagnoses that may be associated withaugmented suicide risk. Many patients who are being assessed for suicidality will already be in treatment, either with other psychiatrists or mental health professionals or with primary care physicians or medicalspecialists. Contacts with such caregivers can provide a great deal of relevant information andhelp in determining a setting and/or plan for treatment. With patients who are currently intreatment, it is also important to gauge the strength and stability of the therapeutic relation-ships, because a positive therapeutic alliance has been suggested to be protective against suicidalbehaviors. On the other hand, a patient with a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation who doesnot have a reliable therapeutic alliance may represent an increased risk for suicide, which wouldneed to be addressed accordingly. 4. Identify family history of suicide, mental illness, and dysfunction Identifying family history is particularly important during the psychiatric evaluation. The psy-chiatrist should specifically inquire about the presence of suicide and suicide attempts as wellas a family history of any psychiatric hospitalizations or mental illness, including substance usedisorders. When suicides have occurred in first-degree relatives, it is often helpful to learn moreabout the circumstances, including the patient's involvement and the patient's and relative'sages at the time of the suicide. The patient's childhood and current family milieu are also relevant, since many aspects of family dysfunction may be linked to self-destructive behaviors. Such factors include a historyof family conflict or separation, parental legal trouble, family substance use, domestic violence,and physical and/or sexual abuse. 5. Identify current psychosocial situation and nature of crisis An assessment of the patient's current psychosocial situation is important to detect acute psy-chosocial crises or chronic psychosocial stressors that may augment suicide risk (e.g., financialor legal difficulties; interpersonal conflicts or losses; stressors in gay, lesbian, or bisexual youths;housing problems; job loss; educational failure). Other significant precipitants may includeperceived losses or recent or impending humiliation. An understanding of the patient's psycho-social situation is also essential in helping the patient to mobilize external supports, which canhave a protective influence on suicide risk. 6. Appreciate psychological strengths and vulnerabilities of the individual patient In estimating suicide risk and formulating a treatment plan, the clinician needs to appreciatethe strengths and vulnerabilities of the individual patient. Particular strengths and vulnerabil-ities may include such factors as coping skills, personality traits, thinking style, and develop-mental and psychological needs. For example, in addition to serving as state-dependentsymptoms, hopelessness, aggression, and impulsivity may also constitute traits, greater degreesof which may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal behaviors.

Perfectionism with excessively high self-expectation is another factor that has beennoted in clinical practice to be a possible contributor to suicide risk. In weighing the strengthsand vulnerabilities of the individual patient, it is also helpful to determine the patient's tenden-cy to engage in risk-taking behaviors as well as the patient's past responses to stress, includingthe capacity for reality testing and the ability to tolerate rejection, subjective loneliness, or psy-chological pain when his or her unique psychological needs are not met. /L50776 C. SPECIFICALLY INQUIRE ABOUT SUICIDAL THOUGHTS, PLANS, AND BEHAVIORS In general, the more an individual has thought about suicide, has made specific plans for suicide,and intends to act on those plans, the greater will be his or her risk. Thus, as part of the suicideassessment it is essential to inquire specifically about the patient's suicidal thoughts, plans, be-haviors, and intent. Although such questions will often flow naturally from discussion of the pa-tient's current situation, this will not invariably be true. The exact wording of questions and theextent of questioning will also differ with the clinical situation. Examples of issues that the psy-chiatrist may wish to address in this portion of the suicide assessment are given in T able 3. 1. Elicit the presence or absence of suicidal ideation Inquiring about suicidal ideation is an essential component of the suicide assessment. Althoughsome fear that raising the topic of suicide will \"plant\" the issue in the patient's mind, this is notthe case. In fact, broaching the issue of suicidal ideation may be a relief for the suicidal patientby opening an avenue for discussion and giving him or her an opportunity to feel understood. In asking about suicidal ideas, it is often helpful to begin with questions that address the patient's feelings about living, such as, \"How does life seem to you at this point?\" or \"Have youever felt that life was not worth living?\" or \"Did you ever wish you could go to sleep and justnot wake up?\" If the patient's response reflects dissatisfaction with life or a desire to escape it,this response can lead naturally into more specific questions about whether the patient has hadthoughts of death or suicide. When such thoughts are elicited, it is important to focus on thenature, frequency, extent, and timing of them and to understand the interpersonal, situational,and symptomatic context in which they are occurring. Even if the patient initially denies thoughts of death or suicide, the psychiatrist should con- sider asking additional questions. Examples might include asking about plans for the future orabout recent acts or thoughts of self-harm. Regardless of the approach to the interview, not allindividuals will report having suicidal ideas even when such thoughts are present. Thus, de-pending on the clinical circumstances, it may be important for the psychiatrist to speak withfamily members or friends to determine whether they have observed behavior (e.g., recent pur-chase of a gun) or have been privy to thoughts that suggest suicidal ideation (see Section V .C,\"Communication With Significant Others\"). In addition, patients who are initially inter-viewed when they are intoxicated with alcohol or other substances should be reassessed for sui-cidality once the intoxication has resolved. 2. Elicit the presence or absence of a suicide plan If suicidal ideation is present, the psychiatrist will next probe for more detailed informationabout specific plans for suicide and any steps that have been taken toward enacting those plans.Although some suicidal acts can occur impulsively with little or no planning, more detailedplans are generally associated with a greater suicide risk. Violent and irreversible methods, suchas firearms, jumping, and motor vehicle accidents, require particular attention. However, thepatient's belief about the lethality of the method may be as important as the actual lethality ofthe method itself. Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Questions That May Be Helpful in Inquiring About Specific Aspects of Suicidal Thoughts, Plans, and Behaviors Begin with questions that address the patient's feelings about living \u007f Have you ever felt that life was not worth living? \u007f Did you ever wish you could go to sleep and just not wake up? Follow up with specific questions that ask about thoughts of death, self-harm, or suicide \u007f Is death something you've thought about recently?\u007f Have things ever reached the point that you've thought of harming yourself? For individuals who have thoughts of self-harm or suicide \u007f When did you first notice such thoughts?\u007f What led up to the thoughts (e.g., interpersonal and psychosocial precipitants, including real or imagined losses; specific sy mptoms such as mood changes, anhedonia, hopelessness, anxiety, agitation, psychosis)? \u007f How often have those thoughts occurred (including frequency, obsessional quality, controllability)?\u007f How close have you come to acting on those thoughts?\u007f How likely do you think it is that you will act on them in the future?\u007f Have you ever started to harm (or kill) yourself but stopped before doing something (e.g., holding knife or gun to your body but stopping before acting, going to edge of bridge but not jumping)? \u007f What do you envision happening if you actually killed yourself (e.g., escape, reunion with significant other, rebirth, reactio ns of others)? \u007f Have you made a specific plan to harm or kill yourself?

Additional questions can be asked in general terms or can refer to the specific method used and may include: \u007f Can you describe what happened (e.g., circumstances, precipitants, view of future, use of alcohol or other substances, method, intent, seriousness of injury)? \u007f What thoughts were you having beforehand that led up to the attempt? \u007f What did you think would happen (e.g., going to sleep versus injury versus dying, getting a reaction out of a particular perso n)? \u007f Were other people present at the time?\u007f Did you seek help afterward yourself, or did someone get help for you?\u007f Had you planned to be discovered, or were you found accidentally? \u007f How did you feel afterward (e.g., relief versus regret at being alive)? \u007f Did you receive treatment afterward (e.g., medical versus psychiatric, emergency department versus inpatient versus outpatient )? \u007f Has your view of things changed, or is anything different for you since the attempt?\u007f Are there other times in the past when you've tried to harm (or kill) yourself? For individuals with repeated suicidal thoughts or attempts \u007f About how often have you tried to harm (or kill) yourself?\u007f When was the most recent time? \u007f Can you describe your thoughts at the time that you were thinking most seriously about suicide? \u007f When was your most serious attempt at harming or killing yourself?\u007f What led up to it, and what happened afterward? For individuals with psychosis, ask specifically about hallucinations and delusions \u007f Can you describe the voices (e.g., single versus multiple, male versus female, internal versus external, recognizable versus n onrecognizable)? \u007f What do the voices say (e.g., positive remarks versus negative remarks versus threats)? (If the remarks are commands, determine if they are for harmless versus harmful acts; ask for examples)? \u007f How do you cope with (or respond to) the voices? \u007f Have you ever done what the voices ask you to do? (What led you to obey the voices? If you tried to resist them, what made it difficult?) \u007f Have there been times when the voices told you to hurt or kill yourself? (How often? What happened?) \u007f Are you worried about having a serious illness or that your body is rotting?\u007f Are you concerned about your financial situation even when others tell you there's nothing to worry about?\u007f Are there things that you've been feeling guilty about or blaming yourself for?TABLE 3.

If thepatient reports that he or she is unlikely to act on the suicidal thoughts, the psychiatrist shoulddetermine what factors are contributing to that expectation, as such questioning can identifyprotective factors. Whether or not a plan is present, if a patient has acknowledged suicidal ideation, there should be a specific inquiry about the presence or absence of a firearm in the home or workplace. It isalso helpful to ask whether there have been recent changes in access to firearms or other weapons,including recent purchases or altered arrangements for storage. If the patient has access to a fire-arm, the psychiatrist is advised to discuss with and recommend to the patient or a significantother the importance of restricting access to, securing, or removing this and other weapons. Suchdiscussions should be documented in the medical record, including any instructions that havebeen given to the patient and significant others about firearms or other weapons. 3. Assess the degree of suicidality, including suicidal intent and lethality of plan Regardless of whether the patient has developed a suicide plan, the patient's level of suicidalintent should be explored. Suicidal intent reflects the intensity of a patient's wish to die and canbe assessed by determining the patient's motivation for suicide as well as the seriousness andextent of his or her aim to die, including any associated behaviors or planning for suicide. Ifthe patient has developed a suicide plan, it is important to assess its lethality. The lethality ofthe plan can be ascertained through questions about the method, the patient's knowledge andskill concerning its use, and the absence of intervening persons or protective circumstances. Ingeneral, the greater and clearer the intent, the higher the risk for suicide will be. Thus, even apatient with a low-lethality suicide plan or attempt may be at high risk in the future if inten-tions are strong and the patient believes that the chosen method will be fatal. At the same time,a patient with low suicidal intent may still die from suicide by erroneously believing that a par-ticular method is not lethal. 4. Understand the relevance and limitations of suicide assessment scales Although a number of suicide assessment scales have been developed for use in research and aredescribed more fully in Part B of the guideline, their clinical utility is limited. Self-report ratingscales may sometimes assist in opening communication with the patient about particular feel-ings or experiences. In addition, the content of suicide rating scales, such as the Scale for SuicideIdeation (8) and the Suicide Intent Scale (9), may be helpful to psychiatrists in developing athorough line of questioning about suicide and suicidal behaviors. However, existing suicide as-sessment scales suffer from high false positive and false negative rates and have very low positivepredictive values (10). As a result, such rating scales cannot substitute for thoughtful and clini-cally appropriate evaluation and are not recommended for clinical estimations of suicide risk. /L50776 D. ESTABLISH A MULTIAXIAL DIAGNOSIS In conceptualizing suicide risk, it is important for the psychiatrist to develop a multiaxial dif-ferential diagnosis over the course of the psychiatric evaluation. Studies have shown that morethan 90% of individuals who die by suicide satisfy the criteria for one or more psychiatric dis-orders. Thus, the psychiatrist should determine whether a patient has a primary axis I or axisII diagnosis. Suicide and other suicidal behaviors are also more likely to occur in individualswith more than one psychiatric diagnosis. As a result, it is important to note other current orpast axis I or axis II diagnoses, including those that may currently be in remission. Identification of physical illness (axis III) is essential since such diagnoses may also be associ- ated with an increased risk of suicide as well as with an increased risk of other suicidal behaviors.

For permission for reuse, visit APPI Permissions & Licensing Center at http://www.appi.org/CustomerService/Pages/Permissions.aspx.24 APA Practice GuidelinesFor some individuals, this increase in risk may result from increased rates of comorbid psychiatric illness or from the direct physiological effects of physical illness or its treatment. Physical illnessesmay also be a source of social and/or psychological stress, which in turn may augment risk. Also crucial in determining suicide risk is the recognition of psychosocial stressors (axis IV), which may be either acute or chronic. Certain stressors, such as sudden unemployment, interper-sonal loss, social isolation, and dysfunctional relationships, can increase the likelihood of suicideattempts as well as increase the risk of suicide. At the same time, it is important to note thatlife events have different meanings for different individuals. Thus, in determining whether aparticular stressor may confer risk for suicidal behavior, it is necessary to consider the perceivedimportance and meaning of the life event for the individual patient. As the final component of the multiaxial diagnosis, the patient's baseline and current levels of functioning are important to assess (axis V). Also, the clinician should assess the relativechange in the patient's level of functioning and the patient's view of and feelings about his orher functioning. Although suicidal ideation and/or suicide attempts are reflected in the GlobalAssessment of Functioning (GAF) scoring recommendations, it should be noted that there isno agreed-on correlation between a GAF score and level of suicide risk. /L50776 E. ESTIMATE SUICIDE RISK The goal of the suicide risk assessment is to identify factors that may increase or decrease a pa-tient's level of suicide risk, to estimate an overall level of suicide risk, and to develop a treatmentplan that addresses patient safety and modifiable contributors to suicide risk. The assessmentis comprehensive in scope, integrating knowledge of the patient's specific risk factors; clinicalhistory, including psychopathological development; and interaction with the clinician. The es-timation of suicide risk, at the culmination of the suicide assessment, is the quintessentialclinical judgment, since no study has identified one specific risk factor or set of risk factors asspecifically predictive of suicide or other suicidal behavior. Table 4 provides a list of factors that have been associated with increased suicide risk, and Table 5 lists factors that have been associated with protective effects. While risk factors are typ-ically additive (i.e., the patient's level of risk increases with the number of risk factors), theymay also interact in a synergistic fashion. For example, the combined risk associated with co-morbid depression and physical illness may be greater than the sum of the risk associated witheach in isolation. At the same time, certain risk factors, such as a recent suicide attempt (espe-cially one of high lethality), access to a firearm, and the presence of a suicide note, should beconsidered serious in and of themselves, regardless of whether other risk factors are present. The effect on suicide risk of some risk factors, such as particular life events or psychological strengths and vulnerabilities, will vary on an individual basis. Risk factors must also be assessed incontext, as certain risk factors are more applicable to particular diagnostic groups, while others carrymore general risk. Finally, it should be kept in mind that, because of the low rate of suicide in thepopulation, only a small fraction of individuals with a particular risk factor will die from suicide. Risk factors for suicide attempts, which overlap with but are not identical to risk factors for suicide, will also be identified in the assessment process. These factors should also be addressedin the treatment planning process, since suicide attempts themselves are associated with mor-bidity in addition to the added risk that they confer for suicide. 1. Demographic factors In epidemiologic studies, a number of demographic factors have been associated with increasedrates of suicide. However, these demographic characteristics apply to a very broad populationof people and cannot be considered alone. Instead, such demographic parameters must be con-sidered within the context of other interacting factors that may influence individual risk. Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

In addition, age-related psychosocial stressors and fam-ily or developmental issues may influence suicide risk. The age of the patient can also be of rel-evance to psychiatric diagnosis, since specific disorders vary in their typical ages of onset. Between age 10 and 24 years, suicide rates in the general population of the United States rise sharply to approximately 13 per 100,000 in the 20- to 24-year-old age group before essen-tially plateauing through midlife. After age 70, rates again rise to a high of almost 20 per100,000 in those over age 80 (Figure 1). These overall figures can be misleading, however, sincethe age distribution of suicide rates varies as a function of gender as well as with race and eth-nicity.

Thus, in adolescence and young adulthood, the suicide rates of AfricanAmerican men are comparable with those of white men, although overall, African Americanmales are half as likely to die from suicide as white males. While suicide rates in many age groupshave remained relatively stable over the last 50 years, the rate among adolescents and youngadults has increased dramatically, and the rate among the elderly has decreased. Among the 14-to 25-year-old age group, suicide is now the third leading cause of death, with rates that aretriple those in the 1950s (12). Suicide rates are higher in older adults than at any other point in the life course. In 2000 in the United States there were approximately 5,300 suicides among individuals over age 65, a rateof 15.3 per 100,000. Whereas older adults made up 12.6% of the population, they accountedfor 18.1% of suicides. In addition, the high suicide rate in those over age 65 is largely a reflec-tion of the high suicide rate in white men, which reaches almost 60 per 100,000 by age 85.While rates in Asian men also increase after age 65 and rates in Asian women increase dramat-ically after age 80, the rate for all other women is generally flat in late life. Thoughts of death are also more common in older than in younger adults, but paradoxically, as people age they are less likely to endorse suicidal ideation per se (13). Attempted suicide is alsoless frequent among persons in later life than among younger age groups (14). Whereas the ratioof attempted suicides to suicides in adolescents may be as high as 200:1, there are as few as oneto four attempts for each suicide in later life (15). However, the self-destructive acts that do occurin older people are more lethal. This greater lethality is a function of several factors, including re-duced physical resilience (greater physical illness burden), greater social isolation (diminishedlikelihood of rescue), and a greater determination to die (15). Suicidal elders give fewer warningsto others of their plans, use more violent and potentially deadly methods, and apply those meth-ods with greater planning and resolve (15, 16). Therefore, compared with a suicide attempt in ayounger person, a suicide attempt in an older person confers a higher level of future suicide risk. b) Gender In virtually all countries that report suicide statistics to the World Health Organization, suiciderisk increases with age in both sexes, and rates for men in older adulthood are generally higherthan those for women (17). One exception is China, where the suicide rate of women is muchgreater than that of men (18). In the United States, death by suicide is more frequent in menthan in women, with the suicide rate in males approximately four times that in females (Figure 1).In the psychiatric population, these gender differences are also present but are less prominent.TABLE 5.

From age 65 on, there are progressive increases in suicide rates for white menand for Asian men as well as for men overall. With the exception of high suicide rates in Asianwomen over age 80, women in the United States are at highest risk in midlife (11). A number of factors may contribute to these gender differences in suicide risk (21). Men who are depressed are more likely to have comorbid alcohol and/or substance abuse problems thanwomen, which places the men at higher risk. Men are also less likely to seek and accept help ortreatment. Women, meanwhile, have factors that protect them against suicide. In addition totheir lower rates of alcohol and substance abuse, women are less impulsive, more socially embed-ded, and more willing to seek help. Among African American women, rates of suicide are re-markably low, a fact that has been attributed to the protective factors of religion and extendedkin networks (22). At the same time, women have higher rates of depression (23) and respondto unemployment with greater and longer-lasting increases in suicide rates than do men (24). Overall, for women in the general population, pregnancy is a time of significantly reduced suicide risk (25). Women with young children in the home are also less likely to kill themselves(26). Nonetheless, women with a history of depression or suicide attempts are at greater riskfor poor outcomes postpartum. Although suicide is most likely to occur in the first month afterdelivery, risk continues throughout the postpartum period. Teenagers, women of lower socio-economic status, and women hospitalized with postpartum psychiatric disorders may be at par-ticularly increased risk postpartum (27, 28). Women tend to choose less lethal suicide methods than men do (e.g., overdose or wrist cut- ting versus firearms or hanging). Such differences may in part account for the reversal in thegender ratio for suicide attempters, with women being reported to attempt suicide three timesas often as men (29). This female predominance among suicide attempters varies with age,FIGURE 1.

Rates of suicidal ideation and attempts are also increased in individuals with bor-derline personality disorder and in those with a history of domestic violence or physical and/orsexual abuse, all of which are more common among women (31-36). In addition, the likeli-hood of suicide attempts may vary with the phase of the menstrual cycle (37, 38). c) Race, ethnicity, and culture Variations in suicide rates across racial and ethnic groups have been mentioned earlier in thediscussion of the influences of age and gender on suicide risk. Overall, however, in the UnitedStates, age-adjusted rates for suicide in whites and in non-Hispanic Native Americans are ap-proximately double those observed in Hispanics, non-Hispanic African Americans, and Asian-Pacific Islanders (12.1 and 13.6 per 100,000 versus 6.1, 5.8, and 6.0 per 100,000, respectively)(11). For immigrant groups, in general, suicide rates tend to mirror the rates in the country oforigin and converge toward the rate in the host country over time (39-41). In the United States, racial and ethnic differences are also seen in the rates of suicide across the lifespan, with the highest suicide rates occurring in those over age 65 among non-Hispanicwhites, Hispanics, and Asian-Pacific Islanders (11). In contrast, among Native Americans andAfrican Americans, the highest suicide rates occur during adolescence and young adulthood(11). Such figures may be deceptive, however, since each of these groups exhibits a striking de-gree of heterogeneity that is rarely addressed in compilations of suicide rates. Racial and ethnic differences in culture, religious beliefs, and societal position may influence not only the actual rates of suicide but also the views of death and suicide held by members ofa particular group. For some groups, suicide can be considered a traditionally accepted way ofdealing with shame, distress, and/or physical illness (42). In addition, cultural values about con-veying suicidal ideas may differ; in some cultures, for example, suicidal ideation may be con-sidered a disgraceful or private matter that should be denied. Cultural differences, particularlyin immigrants and in Native Americans and Alaska Natives, may generate acculturative stressesthat in turn may contribute to suicidality (43, 44). Thus, knowledge of and sensitivity to com-mon contributors to suicide in different racial and ethnic groups as well as cultural differencesin beliefs about death and views of suicide are important when making clinical estimates of sui-cide risk and implementing plans to address suicide risk. d) Marital status Suicide risk also varies with marital status, with the suicide rate of single persons being twicethat of those who are married. Divorced, separated, or widowed individuals have rates four tofive times higher than married individuals (45, 46). Variations in suicide rates with marital sta-tus may reflect differing rates of baseline psychiatric illness but may also be associated with psy-chological or health variations. The presence of another person in the household may also serveas a protective factor by decreasing social isolation, engendering a sense of responsibility towardothers, and increasing the likelihood of discovery after a suicide attempt. For women, the pres-ence of children in the home may provide an additional protective effect (26, 47). It is also im-portant to note that although married adults have lower rates of suicide overall, young marriedcouples may have increased risk, and the presence of a high-conflict or violent marriage can bea precipitant rather than a protective factor for suicide. e) Sexual orientation Although no studies have examined rates of suicide among gay, lesbian, and bisexual individu-als, available evidence suggests that they may have an increased risk for suicidal behaviors.Many recent studies involving diverse sample populations and research methods have consis-tently found that gay, lesbian, and bisexual youths have a higher risk of suicide attempts thanmatched heterosexual comparison groups (48-53). The female-to-male ratio for reported sui-cide attempts in the general population is reversed in lesbian and gay youths, with more males Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

While some risk factors leading to suicide, such as psychi- atric and substance use disorders, are shared by both gay, lesbian, and bisexual youths and het-erosexual youths, others are unique to being gay, lesbian, or bisexual (e.g., disclosure of sexualorientation to friends and family, experience of homophobia and harassment, and gender non-conformity). Aggressive treatment of psychiatric and substance use disorders, open and nonjudg-mental support, and promotion of healthy psychosocial adjustment may help to decrease therisk for suicide in gay, lesbian, and bisexual youths and adults. f) Occupation Occupational groups differ in a number of factors contributing to suicide risk. These factorsinclude demographics (e.g., race, gender, socioeconomic class, marital status), occupationalstress (54, 55), psychiatric morbidity (56), and occupationally associated opportunities for sui-cide (56, 57). Physicians have been consistently found to be at higher risk for suicide than per-sons in other occupations including professionals (57, 58). After basic demographic correlatesof suicide across 32 occupations were controlled, risk was found to be highest among dentistsand physicians (with multivariate logistic regression odds ratios of 5.43 and 2.31, respectively)and was also increased among nurses, social workers, artists, mathematicians, and scientists(54). Although evidence is more varied, farmers may be at somewhat higher risk, whereas riskin police officers generally does not appear to differ from that of age- and sex-matched com-parison subjects (54, 57). 2. Major psychiatric syndromes The presence of a psychiatric disorder is probably the most significant risk factor for suicide.Psychological autopsy studies have consistently shown that more than 90% of persons who diefrom suicide satisfy the criteria for one or more psychiatric disorders (59, 60). The psycholog-ical autopsy method involves a retrospective investigation of the deceased person, within severalmonths of death, and uses psychological information gathered from personal documents; po-lice, medical, and coroner records; and interviews with family members, friends, co-workers,school associates, and health care providers to classify equivocal deaths or establish diagnosesthat were likely present at the time of suicide (61-63). In addition to there being high rates of psychiatric disorder among persons who die by sui- cide, almost all psychiatric disorders with the exception of mental retardation have been shownto increase suicide risk as measured by standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) (64) (Table 6). AnSMR reflects the relative mortality from suicide in individuals with a particular risk factor,compared with the general population. Thus, the SMR will be equal to 1.0 when the numberof observed suicide deaths is equivalent to the number of expected deaths by suicide in an age-and sex-matched group in the general population. Values of the SMR for suicide that are great-er than 1.0 indicate an increased risk of suicide, whereas values less than 1.0 indicate a de-creased risk (i.e., a protective effect). It is also important to note that SMRs do not correspondprecisely to the incidence or prevalence of suicide and may vary in their reliability dependingon the number of suicides in the sample, the time period of the study, and the representative-ness of the study population. Thus, SMRs should be viewed as estimates of relative risk andnot as reflections of absolute risk for individuals with a particular disorder. It is equally neces-sary to appreciate distinctions in risk across disorders and variations in risk at differing pointsin the illness course in the effort to differentiate high-risk patients within an overall at-risk pop-ulation identified in terms of standardized mortality. a) Mood disorders Study after study has confirmed that the presence of a major mood disorder is a significant riskfactor for suicide. Not surprisingly, mood disorders, primarily in depressive phases, are the diag-noses most often found in suicide deaths (59, 65-67). Although most suicides in individuals Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Suicidal ideation and attempts are also more common during mixed epi-sodes than in mania (71). When viewed from the standpoint of lifetime risk, mood disorders are associated with an increased risk of mortality that has been estimated to range from a 12-fold increase in risk withdysthymia to a 20-fold increase in risk with major depression (64). Lifetime suicide risk in bi-polar disorder has generally been found to be similar to that in unipolar major depression (69,72). However, several longitudinal studies of patients followed after an index hospitalizationhave demonstrated suicide risks in patients with major depressive disorder that are greater thanthose in patients with either bipolar I disorder or bipolar II disorder (73-75). Particularly for younger patients, suicides are more likely to occur early in the course of ill- ness (68, 73, 75, 76). Nonetheless, risk persists throughout life in major depressive disorder aswell as in bipolar disorder (73, 74). Suicide risk also increases in a graduated fashion with illnessseverity as reflected by the level of required treatment. Lifetime suicide rates in psychiatric out-patients ranged from 0.7% for those without an affective disorder to 2.2% for those with af-fective disorders, whereas lifetime suicide rates for individuals requiring hospitalization rangedfrom 4% for those whose admission for depression was not prompted by suicidal behavior orrisk to 8.6% for those whose admission was the result of suicidality (77). Illness severity mayalso be an indicator of risk for suicide attempts (75, 78). Among patients with mood disorders, lifetime risk also depends on the presence of other psy- chiatric symptoms or behaviors, some of which are modifiable with treatment. For example, pa-TABLE 6.

At later timepoints, hopelessness has been associated with increased suicide risk in mood disorder patients(78, 79). Suicidal ideation and a history of suicide attempts also augment risk (74, 79). Comor-bid anxiety, alcohol use, and substance use are common in patients with mood disorders andmay also increase the risk of suicide and suicide attempts (see Sections II.E.2.f, \"Alcohol Use Dis-orders,\" and II.E.2.g, \"Other Substance Use Disorders\"). Although a greater risk for suicide orsuicidal behaviors among patients with psychotic mood disorders has been seen in some studies(80-83), this relationship has not been found in other studies (84-88). b) Schizophrenia Compared to the risk in the general population, the risk of suicide in patients with schizophre-nia is estimated to be about 8.5-fold higher (64), with even greater increments in risk in pa-tients who have been hospitalized (89). Although earlier research suggested a 10%-15%lifetime risk of suicide among patients with schizophrenia (90-93), such estimates were likelyinflated by biases in the patient populations and length of follow-up. More recent estimatessuggest a lifetime risk of suicide in schizophrenia of about 4% (94). Suicide may occur more frequently during the early years of the illness, with the time im- mediately after hospital discharge being a period of heightened risk (83, 89, 90, 95-98). How-ever, risk continues throughout life (99, 100) and appears to be increased in those with achronic illness course (83, 89, 101), multiple psychiatric hospitalizations (89, 95), or a previoussuicide attempt (89, 90, 95, 100). Other consistently identified factors that confer an increasedrisk of suicide in patients with schizophrenia include male sex (83, 89, 90, 95, 102, 103),younger age (<30 years) (83, 90, 102), and social isolation (97, 104). In individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, psychotic symptoms are often present at the time of a suicide attempt or suicide (105-107). However, command hallucinationsseem to account for a relatively small percentage of suicides, and there is limited evidence onwhether they increase suicide risk. Nonetheless, they may act as a precipitant to a suicide attemptor to suicide in some individuals (106, 108) (see Section II.E.3.c, \"Command Hallucinations\").Suicide in patients with schizophrenia may be more likely to occur during periods of improvementafter relapse or during periods of depressed mood (83, 89, 90, 95, 100, 109-111), including whathas been termed postpsychotic depression (112, 113). Also, patients with schizoaffective disorderappear to be at greater risk for suicide than those with schizophrenia (114). Suicide risk may paradoxically be increased in those who have insight into the implications of having a schizophrenic illness, particularly if this insight is coupled with a feeling of hope-lessness. Suicide risk is also increased in those who recognize a loss of previous abilities and arepessimistic about the benefits of treatment in restoring those abilities (93, 101, 115). This pat-tern is consistent with the increased risk of suicide observed in individuals with schizophreniawho had a history of good premorbid and intellectual functioning (83, 89, 103) as well as withthe decreased risk of suicide in patients with prominent negative symptoms (83, 89, 103, 116). Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are common among individuals with schizophrenia and need to be identified and addressed in the assessment process. In series of hospitalized orlongitudinally followed patients with schizophrenia, 40%-53% reported having suicidal ide-ation at some point in their lives and 23%-55% reported prior suicide attempts (80, 93, 108,117). For individuals with schizoaffective disorder, these figures are likely to be even higher(80). Patients often reported that suicide attempts were precipitated by depression, stressors, orpsychotic symptoms (108). In addition, suicide attempts among individuals with schizophre-nia or schizoaffective disorder were often medically serious and associated with a high degreeof intent (108), both of which would confer greater future risk for suicide.

Among persons who die from suicide, rates of anxiety disorders appear to belower than rates of mood disorders, with one psychological autopsy study identifying an anxietydisorder in only 11% of persons who died from suicide (120). However, the prevalence of anxietydisorders may be underestimated because of the masking of anxiety by affective disorders and byalcohol use (121). Of the anxiety disorders, panic disorder has been studied in the most detail. In psychological autopsy studies, panic disorder is present in about 1% of persons who die from suicide (120),whereas other studies of panic disorder show an SMR for suicide that is about 10 times that ofthe general population (64). As with anxiety disorders in general, comorbid depression, alcoholuse, or axis II disorders are often present in individuals with panic disorder who die by suicide(122, 123). Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are common in individuals with anxiety disorders, but their rates vary with the patient population and with the presence of comorbid diagnoses.In panic disorder, for example, reported rates of prior suicide attempts range from 0% to 42%(124-129). In other anxiety disorders, the relative risks of suicidal ideation and suicide at-tempts also appear to be increased (118, 130). In addition, in patients with major depression,the presence of a comorbid anxiety disorder appears to increase the risk of suicidal ideation orsuicide attempts (131, 132). Less clear, however, is whether anxiety disorders are associatedwith an increased risk for suicide and other suicidal behaviors in the absence of comorbid di-agnoses (130, 132-136) or whether the observed increases in risk can be accounted for solelyon the basis of comorbid disorders (127, 137). Nonetheless, suicide risk may be diminished byidentifying masked anxiety symptoms and anxiety disorders that are misdiagnosed as medicalillness as well as by explicitly assessing and treating comorbid psychiatric diagnoses in individ-uals with anxiety disorders. d) Eating disorders Eating disorders, particularly anorexia nervosa, are a likely risk factor for suicide as well as beingassociated with an increased risk of mortality in general (64, 138, 139). Exact risk is difficultto determine, however, as data on rates of suicide in eating disorders may be subject to under-reporting bias (140). Suicide attempts are also common, particularly in individuals with bingeingand purging behaviors and in those with comorbid mood disorders, aggression, or impulsivity(141, 142). Conversely, suicide attempters may have increased rates of abnormal eating behav-iors (142). The role of comorbid diagnoses in increasing the risk of suicidal behaviors remainsto be delineated. It is also not clear whether the self-imposed morbidity and mortality associ-ated with severe caloric restriction or bingeing and purging should be viewed as a self-injuriousor suicidal behavior. Regardless, clinicians conducting a suicide risk assessment should be at-tentive to the presence of eating disorders and especially the co-occurrence of eating disorderswith behaviors or symptoms such as deliberate self-harm or depression. e) Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder The relationship between attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and suicidal behav-ior is unclear, with some studies indicating an association between the diagnosis of ADHD andsuicide attempts or completions (143, 144) and other studies indicating no such connection(145, 146). However, individuals with ADHD, combined type, may be at greater risk thanthose with ADHD, inattentive type, perhaps because of an increased level of impulsivity in thecombined type of the disorder (144). In addition, the presence of ADHD may increase suiciderisk through comorbidity with conduct disorder, substance abuse, and/or depressive disorder(143).

In fact, abuseof substances including alcohol may be the second most frequent psychiatric precursor to sui-cide (147). Although suicide rates among alcoholics are higher in Europe and older literatureindicated a lifetime risk for suicide in the 11%-15% range, recent literature suggests the life-time risk of suicide among alcoholics in the United States is as low as 3.4% (148). In addition,in psychological autopsy studies, alcohol abuse or dependence is present in 25%-50% of thosewho died by suicide (59, 149-151). Several factors, including recent or impending interpersonal losses and comorbid psychiat- ric disorders, have been specifically linked to suicide in alcoholic individuals. The loss or dis-ruption of a close interpersonal relationship or the threatened loss of such a relationship maybe both a consequence of alcohol-related behavior and a precipitant to suicide (110, 152-154).Suicide is also more likely to occur among alcoholics who suffer from depressive episodes thanin persons with major depression or alcoholism alone. In addition, studies have found majordepressive episodes in half to three-fourths of alcoholics who die by suicide (67, 120, 149, 152,155-157). As a result, psychiatrists should systematically rule out the presence of a comorbiddepressive disorder and not simply assume that depressive symptoms result from alcohol use orits psychosocial consequences. Whereas full-time employment appears to be a protective factor in alcoholics, factors that in- crease suicide risk include communications of suicidal intent, prior suicide attempts, continuedor heavier drinking, recent unemployment, living alone, poor social support, legal and financialdifficulties, serious medical illness, other psychiatric disorders, personality disturbance, andother substance use (64, 149, 152, 154, 156, 158, 159). In terms of gender, alcoholic men aremore likely to die by suicide, but female alcoholics appear to have a greater standardizedmortality due to suicide than men (64), indicating an increased risk of suicide in alcoholics re-gardless of gender. While the likelihood of a suicidal outcome increases with the total numberof risk factors (149, 160), not all of these factors suggest an immediate risk. In fact, in contrastto suicide in depressed and schizophrenic patients, suicide in alcoholics appears to be a relativelylate sequela of the disease (161), with communications of suicidal intent usually being of severalyears' duration and health, economic, and social functioning showing a gradual deterioration(149). In addition to being associated with an increased risk of suicide, alcohol use disorders are associated with a greater likelihood of suicide attempts (162, 163). For suicide attempts amongalcoholics, greater rates are associated with female sex, younger age, lower economic status, earlyonset of heavy drinking and alcohol-related problems, consumption of greater amounts of al-cohol when drinking, and having a first- or second-degree relative who abused alcohol (164-167). The risk of suicide attempts among alcoholics is also increased by the presence of a co-morbid psychiatric diagnosis, particularly major depression, other substance use disorders,antisocial personality disorder, or an anxiety disorder (165-171). Thus, individuals with alcohol use disorders are at increased risk for suicide attempts as well as for suicide. Family histories of alcoholism and comorbid psychiatric disorders, par-ticularly mood disorders and other substance use disorders, are frequent in alcoholics whodie by suicide and who attempt suicide. Interpersonal loss and other adverse life events arecommonly noted to precede suicide in alcoholics. These factors may act as precipitants, or,conversely, alcohol use disorders may have a deteriorating effect on the lives of alcoholics andculminate in suicide. Together, however, these findings suggest the need to identify and ad-dress comorbid psychiatric diagnoses, family history, and psychosocial factors, including re-cent interpersonal losses, as part of the suicide assessment of persons with alcohol usedisorders.

Substance use disordersare particularly common among adolescents and young adults who die by suicide (110, 145,173, 174). In fact, it has been suggested that the spread of substance abuse may have contrib-uted to the two- to fourfold increase in youth suicide since 1970 (147). For many individuals,substance abuse and alcoholism are co-occurring, making it difficult to distinguish the contri-butions of each to rates of suicide (153, 172, 173). In addition, other comorbid psychiatric dis-orders, particularly mood disorders and personality disorders, may add to the risk of suicide inpatients with substance use disorders (145, 173-175). Substance use disorders also seem to make an independent contribution to the likelihood of making a suicide attempt (176, 177). In addition, a history of suicide attempts is commonamong individuals with substance use disorders (31, 178-180). Even after other factors, includ-ing comorbid psychiatric disorders and demographic characteristics, are controlled, it is thenumber of substances used, rather than the type of substance, that appears to be important(176). As with suicide in individuals with alcohol use disorders, the loss of a significant personalrelationship is a common precipitant for a suicide attempt (179). Suicide attempts are also morelikely in individuals with substance abuse who also have higher childhood trauma scores foremotional neglect (180, 181). Moreover, a substance use disorder may complicate mood disor-ders (182), increasing susceptibility to treatment resistance, increasing psychological impair-ment, and contributing to an elevated risk for suicide attempts. Thus, it is important to identifypatterns of substance use during the psychiatric evaluation and to note comorbid psychiatric di-agnoses or psychosocial factors that may also affect the likelihood of suicidal behaviors amongindividuals with substance use disorders. h) Personality disorders Diagnoses of personality disorders have been associated with an increased risk for suicide, withestimated lifetime rates of suicide ranging from 3% to 9% (183-185). Compared with the gen-eral population, individuals with personality disorders have an estimated risk for suicide that isabout seven times greater (64). Specific increases in suicide risk have been associated with bor-derline and antisocial personality disorders, with possible increases in risk associated withavoidant and schizoid personality disorders (186). Psychological autopsy studies have shownpersonality disorders to be present in approximately one-third of those who die by suicide (174,183, 186, 187). Among psychiatric outpatients, personality disorders are present in about one-half of patients who die by suicide (78, 188). In individuals with personality disorders, suicide risk may also be increased by a number of other factors, including unemployment, financial difficulty, family discord, and other interper-sonal conflicts or loss (189, 190). In individuals with borderline personality disorder, in partic-ular, impulsivity may also increase suicide risk (185). Although comorbid diagnoses do not account for the full increase in suicide risk with per- sonality disorders (184, 185), comorbid diagnoses are frequent and augment suicide risk. Infact, for individuals with personality disorders, concurrent depressive symptoms or substanceuse disorders are seen in nearly all individuals who die by suicide (187). Among individuals who attempt suicide, diagnoses of personality disorders are also com- mon, with overall rates of about 40% (31, 177, 184). Individuals with personality disorderstend to attempt suicide more often than individuals with other diagnoses (191-193), with40%-90% of individuals with personality disorders making a suicide attempt during theirlifetime (184). Comorbid psychiatric diagnoses, including mood disorders and substance usedisorders, are quite prevalent among suicide attempters with personality disorders and inde-pendently contribute to risk (131, 184, 191, 192, 194, 195). Impulsivity has also been shownto increase the risk of suicide attempts in some (196, 197) but not all studies (191). Rates of Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Of personality disorder diagnoses, borderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder confer an added risk of suicide attempts (31, 177, 191, 193). In individuals with bor-derline personality disorder, there is some evidence of increased risk being associated with thenumber and severity of symptoms (195). Among female suicide attempters, rates of borderlinepersonality disorder are higher than among male suicide attempters (199, 200). These findingssuggest that personality disorders, particularly borderline personality disorder and antisocial per-sonality disorder, should be identified and addressed as part of the suicide assessment process. i) Comorbidity As discussed in preceding sections, comorbid psychiatric diagnoses (most commonly, major de-pression, borderline and antisocial personality disorders, and alcohol and other substance usedisorders) increase suicide risk and are often present in individuals who die by suicide (13, 59,120, 174, 201). Comorbid medical diagnoses may also increase suicide risk, as will be discussedin Section II.E.5, \"Physical Illness.\" In general, the greater the number of comorbid diagnosesthat are present, the greater will be the increase in risk. Furthermore, even in the absence of aformal comorbid diagnosis, suicide is more likely to occur when there are high levels of addi-tional psychiatric symptoms (67, 185, 202-204). In patients with a mood disorder, either bipolar disorder or major depression, the risk of sui- cide is particularly increased in the presence of comorbid alcohol or substance use (68, 205-207), with some studies suggesting that males are at additional risk (68, 205). Comorbid alco-hol use may also increase suicide risk in patients with schizophrenia (107). In addition, suicidein schizophrenia may be more likely to occur during periods of depression (83, 90, 109-113).In anxiety disorders and particularly in panic disorder, individuals who die by suicide oftenhave experienced comorbid depression, alcohol use, or axis II disorders (122, 123). Similarly,when suicide occurs in individuals with eating disorders, it is often associated with a comorbidmood disorder or substance use disorder (138). For individuals with alcohol use disorders, major depression is found in half to three-fourths of individuals who die by suicide (67, 120, 149, 152, 155-157), and alcoholics who suffer fromdepressive episodes are more likely to die from suicide than persons with major depression oralcoholism alone. Serious medical illness and other psychiatric disorders, including personalitydisturbance and other substance use disorders, also increase suicide risk in alcoholics (64, 149,152, 154, 156, 158, 159). For many individuals, substance abuse and alcoholism are co-occur-ring, making it difficult to distinguish the contributions of each to rates of suicide (153, 172,173, 208). Furthermore, it appears to be the number of substances used, rather than the spe-cific substance, that determines risk (176). Individuals who die by suicide and who abuse or are dependent on substances other than al- cohol are typically adolescents or young adults. Comorbid mood disorders are commonly seenin both males and females (66, 145, 204). In addition, borderline personality disorder is rela-tively frequent in females with substance use disorders (175), whereas young males with sub-stance use disorders who die by suicide more commonly have comorbid antisocial personalitydisorder (120, 159, 173, 204). The presence of ADHD may increase suicide risk through co-morbidity with conduct disorder, substance abuse, and/or depressive disorder (143). For indi-viduals with personality disorders, concurrent depressive symptoms or substance use disordersaugment suicide risk (184, 185, 209, 210) and are seen in nearly all suicides (187). Comorbid diagnoses are also essential to identify and address because of their role in increas- ing the risk of suicide attempts (199). Furthermore, the likelihood of a suicide attempt appearsto increase with an increasing number of comorbid diagnoses (166, 176, 177, 211). In addi-tion, the number and severity of symptoms may play a role in increasing risk, regardless ofwhether the full criteria for a separate diagnosis are met.

Thus, given the evidence that comorbidity increases the risks for suicide and for sui-cide attempts, the suicide risk assessment should give strong consideration to all current andprevious psychiatric diagnoses. 3. Specific psychiatric symptoms a) AnxietyAnxiety appears to increase the risk for suicide (79, 217, 218). Specifically implicated has beensevere psychic anxiety consisting of subjective feelings of fearfulness or apprehension, whetheror not the feelings are focused on specific concerns. Clinical observation suggests that anxiouspatients may be more inclined to act on suicidal impulses than individuals whose depressivesymptoms include psychomotor slowing. Studies of suicide in patients with affective disordershave shown that those who died by suicide within the first year after contact were more likely tohave severe psychic anxiety or panic attacks (79, 219). In an inpatient sample, severe anxiety, ag-itation, or both were found in four-fifths of patients in the week preceding suicide (218). Similarassociations of anxiety with suicide attempts have been noted in some (212) but not all (220)studies. Since severe anxiety does seem to increase suicide risk, at least in some subgroups of pa-tients, anxiety should be viewed as an often hidden but potentially modifiable risk factor for sui-cide (109). Once identified, symptoms of anxiety can be addressed with psychotherapeuticapproaches and can also respond rapidly to aggressive short-term treatment with benzodiaz-epines, second-generation antipsychotic medications, and possibly anticonvulsant medications. b) Hopelessness Hopelessness is well established as a psychological dimension that is associated with increased sui-cide risk (10, 78, 79, 217, 221-223). Hopelessness may vary in degree from having a negative ex-pectation for the future to being devoid of hope and despairing for the future. In general, patientswith high levels of hopelessness have an increased risk for future suicide (78, 221-225). However,among patients with alcohol use disorders, the presence of hopelessness may not confer additionalrisk (226, 227). For patients with depression, hopelessness has been suggested to be the factor thatexplains why some patients choose suicide, whereas others do not (222). Hopelessness also con-tributes to an increased likelihood of suicidal ideation (192, 228) and suicide attempts (197, 212,229-231) as well as an increased level of suicidal intent (197, 232, 233). Hopelessness often occurs in concert with depression as a \"state-dependent\" characteristic, but some individuals experience hopelessness on a primary and more enduring basis (221). Highbaseline levels of hopelessness have also been associated with an increased likelihood of suicidalbehaviors (234). However, patients experiencing similar levels of depression may have differinglevels of hopelessness (222), and this difference, in turn, may affect their likelihood of developingsuicidal thoughts (228). Whatever the source or conceptualization of hopelessness, interventionsthat reduce hopelessness may be able to reduce the potential for suicide (10, 222, 235-237). c) Command hallucinations Command hallucinations, which order patients to carry out tasks or actions, can occur in in-dividuals with psychotic disorders, primarily schizophrenia (238). Evidence for the associationof command hallucinations with suicide is extremely limited (102, 239). The presence of au-ditory command hallucinations in inpatients does not appear to increase the likelihood of as-saultiveness or of suicidal ideation or behavior over that associated with auditory hallucinations Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

For permission for reuse, visit APPI Permissions & Licensing Center at http://www.appi.org/CustomerService/Pages/Permissions.aspx.38 APA Practice Guidelinesalone (240). Furthermore, in patients who do experience auditory command hallucinations, reported rates of compliance with commands vary widely from 40% to 84% (106, 241-244).Variables that have been associated with a propensity to obey command hallucinations includebeing able to identify the hallucinatory voice, having more severe psychotic disturbance, havinga less dangerous command, and experiencing the commands for the first time or outside of ahospital environment (241, 242, 245). Thus, at least for some individuals, suicidal behaviorscan occur in response to hallucinated commands, and individuals with prior suicide attemptsmay be particularly susceptible (106). Consequently, in the psychiatric evaluation, it is impor-tant to identify auditory command hallucinations, assess them in the context of other clinicalfeatures, and address them as part of the treatment planning process. d) Impulsiveness and aggression Impulsivity, hostility, and aggression may act individually or together to increase suicide risk. Forexample, many studies provide moderately strong evidence for the roles of impulsivity and hostil-ity-related affects and behavior in suicide across diagnostic groups (89, 217, 246-248). Multipleother studies have also demonstrated increased levels of impulsivity and aggression in individualswith a history of attempted suicide (31, 193, 197, 212, 220, 249-252). Many patients withborderline personality disorder exhibit self-mutilating behaviors, and, overall, such behaviorsare associated with increased impulsivity (251). However, for many self-mutilating patients, thesebehaviors are premeditated rather than impulsive (253). Consequently, self-mutilatory behaviorsalone should not be regarded as an indicator of high impulsivity. Moreover, measures of aggressionand impulsivity are not highly correlated (253), making aggression a poor marker of impulsivity aswell. Thus, impulsivity, hostility, aggression, and self-mutilating behaviors should be considered in-dependently in the psychiatric evaluation as well as in estimating suicide risk. 4. Other aspects of psychiatric history a) Alcohol intoxicationIn addition to the increased suicide risk conferred by alcohol abuse or dependence, intoxicationitself appears to play a role in alcoholic as well as nonalcoholic populations (254). Autopsieshave found alcohol to be present in 20%-50% of all persons who die by suicide (121, 255).Those who consume alcohol before suicide are more likely to have experienced a recent break-up of an interpersonal relationship but less likely to have sought help before death (255). Theyare also more likely to have chosen a firearm as a suicide method (151, 256, 257). Alcohol in-toxication at the time of suicide may also be more common in younger individuals (154, 255,258), in men (121, 255), and in individuals without any lifetime history of psychiatric treat-ment (154). Among suicide attempters who later died by suicide, alcohol appeared to contrib-ute to death in more than a third (259). In addition, a study of the interaction of employmentand weekly patterns of suicide emphasizes the role of intoxication in suicides and indicates thatemployment may be a stabilizing factor that curbs heavy drinking during the work week (260),thereby decreasing rates of suicide. Consequently, in some subsets of patients, alcohol con-sumption appears to contribute to the decision to die by suicide (255). Alcohol use is also a common prelude to suicide attempts (258). Some estimates show that more than 50% of individuals have used alcohol just before their suicide attempt. Among alcoholics,heavier drinking adds to risk (64, 149, 165). Suicide attempts that involve alcohol are more likelyto be impulsive (258). Indeed, the majority of acutely intoxicated alcoholics either did not remem-ber the reason for their attempt or had done it on a sudden impulse (258). Thus, alcohol consump-tion may make intervention more difficult by simultaneously limiting the communication of intent(255, 261), increasing impulsivity, decreasing inhibition, and impairing judgment (262). Alcohol use in conjunction with attempted suicide is more common in men than in women (258), although among younger attempters, females may be more likely than males to consume Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Alcohol use in conjunction with a suicide attempt has also been associated with repeated suicide attempts and future suicide (263). In some individuals, intentionally drinking toovercome ambivalence about suicide may signify serious suicidal intent. Thus, since intoxicationis a risk factor for suicide attempts as well as for suicide, the clinician should inquire about a pa-tient's drinking habits and consider the effect of alcohol intoxication when estimating suicide risk. b) Past suicide attempts Individuals who have made a suicide attempt constitute a distinct but overlapping populationwith those who die by suicide. As with individuals who die by suicide, a high preponderance ofsuicide attempters have one or more axis I or II diagnoses, with major depression and alcoholdependence observed most commonly for axis I and borderline personality disorder observedmost commonly for axis II (199, 200, 264). However, suicide attempts are about 10-20 timesmore prevalent than suicide (265), with lifetime prevalence ranging from 0.7% to 6% per100,000 in a random sample of U.S. adults (2). Although a substantial percentage of individualswill die on their initial suicide attempt (266), a past suicide attempt is one of the major risk fac-tors for future suicide attempts (164, 267) and for future suicide (64, 78, 79, 266, 268-271). After a suicide attempt, there can be significant mortality from both natural and unnatural causes (259, 272). A suicide attempt by any method is associated with a 38-fold increase in sui-cide risk, a rate that is higher than that associated with any psychiatric disorder (64). Depend-ing on the length of the follow-up, from 6% to 27.5% of those who attempt suicide willultimately die by suicide (64, 273), and similar results have been suggested for acts of deliberateself-harm (274). Some studies have found that suicide risk appears to be particularly high dur-ing the first year after a suicide attempt (259, 275). An additional increase in risk may be asso-ciated with aborted suicide attempts (276, 277) or repeated suicide attempts (64, 259, 263,272, 274, 278). Thus, the increase in suicide mortality subsequent to attempted suicide em-phasizes the need for aftercare planning in this heterogeneous population. In the context of a suicide attempt, a number of other factors are associated with increases in suicide risk. For example, risk is augmented by medical and psychiatric comorbidity, partic-ularly comorbid depression, alcohol abuse, or a long-standing medical illness (64). Low levelsof social cohesion may also increase risk (64). Risk of later suicide in males, particularly young-er males, appears to be two to four times greater than that in females after a suicide attempt(275). In addition, serious suicide attempts are associated with a higher risk of eventual suicide,as are having high intent (164), taking measures to avoid discovery, and using more lethalmethods that resulted in physical injuries (263). Given this increased likelihood of additional suicide attempts and suicide deaths after a sui- cide attempt or aborted suicide attempt, psychiatric evaluation should be incorporated intoemergency medical assessments of suicide attempters (279) and the importance of follow-upshould be emphasized (2, 280). c) History of childhood physical and/or sexual abuse A history of childhood abuse has been associated with increased rates of suicidal behaviors inmultiple studies. Rates of suicide in individuals with a history of childhood abuse have not beenwidely studied, but available evidence suggests that suicide rates are increased at least 10-foldin those with a history of childhood abuse (36). In addition, a number of studies have demon-strated that individuals with a history of childhood abuse have an increased risk of suicide at-tempts (230, 281-283), suggesting that risk of later suicide will also be increased. Rates ofsuicide attempts are increased in individuals who report experiencing childhood physical abuse(196, 250, 284-290) as well as in individuals who report experiencing childhood sexual abuse(33, 35, 36, 164, 196, 250, 284, 285, 288-294). Rates of suicidal ideation are similarly in-creased in individuals with a childhood history of abuse (284). Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

In addition, the duration and severity of childhood abusevary across individuals and can also influence risk. It appears, however, that the risk of suicide at-tempts is greater in individuals who have experienced both physical and sexual abuse in childhood(288) and that greater levels of risk are associated with increasing abuse severity (285, 286, 291). Childhood trauma can also be associated with increased self-injurious behaviors, including self-cutting and self-mutilation, without associated suicidal intent. Sexual abuse may be a par-ticular risk factor for such behaviors, which can often become repetitive (164). Indeed, delib-erate self-harm is common in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder and other traumaticdisorders and serves to reduce internal tension and provide nonverbal communication abouttheir self-hate and intense distress (295). As a result, inquiring about the motivations of self-injurious behavior may help to inform estimates of suicide risk. Gender may also influence the risk of suicidal behaviors in those with a history of childhood abuse. This influence, in part, relates to differences in the prevalence of childhood abuse betweenmen and women, with rates of childhood physical abuse being higher in men and rates of child-hood sexual abuse being higher in women (288). However, in individuals who have a history ofchildhood sexual abuse, the risk of a suicide attempt may be greater in men than in women (33). Given the significant rates of childhood physical and/or sexual abuse, particularly among psychiatric patient populations (35, 284, 288, 292), and the increased risk for suicidal behav-iors that such abuse confers, it important to assess for a history of physical abuse and sexualabuse as part of the psychiatric evaluation. In addition, the duration and severity of childhoodabuse should be determined, as these factors will also influence risk. d) History of domestic partner violence Domestic partner violence has been associated with increased rates of suicide attempts and sui-cidal ideation; however, there is no information about its effects on risk for suicide per se. Therisk for suicide attempts in individuals who have experienced recent domestic partner violencehas been estimated to be four- to eightfold greater than the risk for individuals without suchexperiences (34, 296-300). Conversely, among women presenting with suicide attempts, thereis a severalfold increase in their risk for experiencing domestic partner violence (230, 301). Although much more commonly experienced by women, domestic partner violence is also ex- perienced by men and can increase their risk for suicide attempts (302). Men with a history ofdomestic violence toward their partners may also be at increased risk for suicide (303). Further-more, domestic violence in the home may increase the risk for suicide attempts among childrenwho are witnesses to such violence (281). Given the clear increase in risk for suicide attempts in individuals experiencing domestic partner violence and the likely association of suicide attempts with an increased risk for suicide,it is important to specifically ask about domestic partner violence as a part of the suicide assess-ment. Such inquiry may also help to identify individuals in addition to the identified patientwho may be at increased risk for suicidal behaviors. e) Treatment history Multiple studies have shown that greater treatment intensity is associated with greater rates ofeventual suicide (64, 77, 198). Although hospitalization generally occurs because a patient hasa more severe illness and is deemed to be at increased risk for suicide, for some patients, hospi-talization could conceivably result in increased distress and thus an increase in suicide risk.Thus, as a general rule, a past history of treatment, including a past history of hospitalization,should be viewed as a marker that alerts the clinician to increased suicide risk. T emporally, the risk for suicide appears to be greatest after changes in treatment setting or intensity (304), with recently admitted and recently discharged inpatients showing increased Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

This increase in rates of suicide after hospital discharge is seen across diagnostic categories and has been observed in individuals with major depressive disor-der, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Rates decline withtime since discharge but may remain high for as long as several years (91, 306, 309). Similarfindings are seen with suicide attempts, which are also more frequent in the period after hos-pitalization (267, 305, 308). These observations suggest a need for close follow-up during theperiod immediately after discharge. f) Illness course and severity In some psychiatric disorders, suicide risk is greater at certain points in the illness or episode course. For example, in the course of major depressive disorder, suicidality tends to occur early,often before a diagnosis has been made or treatment has begun (304, 310-312). In patients withmajor depressive disorder (73, 313), as well as in those with bipolar disorder (73, 74, 305) orschizophrenia (83), suicide has been noted to be more likely during the first few episodes, earlyin the illness (314, 315). After a suicide attempt, the risk for suicide is also greatest initially, withmost suicides occurring in the first year after the attempt (275). Although risks of suicide and sui-cide attempts later in the illness course are less than they are earlier on, these risks remain greaterthan those for the general population (74, 100, 316-318). These findings highlight the need forearly identification of these disorders and for therapeutic approaches that will treat the illnesswhile simultaneously promoting longer-term treatment adherence. Risk may also vary with severity of symptoms. For example, higher levels of depression have been associated with increased risk of suicide in at least one study (319), whereas greater num-bers of symptoms of borderline personality disorder have been associated with an increased riskfor suicide attempts (195). In addition, higher levels of suicidal ideation and subjective hope-lessness also increase risk for suicide (78) and suicide attempts (31). In contrast, higher levelsof negative symptoms have been associated with decreased suicide risk in individuals withschizophrenia (320). It is also important to recognize that other factors such as age will modu-late the effects of symptom severity on risk. With older adults, for example, milder symptomsmay be associated with greater risk than moderate symptoms in younger adults (207, 321).Consequently, clinicians should consider the severity of a patient's illness and psychiatric symp-toms in the context of other patient-specific factors when assessing suicide risk. 5. Physical illness Identification of medical illness (axis III) is also an essential part of the assessment process. Suchdiagnoses will need to be considered in developing a plan of treatment, and they may influencesuicide risk in several ways. First, specific medical disorders may themselves be associated with anincreased risk for suicide. Alternatively, the physiological effects of illness or its treatment may leadto the development of psychiatric syndromes such as depression, which may also increase suiciderisk. Physical illnesses are also a source of social and/or psychological stress, which in turn aug-ments risk. Physical illnesses such as hepatitis C or sexually transmitted diseases may signal an in-creased likelihood of impulsive behaviors or comorbid substance use disorders that may in turnbe associated with greater risk for suicidal behaviors. Finally, when physical illness is present, psy-chiatric signs and symptoms may be ascribed to comorbid medical conditions, delaying recogni-tion and treatment of the psychiatric disorder. Data from clinical cohort and record linkage studies indicate clearly that medical illness is associated with increased likelihood of suicide (Table 7). Not surprisingly, disorders of the ner-vous system are associated with an elevated risk for suicide. The association between seizure dis-orders and increased suicide risk is particularly strong and consistently observed (64, 322-328).Presumably because of its close association with impulsivity, mood disorders, and psychosis,temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with increased risk in most (322, 327, 328) but not all(325) studies. Suicide attempts are also more common among individuals with epilepsy (329- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Other neurological disorders that are associated with increased risk for suicide include multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and brain and spinal cord injury (25, 323, 332-334). Other medical disorders that have also been associated with an increased risk for suicide include HIV/AIDS (25, 335, 336), malignancies (especially of the head and neck) (25, 333,337, 338), peptic ulcer disease (25), systemic lupus erythematosus (25), chronic hemodialysis-treated renal failure (339), heart disease (337), and, in men, chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-ease and prostate disease (337). In contrast, studies have not demonstrated increased suiciderisk in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), blindness, cerebrovascular disease,hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, or diabetes mellitus (25, 337). Beyond the physical illness itself, functional impairments (321, 333, 338), pain (340-342), disfigurement, increased dependence on others, and decreases in sight (333) and hearing in-crease suicide risk. Furthermore, in many instances, the risk for suicide associated with a med-ical disorder is mediated by psychiatric symptoms or illness (321, 342, 343). Indeed, suicidalityis rarely seen in individuals with serious physical illness in the absence of clinically significantmood disturbance. Finally, the risk for suicide or suicide attempts may also be affected by char-acteristics of the individual patient, including gender, coping style, availability of social sup-ports, presence of psychosocial stressors, previous history of suicidal behaviors, and the imageand meaning to the individual of the illness itself. 6. Family history In individuals with a history of suicide among relatives, the risk of suicidal behaviors is increased,apparently through genetic as well as environmental effects. An increased relative risk for suicideor suicide attempts in close relatives of suicidal subjects has been demonstrated repeatedly (31,82, 202, 214, 312, 344-364). Overall, it appears that the risk of suicidal behaviors among familymembers of suicidal individuals is about 4.5 times that observed in relatives of nonsuicidal sub-jects (365-368; R. Baldessarini, personal communication, 2002). Furthermore, this increase inthe risk of suicidal behaviors among family members seems, at least in part, to be independent ofgenetic contributions from comorbid psychiatric diagnoses (355, 361, 367, 368). T win studies also provide strong support for the role of a specific genetic factor for suicidal behaviors (365, 368, 369), since there is substantially higher concordance of suicide and suicideattempts in identical twins, compared with fraternal twin pairs (370-375). Adoption studiessubstantiate the genetic aspect of suicide risk in that there is a greater risk of suicidal behavioramong biologic than among adopted relatives of individuals with suicidal behavior or depres-sion (376-378). Despite the fact that family, twin, and adoption methods provide highly suggestive evidence of heritable factors in risk of suicide as well as some evidence for nonlethal suicidal behavior,TABLE 7.

Thus far, molecular genetic ap- proaches have not yielded consistent or unambiguous evidence of a specific genetic basis forsuicide risk (16). In addition, genetic associations with suicide risk may be confounded by theheritability of other factors such as mood disorders or substance use disorder that are also asso-ciated with increased risk for suicidal behaviors. 7. Psychosocial factors a) EmploymentUnemployment has long been associated with increased rates of suicide (379, 380). In recentcase-control and longitudinal studies, higher rates of unemployment have been consistentlynoted in suicide attempters (78, 149, 361, 381-383) and in persons who died by suicide (24,190, 384, 385). Compared with individuals in control groups, unemployed persons have atwo- to fourfold greater risk for suicide. Risk is particularly elevated in those under age 45 andin the years closest to job loss, with even greater and longer-lasting effects noted in women (24).Parallel increases in rates of suicide and suicide attempts are also seen in socioeconomically de-prived geographical areas, which have larger numbers of unemployed people (386). For many individuals, unemployment occurs concomitantly with other factors that affect the risk of suicidal behaviors. For example, with job loss, financial and marital difficulties may in-crease. Alternatively, factors such as psychiatric illness (380) or adverse childhood experiences(361) may affect rates of suicidal behaviors but also influence the likelihood of gaining andmaintaining employment. Thus, while unemployment appears to be associated with some inde-pendent increase in risk, a substantial fraction of the increase in risk for suicidal behaviors amongunemployed persons can be accounted for by co-occurring factors (361, 381, 384, 385). Among individuals with alcohol use disorders, particularly those under age 45, unemploy- ment is one of a number of stressors that is a common precipitant to suicide (149, 382, 387).Even in those without substance use disorders, unemployment may result in increased drink-ing, which in turn may precipitate self-destructive behavior (154). Conversely, in those withsubstance use disorders, full-time employment protects against suicidal behaviors, a findingthat may in part relate to decreases in use of alcohol or other substances during the work week(260). Thus, unemployment may serve as a risk factor for suicide, whereas employment mayhave protective effects on suicide risks. b) Religious beliefs The likelihood of suicide may also vary with religious beliefs as well as with the extent of in-volvement in religious activities. In general, individuals are less likely to act on suicidal thoughtswhen they have a strong religious faith and believe that suicide is morally wrong or sinful. Sim-ilar findings of low suicide rates are found in cultures with strong religious beliefs that the bodyis sacred and not to be damaged intentionally. In the United States, Catholics have the lowestrate of suicide, followed by Jews, then Protestants (388). Among other religious groups, Islamictradition has consistently regarded suicide as morally wrong, and some Islamic countries havelegal sanctions for attempted suicide (389, 390). In some countries, suicide rates among Mus-lims appear to be greater than those among Hindus (391, 392), although suicide rates acrosscountries do not appear to vary with the proportion of Muslims in the population (393). Additional evidence suggests that it is the strength of the religious beliefs and not the specific religion per se that alters suicide rates (43, 394-398). In the African American community, forexample, religion is viewed as a source of social solidarity and hope (22). Religious involvementmay also help to buffer acculturative stress, which is associated with depression and suicidalideation (43). The religious belief system itself and the practice of spiritual techniques may alsodecrease suicide risk by acting as a coping mechanism and providing a source of hope and pur-pose.

For example, suicide may be more likely to occur among cultures in which death by sui- cide is a traditionally accepted way of dealing with distress or in religions that deemphasize theboundaries between the living and the dead. Particularly for adolescents, belief in an afterlifemay lead to suicide in an effort to rejoin a deceased loved one. Thus, it is important to gain anunderstanding of the specific religious beliefs and religious involvement of individuals and alsoto inquire how these religious beliefs relate to thoughts and conceptions of suicide. c) Psychosocial support The presence of a social support system is another factor that may reduce suicide risk (399,400). Consequently, communicating with members of the patient's support network may beimportant in assessing and helping to strengthen social supports (see Section V .C, \"Commu-nication With Significant Others\"). Although social supports typically include family membersor friends, individuals may also receive support from other sources. For example, those in themilitary and those who belong to religious, community, or self-help organizations may receivesupport through these affiliations. In addition to determining whether a support system is present, the clinician should assess the patient's perception of available social supports. Individuals who report having more friendsand less subjective loneliness are less likely to have suicidal ideation or engage in suicidal behav-iors (401). By the same token, if other social supports are not available, living alone may increasesuicide risk (149, 385, 402), although this is not invariably true (343, 403, 404). Family discord,other relationship problems, and social isolation may also increase risk (403, 405, 406). Risk ofsuicidal behaviors may also increase when an individual rightly or wrongly fears that an interper-sonal loss will occur (149). Thus, in estimating suicide risk, the clinician should assess the pa-tient's support network as well as his or her perception of available social supports. d) Reasons for living, including children in the home An additional protective factor against suicidal behaviors is the ability to cite reasons for living(231, 407), which reflects the patient's degree of optimism about life. A sense of responsibility tofamily, particularly children, is a commonly cited reason for living that makes suicide a less viableoption to escape from pain. The presence of children in the home as well as the number of chil-dren appear to decrease the risk for suicide in women (26, 47). Although less well-studied, asmaller effect on suicide potential may also be present in men who have children under age 18within the home (408). Thus, knowledge of the patient's specific reasons for living, including in-formation about whether there are children in the home, can help inform estimates of suicide risk. e) Individual psychological strengths and vulnerabilities Estimates of suicide risk should also incorporate an assessment of the patient's strengths and vul-nerabilities as an individual. For example, healthy and well-developed coping skills may bufferstressful life events, decreasing the likelihood of suicidal actions (409). Conversely, lifelong pat-terns of problematic coping skills are common among those who die by suicide (410). Such fac-tors may be particularly important in patients with substance use or personality disorders, forwhom heightened suicide risk may be associated with life stressors or interpersonal loss. In addition to the diagnosis of categorical axis II disorders, as discussed elsewhere, dimen- sional and trait approaches to personality can also inform estimates of suicide risk. Althoughthe positive correlation value of individual personality traits with suicide is low, increased suiciderisk may be associated with antisocial traits (411) as well as with hostility, helplessness/depen-dency, and social disengagement/self-consciousness (246). Extensive clinical literature and clinical consensus support the role of psychodynamics in assess- ing a patient's risk for suicidal behavior (409, 410, 412-419). Suicide may have multiple motiva-tions such as anger turned inward or a wish of death toward others that is redirected toward the Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Other motivations include revenge, reunion, or rebirth. Another key psychodynamic concept is the interpretation of suicide as rooted in a triad of motivations: the wish to die, the wish to kill,and the wish to be killed (415). Other clinicians have conceptualized these motivations as escape(the wish to die), anger or revenge (the wish to kill), and guilt (the wish to be killed). The presenceof one or several of these motivations can inform the psychiatrist about a patient's suicide risk. Object relations theories offer important concepts for psychodynamic formulations of suicide. Suicidal behavior has been associated with poor object relations, the inability to maintain a stable,accurate, and emotionally balanced memory of the people in one's life (413). In some cases thewish to destroy the lives of the survivors is a powerful motivator (415, 420). For other individuals,a sadistic internal object is so tormenting that the only possible outcome is to submit to the tor-mentor through suicide (416, 417). Other important psychodynamic concepts for the clinician to assess are shame, worthless- ness, and impaired self-esteem. Early disturbance in parent-child relationships through failureof empathy or traumatic loss can result in an increased vulnerability to later injuries of self-esteem. These patients are vulnerable to narcissistic injuries, which can trigger psychic pain oruncontrollable negative affects. In these situations some patients may experience thoughts ofdeath as peaceful, believing that their personal reality is emotionally intolerable and that it ispossible to end pain by stopping consciousness. Suicidal individuals are often ambivalent about making a suicidal action. As a result, suicide is less likely if an individual sees alternative strategies to address psychological pain (410). How-ever, certain traits and cognitive styles limit this ability to recognize other options. For example,thought constriction and polarized, all-or-nothing thinking are characterized by rigid thinkingand an inability to consider different options and may increase the likelihood of suicide (410,421-423). Individuals who are high in neuroticism and low in \"openness to experience\" (affec-tively blunted and preferring the familiar, practical, and concrete) may also be at greater riskfor suicide (424). Perfectionism with excessively high self-expectation is another factor that hasbeen noted in clinical practice to be a possible contributor to suicide risk (425). As already dis-cussed, pessimism and hopelessness may also act in a trait-dependent fashion and further in-fluence individual risk. In estimating suicide risk it is therefore important for the clinician to appreciate the contri- butions of patients' individual traits, early or traumatic history, ability to manage affects includ-ing psychological pain, past response to stress, current object relations, and ability to use externalresources during crises. Identifying these issues may help the psychiatrist in assessing suicide risk.In addition, gaining an empathic understanding of the patient's unique motivations for suicidein the context of past experiences will aid in developing rapport as well as in formulating andimplementing a psychotherapeutic plan to reduce suicide risk (410, 412, 421, 426). 8. Degree of suicidality a) Presence, extent, and persistence of suicidal ideationSuicidal ideation is an important determinant of risk because it precedes suicide. Moreover, sui-cidal ideation is common, with an estimated annual incidence of 5.6% (2) and estimated life-time prevalence of 13.5% (427). Since the majority of individuals with suicidal ideation willnot die by suicide, the clinician should consider factors that may increase risk among individ-uals with suicidal ideation. Although current suicidal ideation increases suicide risk (78, 79),death from suicide is even more strongly correlated with the worst previous suicidal ideation(273, 428). Thus, during the suicide assessment, it is important to determine the presence,magnitude, and persistence of current as well as past suicidal ideation. In addition to reporting suicidal ideation per se, patients may report thoughts of death that may be nonspecific (\"life is not worth living\") or specific (\"I wish I were dead\"). These reports shouldalso be assessed through further questioning since they may serve as a prelude to later development Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

At the same time, individuals with suicidal ideation will oftendeny such ideas even when asked directly (218, 429-431). Given these associations of suicide withsuicidal ideation, the presence of suicidal ideation indicates a need for aggressive intervention. Atthe same time, since as many as a quarter of suicide attempts occur impulsively (432), the absenceof suicidal ideation does not eliminate risk for suicidal behaviors. b) Presence of a suicide plan and availability of a method Determining whether or not the patient has developed a suicide plan is a key part of assessingsuicide risk. For many patients, the formation of a suicide plan precedes a suicidal act, typicallywithin 1 year of the onset of suicidal ideation (427). A suicide plan entails more than simply areference to a particular method of harm and includes at least several of the following elements:timing, availability of method, setting, and actions made in furtherance of the plan (procuringa method, \"scoping out\" the setting, rehearsing the plan in any way). The more detailed andspecific the suicide plan, the greater will be the level of risk. Plans that use lethal methods orare formulated to avoid detection are particularly indicative of high risk (433). Access to suicidemethods, particularly lethal methods, also increases suicide risk. Even in the absence of a spe-cific suicide plan, impulsive actions may end in suicide if lethal methods are readily accessible.Thus, it is important to determine access to methods for any patient who is at risk for suicideor displays suicidal ideation. In the United States, geographic variations in rates of firearm suicide parallel variations in the rates of gun ownership (434). Although individuals may opt for a different suicide method whena particular method is otherwise unavailable, studies show some decreases in overall suicide rateswith restrictions in access to lethal suicide methods (e.g., domestic gas and paracetamol) (435-437). Men are most likely to use firearms in suicidal acts, but other specific populations at in-creased risk of using firearms include African Americans, elderly persons, and married women.In adolescents and possibly in other age groups, the presence of firearms may be an independentrisk factor for suicide (438). Consequently, if the patient has access to a firearm, the psychiatristis advised to discuss with and recommend to the patient or a significant other the importance ofrestricting access to, securing, or removing this and other weapons. In addition to addressing access to firearms, clinicians should recognize the potential lethal- ity of other suicide methods to which the patient may have access. As with restrictions for fire-arms, it is important for the psychiatrist to work with the patient, family members, and othersocial support persons in restricting the patient's access to potentially lethal suicide methods,particularly during periods of enhanced risk. Removal of such methods from a patient's pres-ence does not remove the risk for suicide, but it removes the potential for the patient to impul-sively gain access to the means with which to carry out a suicidal wish. c) Lethality and intent of self-destructive behavior Suicidal intent refers to the patient's subjective expectation and desire to die as a result of a self-inflicted injury. This expectation may or may not correspond to the lethality of an attempt,which represents the medical likelihood that death will result from use of a given method. Forexample, some patients may make a nonlethal attempt with the intention of being saved andgetting help, whereas others may make a nonlethal attempt, thinking it will kill them. From thestandpoint of suicide risk assessment, the strength of the patient's intent to die and his or hersubjective belief about the lethality of a method are more relevant than the objective lethality ofthe chosen method (439, 440). The presence of a suicide note also indicates intensification of asuicidal idea and/or plan and generally signifies premeditation and greater suicidal intent. Re-gardless of whether the patient has attempted suicide or is displaying suicidal ideation, the cli-nician should assess the timing and content of any suicide note and discuss its meaning with thepatient. The more specifically a note refers to actual suicide or steps to be taken after death, the Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Factors separating suicide attempters who go on to make future fatal versus nonfatal attempts include an initial attempt with highintent (164, 441), having taken measures to avoid discovery (224), and having used more lethalmethods that resulted in physical injuries (263), all of which indicate a greater degree of suicidalintent. Consequently, suicidal intent should be assessed in any patient with suicidal ideation. Inaddition, for any patient who has made a prior suicide attempt, the level of intent at the time ofthe suicide attempt should be determined. /L50776 F. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS WHEN EVALUATING PATIENTS IN SPECIFIC TREATMENT SETTINGS 1. Inpatient settings Patients are often admitted to an inpatient unit in the midst of an acute suicidal crisis with ei-ther overt suicidal behavior or intense suicidal ideation. Even when a patient who is not in anacute suicidal crisis is admitted, the symptoms and disorders that typically lead to psychiatrichospitalization are associated with an increased suicide risk. There do not appear to be specificrisk factors that are unique to the inpatient setting, with about half of inpatient suicides in arecent study involving individuals with prior suicide attempts and about half occurring in in-dividuals with psychosis (218). Inpatient suicides also cannot be predicted by the reason forhospitalization, since fewer than half of the patients who die by suicide in the hospital wereadmitted with suicidal ideation and only a quarter were admitted after a suicide attempt. How-ever, extreme agitation or anxiety (218) or a rapidly fluctuating course (442) is common beforesuicide. Thus, it is important to conduct a suicide risk assessment, as discussed earlier, whenindividuals are admitted for inpatient treatment, when changes in observation status or treat-ment setting occur, when there are significant changes in the patient's clinical condition, orwhen acute psychosocial stressors come to light in the course of the hospitalization. For patientswith repeated hospitalizations for suicidality, each suicidal crisis must be treated as new witheach admission and assessed accordingly. 2. Outpatient settings An initial evaluation of a patient in an office-based setting should be comprehensive and includea suicide assessment. The intensity and depth of the suicide assessment will depend on the pa-tient's clinical presentation. In following outpatients over time, the psychiatrist should be awarethat suicidality may wax and wane in the course of treatment. Sudden changes in clinical status,which may include worsening or precipitous and unexpected improvements in reported symp-toms, require that suicidality be reconsidered. Furthermore, risk may also be increased by thelack of a reliable therapeutic alliance, by the patient's unwillingness to engage in psychotherapyor adhere to medication treatment, or by inadequate family or social supports. Again, however,the frequency, intensity, and depth of the suicide assessment will depend on the patient's clinicalstate, past history, and other factors, including individual strengths, vulnerabilities, and stressorsthat will simultaneously influence risk. These factors will also be important in judging whenfamily members or other significant support persons may need to be contacted. 3. Emergency settings Regardless of the patient's presenting problem, the suicide assessment is an integral part of thepsychiatric evaluation in an emergency setting. As in the inpatient setting, substantial numbersof individuals present to emergency settings with suicidal ideation or after having made a sui-cide attempt (443-447). Even when suicidality is not a part of the initial presentation, the ma-jority of individuals seen in emergency psychiatric settings have diagnoses that are associatedwith an increased risk of suicide (268, 269, 271, 275, 448).

For permission for reuse, visit APPI Permissions & Licensing Center at http://www.appi.org/CustomerService/Pages/Permissions.aspx.48 APA Practice GuidelinesAs the suicide assessment proceeds, the psychiatrist should be alert for previously unrecog- nized symptoms of trauma or toxicity resulting from ingestions. Ambivalence is a key element in individuals presenting with suicidality, and individuals may simultaneously seek help yetwithhold information about recent ingestions (449) or self-induced trauma. Thus, in additionto initially assessing the patient's vital signs, the psychiatrist should investigate any changes inthe patient's physical condition or level of consciousness that may develop during the course ofthe evaluation. For patients who are administered medications in the emergency area or whohave concomitant alcohol or substance use, serial monitoring of vital signs is important to de-tect adverse events or signs of substance withdrawal. Simultaneous presentation with intoxication and suicidality is common in emergency set- tings (444, 450-454) and requires some modification in the assessment process. Depending onthe severity of the intoxication, medical intervention may be needed before psychiatric assess-ment begins. Also, it is often necessary to maintain the patient in a safe setting until the intoxi-cation resolves and a thorough suicide assessment can be done. In this regard, some institutionsfind it helpful to quantify the level of intoxication (with serum alcohol levels or breath alcoholmeasurements), since some individuals may not show physical symptoms of intoxication despitesubstantially elevated blood alcohol concentrations (455). At some facilities, short-term obser-vation beds are available in the emergency area or elsewhere for monitoring and serial assessmentsof intoxicated individuals who present with suicidality. At other facilities, such observation mayneed to be carried out in a more typical medical or psychiatric inpatient setting. Although obtaining collateral information is useful with all suicidal individuals, in the emergency setting such information is particularly important to obtain from involved familymembers, from those who live with the patient, and from professionals who are currently treat-ing the patient. Patients in emergency settings may not always share all of the potentially rele-vant aspects of their recent symptoms and their past psychiatric history, including treatmentadherence. In addition, most psychiatrists who evaluate patients in emergency settings do nothave the benefit of knowing and working with the patient on a longitudinal basis. Corrobora-tion of history is particularly important when aspects of the clinical picture do not correspondto other aspects of the patient's history or mental state. Examples include patients who denysuicidal ideas and request discharge yet who made a highly lethal suicide attempt with clear sui-cidal intent or those who request admission on the basis of command hallucinations whileseeming relaxed and jovial and without appearing to respond to internal stimuli. The process by which the patient arrived at the emergency department can provide helpful in- formation about his or her insight into having an illness or needing treatment. T ypically, individ-uals who are self-referred have greater insight than those who are brought to the hospital by policeor who reluctantly arrive with family members. For individuals who are brought to the emergencydepartment by police (or as a result of a legally defined process such as an emergency petition), itis particularly important to address the reasons for the referral in estimating suicide risk. 4. Long-term care facilities When evaluating patients in long-term care facilities, psychiatrists and staff should be aware ofthe varied forms that suicidality may take in such settings. In particular, it is important to rec-ognize that indirect self-destructive acts are found among both men and women with chronicmedical conditions (456-459) and are a common manifestation of suicide in institutional set-tings (460). Despite these occurrences, suicide rates in long-term care facilities are generallylower than expected (460, 461), perhaps as a result of greater supervision and residents' limitedaccess to potentially lethal means and physical inability to carry out the act as well as under-reporting or misattribution of self-destructive behaviors to accident or natural death (66). Risk factors for suicide and other self-destructive behaviors are similar to those assessed in other settings of care. For example, 90% or more of randomly sampled residents of long-termcare facilities have been shown to have a diagnosable psychiatric illness (462, 463), with the prev- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Physical illness, functional impairment, and pain are associated with increased risk for suicide and are ubiquitousfactors in long-term care facilities. Hopelessness (228) and personality styles that impede ad-aptation to a dependent role in the institutional setting also play a role (464). When treating individuals in long-term care facilities, the psychiatrist should be mindful of the need for follow-up assessments, even when initial evaluation does not show evidence of depressionor increased risk for suicide or other self-injurious behaviors. To facilitate early intervention, safetyand suicide risk should be reassessed with significant changes in behavior, psychiatric symptoms,medical status, and/or level of functional disability. Psychiatrists can also play a critical role in ed-ucating long-term care providers about risk factors and warning signs for suicide in residents undertheir care. 5. Jail and correctional facilities In jails, prisons, and other correctional facilities, most initial mental health assessments are notdone by psychiatrists (465, 466); however, psychiatrists are often asked to perform urgent sui-cide assessments for individuals identified as being at risk. The actual rates of suicide in jailsand in prisons are somewhat controversial, and reported rates depend on the method by whichthey are calculated (467). The U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics reportedthat the rate of suicide per 100,000 prison inmates was 14 during 1999, compared with 55 per100,000 jail inmates (468). However, reported rates are generally based on the average dailycensus of the facility. Since jails are local facilities used for the confinement of persons awaitingtrial and those convicted of minor crimes, whereas prisons are usually under state control andare used to confine persons serving sentences for serious crimes, jails have a much more rapidturnover of detainees than prisons. This turnover results in a higher reported rate of suicidesper 100,000 incarcerated persons in jails relative to prisons, since annual jail admissions aremore than 20 times the average daily jail census, whereas the annual number of persons admit-ted to prisons nationwide is about 50% of the average daily prison census. Reported suiciderates in jails are also elevated relative to those in prisons because the majority of suicides in jailoccur during the first 24 hours of incarceration (469, 470). The importance of identification and assessment of individuals at increased risk for suicide is underscored by the fact that suicide is one of the leading causes of death in correctional set-tings. For example, from July 1, 1998, to June 30, 1999, natural causes other than AIDS barelyled suicide as the leading cause of death in jails. Between 1995 and 1999, suicide was the thirdleading cause of death in prisons, after natural causes other than AIDS and deaths due to AIDS(468). In relative terms, suicides among youths in juvenile detention and correctional facilitiesare about four times more frequent, suicide rates for men in jails are about nine to 15 timesgreater, and the suicide rate in prisons is about one-and-a-half times greater than the suiciderate in the general population (471). Factors that increase risk in other populations are very prevalent and contribute to increased risk in correctional populations (472, 473). Persons who die by suicide in jails have been con-sistently shown to be young, white, single, intoxicated individuals with a history of substanceabuse (470, 474-476). Suicide in correctional facilities generally occurs by hanging, with bedclothing most commonly used (470, 474, 476-478). It is not clear whether first-time nonvio-lent offenders (474, 476) or violent offenders (473, 477) are at greater risk. Most (473, 474,476, 479) but not all (480) investigators have reported that isolation may increase suicide incorrectional facilities and should be avoided. While inmates may become suicidal anytime dur-ing their incarceration, there are times when the risks of suicidal behavior may be heightened.Experience has shown that suicidal behaviors increase immediately on entry into the facility,after new legal complications with the inmate's case (e.g., denial of parole), after inmates receivebad news about loved ones at home, or after sexual assault or other trauma (471).

Consequently, the standards of the National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) requirejails and prisons to have a written policy and defined procedures for identifying and respondingto suicidal inmates, including procedures for training, identification, monitoring, referral, eval-uation, housing, communication, intervention, notification, reporting, review, and critical in-cident stress debriefing (484, 485). Other useful resources include a widely used instrument forsuicide screening (486) and the detailed discussions of specific approaches to suicidal detaineesthat are provided in a later NCCHC publication (487). III. PSYCHIATRIC MANAGEMENT Psychiatric management consists of a broad array of interventions and approaches that shouldbe instituted by psychiatrists for all patients with suicidal behaviors. Psychiatric managementserves as the framework by which the patient and psychiatrist will collaborate in the ongoingprocesses of assessing and monitoring the patient's clinical status, choosing among specifictreatments, and coordinating the various treatment components. Psychiatric management in-cludes establishing and maintaining a therapeutic alliance; attending to the patient's safety; anddetermining the patient's psychiatric status, level of functioning, and clinical needs to arrive ata plan and setting for treatment. For individuals with suicidal behaviors, such treatment plan-ning will encompass interventions targeted to suicidality per se as well as therapeutic approach-es designed to address psychosocial or interpersonal difficulties and any axis I and axis IIdisorders that may be present. Once a plan of treatment has been established with the patient,additional goals of psychiatric management include facilitating treatment adherence and pro-viding education to patients and, when indicated, family members and significant others. /L50776 A. ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE Beginning with the initial encounter with the patient, the psychiatrist should attempt to buildtrust, establish mutual respect, and develop a therapeutic relationship with the patient. Suicidalideation and behaviors can be explored and addressed within the context of this cooperativedoctor-patient relationship, with the ultimate goal of reducing suicide risk. This relationshipalso provides a context in which additional psychiatric symptoms or syndromes can be evalu-ated and treated. At the same time, the psychiatrist should recognize that an individual who isdetermined to die may not be motivated to develop a cooperative doctor-patient relationshipand indeed may view the psychiatrist as an adversary. Appreciating the patient's relationship toand with significant others can help inform the clinician about the patient's potential to forma strong therapeutic relationship. In addition, the therapeutic alliance can be enhanced by pay-ing careful attention to the concerns of patients and their family members as well as their wishesfor treatment. Empathy (488, 489) and understanding of the suicidal individual (488-491) arealso important in establishing a therapeutic psychiatrist-patient relationship, helping the pa-tient feel emotionally supported, and increasing the patient's sense of possible choices otherthan suicide (492). In this manner, a positive and cooperative psychotherapeutic relationshipcan be an invaluable and even life-sustaining force for suicidal patients. In caring for potentially suicidal patients, the psychiatrist will need to manage the often competing goals of encouraging the patient's independence yet simultaneously addressing safe-ty. In addition, the psychiatrist should be aware of his or her own emotions and reactions tothe suicidal patient that may influence the patient's care (488). Psychiatrists should acknowl-edge the unique place that they may hold in a patient's life, often seeming to be the only source Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

At the same time, the clinician must guard against falling into the role of constant savior (490, 491). Suicidal patients may wish to be taken care of uncondition-ally (493, 494) or alternatively, to assign others the responsibility for keeping them alive (490).Therapists who are drawn into the role of savior with suicidal patients often operate on the con-scious or unconscious assumption that they can provide the love and concern that others havenot, thus magically transforming the patient's wish to die into a desire to live (420, 490). Undersuch circumstances, or if the therapist uses defensive reaction formation to deny hostile feelingstoward the patient, the therapist may go to great lengths to assure the patient that he or she hasonly positive feelings about the patient and will do whatever is necessary to save the patient'slife. In the worst-case scenario, this need to demonstrate one's caring may contribute to bound-ary crossings or outright boundary violations (495). Also, by producing false or unrealistichopes, the psychiatrist may ultimately disappoint the patient by not fulfilling those expecta-tions. Thus, the psychiatrist must remember that taking responsibility for a patient's care is notthe same as taking responsibility for a patient's life. Suicidal patients can also activate a clinician's own latent emotions about death and suicide, leading to a number of defensive responses on the part of the clinician (426). On one hand,there is a potential to develop countertransference hate and anger at suicidal patients (496) thatmay be manifested by rejecting behavior on the part of the clinician (488). At the other ex-treme, the clinician may avoid patients who bring up his or her own anxieties surrounding sui-cide (426, 490). Clinicians may also overestimate the patient's capabilities, creating unrealisticand overwhelming expectations for the patient. Conversely, they may become enveloped by thepatient's sense of hopelessness and despair and become discouraged about the progress of treat-ment and the patient's capacity to improve (488). Thus, management of the therapeutic alli-ance should include an awareness of transference and countertransference issues, regardless ofthe theoretical approach used for psychotherapy and regardless of whether these issues are di-rectly addressed in treatment. In this regard, the use of consultation with a senior colleaguewith experience and some expertise in the management of suicidal patients may be helpful. Itis also important to keep in mind that the course and conduct of treatment may be influencedby gender and cultural differences between patients and therapists as well as by cultural differ-ences between patients and other aspects of the care delivery system. /L50776 B. ATTEND TO THE PATIENT'S SAFETY Although it is impossible to prevent all self-injurious actions including actual suicide, it is criti-cally important to attend to the patient's safety and work to minimize self-endangering behaviorsthroughout the evaluation and treatment process. The preceding sections have discussed an or-derly process for assessing the patient, estimating suicide risk, and then instituting interventionsto target that risk. In actual practice, however, some interventions may be needed to address thepatient's safety while the initial evaluation proceeds. For example, in emergency or inpatient set-tings, specific interventions may include ordering observation of the patient on a one-to-one ba-sis or by continuous closed-circuit television monitoring, removing potentially hazardous itemsfrom the patient's room, and securing the patient's belongings (since purses and backpacks maycontain weapons, cigarette lighters or matches, and medications or other potentially toxic sub-stances). If restraints are indicated, continuous observation is also recommended (497, 498).Some institutions screen patients for potentially dangerous items by searching patients or scan-ning them with metal detectors (499). In addition, some institutions have policies prohibitingany guns in emergency areas, since police or security officers' weapons may be taken by suicidalpatients. In other circumstances, such as with agitated, uncooperative, intoxicated, or medicallyill patients, significant time may elapse before it will be possible to complete a full psychiatricevaluation, including a suicide assessment. Under such conditions, the psychiatrist will need touse the information that is available to make a clinical judgment, with steps being taken to en-hance the patient's safety in the interim.

DETERMINE A TREATMENT SETTING T reatment settings include a continuum of possible levels of care, from involuntary hospital- izations to partial hospital and intensive outpatient programs to more typical ambulatory set-tings. In general, patients should be treated in the setting that is least restrictive yet most likelyto prove safe and effective. In addition, the optimal treatment setting and the patient's abilityto benefit from a different level of care should be reevaluated on an ongoing basis throughoutthe course of treatment. The choice of an appropriate site of treatment will generally occur after the psychiatrist eval- uates the patient's clinical condition, including specific psychiatric disorder(s) and symptoms(e.g., hopelessness, impulsiveness, anxiety), symptom severity, level of functioning, available sup-port system, and activities that give the patient a reason to live. The psychiatrist should also con-sider whether or not the current suicidality is related to an interpersonal crisis such as a recentseparation, loss of a loved one, or other trauma. The estimate of suicide risk will obviously be animportant component of the choice of treatment setting, and the potential for dangerousness toothers should also be taken into consideration. Under some clinical circumstances, a decision forhospitalization may need to be made on the basis of high potential dangerousness to self or oth-ers, even if additional history is unavailable or if the patient is unable to cooperate with the psy-chiatric evaluation (e.g., in the presence of extreme agitation, psychosis, or catatonia). At thesame time, the benefits of intensive interventions such as hospitalization must be weighedagainst their possible negative effects (e.g., disruption of employment, financial and other psy-chosocial stress, persistent societal stigma). Other aspects to be incorporated into the determina-tion of a treatment setting include the patient's ability to provide adequate self-care, understandthe risks and benefits of various treatment approaches, understand what to do in a crisis (e.g.,contact family members or other support persons, contact the psychiatrist, seek emergency care),give reliable feedback to the psychiatrist, and cooperate with treatment planning and implemen-tation. Consequently, choice of a specific treatment setting will not depend entirely on the esti-mate of suicide risk but rather will rely on the balance between these various elements. Anoverview of factors to consider in determining a setting for treatment is provided in Table 8. Hospitalization should always be viewed as a possible intervention and should be considered whenever the patient's safety is in question. Hospitalization, by itself, is not a treatment. Rather, itis a treatment setting that may facilitate the evaluation and treatment of a suicidal person. In addi-tion, inpatient settings can implement approaches such as constant observation, seclusion, or phys-ical or pharmacological restraint that may restrict an individual's ability to act on suicidal impulses.Although such interventions may delay suicide and permit initiation of treatment approaches, thereis no empirical evidence that these methods reduce the incidence of suicide in the long term (77,500, 501). In addition, hospitals must balance requirements for security against the patient's needto prepare to return to independent living in the community. Since patients cannot be continuouslyobserved or restrained, they can and do die by suicide while hospitalized. In fact, it is estimated thatapproximately 1,500 inpatient suicides occur in the United States each year, with about a third ofthese occurring while patients are on one-to-one observation or every-15-minute checks (218). Although no guidelines regarding hospitalization decisions can be absolute, inpatient care is usually indicated for individuals who are considered to pose a serious threat of harm to themselvesor others. Other indications for hospitalization include factors based on illness (e.g., symptom se-verity, violent or uncontrollable behavior) and those based on the intensity of services needed(e.g., a need for continuous skilled observation; complicated medication trials, particularly for anelderly or a medically fragile patient; ECT; clinical tests or diagnostic evaluation that cannot beperformed on an outpatient basis). Severely ill individuals may require hospitalization if they can-not be maintained safely in a less restrictive environment or if they lack adequate structure andsocial support outside of a hospital setting. More intensive treatment will also be called for when-ever there is a new, acute presentation that is not part of a repetitive pattern.

Inpatient care may also be necessary at lower levels of suicide risk in geographic areas where partial hospital or intensiveoutpatient programs are not readily accessible. If the clinician is not the patient's regular healthcare provider, does not have an ongoing relationship with the patient, or otherwise does not knowthe patient well and does not have access to the patient's history or medical records, hospitaliza-tion may be necessary until further data can be collected. More intensive treatment may also benecessary even for patients with lesser degrees of suicidality if the patient lacks a strong psycho-social support system, is unable to gain timely access to outpatient care, has limited insight intothe need for treatment, or is unable to adhere to recommendations for ambulatory follow-up. The hospital length of stay should similarly be determined by the ability of the patient to receive the needed care safely in a less intensive environment. In addition, before the patient istransitioned to a less restrictive setting, the patient's condition should show evidence of beingimproved and more stable both in the estimated level of suicide risk and in the symptoms ofany associated psychiatric disorders. Less intensive treatment may be more appropriate if suicidal ideation or attempts are part of a chronic, repetitive cycle and the patient is aware of the chronicity. For such patients, suicidal ide-ation may be a characteristic response to disappointment or a way to cope with psychological dis-tress. If the patient has a history of suicidal ideation without suicidal intent and an ongoing doctor-patient relationship, the benefits of continued treatment outside the hospital may outweigh thepossible detrimental effects of hospitalization even in the presence of serious psychiatric symptoms. When considering hospitalization, the risk of suicide is not the only factor to take into ac- count. Patients may feel humiliated or frightened in the hospital rather than experience a senseof emotional relief. Hospitalization can also be associated with realistic life stressors, includingthe social and financial burdens of having received inpatient treatment. For some patients, treat-ment in a restrictive setting such as an inpatient unit may foster dependency and a regressive,vicious cycle of intensifying suicidal thoughts requiring ever more restrictive care. Such individ-uals, most notably those with personality disorders, suffer chronic morbidity if they are neversupportively challenged to bear painful feelings. In addition, some patients may gain positive re-inforcement from hospitalization and repeatedly harm themselves with the goal of regaining ad-mission. Psychiatric hospitalization may also arouse unrealistic expectations in patients, familymembers, therapists, and medical and nursing staff members. Often, a plea for hospitalizationcomes from a sense of exasperation on the part of an individual involved with the patient's situ-ation. When hospital treatment does not meet these unrealistic expectations, the associated dis-illusionment may contribute to hopelessness and have a negative effect on future therapeuticrelationships. The inpatient admission process itself may also cause the patient to mistrust men-tal health professionals, particularly when hospitalization occurs on an involuntary basis. Thus,the clinician's key responsibility is to weigh the risks and benefits of hospitalization before andduring admission (especially around decisions related to therapeutic passes and privilege levels)and ultimately when contemplating discharge (502). Moreover, a person's right to privacy andself-determination (which includes the right to be treated in the least restrictive environment)must be balanced against the issue of potential dangerousness to self or others. If hospitalization is indicated, the psychiatrist must next decide whether it should occur on a voluntary or involuntary basis. This decision will also depend on multiple factors, including theestimated level of risk to the patient and others, the patient's level of insight and willingness toseek care, and the legal criteria for involuntary hospitalization in that jurisdiction. In general, pa-tients at imminent risk for suicide will satisfy the criteria for involuntary hospitalization; howev-er, the specific commitment criteria vary from state to state (503), and in some states, willingnessto enter a hospital voluntarily may preclude involuntary admission. T o that end, psychiatristsshould be familiar with their specific state statutes regarding involuntary hospitalization. Patients who are not assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide and who do not require inpa- tient treatment for other reasons may be suitable for treatment on an outpatient basis.

Either of the latter settings may function as a \"step-down\" from inpatient treatment or asa \"step-up\" from outpatient therapy, if once- or twice-a-week therapy is insufficient to maintainthe patient's stabilization. For patients at significant risk for suicide in these treatment programs,a member of the treatment team must be available to respond to emergencies by telephone, beep-er, or other means of contact. In military settings, \"unit watch\" protocols may be activated to lookafter the patient between treatment sessions. For patients who continue to be followed by an out-side therapist or psychiatrist while in a partial hospital or intensive outpatient treatment program,regular communication among treating professionals is important. Communication with signif-icant others is also helpful, and appropriate supervision and supports should be available and mayinclude a plan for continued after-hours monitoring. If such supervision is not possible, a higherlevel of care (i.e., inpatient admission) may be needed to maintain the patient's safety even at low-er levels of suicide risk. Worsening of a patient's condition, with a concomitant increase in the riskof suicide, requires the careful assessment of the patient's risk for suicide and possible hospitaliza-tion. Discharge planning should include appropriate continuing treatment to maintain stabilitygains and to continue monitoring of suicide risk. Under some circumstances, individuals who are not currently engaged in outpatient treat- ment may be referred for care after a suicide attempt or emergency department visit in whichsuicidality was at issue. Since adherence is often a problem when individuals are referred foroutpatient follow-up from emergency departments (448, 504), it may be helpful to discuss thereferral with the patient during the course of the interview and if possible arrange a specific ap-pointment time (505-507). When determining a treatment setting in emergency situations, itis also important to consider the potential effects of countertransference and lack of knowledgeabout suicidality on clinical decision making, since individuals who present with suicidal ideasor attempts may engender a broad range of countertherapeutic reactions in medical profession-als, including antipathy, anger, helplessness, and indifference (445, 450, 508-510). /L50776 D. DEVELOP A PLAN OF TREATMENT Individuals with suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors may benefit from a variety of treatments.If the patient is at risk for suicide, a plan that integrates a range of biological and psychosocialtherapies may increase the likelihood of a successful outcome. Choosing among possible treat-ments requires knowledge of the potential beneficial and adverse effects of each option alongwith information about the patient's preferences. In addition, treatment decisions should becontinually reassessed as new information becomes available, the patient's clinical status chang-es, or both. For patients in ongoing treatment, this may mean that existing treatment plans willrequire modification as suicidal ideas or behaviors emerge or wane. Thus, treatment planningis an iterative process in which the psychiatrist works with the patient to implement and modifytreatments over time, depending on the patient's responses and preferences. Depending on theclinical circumstances, it may be important for the treatment planning process to include fam-ily members or other significant supports (e.g., military unit personnel, community residenceor adult home providers, case management staff). More detail on the specific therapeuticapproaches discussed subsequently can be found in APA practice guidelines that discusstreatment of specific psychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (511), bipolardisorder (512), schizophrenia (513), panic disorder (514), and borderline personality disorder(515). Psychiatrists should be cautioned against developing a treatment plan in which the stated goal is to \"eliminate\" suicide risk; this is impossible to do for the reasons already discussed.Instead, the goals of treatment should include a comprehensive approach to treatment with themajor focus directed at reducing risk. Since individuals with suicidal behaviors often have axis I Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Given the high rates of comorbid alcohol and substance use among individuals with suicidalbehaviors, it is particularly important to address substance use disorders in the treatment plan(516). Medical disorders and treatments for those disorders will also need to be considered indeveloping a plan of treatment for the patient with suicidal behaviors. In the early stages of treatment, more intense follow-up may be needed to provide support for the patient as well as to monitor and rapidly institute treatment for relevant symptoms suchas anxiety, insomnia, or hopelessness. In addition, it is during the early stages of illness that de-nial of symptoms and lack of insight into the need for treatment are likely to be most promi-nent, and, therefore, specific education and supportive psychotherapy are required to targetthese issues. Appreciating the patient's past responses to stress, vulnerability to life-threateningaffects, available external resources, death fantasies, and capacity for reality testing may help theclinician to weigh the strengths and vulnerabilities of the individual patient (412) and may aidin the planning of treatment. For patients treated in ambulatory settings, it is also importantfor the psychiatrist to review with the patient guidelines for managing exacerbations of suicidaltendencies or other symptoms that may occur between scheduled sessions and could contributeto increased suicide risk. /L50776 E. COORDINATE CARE AND COLLABORATE WITH OTHER CLINICIANS Providing optimal treatment for patients with suicidal behaviors frequently involves a multi-disciplinary treatment team that includes several mental health professionals. While ongoingcoordination of the overall treatment plan is generally easier to implement in inpatient or par-tial hospital settings as opposed to less integrated ambulatory settings, useful strategies for co-ordination in any treatment setting include clear role definitions, regular communicationamong team members, and advance planning for management of crises. It is also helpful toclarify with the patient that a number of individuals will be involved in his or her care and tooutline the specific roles of each. In this regard, it is important for patients to understand thattreatment team members assist the psychiatrist in many respects and may supply clinical infor-mation that will influence decisions about the level of precautions, readiness for discharge,medications, and other aspects of treatment planning. Many patients have ongoing medical illnesses for which they receive care from one or more physicians. Particularly for individuals whose medical disorders or treatments interface withtheir psychiatric symptoms or treatments, it is helpful to communicate with the patient's pri-mary care physician as well as with any specialists who are actively involved in the patient's care. In inpatient settings, the treatment team generally consists of a psychiatrist, nurses, social workers, psychologists, and other mental health workers, with the psychiatrist acting as theteam leader. In this capacity, with input from the other members of the treatment team, thepsychiatrist will make the critical decisions regarding the patient's care. Such decisions includebut are not limited to the patient's diagnosis, specific medications, level of precautions, passes,discharge, and follow-up treatment plan. Given the key roles and observations of other treat-ment team members in such decisions, the psychiatrist should encourage open communicationamong the staff members regarding historical and clinical features of the patient. In an outpatient setting, there may also be other professionals involved in the care of the patient. In some instances, the patient may be referred to individuals with expertise in symp-tom-specific treatments (e.g., cognitive behavior therapy for hopelessness or dialectical beha-vior therapy for recurrent suicidal behavior). In other instances, the psychiatrist may beproviding primarily psychopharmacologic management, with another psychiatrist or othermental health professional conducting the psychotherapy. During visits with the patient, it isimportant for the psychiatrist to review the patient's response to all aspects of the treatment. Inaddition, it is useful for the psychiatrist to communicate with the therapist and to establishguidelines or expectations as to when and under what conditions the therapist and the psychi- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Moreover, if the psychiatrist has direct supervisory responsibilities for the therapist, the level of communi-cation should be increased and may include a chart review. /L50776 F. PROMOTE ADHERENCE TO THE TREATMENT PLAN The successful treatment of many psychiatric disorders requires close adherence to treatmentplans, in some cases for long or indefinite durations. With individuals whose clinical symptomsinclude suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors, it is particularly important that management beoptimized through regular adherence with the treatment plan. Facilitating adherence beginswith the initial establishing of the physician-patient relationship and the collaborative develop-ment of a plan of care that is attentive to the needs and preferences of the individual patient.Within the therapeutic relationship the psychiatrist should create an atmosphere in which thepatient can feel free to discuss what he or she experiences as positive or negative in the treatmentprocess. Side effects or requirements of treatment are common causes of nonadherence. Othercommon contributors include financial constraints, scheduling or transportation difficulties,perceived differences of opinion with the clinician, and misunderstandings about the recom-mended plan of treatment or dosing of medications. Especially while symptomatic, patientsmay be poorly motivated, less able to care for themselves, or unduly pessimistic about theirchances of recovery with treatment, or they may suffer from memory deficits or psychosis. Insome instances, psychiatric disorders are associated with reductions in insight about having anillness or needing treatment, making adherence less likely. Particularly during maintenancephases of treatment, when symptoms are less salient, patients may tend to undervalue the ben-efits of treatment and instead focus on its burdens. The psychiatrist should recognize these pos-sibilities, encourage the patient to articulate any concerns regarding adherence, and emphasizethe importance of adherence for successful treatment and for minimizing the risk of future sui-cidal behaviors (306). Specific components of a message to the patient that have been shownto improve adherence include 1) when and how often to take the medicine, 2) the fact thatsome medications may take several weeks before beneficial effects may be noticed, 3) the needto take medication even after feeling better, 4) the need to consult with the doctor before dis-continuing medication, and 5) what to do if problems or questions arise (517). To facilitate adherence, it is helpful to reassess the treatment plan on a regular basis in collab- oration with the patient and attempt to modify it in accord with the patient's preferences andneeds. Some patients, particularly elderly patients, have been shown to have improved adherencewhen both the complexity of medication regimens and the costs of treatments are minimized.When a patient does not appear for appointments or is nonadherent in other ways, outreach, in-cluding telephone calls, may be helpful in reengaging the patient in treatment. This outreach canbe carried out by the psychiatrist or other designated team members in consultation with the psy-chiatrist. For patients in an involuntary outpatient treatment program, the judicial system mayalso be involved in outreach efforts. Severe or persistent problems of nonadherence may representpsychological conflicts or psychopathology, for which psychotherapy should be considered. Ed-ucating patients about medications, aspects of suicidality, and specific psychiatric disorders andtheir management can be useful. When family members or other supportive individuals are in-volved (e.g., military command personnel, supported housing staff), they can also benefit fromeducation and can be encouraged to play a helpful role in improving adherence. /L50776 G. PROVIDE EDUCATION TO THE PATIENT AND FAMILY Most patients can benefit from education about the symptoms and disorders being treated aswell as about the therapeutic approaches employed as part of the treatment plan. When appro-priate, and with the patient's permission, education should also be provided to involved family Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Understanding that psychiatric disorders are real illnesses and that effective treatments are both necessary and available may be crucial for patients who attribute their illness to a moraldefect or for family members who are convinced that there is nothing wrong with the patient.Patients and family members can also benefit from an understanding of the role of psychosocialstressors and other disruptions in precipitating or exacerbating suicidality or symptoms of psy-chiatric disorders. Education regarding available treatment options will help patients make in-formed decisions, anticipate side effects, and adhere to treatments. Patients also need to beadvised that improvement is not linear and that recovery may be uneven. Certain patients orfamily members may become overwhelmed or devastated by a recurrence of symptoms or a tem-porary worsening of symptoms after the initiation of treatment. Since suicidal patients tend tobe overly critical of themselves, a recurrence or worsening of symptoms may be seen as evidenceof personal failure; they need to be reassured that this can be part of the recovery process. It is also useful to have an open discussion with the patient about the phenomenon of suicide. When there has been a family history of suicide, some patients will feel that it is their fate to diefrom suicide as well. The age at which a family member died or the specific anniversary of thefamily member's death may take on special significance for some patients. Education for the pa-tient and the family should emphasize that a family history of suicide may increase risk ofsuicide, but it does not make suicide inevitable. It can be helpful to educate the patient and in-volved family members about how to identify symptoms, such as insomnia, hopelessness, anxi-ety, or depression, that may herald a worsening of the patient's clinical condition. In addition,patients and family members should be encouraged to think about other symptoms, specific tothe individual patient, that have been associated with suicidality in the past. Furthermore, pa-tients and family members should be aware that thoughts of suicide may return and that theyshould inform the psychiatrist or a significant other as soon as possible if that occurs. Thereshould also be an open discussion about what to do in the event of an emergency and how toobtain emergency services. Under some circumstances, this discussion may include an explana-tion of methods for involving the police to facilitate an involuntary evaluation. Some family members, particularly those of patients with borderline personality disorder, mistakenly view suicide attempts or communications of suicidal intent as \"manipulative\" or\"attention-seeking\" behaviors. Thus, it is important to provide family members with educationabout the lifetime risks of suicide in such patients and to help family members learn ways torespond in a helpful and positive manner when the patient is experiencing a suicidal crisis. /L50776 H. REASSESS SAFETY AND SUICIDE RISK The waxing and waning nature of suicidality is one of the difficult challenges in the care of thesuicidal patient and often requires that suicide assessments be repeated over time (Table 2). Al-though a full suicide assessment is not required at each encounter with the patient, the psychi-atrist should use reasonable judgment in determining the extent of the repeat assessmentneeded to estimate the patient's current suicide risk. In inpatient settings, repeat suicide assess-ments should occur at critical stages of treatment (e.g., with a change in level of privilege,abrupt change in mental state, and before discharge). When a reassessment is done, the psychi-atrist often finds that a patient who initially reported suicidal ideation with lethal intent nolonger reports suicidal ideation at a subsequent visit. As stated earlier, it is not possible to pre-dict which individuals with recent suicidal ideation will experience it again nor which patientswill deny suicidal ideation even when it is present. Nonetheless, if a patient is assessed as beingat high risk for suicide, a plan to address this risk must be implemented and documented. Thisplan may include changes in the setting of care or level of observation, changes in medicationtherapy or psychotherapy, or both kinds of changes. Patients with a recent onset of severe suicidal ideation should be treated with particular caution. For those experiencing suicidal ideation in the context of an underlying depressive disorder, it can Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

The psychiatrist also needs to be mindful of other symptoms that may be associated with increased suicide risk, such as hopelessness, anxiety, insom-nia, or command hallucinations. Behaviors that may be associated with an acute increase in riskinclude giving away possessions, readying legal or financial affairs (e.g., finalizing a will, assigninga power of attorney), or communicating suicidal intentions or \"goodbye\" messages. Patients who are responding to ongoing treatment or who are in remission with continua- tion or maintenance treatment should be assessed for suicide risk when there is evidence of anabrupt clinical change, a relapse or recurrence, or some major adverse life event. In this context,the new emergence of suicidality should be responded to by an alteration of the treatment plan.The nature of this alteration depends on the clinical situation and can include a change in treat-ment setting or level of observation, increased visits, a change of medication or psychothera-peutic approach, inclusion of a significant other person, and consultation. With changes inclinical status or as new information becomes available, the psychiatrist must also be preparedto reevaluate the patient's psychiatric diagnosis and also evaluate the nature and strength of thetherapeutic alliance. 1. Patients in a suicidal crisis There will be times when a patient in ongoing treatment is in an acute suicidal crisis and thepsychiatrist has to respond immediately. There may be communications directly from the pa-tient, the family, or significant others, including employers or co-workers. In urgent situations,it may be necessary to have telephone calls traced or involve the police. The challenge for thepsychiatrist is not only to evaluate the extent of the emergency but also to assess the content ofthe communication and its source. T o better assess the situation, it is critical to speak with thepatient directly, if at all possible. In addition, the psychiatrist should remain mindful of issuesrelating to confidentiality and breach confidentiality only to the extent needed to address thepatient's safety (see also Section V.C, \"Communication With Significant Others\"). Under some circumstances, the psychiatrist may need to refer a suicidal patient to an emergency department for evaluation or hospitalization. When doing so, it is important forthe psychiatrist to communicate with the psychiatric evaluator in the emergency department.Although such communication may not always be possible because of the exigencies of theemergency situation, such contact does provide hospital personnel with the context for theemergency. Particularly when a patient is brought to the hospital by police, it is not unusualfor the patient to minimize the symptoms and reasons for the referral after arriving in theemergency setting. Adequate information about the reasons for the emergency departmentreferral and about the patient's previous and recent history can be crucial in helping theemergency department evaluator determine a safe and appropriate setting for treatment.When hospitalization is recommended by the referring psychiatrist, the reasons for that rec-ommendation should similarly be communicated to the emergency department evaluatorwho will be making the final determination about the need for hospital admission. 2. Patients with chronic suicidality For some individuals, self-injurious behaviors and/or suicidality are chronic and repetitive, re-sulting in frequent contacts with the health care system for assessment of suicide potential. Itis important to recognize that self-injurious behaviors may or may not be associated with sui-cidal intent (518). Although self-injurious behaviors are sometimes characterized as \"gestures\"aimed at achieving secondary gains (e.g., receiving attention, avoiding responsibility throughhospitalization), patients' motivations for such behaviors are quite different. For example, with-out having any desire for death, individuals may intentionally injure themselves to express an-ger, relieve anxiety or tension, generate a feeling of \"normality or self-control,\" terminate a stateof depersonalization, or distract or punish themselves (519, 520). Conceptualizing such behav- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

For permission for reuse, visit APPI Permissions & Licensing Center at http://www.appi.org/CustomerService/Pages/Permissions.aspx.60 APA Practice Guidelinesiors as \"gestures\" is also problematic because suicide attempts may be downplayed when asso- ciated with minimal self-harm. Self-destructive acting out can also result in accidentally lethalself-destructive behaviors even in the absence of suicidal intent. Furthermore, a past or currenthistory of nonlethal self-injurious behaviors does not preclude development of suicidal ideas,plans, or attempts with serious intent and lethality (521). In fact, among suicide attempterswith suicidal intent, those who also had histories of self-injurious behaviors without suicidalintent were more likely to underestimate the objective lethality of their attempt and to havesymptoms associated with greater suicide risk (251). Thus, in assessing chronic self-injuriousbehaviors, it is important to determine whether suicidal intent is present with self-injury and,if so, to what extent and with what frequency. In addition, an absence of suicidal intent or aminimal degree of self-injury should not lead the psychiatrist to overlook other evidence of in-creased suicide risk. For patients who are prone to chronic self-injurious behavior, each act needs to be assessed in the context of the current situation; there is not a single response to self-injurious behaviorsthat can be recommended. For example, there are times when outpatient management is mostappropriate; under other circumstances, hospitalization may be indicated. In general, for suchindividuals, hospitalization should be used for short-term stabilization, since prolonged hospi-tal stays may potentiate dependency, regression, and acting-out behaviors. When chronic self-injurious behaviors are present, behavioral techniques such as dialectical behavior therapy canbe helpful (522, 523). In addition, at times when care of the patient is being transitioned toanother clinician, the risk of suicidal behaviors may increase. Diagnostically, severe personality disorders, particularly borderline (521) and antisocial per- sonality disorders, predominate among patients who exhibit chronic self-injurious behaviorswithout associated suicidal intent. Such individuals may also have higher rates of comorbid panicdisorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (524). Patients with schizoaffective disorder, bipolardisorder, and schizophrenia may also be represented, but more often such patients have ongoingthoughts of suicide or repeated suicide attempts in the presence of suicidal intent. There is evi-dence that the presence of comorbid personality disorders or substance use disorders not onlyincreases suicide risk in these individuals but also decreases treatment response. For example, pa-tients with a combination of affective disorder and personality disorder are prone to frequent sui-cidal crises, difficulties with mood instability and impulse control, and problems with treatmentadherence. Consequently, for patients whose nonadherence contributes to a chronic risk for sui-cide, psychiatrists should be familiar with statutes on involuntary outpatient treatment, if it isapplicable in their jurisdiction (525). When treating chronically suicidal individuals, it is important for the psychiatrist to moni- tor his or her own feelings, including countertransference reactions. Careful attention to thetreatment relationship and the psychosocial context of the patient is also critical. Consistencyand limit-setting are often needed, but the latter needs to be established on the basis of clinicaljudgment and should not be framed in punitive terms. Helping patients develop skills for cop-ing with self-injurious impulses is often a valuable part of treatment. In outlining a detailed treatment plan, it is helpful to incorporate input from the patient and significant others, when clinically appropriate. During periods of crisis, disagreements may oc-cur about the need for hospitalization. In some circumstances, the psychiatrist may view hospi-talization as essential, whereas the patient or family members may not. Alternatively, the patient,family members, or other involved persons may demand hospitalization when outpatient man-agement may seem more appropriate. When such disagreements occur, power struggles are bestavoided. Instead, gaining a deeper understanding of the conflicting viewpoints will often lead toa successful resolution. In addition, educational efforts with the patient and others should dis-cuss the fact that risk in chronically suicidal individuals will be increased on an ongoing basis.Thus, the risk of suicide outside of the hospital must be balanced against the potentially detri-mental effects of hospitalization (see Section III.C, \"Determine a Treatment Setting\").

MONITOR PSYCHIATRIC STATUS AND RESPONSE TO TREATMENT In addition to reassessing the patient's safety and degree of suicidality, it is equally important for the psychiatrist to monitor the patient's psychiatric status and response to treatment. Thisis particularly the case during the early phases of treatment, since some medications, particu-larly antidepressants, may take several weeks to reach therapeutic benefit. Also, with the excep-tion of suicides in persons with alcoholism, suicides tend to occur early in the course of mostpsychiatric disorders, when individuals are least likely to have insight into having an illness andare least likely to adhere to treatment. Moreover, clinical observations suggest that there maybe an early increase in suicide risk as depressive symptoms begin to lift but before they are fullyresolved. Thus, ongoing monitoring of the patient's clinical condition is needed to determinethe patient's symptoms and response to treatment (e.g., determining the optimal dose of a drugand evaluating its efficacy). Often the course of treatment is uneven, with periodic setbacks, forexample, at times of stress. Such setbacks do not necessarily indicate that the treatment is inef-fective. Nonetheless, ultimate improvement should be a reasonably expected outcome. Fur-thermore, as treatment progresses, different features and symptoms of the patient's illness mayemerge or subside. Significant changes in a patient's psychiatric status or the emergence of newsymptoms may indicate a need for a diagnostic reevaluation, a change in treatment plan, orboth. Such modifications may include a change in treatment setting, medication, or frequencyof visits; involvement of significant others; referral for additional treatments (e.g., dialecticalbehavior therapy, ECT) that are targeted at specific symptoms or syndromes; and consultation. /L50776 J. OBTAIN CONSULTATION, IF INDICATED In treating suicidal patients, particularly those with severe or chronic suicidality, consultationmay be helpful from a number of standpoints. The use of consultation or supervision from acolleague may be of help in monitoring and addressing countertransference issues. Since clinicaljudgments regarding assessment and treatment issues with suicidal patients may be quite difficult,input from other colleagues may be important in affirming the appropriateness of the treatmentplan or suggesting other possible therapeutic approaches. For complex clinical presentations inwhich alcohol or other substance use disorders might be present, referral to a psychiatrist spe-cializing in the treatment of addictive disorders may be helpful for consultation, management,or involvement in a program of recovery. However, in the context of a suicidal crisis, psychiatristsneed to be careful in referring a long-term patient for consultation. Some patients may perceivesuch a referral as the first step to termination of therapy and may need to be reassured that thereferral is only for consultation. IV. SPECIFIC TREATMENT MODALITIES /L50776 A. SOMATIC THERAPIES For the purposes of this practice guideline, psychiatrists should be familiar with specific psycho- tropic medicines that have been found to be useful in the care of the suicidal patient. In general, somatic therapies such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, or mood-stabilizing agents will be target-ed to specific axis I and/or axis II psychiatric disorders. However, early use of supplemental medi-cines, including sedative-anxiolytics or low doses of second-generation antipsychotics, may also behelpful to rapidly address agitation, anxiety, and insomnia, which are additional risk factors for suicide.

Antidepressants A mainstay of the treatment of suicidal patients suffering from acute, recurrent, and chronic depressive illness is the administration of antidepressant medication in an adequate dose (526).Antidepressants also have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of anxiety disorders (526).They have also been used successfully in treating suicidal patients with comorbid depressionand substance use disorders (527). Remarkably, however, there is relatively limited evidencethat antidepressant treatment reduces risk (69, 526, 528-533). On the basis of a large numberof short-term randomized, placebo-controlled trials for acute major depression (534-546) thatwere subjected to meta-analysis (533), antidepressant treatment has not been shown to reducerates of suicide or suicide attempts. Studies using data on antidepressants from Food and DrugAdministration clinical trial databases also do not show differences in rates of suicide or suicideattempts with antidepressant treatment (546-548). However, reductions in risk might not beobserved as readily over short time periods or in studies in which suicidality was used as an ex-clusion criterion. Furthermore, long-term studies with relevant data are rare and too small tosupport any conclusions (526). However, since the late 1980s, suicide rates in several countries,regions, or subpopulations have fallen appreciably (69, 531, 532, 549, 550), coinciding withthe increasing clinical use of nontricyclic and non-monoamine oxidase inhibitor (non-MAOI)antidepressants in adequate doses and perhaps providing indirect evidence for a role of antide-pressant treatment in the treatment of suicidal behaviors. After publication of several case reports suggesting that SSRI antidepressants might be asso- ciated with increased risks of aggressive or impulsive acts, including suicide (551-553), a num-ber of investigators retrospectively analyzed clinical trial data to determine whether suicidalityand/or suicide rates are increased with SSRI treatment (537, 548, 554, 555). These studies didnot show evidence that suicide or suicidality is increased by treatment with specific types ofantidepressants. At the same time, these medications are prescribed in order to treat disordersthat may have anxiety, agitation, and suicidality as part of the illness course, making it difficultto distinguish the etiology of symptoms that emerge in the course of treatment. Thus, as treat-ment begins, it is important to determine baseline levels of symptoms and then to observepatients for symptoms such as anxiety, agitation, or sleep disturbance as well as for the devel-opment of mixed states or psychosis, all of which may increase their subjective sense of distressand increase suicide risk. In addition, antidepressant therapy typically involves a substantial de-lay before clinically obvious improvements occur. During initial, partial recovery, it is possiblethat suicidal impulses as well as the energy to act on them may increase. Patients should be fore-warned of this likely delay in treatment effects and should be given encouragement and mon-itored especially closely in the initial days and weeks of treatment. If full response to treatmentis not observed, adjustments in medication dosage or a change to a different antidepressantmedication may be necessary. Nontricyclic, non-MAOI antidepressants are relatively safe andpresent virtually negligible risks of lethality on overdose (526). Nevertheless, it is wise to re-quest that conservative quantities of medication be dispensed for suicidal patients, especiallyfor patients who are not well known. Although the tricyclic antidepressants and MAOIs aremuch more toxic in overdose and more limited in their use, they may still be valuable in treat-ing individuals with suicidal behaviors and depressive disorders who have not responded totreatment with SSRIs or other newer antidepressants (526, 556, 557). Overall, from a clinicalperspective, the strong association between clinical depression and suicide and the availabilityof reasonably effective and quite safe antidepressants support their use, in adequate doses andfor an adequate duration, as part of a comprehensive program of care for potentially suicidalpatients, including long-term use in patients with recurrent forms of depressive or severe anx-iety disorders.

Lithium There is strong and consistent evidence in patients with recurring bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder that long-term maintenance treatment with lithium salts is associated withmajor reductions in risk of both suicide and suicide attempts (69, 558-565). A recent meta-analysis (563) of available studies of suicide rates with versus without long-term lithium main-tenance treatment (76, 534, 559, 565-595) found a highly statistically significant decrease insuicidal acts (i.e., suicide or suicide attempts) of almost 14-fold. For suicide, lithium mainte-nance treatment was associated with an 80%-90% decrease in risk, whereas the reduction insuicide attempt rates was more than 90%. Although suicide rates during lithium treatment arestill greater than those in the general population, maintenance therapy with lithium for bipolardisorder patients is associated with substantial and significant reductions in suicide risk, com-pared to non-lithium-treated bipolar disorder patients. As with antidepressants, the potentiallethality of lithium in overdose (596) should be taken into consideration when deciding on thequantity of lithium to give with each prescription. However, given the long-term benefits oflithium in reducing risks of suicidal behaviors, the potential for overdose effects should not pre-clude treatment of suicidal patients with lithium when it is clinically indicated. 3. \"Mood-stabilizing\" anticonvulsant agents Despite the increased use and antimanic efficacy of specific anticonvulsant and antipsychoticagents (e.g., divalproex, olanzapine), their long-term effectiveness in protecting against recur-rent mood episodes is less well established. Moreover, there is no established evidence of a re-duced risk of suicidal behavior with any other \"mood-stabilizing\" anticonvulsants. Althoughtreatment with these agents may be associated with some decrease in suicidal behaviors, lithiumtreatment is still associated with a greater diminution in rates of suicidal acts than treatmentwith carbamazepine or divalproex (592, 597, 598). Consequently, when deciding between lith-ium and other first-line agents for treatment of patients with bipolar disorder, the efficacy oflithium in decreasing suicidal behavior should be taken into consideration when weighing thebenefits and risks of treatment with each medication. 4. Antipsychotic agents Analogous to the use of antidepressants for patients with depression, the antipsychotic medi-cations have been the mainstay of somatic treatment for suicidal patients with psychotic dis-orders. First-generation antipsychotic agents are highly effective in treating delusions andhallucinations as well as agitation, aggression, and confusion and may also have some beneficialactions in major affective disorders. Their potential effects in limiting suicidal risk in psychoticpatients are unknown, although annual rates of suicide associated with schizophrenia have notfallen appreciably since their introduction (599-602). Particularly in highly agitated patients, the beneficial effects of first-generation and modern antipsychotics may serve to reduce suicide risk (603). However, use of older neuroleptic agentsmay also be associated with adverse effects, including extrapyramidal neurological side effectsand possible worsening of depression as a result of induction of akathisia (603-606). Given thefact that treatment of psychotic disorders with second-generation antipsychotic agents is asso-ciated with lower risks of some, particularly extrapyramidal-neurological, adverse effects (512,513, 596), use of first-generation antipsychotics in individuals with suicidal behaviors currentlyis usually reserved for those needing the enhanced treatment adherence afforded by depotforms of medication or those whose psychosis has not responded to a second-generation anti-psychotic, or when economic considerations are compelling. In the United States, the second-generation antipsychotic medications, such as aripiprazole, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, are now used to treat the ma-jority of individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. In addition to their use asfirst-line agents in the treatment of schizophrenia, the second-generation antipsychotic agents Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Among the second-generation anti-psychotic agents, clozapine has generally been reserved for use when psychotic symptoms havenot responded to other antipsychotic medications. As for effects on suicide attempts and sui-cide, clozapine is the best studied of any of the antipsychotic agents. Reductions in the rates ofsuicide attempts and suicides have been reported in specific studies of patients with schizophre-nia treated with clozapine (607) as well as in registry studies (533, 606, 608-613), which mayinclude patients with other psychotic diagnoses. Earlier studies could not eliminate the possi-bility that suicide rates were decreased by a nonspecific effect of increased clinical contact dueto hematologic monitoring during clozapine therapy. However, significant reductions in sui-cide attempts and hospitalization for suicidality were also seen in a more recent blinded studycomparing clozapine and olanzapine (603). The reduction of suicide attempts in both groups,compared to the rate in the year preceding the study, suggests that olanzapine may also offersome protection against suicide attempts. These findings suggest that use of clozapine mightbe considered earlier in the treatment of individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective dis-orders. At the same time, the potential benefits of treatment with clozapine need to be weighedagainst the potential for adverse effects with long-term clozapine treatment, including agranu-locytosis, myocarditis, weight gain, and glucose dysregulation. Further study is needed to de-termine whether clozapine can reduce suicide risk in patients with other diagnoses or whetherother second-generation antipsychotic drugs may reduce suicide risk in schizophrenia in com-parison with one another or with first-generation antipsychotic drugs. 5. Antianxiety agents Since anxiety is a significant and modifiable risk factor for suicide, utilization of antianxietyagents may have the potential to decrease this risk. More specifically, before accompanying de-pression has resolved, acute suicide risk may be associated with severe psychic anxiety, panicattacks, agitation, and severe insomnia (79). Although these symptoms may be reduced by ag-gressive short-term benzodiazepine treatment (lasting 1-4 weeks), research on suicide risk withantianxiety treatment is quite limited, with no clinical trial of antianxiety treatment showingshort- or long-term antisuicide effects. However, a recent analysis of data obtained in controlledtrials of treatments for anxiety disorders showed no significant differences in rates of suicidalbehavior between those treated with active agents and those taking placebo (118). T o minimize severe recurrent (rebound) anxiety/agitation, long-acting benzodiazepines may be preferable to short-acting ones. At the same time, long-acting benzodiazepines may be morelikely to cause daytime sedation. Psychiatrists should also keep in mind that benzodiazepinesoccasionally disinhibit aggressive and dangerous behaviors and enhance impulsivity, particular-ly in patients with borderline personality disorder (614, 615). For patients treated with benzo-diazepines on a chronic basis, discontinuation of the benzodiazepine may be associated with anincrease in suicide risk (616). As alternatives to benzodiazepines, second-generation antipsy-chotic medications or anticonvulsant medicati ons such as divalproex or gabapentin may be helpful, although no specific research information on their potential to limit anxiety is avail-able. Persistent, severe insomnia is also a modifiable risk factor for suicide and can be addressedwith the use of benzodiazepines or sedating second-generation antipsychotics (617-619).Choice of a sedating antidepressant can also be considered for depressed patients with promi-nent insomnia. 6. ECT ECT is sometimes used to treat patients who are acutely suicidal, and available evidence sug-gests that ECT reduces short-term suicidal ideation (620-622). The efficacy of ECT is bestestablished in patients with severe depressive illness, but ECT may also be used in treating in- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

ECT is especially likely to be consideredfor patients for whom a delay in treatment response is considered life-threatening. Such patientsmay include individuals who are refusing to eat because of psychosis or depressive symptomsas well as those with catatonic features or prominent psychosis. ECT may also be indicated forsuicidal individuals during pregnancy and for those who have already failed to tolerate or re-spond to trials of medication. Although ECT is often raised as a possible treatment for chron-ically suicidal individuals with borderline personality disorder, ECT in such patients shouldtarget comorbid disorders that may be present, particularly comorbid major depressive dis-order. In the absence of another indication for use, ECT is not indicated for the treatment ofsuicidality in borderline personality disorder. For further details on the clinical use of ECT, in-cluding the pre-ECT evaluation, the informed consent process, the numbers of treatments gen-erally given, and the technical aspects of ECT administration, the reader is referred to APA's2001 report, The Practice of Electroconvulsive Therapy: Recommendations for Treatment, Training,and Privileging: A T ask Force Report of the American Psychiatric Association (623). Since there is no evidence for long-term or sustained reduction of suicide risk after an acute course of ECT, closeclinical supervision and additional treatment with psychotropic medications are usually requiredduring subsequent weeks and months. /L50776 B. PSYCHOTHERAPIES In addition to pharmacotherapies and ECT, psychotherapies play a central role in the manage-ment of suicidal behavior in clinical practice. Although few rigorous studies have directly ex-amined whether these interventions reduce suicide morbidity or mortality per se, clinicalconsensus suggests that psychosocial interventions and specific psychotherapeutic approachesare of benefit to the suicidal patient. Furthermore, in recent years, studies of psychotherapyhave demonstrated its efficacy in treating disorders such as depression and borderline person-ality disorder that are associated with increased suicide risk. For example, cognitive behaviortherapy, psychodynamic therapy, and interpersonal psychotherapy have been found effective inclinical trials for the treatment of these disorders (511, 515). A small randomized, controlledtrial of psychoanalytically oriented partial hospital treatment for individuals with borderlinepersonality disorder showed a beneficial effect on suicide attempts and self-harming behaviorsduring treatment and follow-up (624, 625). These observations as well as clinical experiencelend support to the use of such psychotherapeutic approaches in the treatment of suicidal ide-ation and behaviors. A number of other specific and nonspecific interventions have been assessed in small meth- odologically sound, randomized, controlled trials involving individuals with suicidal ideationor attempts as well as other forms of deliberate self-harm (626, 627). Dialectical behavior ther-apy has been studied for effects in a narrow range of potentially suicidal patients, particularlychronically suicidal or self-harming women with personality disorders. By targeting deficits inspecific skills, such as emotional regulation, impulse control, anger management, and interper-sonal assertiveness, dialectical behavior therapy may be effective in reducing suicide attemptswhen applied over longer time frames, especially for patients with personality disorders. Thereis also some preliminary evidence that cognitive and behavioral psychotherapy may reduce theincidence of suicide attempts in depressed outpatients (236, 626). However, other forms ofcognitive behavior therapy that include a problem-solving component have shown mixed re-sults (524, 628-632), suggesting the need for additional study. Other nonspecific interventionshave been studied in relatively small samples and have similarly shown mixed results. Most ofthese studies are limited in the size and scope of the patient population and provide only nar-row support for an effect on suicidal behaviors (633).

DOCUMENTATION AND RISK MANAGEMENT /L50776 A. GENERAL RISK MANAGEMENT AND DOCUMENTATION ISSUES SPECIFIC TO SUICIDE Risk management is an important component of psychiatric practice, especially in the assess- ment and management of patients at risk for suicide. Clinically based risk management is pa-tient centered and supports the therapeutic alliance and the treatment process. The mostfrequent lawsuits, settlements, and verdicts against psychiatrists are for patients' suicides. Thus,when treating a patient with suicidal behaviors, it is important to be aware of and pay attentionto certain general risk management considerations, which are summarized in Table 9. Documentation of patient care is a cornerstone of medical practice, but it is also essential to risk management (634, 635). If a malpractice claim is brought against the psychiatrist, docu-mentation of suicide risk assessments assists the court in evaluating the many clinical complex-ities and ambiguities that exist in the treatment and management of patients at suicide risk.The failure to document suicide risk assessments and interventions may give the court reasonto conclude they were not done. For patients who are hospitalized, it is also important to doc-ument the aspects of the risk assessment that justify inpatient treatment, particularly when it isoccurring on an involuntary basis (636). Thus, it is crucial for the suicide risk assessment to bedocumented in the medical record. Despite the time burdens faced by the psychiatrist, documentation is best done just after the suicide assessment is completed. Reference to the reason for the assessment (e.g., relapse, worsen-ing, a reversal in the patient's life) will set the context for the evaluation. Subsequent discussionreviews the factors that may contribute to increased shorter-term or longer-term suicide risk aswell as the reasoning process that went into the assessment. Clinical conclusions and any changesin the treatment plan should also be noted, along with the rationale for such actions. If other in-terventions or actions were considered but rejected, that reasoning should be recorded as well. Consider the example of a patient who was in remission after a prior hospitalization for a suicide attempt but who recently had a relapse or a recurrent episode. The psychiatrist maydocument that suicidal ideation is present but that there is no evidence of a specific plan orspecific symptoms that would augment risk (i.e., agitation, severe anxiety, severe insomnia). Itmay also be noted that the patient is under increased stress and is in some distress but is respon-sive to support. On the basis of the patient's willingness to accept help and the lack of evidenceof acute suicide risk factors, continued outpatient management may be reasonable, with chang-es in the treatment plan, such as increasing the frequency of visits, perhaps increasing anxiolyticmedication doses temporarily, and perhaps talking with a supportive relative or friend to obtainmore information and to solidify the patient's support system. In all settings, the psychiatrist should be aware that suicide risk assessment is a process and never simply an isolated event. Specific points at which reassessment may be indicated havebeen detailed in Table 2. On inpatient units, important points of documentation of assessmentoccur at admission, changes in the level of precautions or observations, transitions betweentreatment units, the issuance of passes, marked changes in the clinical condition of the patient,and evaluation for discharge (637). In particular, the determination of the level of suicide pre-cautions (one-to-one versus every-15-minute checks, etc.) should be based on the patient's clin-ical presentation and be supported by a clinical rationale. Because care in inpatient settings isgenerally delivered by a multidisciplinary treatment team, it is important for the psychiatristeither to review the patient's records regularly or to communicate verbally with staff throughoutthe patient's hospital stay. At the time of the patient's discharge from the hospital, risk-benefitassessments for both continued hospitalization and discharge should be documented, and fol-low-up arrangements for the patient's outpatient care should be recorded.

Revisionsof the treatment plan are appropriately noted at these times. For patients in psychoanalysis ormodified psychoanalytic treatment, the psychiatrist may elect to follow the charting recom-mendations of the psychoanalytic subspecialty practice guideline (638). /L50776 B. SUICIDE CONTRACTS: USEFULNESS AND LIMITATIONS As originally designed, the suicide prevention contract, which is sometimes known as a no-harm contract, was intended to facilitate management of the patient at suicide risk (639). Al-though in the era of managed care, suicide pr evention contracts are increasingly being used with patients at risk for suicide, the patient's willingness (or reluctance) to enter into a suicideprevention contract should not be viewed as an absolute indicator of suitability for discharge(or hospitalization). In addition, since the utility of the suicide prevention contract is based onsubjective belief rather than objective evidence, it is overvalued as a clinical or risk managementtechnique. Furthermore, the suicide prevention contract is not a legal document and cannot beused as exculpatory evidence in the event of litigation (640). Thus, the suicide prevention con-tract cannot and should not take the place of a thorough suicide risk assessment (637). Although suicide prevention contracts are commonly used in clinical practice (429), no studies have shown their effectiveness in reducing suicide. In fact, studies of suicide attemptersand of inpatients who died by suicide have shown that a significant number had a suicide preven-tion contract in place at the time of their suicidal act (212, 218, 430). Consequently, althoughverbal and written suicide prevention contracts have each been proposed as aids to assessing theTABLE 9.

Relying on sui- cide prevention contracts may reflect the clinician's understandable but not necessarily effectiveattempt to control the inevitable anxiety associated with treating patients at suicide risk. At thesame time, undue reliance on a patient's suicide prevention contract may falsely lower clinicalvigilance without altering the patient's suicidal state. Some clinicians gauge the patient's suicidal intent by his or her willingness to formalize the alliance by a written or an oral contract. For example, when discussing a suicide prevention con-tract, some patients will state openly that they cannot be sure that they can (or will want to) callthe psychiatrist or other treatment team members if self-destructive impulses threaten. Patientswho reject a suicide prevention contract are communicating that they see the therapeutic alli-ance as suboptimal or that they feel unable to adhere to such a contract. Consequently, patientswho refuse to commit to contracts against suicide put the clinician on notice that the therapeuticalliance and the level of suicide risk should be reassessed. An alternative approach to suicide pre-vention contracts proposed by Miller et al. (642) relies on the basic tenets of informed consentand includes discussion of the risks and benefits of treatment and management options with thepatient as a means of assessing his or her ability to develop and maintain a therapeutic alliance.In inpatient settings such discussions can emphasize the availability of the clinical staff and beused as a way to educate the patient about options for dealing with suicidal impulses. Regardless of their potential advantages, suicide prevention contracts are only as reliable as the state of the therapeutic alliance. Thus, with a new patient, the psychiatrist may not have hadsufficient time to make an adequate assessment or to evaluate the patient's capacity to form atherapeutic alliance, creating little or no basis for relying on a suicide prevention contract. As aresult, the use of suicide prevention contracts in emergency settings or with newly admitted andunknown inpatients is not recommended. Furthermore, patients in crisis may not be able to ad-here to a contract because of the severity of their illness. Suicide prevention contracts are also ill-advised with agitated, psychotic, or impulsive patients or when the patient is under the influenceof an intoxicating substance. For these individuals, as for all patients presenting with suicidal be-haviors, the psychiatrist must be ever mindful of the need for ongoing suicide assessments. /L50776 C. COMMUNICATION WITH SIGNIFICANT OTHERS The confidential nature of the doctor-patient relationship is a fundamental aspect of the psy-chotherapeutic process. Consequently, the psychiatrist will need to manage the tension be-tween this requirement and the wish to act in the patient's best interest. The default positionis to maintain confidentiality unless the patient gives consent to a specific intervention or com-munication. However, in maintaining a safe environment for the patient, significant othersmay need to be contacted to furnish historical information or carry out specific tasks such asremoving firearms from the home. If the psychiatrist determines that the patient is (or is likelyto become) dangerous to him- or herself or to others and the patient will not consent to inter-ventions that aim to reduce those risks, then the psychiatrist is justified in attenuating confi-dentiality to the extent needed to address the safety of the patient and others. More specifically,the 2001 edition of The Principles of Medical Ethics With Annotations Especially Applicable to Psychiatry states: \"[P]sychiatrists at times may find it necessary, in order to protect the patient or the community from imminent danger, to reveal confidential information disclosed by thepatient\" (Section IV , Annotation 8) (643). As with many situations involving the suicidal pa-tient, such decisions require much clinical judgment in weighing the effects of breaching con-fidentiality on the therapeutic relationship against the potential safety risks for the patient orothers. It should also be noted that the psychiatrist can listen to information provided byfriends or family without violating confidentiality by disclosing information about the patientto the informant. In addition, in an emergency situation, necessary information about the pa-tient can be communicated with police and with emergency personnel, including medical staffand emergency medical technicians.

MANAGEMENT OF SUICIDE IN ONE'S PRACTICE Because psychiatrists work with individuals who are by definition at increased risk for suicide, sui- cides can and do occur in clinical practice despite the best efforts at suicide assessment and treat-ment (489, 491). At least half of psychiatrists can expect in the course of their practice that oneof their patients will die from suicide (644, 645). A patient's suicide is among the most difficultprofessional experiences encountered by a psychiatrist. It can lead to symptoms of posttraumaticstress disorder, shock, anger, grief, guilt, isolation, shame, diminished self-esteem, and concernabout reactions of colleagues (646, 647). In one study (644), approximately half of the psychia-trists who had lost a patient to suicide experienced stress levels comparable with those of personsrecovering from a parent's death. The significant effects of a patient's suicide on the psychiatrist,especially posttraumatic stress responses (644), suggest that support for the psychiatrist and a re-view of events leading to the suicide are warranted. Specific training may also be useful in helpingthe psychiatrist deal with the aftermath of a patient's suicide (644). In addition to receiving sup-port from colleagues after a patient's suicide, some psychiatrists find it helpful to seek consultationor supervision to enable them to continue to respond effectively in working with other patients. After a patient's suicide, clinicians may experience conflicting roles and concerns. However, a number of steps can be taken to facilitate the aftercare process. Many psychiatrists find it help-ful to consult with a colleague or with an attorney. In addition, the psychiatrist should ensurethat the patient's records are complete. Any additional documentation included in the medicalrecord after the patient's death should be dated contemporaneously, not backdated, and previousentries should not be altered. Conversations with family members can be appropriate and can allay grief and assist devastat- ed family members in obtaining help after a suicide. This recommendation is based primarily onhumanitarian concerns for survivors, but this approach may also have a powerful, though inci-dental, risk management aspect. Nonetheless, attorneys advise clinicians in two very differentways on the issue of suicide aftercare. After a bad outcome, some attorneys recommend that thecase be sealed and no communication be established with the family, except through the attorney.Other attorneys encourage judicious communication or consultation, if indicated. If this ap-proach is taken, the psychiatrist should concentrate on addressing the feelings of the family mem-bers rather than specific details of the patient's care. In addition, in speaking with survivors, caremust be exercised not to reveal confidential information about the patient and not to make self-incriminating or self-exonerating statements, since these statements may further distress the fam-ily and provide a spur to litigation. The individuals who lived with the patient before the suicidenot only currently experience intense emotional pain but also shared it with the patient beforedeath. Thus, a number of lawsuits are filed because of the clinician's refusal to express, in any way,feelings of condolence, sadness, sympathy, or regret for the patient's death. A number of stateshave statutes that prohibit statements, writings, or benevolent human expressions of sympathysuch as condolences and regrets from being admissible as evidence of an admission of liability ina civil action (648). However, statutes often distinguish between the part of a statement that is anexpression of sympathy and the part of a statement that expresses fault, e.g., in the case of an au-tomobile accident, \"I'm sorry you were hurt\" (inadmissible as evidence of liability) versus \"I wasusing my cell phone and just didn't see you coming\" (admissible as evidence of liability). Conse-quently, it may be useful for psychiatrists to know whether an apology statute is applicable withintheir jurisdiction and, if so, to know the specific provisions of the statute. The individual psychi-atrist must use his or her clinical judgment to decide whether attending the patient's funeralwould be appropriate. It may also be helpful to include a risk manager in this decision process. Many occasions arise in which information is requested after a patient's death. As a general rule, written authorization should be obtained from the executor or administrator of the de-ceased patient's estate before releasing a copy of the medical records. If the estate has been set-tled and an executor or administrator no longer exists, a copy of the medical records should bereleased only to properly appointed legal representatives (649).

MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS FOR SURVIVING FAMILY AND FRIENDS AFTER A SUICIDE The survivors of suicide are more vulnerable to physical and psychological disorders and are at increased risk of suicide themselves (see Section II.E.6, \"Family History\"). Although there arerelatively few systematic studies of adult bereavement after suicide, existing studies suggest thatemotional, social, and physical conditions of survivors are significantly changed after the sui-cide of a relative. Within 6 months after a suicide, 45% of bereaved adults report mental dete-rioration, with physical deterioration in 20% (650). Symptoms of depression, posttraumaticstress, guilt, and shame as well as somatic complaints are prevalent during that period and aremore severe among parents of deceased children (650-652). While the majority of bereavedadults within 6 months after a suicide acknowledge a need for intervention, only approximately25% seek psychiatric treatment (650). Despite this low rate of treatment, the majority of be-reaved adults adapt well in the long term (653, 654). The most comprehensive data on bereavement after suicide exist for youths. These data in- dicate that within 6 months after the suicide of a friend or sibling, symptoms of major de-pressive and posttraumatic stress disorders are prevalent among bereaved youths (145, 651,655). The long-term outcomes, up to 18 months, of adolescents whose friends had died by sui-cide suggest the incidence of major depressive disorder is higher in those who had depressionbefore the friend's suicide, intermediate in those who developed depression immediately afterthe suicide, and lowest in those who were not depressed immediately after the suicide (656).Those who became depressed after the death were closer to the friend who died by suicide,showed more intense grief, and had more intense exposure to the suicide. Within 6 years of thesuicide of a friend, adolescents with syndromal levels of traumatic grief were five times morelikely to report suicidal ideation than those without traumatic grief (657). However, there wasno greater incidence of suicide attempts among adolescents with a friend who had died by sui-cide than among adolescents who did not know someone who died by suicide. Adolescentsiblings of youths who died by suicide had a sevenfold increased risk for developing major de-pressive disorder within 6 months (651). However, in a related 3-year follow-up of siblings ofadolescents who died by suicide, the siblings suffered more significant grief than the friends ofthe adolescents who died by suicide, although the rates of psychiatric disorders in follow-upwere similar to those for adolescents who did not have a friend or sibling who died by suicide(651). These studies suggest an increased risk of psychiatric symptoms and impairment after the suicide of a relative. As a result, psychiatric intervention should be offered to family membersshortly after the death and maintained to reduce risk for psychiatric impairment. Such inter-vention is particularly important for youths and for those who witnessed the suicide or were atthe scene of the death. The goals of psychiatric intervention include the identification andtreatment of major depressive and posttraumatic stress disorders as well as related symptoms(658, 659). Longer-term follow-up with evaluation and intervention for adolescents bereavedafter the suicide of a relative or friend is also indicated to decrease the risk for recurrent de-pression and other morbidities (660). Furthermore, a family approach to evaluation and in-tervention is needed for those who are bereaved after an adolescent's suicide. Evaluation andtreatment of grief may be similarly important in reducing risk for suicidal ideation amongyouths who are bereaved as a result of the suicide of a person who is emotionally important tothem. For all family members and close friends of individuals who die by suicide, referral to asurvivor support group can be helpful. Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

REVIEW AND SYNTHESIS OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE /L50776 A. FACTORS ALTERING RISK OF SUICIDE AND ATTEMPTED SUICIDE 1. Demographic factors a) Age As shown in Table 10, suicide rates vary with age, gender, and race or ethnicity. Annual ratesin the general U.S. population rise sharply in adolescence and young adulthood, plateauthrough midlife, then rise again in individuals over age 65. The increased rates of suicide inyouths are even more dramatic in some ethnic and racial subgroups of the population. For ex-ample, the suicide rate among American Indian males between ages 15 and 34 years averagedabout 36 per 100,000 during the period from 1979 to 1993, whereas Alaska Native males be-tween ages 14 and 19 years had an even more dramatic rate, at 120 per 100,000 (661). Blackmale youths, who were historically at low risk for suicide, now have a suicide rate comparableto their white peers. Although the suicide rate in adolescents, like the overall U.S. suicide rate,has dropped in the past decade, the relative suicide risk of youths remains high, and this hasbeen attributed to increases in alcohol and substance abuse (662), breakdown in extended familyand intergenerational support, and increased availability of firearms, especially for young AfricanAmerican males (663). Individuals over age 65 are disproportionately represented among those who die by suicide. Compared with suicide rates in men ages 55 to 64 years, suicide rates in men over age 85 aretwo- to threefold higher for all races except African Americans. For elderly women, suicide ratesare relatively unchanged with increasing age, with the exception of Asian women over age 85,whose suicide rate increases threefold from middle age. Overall suicide rates among those over age 65 have decreased substantially over the course of the last century, with a further decrease over the past decade. Although the reasons for the de-cline are unknown, a variety of mechanisms have been postulated, including improved access tosocial and health care resources by older adults with the implementation of Social Security andMedicare legislation and the more widespread use of safe and effective antidepressant medica-tions (664). The incidence of suicide among elderly persons may increase again, however, as thelarge, post-World War II baby boom generation continues to age. Relative to age groups bornin earlier or later periods, baby boomers have been distinguished by suicide rates that have beencomparatively higher at all ages (665). Of additional concern is the fact that elders are the fastestgrowing segment of the U.S. population. Thus, as large numbers of this high-risk cohort enterthe phase of life associated with greatest risk, the absolute number of suicides among older adultsmay increase dramatically (666).

Kuo et al. (29), using prospectively gathered data from the Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) survey, found a progressive decrease in the annual incidences of suicidal ideationand suicide attempts with increasing age. Compared with the rate in individuals over age 65,the rate of suicide attempts was 10-fold greater in those ages 18 to 29 years, at approximately310 per 100,000 person-years. The rate of suicidal ideation in individuals ages 18 to 29 wasapproximately 630 per 100,000 person-years, a rate that was sixfold greater than that in thoseover age 65. Duberstein et al. (13), in a study of adults age 50 years and older, also found thatpeople are less likely to report suicidal ideation as they age. In other studies, estimates of the prevalence of suicidal ideation in older adults have varied with the population sampled and the site, time frame, and study methods. Lish and colleagues(667) found that 7.3% of an older sample in Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) primary carepractices had thoughts of suicide, and elders with a history of mental health treatment were atfar greater risk. Callahan and colleagues (668) used a far more stringent definition of suicidalideation, limited ascertainment to within the past week, and required the ideation to include aspecific suicide plan. They found that 0.7%-1.2% of elders in primary care had suicidal ide-ation, all of whom had a simultaneous mood disorder. Skoog et al. (669), in a survey of non-demented Swedes age 85 years and older, inquired about the presence of both active and passivesuicidal ideation in the month preceding the interview. They found that 16% of the subjectshad thoughts of suicide. Again, the rate was higher in subjects with mental disorder, in thosetaking anxiolytic and neuroleptic agents, and in those with significant physical illness. Amongcommunity-dwelling Floridians 60 years of age and older, less than 6% reported ever havinghad suicidal thoughts in a study by Schwab et al. (670), while in the Berlin Aging Study (671)21% of subjects over age 70 reported having had suicidal ideation. Again, psychiatric illnesswas present in virtually all subjects, suggesting a need for careful screening for psychiatric dis-order in elders with suicidal ideation. b) Gender In the United States, epidemiologic data show that suicide is more frequent in men than inwomen. For example, data from the National Center for Health Statistics for the year 2000showed an age-adjusted suicide rate for males that was approximately 4.5-fold that for females(18.08 per 100,000 and 4.03 per 100,000, respectively) (11). This differential is comparableto the male-to-female ratio for suicide found in the National Longitudinal Mortality Study forthe years 1979 to 1989 (672). Within the U.S. population, males are disproportionately rep-resented among deaths by suicide in all racial and ethnic groups, with rates that range frommore than 5.5-fold greater than that for females among African Americans and Hispanics tothreefold greater than that for females among Asian/Pacific Islanders. This is not the case inother parts of the world, however. For example, in China the suicide rate for women is 25%higher than that for men (18). The male-to-female predominance in suicide in the United States persists across the lifespan. Adolescent and young adult males are about 5.5 times more likely to die from suicide than fe-males, whereas in midlife the male-to-female ratio is approximately 3.5 to 1. After about age65, however, there is a steadily widening male-to-female ratio of suicide rates in all groups ex-cept Asians, with differences of more than 10-fold after age 80. Differences in suicide risk with gender may be explained in part by factors that contribute to risk in general but that are present to differing degrees in men and in women. For example,men are less likely than women to seek help, admit the severity of their symptoms, or accepttreatment, increasing their likelihood of suicide. In contrast, women tend to be less impulsive,have more social support, and have lower rates of comorbid alcohol and substance use disor-ders, all of which may have a protective effect (21). Among African American women, the po-tential protective factors of religion and extended kin networks have been suggested as possibleexplanations for this group's very low rate of suicide (22).

Furthermore, in a 10-year follow-up study using data from the National Longitudi- nal Mortality Study, unemployment was associated with a greater and longer-lasting effect onthe suicide rate of women compared to men (24). Compared to men, women also have an in-creased likelihood of having been physically or sexually abused, which may also increase therisk for suicide (36). The relative lethality of the suicide methods chosen by women remainsless than those chosen by men; however, the recent, more frequent use of firearms among wom-en suggests that this distinction may be diminishing (11, 674). Suicide rates have also been examined in pregnant women and during the postpartum period. Dannenberg et al. (675) reviewed New York City medical examiner records of 293 pregnant orrecently pregnant women ages 15 to 44 years who died of injury during a 4-year period. Ofthese, 15 died by suicide, a rate that was not significantly different from the expected age- andrace-specific rates in the general population. However, Marzuk et al. (676) analyzed autopsy datafrom female residents of New York City who were of childbearing age and found the standard-ized mortality rate for suicide during pregnancy to be one-third the expected rate. Appleby(677), using retrospective population data for England and Wales from 1973 to 1984, also noteddecreased rates of suicide among pregnant women and among women during the first year afterchildbirth, with SMRs of 0.05 and 0.17, respectively. In contrast to decreased suicide rates forwomen in general during pregnancy and the puerperium, Appleby et al. (27) subsequentlyfound an extremely high suicide rate among women who had been psychiatrically hospitalizedduring the postpartum period. In this study of 1,567 women admitted to Danish psychiatrichospitals within the first year after childbirth, the SMR for suicide within 1 year was more than70 times the expected rate. Although risk was greatest within the first month postpartum, it per-sisted throughout the initial year after childbirth. In addition, women who died by suicide afterchildbirth often used violent methods. Thus, although evidence is limited, women with severepostpartum psychiatric disturbances appear to be at significantly increased risk during the initialyear after childbirth. Other groups with a particularly increased postpartum risk include teenag-ers and women of lower socioeconomic status (2 7, 28). For women as a group, however, a pro- tective effect seems to be present during pregnancy and the postpartum period (25). In terms of suicide attempts, women in the United States are reported to attempt suicide three times as often as men. This female predominance of suicide attempters varies with age,however, and in older adults the ratio of female-to-male suicide attempters approaches 1:1 (11).Similar trends are observed in the incidence of suicidal ideation. For example, Kuo et al. (29),using data from 3,481 prospectively followed individuals from the Baltimore ECA study, foundthat females ages 18 to 29 years had a higher incidence of suicidal ideation and suicide attemptsthan their male peers. However, this female-to-male predominance in suicidal ideation and sui-cide attempts was not observed for older age groups or for the sample as a whole. As noted earlier, women are more likely to have experienced domestic violence or physical or sexual abuse, all of which have been associated with higher rates of suicidal ideation and sui-cide attempts (32-34). In a study of psychosocial outcomes in 1,991 same-sex twin pairs, Nel-son et al. (35) found that childhood sexual abuse was three times more common in women andwas associated with an increased risk of attempting suicide. Borderline personality disorder isalso present more often in women (515) and is itself associated with increased rates of suicidalideation, suicide, suicide attempts, and other self-injurious behaviors. In addition, borderlinepersonality disorder is particularly common in women who have experienced childhood sexualabuse, physical abuse, or both (31). As a result, physical and sexual abuse and domestic violenceshould be given particular consideration in the assessment and treatment of women with sui-cidal ideation, suicide attempts, and other self-injurious behaviors. c) Race, ethnicity, and culture Race, ethnicity, and culture are all associated with variations in rates of suicide. In the UnitedStates for the year 2000, the overall age-adjusted rates of suicide were highest in Native Amer- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

In contrast, the age-adjusted rate of suicide in Hispanics was substantially less, at 6.13 per 100,000, andwas similar to the rates for non-Hispanic African Americans and Asian/Pacific Islanders, at 5.8and 6.0 per 100,000, respectively. For immigrant groups, suicide rates in general tend to mirror rates in the countries of origin, with trends converging toward the host country over time (40, 41). In a large epidemiologicalstudy, Singh and Siahpush (39) found that between 1979 and 1989, foreign-born men in theUnited States were 52% less likely to die by suicide than native-born men, but the differencenarrowed in the older age cohorts. Data for immigrant women were not statistically significantbecause of the small number of deaths. In the United States, racial and ethnic differences are also seen in the rates of suicide across the lifespan (Table 10). Among European-American non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics, andAsian/Pacific Islanders, the highest suicide rates occur during the senior years, in those over age65. In contrast, among Native Americans and African Americans, the highest suicide rates oc-cur during adolescence and young adulthood. For example, in Native American and AfricanAmerican males ages 15 to 24, suicide rates in the year 2000 were 36.81 and 14.66 per100,000, respectively. Young African American men have been described as being caught in acycle of drug abuse, criminal activity, and self-devaluation and may view an early death as in-evitable or as an alternative to the wearying struggle that life has become (678). Additional riskfactors for suicide in young African American males include substance abuse (662, 679), pres-ence of a firearm (663), and in particular the combination of cocaine abuse and the presenceof a firearm (679). Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are also common in urban AfricanAmerican young adults, with 6-month prevalences of 1.9% and 0.4%, respectively (680). In contrast to young African American males, African American women have a very low rate of suicide. Gibbs (22) attributes this low rate to the protective factors of religion, including therole of religion in the civil rights movement, women's central involvement in the church, andstrong values for endurance in the face of adversity. Women-dominated kinship networks arealso believed to be protective, providing flexible roles, resource sharing, and social support (681). Although black women are less likely to die from suicide than white women, they attempt sui- cide and express negative emotional states such as hopelessness and depression just as frequently.In addition, both black men and black women are less likely than their white counterparts to pur-sue professional counseling in the face of depression or other mental illness. Instead, AfricanAmericans are more likely to view depression as a \"personal weakness\" that can be successfullytreated with prayer and faith alone some or almost all of the time (682). When depression is dis-cussed, it may be described in different terms such as having \"the blues\" or \"the aching misery\" or\"being down\" (678). Consequently, sensitivity to language and beliefs about illness are importantin recognizing depression and other risk factors for suicide among African Americans. Among Native Americans (American Indians and Alaska Natives), suicide also is predomi- nately an epidemic of the young and is the second leading cause of death for Native Americansbetween ages 15 and 24 years. As with other racial and ethnic groups, Native American andAlaska Natives are a very heterogeneous population, with different tribal identities, varying de-grees of urbanization, different levels of tribal organization, and diverse approaches to historicaland cultural integration. For example, in a study of three groups of Native Americans in NewMexico, the Apache had the highest suicide rate (43.3 per 100,000) and the highest degree ofacculturation but also had the lowest degree of social integration and generally viewed religionas unimportant (683). In contrast, the Navajo had the lowest suicide rate (12.0 per 100,000)and the lowest level of acculturation but had moderate social integration and were organizedinto bands with a strong matrilineal clan influence. In the third group, the Pueblo, the sub-group with the most acculturation, had a higher suicide rate than the most traditional sub-group, again suggesting an effect of acculturation on suicide risk. Acculturation has also beenproposed as a contributor to the extremely high suicide rate in Alaska Native youths, which in Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Theories to explain these high rates tend to rely on family disintegration, social disruption, and alcohol use (684), as well as rapid social andcultural changes associated with intensive energy development projects in the Arctic and theresulting stress of acculturation. In contrast, in Hawaiian youths, the relationship between ac-culturation and suicidal behavior is less clear, with increased numbers of suicide attempts inthose with stronger Hawaiian cultural affiliation (685). Research on suicide among Hispanics in the United States is limited and rarely differentiates among different Hispanic groups. In addition, many individuals of Hispanic origin are undoc-umented workers who are not represented in census data or epidemiological studies. Large-scale grouping of diverse ethnic groups also obscures intracultural variations in important socialand economic categories. For example, Cuban American women and Mexican Americans andPuerto Ricans of both genders were reported to have lower than expected suicide rates, relativeto 1-year prevalence of major depression, than were whites, blacks, and Cuban American males(23). In terms of suicidal ideation, higher levels have been reported in Central American im-migrants experiencing heightened levels of acculturative stress (43). In addition, lifetime age-and gender-adjusted rates of suicidal ideation were significantly lower for Mexican Americansborn in Mexico (4.5%) than for Mexican Americans born in the United States (13%) or fornon-Latino whites (19.2%) (686). Similarly, rates of suicide attempt were lower among Mexi-can Americans born in Mexico (1.6%) and higher among both Mexican Americans born in theUnited States (4.8%) and non-Latino whites (4.4%). The rate of suicide attempt is also elevat-ed among Hispanic youths, who had higher numbers of reported suicide attempts comparedto non-Hispanic youths in a nationwide survey of high school students (687). The suicide rate for Asians overall is the lowest of all of the major American ethnic groups, but Asian Americans themselves have diverse ethnic backgrounds, languages, and cultures.Some groups, such as the Japanese, have been in the United States for generations. Others, suchas the Chinese, include both recent immigrants and descendants of 19th-century immigrants,whereas the Vietnamese have arrived in large numbers only since the 1960s. These individualsbring with them attitudes toward coping and suicide from their home countries, which can in-fluence the circumstances of suicidal behavior (688). In Japan, for example, suicide is permis-sible or even appropriate in particular contexts, and ritual suicide has been an honorablesolution to certain social dilemmas. For exampl e, the disgrace of bankruptcy in Japan can shame the family for generations, making suicide a preferable way to resolve debt. When it isculturally important for a man to be physically healthy and able to support his family, suicidemay be viewed as an option if a serious physical illness impairs his ability to function. For ex-ample, in Hawaii, 20.5% of suicides by Japanese American men occurred in individuals withhealth problems, in contrast to only 11.8% of suicides by Caucasian men and 3.0% by Hawai-ian men (42). In addition, for individuals who come from a culture in which mental illness ishighly stigmatized, receipt of a psychiatric diagnosis may increase the risk for suicide. AlthoughChinese societies have not generally codified suicide as socially acceptable, more recent suiciderates in China are quite high, particularly in women and in rural settings, where use of agricul-tural poisons is a common suicide method (18). In the United States, acculturation and acculturative stress may be a contributor to suicide risk among Asian Americans. For most Asian Americans, the family unit is central to identity. Childrenare socialized into awareness that their individual actions reflect upon the entire family, includingextended family members (689). While this feature may impede a family's willingness to seek treat-ment for a troubled relative, the strong sense of family as a support and source of obligation protectsagainst suicide as well. At the same time, family conflict as a reason for suicide is more common inEastern societies (42). For example, if a young woman from a traditional society experiences con-flicts with her in-laws that have no apparent solution, the woman may be more likely to view sui-cide as an option than would someone from a different family system in which close familyrelationships are not as imperative.

The group most at risk appears to be traditionalists who live in tight-knit groups resistant to acculturative processes. They appear tofunction relatively well until their elderly years, when the culture clash between the values of thelarger society and the Confucian tradition of strong family identity results in alienation of eldersand contributes to suicide in the style of the old country (44). For example, a major factor in thehigh suicide rate of elderly Asian/Pacific Islander women was reported to be the failure of youngerfamily members to provide support for their elderly parents, especially widowed mothers (690).Such deaths occurred predominantly by hanging, which was traditionally seen as an act of revenge,since someone who died by hanging was believed to return to haunt the living as a ghost (690). In summary, race, ethnicity, and culture may all influence population-based rates of suicide and suicide attempts. Of equal importance to the clinician, however, each of these factors maymodify suicide risk within the individual. Views of death and cultural beliefs regarding suicidecan vary widely, even among members of apparently homogeneous racial, ethnic, or culturalgroups. Thus, as part of the assessment and treatment planning process, it can be helpful forthe psychiatrist to explore the patient's beliefs about death and suicide and the role of culturaland family dynamics in these beliefs. d) Marital status Marital status has been correlated with variations in suicide mortality in a number of studies.Smith et al. (691) used data from the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics for the years1979 to 1981 to calculate age-adjusted suicide rates for each marital status. Regardless of ageor racial group, the suicide rate was consistently lowest in married individuals. An intermediaterate was seen in those who had never been married, with a relative risk that was about twicethat in married individuals. The highest suicide rate was found for divorced or widowed indi-viduals, with a relative risk that was about threefold greater than that in married individuals.Whereas divorced women had a higher age-adjusted suicide rate than widowed women, the op-posite was true among men, with a particularly striking rate of suicide in young widowed men. Kposowa (672) applied Cox proportional hazards regression models to data from the 1979- 1989 follow-up of the National Longitudinal Mortality Study and made adjustments for age,sex, race, education, family income, and region of residence to estimate the effect of maritalstatus on suicide risk. Although in this sample being single or widowed had no significant effecton suicide risk, divorced and separated persons had suicide rates that were more than twice thatof married persons. Stratification of the sample by sex showed that the effect of marital statuson suicide rates occurred only among men. Luoma and Pearson (46) also examined whether marital status is associated with variations in suicide rates. Suicide rates broken down by race, 5-year age groups, sex, and marital statuswere calculated by using data compiled from the U.S. National Center for Health StatisticsMultiple-Cause-of-Death Files for the years 1991 to 1996. Widowed white and African Amer-ican men under age 50 were found to have substantial elevations in suicide rates, with 17-foldand ninefold higher rates, respectively, compared with married men under age 50. At youngerages, for women as well as for men, being widowed was associated with a higher suicide rate,compared with being married. Using data from the National Suicide Prevention Project in Finland, Heikkinen et al. (402) investigated age-related variations in marital status as well as other social factors in a sample of1,067 individuals who died by suicide during a 1-year period and for whom relevant data wereavailable. Compared with the general population, individuals who died by suicide were morecommonly divorced, widowed, or never married. Among individuals under age 50 who diedby suicide, more males than females had never been married. Among those over age 50, morewomen than men were widowed. Other data from Finland obtained through the Finnish Population Register and cause-of- death files also suggest that the rate of suicide is elevated among widowed individuals (45).

During the initial month of bereavement,men had a much greater increase in suicide mortality than women (17.2-fold versus 4.5-fold), butthis disproportionate ratio primarily resulted from occurrences of homicide-suicide. In the re-maining first year of bereavement, men had a 3.1-fold increase in suicide mortality and women a2.2-fold increase, and rates remained higher than expected throughout the follow-up period. Overall, these studies suggest that married individuals have a significantly lower rate of suicide than unmarried individuals. In addition, elevations in the suicide rate are especially striking forwidowed men in general and young widowed men in particular. What remains unclear is whetherthis protective effect of marriage on the suicide rate relates to specific benefits of marriage, such asa greater likelihood of social integration. In contrast, the decrease in social integration and the psy-chological experience of loss with widowhood and with divorce may increase the tendency for sui-cide. The suicide rate among divorced individuals could also be higher because individuals whostay married have a greater likelihood of stable mental health at baseline. Other confounding fac-tors, such as differences in substance use or socioeconomic status with marital status, could playadditional roles that should be considered in the assessment process. e) Sexual orientation It remains unclear whether suicide rates in gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals differ from thesuicide rate among heterosexual individuals. One psychological autopsy study compared gaymales to all other similarly aged males in the sample and did not find any characteristics thatdistinguished the two groups (692). However, research on suicide among gay, lesbian, and bi-sexual individuals is particularly complex because of many factors, including small sample sizes,difficulties in achieving random sampling, problems in obtaining baseline prevalences, andproblems in reliability of postmortem reports of sexual orientation. In addition, individualsmay choose not to disclose their sexual orientation to researchers or may engage in same-sexbehavior but not identify themselves as gay or lesbian. The risks for suicide attempts and suicidal ideation in gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals have been assessed by using several approaches. Fergusson et al. (51), analyzing longitudinal datagathered on a New Zealand birth cohort, found that those who identified themselves as gay, les-bian, and bisexual or reported having a same-sex partner since the age of 16 had elevated ratesof suicidal ideation (odds ratio=5.4) and suicide attempts (odds ratio=6.2). A study by Cochranand Mays (50) examined lifetime prevalences of suicide-related symptoms among men withsame-gender partners and found that approximately one-half (53.2%) of the men reported ex-periencing at least one suicide-related symptom in their lifetime, with a suicide attempt reportedby 19.3%. In contrast, in men with female partners only, 33.2% had at least one suicide-relatedsymptom and 3.6% reported a suicide attempt. Corresponding figures for those with no sexualpartners were 28.1% and 0.5%, respectively. Using the population-based Vietnam Era T winRegistry, Herrell et al. (52) identified a subsample of 103 middle-aged male twin pairs in whichone of the twins from each pair reported having a male sexual partner after age 18 while the otherdid not. Suicide attempts were more common in the men with same-gender sexual orientation,with 15% reporting a suicide attempt, compared with only 4% of their twin brothers. In theTwin Registry sample as a whole, which included 16 twin pairs concordant for having a malesexual partner after age 18 and 6,434 twin pairs concordant for having no adult same-genderpartners, the men with same-gender sexual orientation had more than a fourfold increase in sui-cidal ideation and more than a 6.5-fold increase in suicide attempts. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual youths may be at particular risk for suicidal behaviors. Paul et al. (53), in a study of a large urban population-based telephone probability sample of gay men,found that 21% had made a suicide plan and 12% had attempted suicide. Of the latter, almostone-half had made multiple attempts, and most had made their first attempt before age 25. Theimportance of sexual orientation to suicidal behaviors in youths is also highlighted by the find- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

(48). In this study, suicide attempts were reported by 28.1% of bisexual/homosexual males, 20.5% ofbisexual/homosexual and 4.2% of heterosexual males.For males, but not for females, a bisexual/homosexual orientation was associated with suicidalintent (odds ratio=3.61) and with suicide attempts (odds ratio=7.10). Thus, although evidence is limited, there is clearly an elevated risk for suicide attempts among cohorts of gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals that is particularly striking among youths. In addi-tion to addressing risk factors such as psychiatric and substance use disorders in the assessment andtreatment planning processes, it is also important for the clinician to address stresses that are uniqueto being gay, lesbian, or bisexual (e.g., disclosure of sexual orientation to friends and family, homophobia, harassment, and gender nonconformity). Since suicide attempts themselves increase the risk for later suicide, it is presumed that suicide rates may also be increased in gay, lesbian, andbisexual individuals. However, this hypothesis remains to be tested empirically. f) Occupation Occupational groups differ in a number of factors contributing to suicide risk. These factors in-clude demographics (e.g., race, gender, socioeconomic class, and marital status), occupationalstress, psychiatric morbidity, and occupationally associated opportunities for suicide. Althoughmany studies have reported increased rates of suicide in specific occupational groups, most havenot controlled for other suicide risk factors. In one study, however, that controlled for basic de-mographic correlates of suicide across 32 occupations (54), risk was found to be highest amongdentists and physicians, compared with the rest of the working-age population, with multivari-ate logistic regression odds ratios of 5.43 and 2.31, respectively. The odds of suicide were alsosignificantly higher in nurses (1.58 times the risk), social workers (1.52 times the risk), mathe-maticians and scientists (1.47 times the risk), and artists (1.30 times the risk). Rates of suicideamong physicians have also been found to be elevated, compared with rates for other white maleprofessionals, with white male physicians having a 70% greater proportionate mortality ratio forsuicide (58). In well-designed epidemiological studies, police officers have generally not beenfound to be at higher risk for suicide than age- and sex-matched comparison subjects (54, 57). Factors that may play a role in the increased suicide rates in specific professions may include occupational stresses, as is seen in helping professionals (54), or social isolation, as is seen insheepherders, who had the highest suicide rate of 22 occupational groups studied in WashingtonState (56). Although data are inconsistent, additional work stress may occur with infrequent rolesets such as female laborers or pilots (55, 57) or in nontraditional occupations (693). In someoccupations, suicide rates may be influenced by greater access to lethal methods such as medi-cations or chemicals, as in health care professionals, scientists, and agricultural workers (57). Differential rates of psychiatric illness may be present in some occupations and may predate employment. Artists, for example, have higher rates of psychiatric morbidity and suicide thanthe general population. Highly educated people with depressive disorders also have a highersuicide rate. Among physicians, such individuals may tend to specialize in psychiatry (56). In general, specific occupations do seem to be associated with an increased risk for suicide, but more research is needed to distinguish occupational from nonoccupational stressors (56)and to determine whether it is the occupation itself or associated factors such as psychiatricmorbidity that affect suicide risk. 2. Major psychiatric syndromes a) Mood disordersMajor depressive disorder and other depressive syndromes are the most commonly and mostconsistently identified axis I diagnoses in individuals who die by suicide (694, 695). For exam-ple, Robins et al. (60) found that among 134 persons who died by suicide, 98% were psychi- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Barraclough et al. (65), in a similar study, found that of 100 individuals who died by suicide, 93% were mentally ill and 85% hadeither depression or alcoholism. Henriksson et al. (59), using psychological autopsy methodsto investigate current mental disorders among a random sample of 229 persons who died bysuicide during a 1-year period in Finland, found that 93% of those persons had received at leastone axis I diagnosis and that 59% had a depressive disorder. In patients with bipolar disorder who die by suicide, the majority are experiencing either a depressive or mixed episode of illness (69, 72, 315). For example, Isometsa et al. (68) notedthat among 31 patients with bipolar disorder identified in a group of 1,397 persons who diedby suicide in Finland in a 12-month period, 79% died while in a major depressive episode and11% while in a mixed state. In a study of more than 300 patients who were discontinued fromlithium treatment, Baldessarini et al. (696) found that the majority of suicidal acts occurredeither during a major depressive episode (73%) or during a dysphoric-mixed episode (16%). In addition to being highly prevalent in individuals who die from suicide, mood disorders have long been associated with an increased risk for suicide. For example, in 1970, Guze andRobins (697) reviewed 17 studies that assessed the risk of suicide in individuals with primaryaffective disorders and calculated the frequency of suicide as a percentage of all deaths. Highsuicide rates were found, with the ultimate risk of suicide estimated to be about 15%, or ap-proximately 30 times that seen in the general population. For major depression, review of theliterature suggests that overall rates of suicide mortality range from 5% to 26% and are abouttwice as high for men as for women (694). However, these studies generally assessed severely illpatient populations and individuals early in the course of their illness, when suicide rates areknown to be highest. Several investigators have subsequently reexamined these estimates of lifetime suicide risk in individuals with mood disorders. For example, Inskip et al. (94), using cohort-based curve-fittingtechniques and data from previous studies, estimated the lifetime risk for suicide in mood disor-ders to be 6%. In addition, Bostwick and Pankratz (77) used data from prior studies to calculatecase fatality prevalences (the ratio of suicides to the total number of subjects) to determine suiciderisks for three groups of patients with affective disorders\u2014outpatients, inpatients, and suicidal in-patients. With this method, which provides a less biased estimate of risk, they found a gradationin suicide risk that varied with treatment setting as well as with hospitalization for suicidality. Forexample, in patients with mood disorders who were previously hospitalized for suicidality, the es-timated lifetime prevalence of suicide was 8.6%, compared to a lifetime risk of 4% for those witha psychiatric hospitalization for any reason. For mixed inpatient/outpatient populations, the prev-alence of suicide was 2.2%, whereas for the populations without affective illness, it was less than0.5%. For individuals with major depressive disorder, Blair-West et al. (205) used age- and gen-der-stratified calculations to arrive at comparable estimates for lifetime suicide risk of 3.4%, witha lifetime risk for males more than six times than for females (6.8% versus 1.1%). Harris and Barraclough (64), in their meta-analysis of suicide as an outcome in psychiatric illness, assessed relative suicide risk in mood disorder by calculating SMRs. Their analysis useddata from published English-language studies that had mean or median follow-up periods ofat least 2 years and that provided sufficient data to calculate ratios of observed to expected num-bers of suicides. For patients with major depressive disorder, 23 studies that included a total of351 suicides among more than 8,000 patients yielded an SMR of 20.35, or a 20-fold increasein risk. A key finding was that risk in patients with major depressive disorder was highest im-mediately after hospital discharge (698, 699). For patients with bipolar disorder, data from 15studies including a total of 93 suicides among 3,700 subjects yielded an SMR for suicide of15.05. Although patients with dysthymia also had an elevated SMR for suicide, of 12.12, thenine studies that contributed to this estimate were extremely heterogeneous in their findingsand most had extremely small samples, which raises some question about the validity of thisapproximation.

Hoyer et al. (75) used data from the Danish Psychiatric Case Reg- ister to determine SMRs for suicide among 54,103 patients (19,638 male and 34,465 femalepatients) who had an initial admission to a Danish psychiatric hospital between 1973 and 1993and who received a mood disorder diagnosis. During the study period, 29% of the patientsdied, and of those, suicide occurred in 20%. Standardized mortalities for suicide were compa-rable for patients with ICD-8 diagnoses of unipolar major depression, psychotic reactive de-pression, and bipolar disorder, with of 19.33, 18.67, and 18.09, respectively. In contrast,the SMR for suicide in patients with neurotic depression was significantly less, at 10.51. In alldiagnostic subgroups and regardless of age and gender, the risk of suicide was greatest duringthe first year after the initial admission, decreased over the subsequent 5 years, and then stabi-lized. Overall, the risk for suicide was comparable in men and women, except in patients withbipolar disorder, for whom the SMR for suicide was somewhat greater in women than in men(20.31 versus 18.09). In a similarly designed study using data from a Swedish inpatient register, Osby et al. (73) obtained the date and cause of death for patients hospitalized between 1973 and 1995 with adiagnosis of bipolar disorder (N=15,386) or unipolar depressive disorder (N=39,182). SMRsfor suicide were found to be significantly increased in women and in patients with a unipolardepressive disorder diagnosis (15.0 for male bipolar disorder patients, 20.9 for male unipolardepressive disorder patients, 22.4 for female bipolar disorder patients, and 27.0 for female un-ipolar depressive disorder patients). Suicide mortality was more pronounced in younger indi-viduals and with shorter intervals from the index hospitalization. Although SMRs decreased inall age groups with increasing time of follow-up, some suicide risk persisted even at long follow-up intervals. Baxter and Appleby (188) used the Salford (U.K.) Psychiatric Case Register to identify 7,921 individuals who had received psychiatric or mental health care and determined theirmortality rates (estimated as rate ratios) over a follow-up period of up to 18 years. Among in-dividuals with affective disorders, there was a 12.2-fold elevation in observed suicide mortalityin men, compared to expected mortality based on population rates. For women, the relativeincrease in suicide mortality was even greater, with a 16.3-fold elevation. Angst et al. (74) followed a sample of 406 hospitalized patients with mood disorders (220 with bipolar disorder and 186 with unipolar depressive disorder) on a prospective basis for 22years or more and found an overall standardized mortality rate for suicide of 18.04, comparableto the SMRs found in the Swedish and Danish longitudinal follow-up studies. Sixty-one percentof the sample had manifested psychotic symptoms at least once over their lifetime, suggestingthat this was a particularly ill group of patients. The suicide rate was greatest near the age of illnessonset; however, from ages 30 to 70 years, the rate was remarkably constant, suggesting a per-sistence of risk throughout the illness course. The suicide mortality in women was greater thanthat in men (SMR of 21.87 for women, compared to 13.49 for men), in part reflecting thegreater rate of suicide for men in the general population. Patients with unipolar depressive dis-order had a significantly higher rate of suicide than patients with bipolar I disorder or bipolarII disorder, with an SMR for suicide of 26.7, compared with 12.3 for bipolar disorder patients.The SMR for suicide did not differ significantly between bipolar I disorder patients and bipolarII disorder patients. Some evidence suggests that in individuals with mood disorders, the rate of suicide may be increasing over time. For example, Harris and Barraclough (64) noted that the suicide risk forpatients with major depression in cohorts treated before 1970 was increased by 17-fold in con-trast to a 36-fold increase in risk for cohorts treated after 1970. In the study described earlier,Hoyer et al. (75) noted an increase in both the absolute and relative risks for suicide over the20-year study time period, and they suggested that the increase may have been related tochanges in the health care delivery system and the availability of psychiatric inpatient services.

(563) observed that the annualized rates of suicide and suicide attempts in patients with major affective disorders appear to have risen across the decades since1970. This trend was sustained and statistically significant for both suicides and suicide at-tempts, as well as for treated and untreated samples considered separately. Although this appar-ent secular trend could reflect increased recruitment of more severely ill patients to more recentstudies or increased reporting of suicidal behaviors, the percentage reduction of suicide riskwith lithium treatment did not decline across the years, suggesting that the patient populationsare in fact comparable and that the prevention of suicide in major affective disorders is becom-ing increasingly challenging (558). Furthermore, suicide attempts that do occur in individualswith major mood disorders may be more lethal than suicide attempts by individuals in the gen-eral population. The reported ratio of suicide attempts to deaths from suicide averages between3:1 and 5:1 among persons with mood disorders, whereas in the general population the suicideattempt rate has been estimated to be about 10-20 times (average, 18 times) greater than thesuicide rate, or about 0.3% per year (700). For individuals with mood disorders, it is also important to note factors that are particularly associated with increased risk. Fawcett et al. (79, 313) determined time-related predictors ofsuicide in a sample of 954 psychiatric inpatients in the NIMH Collaborative Program on thePsychobiology of Depression, about one-third of whom had bipolar disorder and the rest ofwhom had other mood disorders. During the initial 10 years of follow-up, 34 patients died bysuicide, an overall rate that was extremely low, at 0.36% per year. The first year of follow-upwas the time of highest risk, with 38% of suicides occurring during that period. Within 1 yearof admission, six factors were associated with suicide: panic attacks, severe psychic anxiety, di-minished concentration, global insomnia, moderate alcohol abuse, and anhedonia. The threefactors associated with suicide that occurred after 1 year were severe hopelessness, suicidal ide-ation, and history of previous suicide attempts. By 14 years, among individuals for whom fol-low-up information was available, 36 had died by suicide, 120 had attempted suicide, and 373had no recorded suicide attempt (247). Analysis at that time point showed that patients whodied by suicide and patients with suicide attempts shared core characteristics, including a his-tory of previous suicide attempts, alcohol and substance abuse, impulsivity, and psychic tur-moil within a cycling/mixed bipolar disorder. In contrast to suicide within 12 months ofintake, which was predicted by clinical variables, suicide beyond 12 months was prospectivelypredicted by temperament attributes, such as higher levels of impulsivity and assertiveness.Stressful life events (701), executive dysfunction (702), and higher levels of depression (10, 78,221, 222, 703) may also be associated with greater risk, as may an awareness of the discrepan-cies between a previously envisioned \"normal\" future and the patient's likely degree of futurechronic disability (273). In summary, mood disorders are consistently identified as conferring a significant increase in the risk for suicide as well as for suicide attempts. However, among individuals with mooddisorders, a variety of factors commonly modify that risk and should be taken into consider-ation during the assessment and treatment planning processes. These factors include the spe-cific mood disorder diagnosis and duration of illness, the type and severity of the moodepisode, the prior history of treatment, the presence of comorbid diagnoses or specific psychi-atric symptoms such as severe anxiety or agitation, and the occurrence of significant psycho-social stressors. It is important to note, however, that this increased risk of suicidal behaviorsamong individuals with mood disorders has been consistently shown to be modifiable withtreatment (see Section VI.D, \"Somatic Therapies\"). b) Schizophrenia Schizophrenia has also been associated with an increase risk of suicide in multiple studies. Har-ris and Barraclough (172), for example, analyzed data from 38 studies that had follow-upperiods of up to 60 years.

Baxter and Appleby (188), in a case registry study of long-termsuicide risk in the United Kingdom, found an even higher 14-fold increase in rate ratios forsuicide among individuals with schizophrenia. In contrast, using cohort-based curve-fittingtechniques and data from 29 studies of mortality in schizophrenia, Inskip et al. (94) estimatedthe lifetime risk for suicide as 4%. In addition to assessing suicide rates among patients with schizophrenia, longitudinal follow- up studies have also examined factors associated with increased risk of suicide. Black et al. (98)found that suicide occurred in 14 of 688 schizophrenia patients (2%) who were admitted to anIowa psychiatric hospital over a 10-year period, with the majority of deaths occurring within 2years of hospital discharge. Although women were found to be at relatively greater risk, the num-bers of suicides significantly exceeded expected rates for both male and female patients. Nymanand Jonsson (101) found that suicide occurred in 10 of 110 (9%) young patients with schizo-phrenia who were hospitalized between 1964 and 1967 and followed for up to 17 years. In thisgroup, suicide was associated with a more chronic course as well as with social and financial de-pendency. Dingman and McGlashan (103) longitudinally followed 163 Chestnut Lodgepatients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and noted that the 13 patients who died by suicidewere predominantly male and had a later onset of illness, less chronic illness, better premorbidfunctioning, and a greater ability for abstract and conceptual thinking. At a later follow-up(mean=19 years), 6.4% of the Chestnut Lodge sample had died by suicide, and this group hadexhibited fewer negative symptoms but more severe delusions and suspiciousness at index ad-mission than those who did not die by suicide (93). A group of young psychotic patients whohad not exhibited a chronic course was followed after discharge from an index hospitalizationby Westermeyer et al. (83), who found that 36 patients died by suicide and 550 did not. Suicideoccurred in about 9% of individuals with schizophrenia and was more likely during the earlyyears of their illness, particularly within 6 years of initial hospitalization. At greater risk for sui-cide were unmarried white male patients with chronic symptoms, relatively high IQs, and agradual onset of illness. De Hert et al. (89) studied outcomes for 870 patients (536 men and 334 women) with schizophrenia (87%) or schizoaffective disorder (13%) after a mean duration of follow-up of11.4 years. Sixty-three individuals died by suicide, yielding a suicide rate of 635 per 100,000per year and an SMR for suicide of 39.7. The frequency of suicide in men was twice that inwomen, although the SMR and the age at the time of suicide did not differ significantly be-tween the sexes. Of the suicides, 33 (52.4%) occurred while the patient was hospitalized(although only nine actually took place in the hospital) and 12 (19.1%) occurred during thefirst 6 months after discharge. When the patients who died by suicide were compared with anage- and sex-matched group of 63 patients from the remaining sample, a number of differencesbetween the groups were observed. Those who died by suicide were more likely to have a familyhistory of suicide, had had more and shorter hospitalizations and more past suicide attempts,and were more likely to have used a highly lethal method in prior suicide attempts. They alsohad higher total WAIS IQ scores and were more likely to have been psychotic or depressed orto have suffered a major loss in the 6 months before death or follow-up. Compared with con-trol subjects, the patients who died by suicide were also less likely to have received community-based care and were less likely to have had a useful daily activity, remission of symptoms, or anearly onset of prominent negative symptoms. Among individuals with schizophrenia who die by suicide, a number of demographic fac- tors seem to be present more often than in living control subjects. In a cohort of 9,156 patientswith schizophrenia, Rossau and Mortensen (95) individually matched 10 control subjects toeach of 508 individuals who were admitted to Danish hospitals between 1970 and 1987 andwho later died by suicide. They found suicide risk to be particularly high during the first 5 days Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Increases in risk were also associated with multiple psychiatric admissions during the previous year, previoussuicide attempts, previous diagnosis of depression, male sex, and previous admissions to generalhospitals for physical disorders. Breier and Astrachan (102) compared 20 schizophrenia pa-tients who died by suicide with a randomly selected sex-matched group of nonsuicidal schizo-phrenia patients and a group of persons without schizophrenia who died by suicide. Patientswith schizophrenia who died by suicide were more likely to be men and tended to be young,white, and never married. In contrast to the persons without schizophrenia who died by sui-cide, the schizophrenia patients who died by suicide tended not to show a temporal relationshipof suicide with suicide attempts or stressful life events. Among individuals who died by suicide, comparisons have also been made between those with schizophrenia and those with other diagnoses. Heila et al. (100) used psychological autopsy datafor 1,397 individuals who died by suicide over a 1-year period in Finland and compared the 92individuals with schizophrenia (7%) to the remainder of the sample. They found that suicide oc-curred at any point during the course of schizophrenia and over a large age range. In addition,among the individuals with schizophrenia, 71% had a history of suicide attempts, and, particu-larly in women, active illness and depressive symptoms were often observed immediately beforethe suicide. Significant life events, however, were seen less often before suicide in individuals withschizophrenia than in those with other diagnoses (46% and 83%, respectively). Other studies have found suicidal ideation and suicide attempts to be common among in- dividuals with schizophrenia. For example, in the Chestnut Lodge sample, over an average of19 years of follow-up, 40% of the patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders reported sui-cidal ideation since their initial hospitalization, and 23% reported at least one suicide attempt(93). Radomsky et al. (80) evaluated lifetime rates of suicidal behavior among 1,048 consecu-tively admitted psychiatric inpatients with DSM-III-R psychotic disorders. Of the 454 indi-viduals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, 27.3% reported at least one lifetime suicide attempt,with an additional 26.4% reporting suicidal ideation only. For the 159 patients with schizo-affective disorder, 42.8% and 27% reported suicide attempts and suicidal ideation, respectively.Roy et al. (117) found that 55% of a series of 127 consecutively admitted patients with chronicschizophrenia had previously made a suicide attempt. Harkavy-Friedman et al. (108), in a sam-ple of 104 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, found that 33% had madea suicide attempt, with 60% of those reporting multiple attempts. Attempts were often medi-cally serious, requiring medical inpatient care in 57% of cases and emergency medical evalua-tion in an additional 11%, and were associated with strong suicidal intent (in the 76% ofpatients for whom this information was available). As with suicide in schizophrenia, initial sui-cide attempts tended to occur early during the course of the illness. A number of specific factors appear to increase the likelihood of a suicide attempt among in- dividuals with schizophrenia. For example, in the study by Roy et al. (117), those who had at-tempted suicide had significantly more psychiatric admissions and were more likely to haveexperienced a major depressive episode or received antidepressant treatment, compared withthose who had not attempted suicide. Young et al. (704), in a longitudinal study of 96 individualswith recent-onset schizophrenia who were followed for a 1-year period, noted that depression wasmoderately correlated with concurrent suicidality but was not independently associated with fu-ture suicidality, whereas the presence of suicidal ideation even at low levels increased the risk forsignificant suicidal ideation or a suicide attempt during the subsequent 3 months. In their sample,Harkavy-Friedman et al. (108) found that suicide attempts were reported to be precipitated bydepression (27%), loss of a significant other or other stressful life event (24%), being bothered bypsychotic symptoms (11%), and responding to command hallucinations (4%). In a subsequentstudy of 100 individuals with schizophrenia, Harkavy-Friedman et al. (106) found that 8% ofsuicide attempts were associated with command auditory hallucinations for suicide and that in-dividuals with previous suicide attempts were at particularly increased risk.

Increased insight, specifically aware-ness of delusions and negative symptoms, has also been noted in individuals with schizophreniawho experience recurrent suicidal thoughts and behaviors (706). In summary, an increase in the risks of suicide and suicide attempts is seen in individuals with schizophrenia and should be taken into consideration in the assessment and treatmentplanning process. Additional factors that modify risk include the duration of illness, the pa-tient's insight into the illness's implications, the patient's history of treatment, and the presenceof comorbid diagnoses or specific psychiatric symptoms, such as depression, hopelessness, ornegative symptoms. As with mood disorders, however , increasing evidence also suggests thatthe risk of suicidal behaviors among individuals with schizophrenia can be modifiable withtreatment (see Section VI.D, \"Somatic Therapies\"). c) Anxiety disorders Data on lifetime rates of suicide among patients with anxiety disorders are limited but suggestthat these diagnoses are associated with an increase in suicide risk. At the same time, it is notclear whether anxiety disorders represent an independent risk factor for suicide or whether thisincreased risk is attributable to the presence of depressive disorders or substance use disorders,which commonly co-occur with anxiety disorders. Among broadly defined groups of individuals with anxiety disorders, increased rates of sui- cide have been seen in several studies. Khan et al. (118) used the U.S. Food and Drug Admin-istration (FDA) database to assess the risk of suicide among patients who were participating inrecent clinical trials of antianxiety medications and had diagnoses of panic disorder, social pho-bia, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disor-der. Among the 20,076 patients, 12 died by suicide, yielding a suicide risk among patients withanxiety disorders of 193 per 100,000 patients, or at least 10-fold higher than that in the generalpopulation. This finding is particularly striking since the patients were receiving treatment andsince current suicidality is generally an exclusion criterion for clinical trials. Allgulander (119)also noted an increased risk of suicide in individuals with anxiety disorders. Data on 9,912 pa-tients with anxiety neurosis in the Swedish National Psychiatric Case Register between 1973and 1983 yielded SMRs for suicide before age 45 of 6.7 and 4.9 for men and women, respec-tively. Suicide risk was highest within 3 months of discharge and was two- to threefold less thanthe risk in individuals with depressive neurosis. Several studies have examined characteristics of patients with panic attacks or panic disorder who have died by suicide. Henriksson et al. (707) used data on suicides in Finland in a 1-yearperiod to examine the relationship between panic disorder and suicide. All of the 17 persons witha current diagnosis of panic disorder who died by suicide\u20141.22% of the 1,397 suicides in Fin-land in the 1-year period\u2014also had another axis I disorder, most often major depression. A sub-stance use disorder was found in one-half of these individuals, with almost one-half of thosepersons also receiving an axis II diagnosis. These results are in accord with those of a study by Bar-raclough et al. (65), which found a principal diagnosis of either alcoholism or depression in vir-tually all persons who died by suicide and who had had a panic attack in the week before death. Two smaller follow-up studies of patients with panic disorder yielded similar conclusions. Noyes et al. (122) found that 4% (three of 74) of patients with panic disorder followed up after7 years had died by suicide, with an additional 7% (five of 74) having made a serious suicide at-tempt. Comorbid diagnoses, particularly major depression and axis II disorders, were more likelyto be present in those who died by suicide and in serious suicide attempters. Coryell et al. (123)found that 35 years after an index admission, approximately 20% of 113 patients with panic dis-order had died by suicide and that alcoholism and secondary depression may have had a role inthose deaths.

In a random sample of 18,011 adults from five U.S. communities derived from the ECA study, Weissmanet al. (125) found that the presence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts varied. Levels werehighest among subjects with a lifetime diagnosis of panic disorder, followed by those who hadpanic attacks but not panic disorder and those with other DSM-III disorders but not panic at-tacks or panic disorder; lower levels were found in individuals with no prior panic attacks orDSM-III diagnoses. Weissman et al. also found that 20% of the subjects with panic disorderand 12% of those with panic attacks had made suicide attempts. Furthermore, this increase inrisk was not solely attributable to comorbid diagnoses, since the lifetime rate of suicide at-tempts for persons with uncomplicated panic disorder was consistently higher than that forpersons with no psychiatric disorder (7% and 1%, respectively) (708). This conclusion con-trasted with the findings of Hornig and McNally (137), who reanalyzed the ECA data with theeffects of comorbid disorders and sociodemographic variables controlled in the aggregate ratherthan singly. Using both stepwise and backward logistic regression analyses, they did not findpanic disorder to be associated with a significant increase in risk for suicide attempts beyondthat predicted by the presence of other disorders. Other investigators have assessed other populations to determine whether panic attacks or panic disorder is associated with increases in suicidal behaviors. Pilowsky et al. (130), in a study of 1,580adolescents in an urban public school system, found that suicidal ideation was three times morelikely and a history of suicide attempts twice as likely in individuals with panic attacks, even afterthe effects of demographic factors, major depression, and substance use were controlled. Fleet et al.(136) assessed 441 consecutive patients who presented to an emergency department with chestpain and who underwent a structured psychiatric interview. Of the total sample, 108 (25%) metthe DSM-III-R criteria for panic disorder. The investigators found that more of those with panicdisorder had experienced suicidal ideation during the preceding week than of those without panicdisorder (25% and 5%, respectively), even after controlling for the effect of coexisting major de-pression. In addition, of the 44 patients (10% of the sample) who had experienced suicidal ideationduring the preceding week, 60% met the DSM-III-R criteria for panic disorder (709). Thus, inboth of these populations, panic attacks or panic disorder was a significant risk factor for suicidalideation or suicide attempts, independent of comorbid disorders. Other studies have assessed psychiatric outpatients with panic disorder and have demon- strated substantial variability in its effect on suicidality. Cox et al. (124), for example, used thesuicide questions from the ECA study to assess 106 patients with panic disorder and found that31% of the patients reported suicidal ideation and 18% reported a history of suicide attempts.Very few individuals with suicidal ideation reported actual suicide attempts within the preced-ing year. However, when suicide attempts did occur, they were predominantly in the contextof depressed mood. In a sample of 100 outpatients with panic disorder, Lepine et al. (129)found that 42% had a prior suicide attempt. Suicide attempters were more likely to be femaleor unmarried, and 88% of the patients met the DSM-III-R criteria for at least one additionaldiagnosis, predominantly major depressive disorder (52%) or substance use disorder (31%).Warshaw et al. (127) followed 498 patients with panic disorder and found a 6% risk of suicidalbehaviors over a 5-year period. Being married or having children were protective factors, where-as mood disorders, substance use, eating disorders, personality disorders, female sex, and a priorhistory of suicide attempts were associated with increased risk. In the absence of other risk fac-tors, the risk of a suicide attempt in persons with panic disorder was minimal. King et al. (126)studied 346 depressed outpatients and found a significant difference in the frequency of suicideattempts in those with a history of panic attacks compared with those without such a history(26.9% and 16.8%, respectively). Paradoxically, however, depressed patients with a history ofinfrequent panic attacks had a higher incidence of suicide attempts than those with panic dis-order (32.3% and 21.5%, respectively). Friedman et al. (710) assessed 293 patients with panic Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

A past history of suicide attempts was reported by 25% of the patients with comorbid borderline personality disorderand by 2% of those without that comorbidity. In contrast, Beck et al. (128) found that noneof the 73 patients with primary panic disorder in a study of 900 consecutive psychiatric outpa-tients reported having made a prior suicide attempt. Other anxiety disorders, although less well studied, may also influence suicide attempts or suicidal ideation. For example, in recent clinical trials of new antianxiety medications that in-cluded patients with a broad range of diagnoses, the risk of suicide attempts was increasedrelative to the general population, with attempts occurring in 28 of 20,076 patients, for an an-nualized risk of 1,350 per 100,000 patients (118). Cox et al. (124) found that of 41 outpatientswith a diagnosis of social phobia, 14 (34%) had experienced suicidal ideation and two (5%)had made a suicide attempt within the prior year, although five (12%) had at least one lifetimesuicide attempt. Oquendo et al. (131) assessed 156 inpatients with a diagnosis of major depres-sive episode and found that those with comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder were more likelyto have attempted suicide, a finding that was more prominent in women than in men and thatwas independent of the presence of borderline personality disorder. Schaffer et al. (132) retro-spectively reviewed the assessments of 533 patients with major depression and found that sui-cidal ideation was present in 57.8%. Suicidal ideation was more likely to be present in the43.2% of the sample that had a lifetime anxiety disorder, and this association was independentof either age or severity of depressive symptoms. In contrast, in a study of 272 inpatients withat least one major depressive episode, Placidi et al. (220) found that rates of panic disorder didnot differ between the 143 patients who had attempted suicide and the 129 patients who hadnot. In fact, agitation, psychic anxiety, and hypochondriasis were more severe in the nonat-tempter group, and these effects were independent of severity of aggression and impulsivity.However, rates of comorbid borderline personality disorder were much greater in those whoattempted suicide, which may have contributed to these findings. Even subsyndromal anxiety symptoms may contribute to an increase in risk. For example, Marshall et al. (135) found that rates of suicidal ideation increased linearly and significantlywith an increasing number of subthreshold symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. Theyreported that for the 2,608 of 9,358 individuals who were screened in 1997 as part of NationalAnxiety Disorders Screening Day and who reported at least one symptom of posttraumaticstress disorder of at least 1 month's duration, the risk of suicidal ideation was increased, evenafter controlling for the effect of comorbid major depressive disorder. Anxiety disorders may be overrepresented among individuals with suicidal ideation or suicide attempts. Pirkis et al. (383) analyzed data from 10,641 respondents in the Australian NationalSurvey of Mental Health and Wellbeing and found that the relative risk of anxiety disorder wasincreased 3.5-fold in individuals with suicidal ideation in the prior year and increased sevenfoldin those with a suicide attempt in the prior year. Thus, available evidence suggests that anxiety disorders, particularly panic disorder, may be associated with increased rates of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. It remains un-clear whether panic attacks and panic disorder represent independent risk factors for suicide orwhether elevations in suicidality associated with these disorders are simply a reflection of co-morbidity with other disorders such as depression, substance use disorders, or personality dis-orders. Nonetheless, individuals with anxiety disorders warrant explicit evaluation and follow-up for comorbid diagnoses and for suicide risk. Psychiatrists should also be alert for maskedanxiety symptoms and for anxiety disorders that are misdiagnosed as physical illnesses. d) Eating disorders Studies point to eating disorders in general as a risk factor for death and as a likely risk factorfor suicide. For example, Harris and Barraclough (64) calculated SMRs for suicide using datafrom 15 studies and found a 23.1-fold increase in risk in patients with eating disorders.

(138), in an 11-year longitudinal study of 246 women with eating disorders, noted a crude mortality rate of 5.1% and an SMR for death by any cause of 9.6. Three of the womendied by suicide, yielding a significantly elevated SMR for suicide of 58.1. The risk associated with specific eating disorders is less clear. Eckert et al. (139), in a similar longitudinal study, examined the clinical course and outcome of anorexia nervosa in 76 severelyill females. Although none of the deaths were attributed to suicide, by the time of 10-year fol-low-up, five subjects (6.6%) had died, yielding an almost 13-fold increase in mortality. Coren and Hewitt (140) extracted data from all death certificates in the United States reg- istered with the National Center for Health Statistics from 1986 through 1990. Of 5.5 millionfemales who died in that period, 571 had anorexia nervosa listed as an underlying cause or ac-companying condition of death. Of these, 1.4% died by suicide, compared to 4.1% of amatched control sample, suggesting that the risk of suicide in persons with anorexia nervosa is,if anything, lower than that in control subjects. However, substantial underreporting bias maybe present, since personnel recording information on death certificates may not recognize an-orexia as a contributory comorbid condition. Eating disorders, particularly bulimia nervosa, have also been associated with an increased rate of suicide attempts, and, conversely, suicide attempters may have an increased rate of abnormaleating behaviors. Kent et al. (141) compared 48 women who were referred for psychiatric assess-ment after an act of deliberate self-poisoning with 50 control subjects who were evaluated in ahospital emergency department after a minor accidental injury. Even after controlling for the ef-fect of differences in rates of depression, the investigators found that disordered eating behaviorswere significantly more prevalent in the self-poisoning group. Compared to the general commu-nity, for whom surveys suggest rates of bulimia nervosa of 1%-2%, four subjects (8%) in the self-poisoning group met the diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa. Thus, awareness of eating disor-ders may be important in evaluating patients after a suicide attempt. By the same token, suicide attempts may be more likely in women with eating disorders. Us- ing anonymous survey data gathered from 3,630 girls in grades 6 through 12 in the upper Mid-west, Thompson et al. (142) found that eating disturbances and aggressive behavior weresignificantly associated with substance use and with attempted suicide. In addition, adolescentsreporting disturbed eating behaviors were three times more likely to report suicidal behaviorsthan were other respondents. In summary, individuals with eating disorders may be at increased risk for suicidal behav- iors. Anorexia nervosa seems more likely to be a potential risk factor for suicide, whereas binge-ing, purging, and bulimia may be more likely to be associated with suicide attempts. The roleof comorbid diagnoses in increasing the risk of suicidal behaviors remains unclear. Also unclearis whether the self-imposed morbidity and mortality associated with severe caloric restrictionor bingeing and purging should be viewed as a self-injurious or suicidal behavior. Regardless,clinicians conducting suicide risk assessment should be attentive to the presence of eating dis-orders and especially the co-occurrence of eating disorders with other psychiatric disorders orsymptoms such as depression or deliberate self-harm. e) ADHD The relationship between ADHD and suicidal behavior is unclear, with some but not all studiesindicating an association between the diagnosis of ADHD and suicide attempts or suicide. Toidentify psychiatric risk factors for adolescent suicide, Brent et al. (145) used psychological au-topsy data to match 67 adolescents who died by suicide to community control subjects. At thetime of death, 89.6% of those who died by suicide had a psychiatric disorder, with major de-pression, bipolar disorder-mixed episode, substance use disorder, and conduct disorder seen atincreased rates relative to the rates for the community control subjects. In contrast, the rate ofADHD in those who died by suicide was 13.4% and did not differ from the rate in the controlsubjects (145). Similarly, in a case-control study of adolescent suicide attempters, ADHD wasactually less likely in those who attempted suicide than in the control subjects (146).

(144) compared 60 sub- jects with ADHD, combined type, to 36 subjects with ADHD, predominantly inattentive type, and to 64 community control subjects. A higher proportion of the group with ADHD,combined type (15%), reported attempting suicide, compared with the group with ADHD,predominantly inattentive type (2.8%), and the control group (0%). Compared to the controlgroup, both ADHD groups had greater amounts of psychological distress, received more pre-scriptions for psychiatric medication and more types of psychiatric services, and had a higherprevalence of alcohol/cannabis use disorders and learning disorders. The groups did not differin comorbidity of conduct disorder, major depressive disorder, or anxiety disorders. Patientswith the combined type of ADHD are clinically more likely to present with distractible andimpulsive behavior, whereas patients with the predominantly inattentive type of ADHD aremore likely to present with problems of staring, daydreaming, confusion, passivity, withdrawal,and sluggishness or hypoactivity. These differences in clinical features may account for the dif-ferences in the numbers of suicide attempts in the two subgroups. Nasser and Overholser (143) examined the lethality of suicidal behavior in 60 hospitalized ad- olescent inpatients who had recently attempted suicide. The subjects were divided into threeequal groups on the basis of the qualities of their suicidal acts (nonlethal, low-lethal, and high-lethal). The groups did not differ significantly in terms of hopelessness, depression, substanceabuse, and self-esteem or in diagnoses of major depression, adjustment disorder, substance abuse,and bipolar disorder. However, the group of high-lethal attempters included four individuals witha diagnosis of major depressive episode and comorbid ADHD. Thus, it may be the comorbidityof ADHD with other disorders that increases the relative lethality of suicide attempts. In summary, evidence for an independent association between ADHD and risk for suicide or attempted suicide appears weak. Individuals with ADHD, combined type, seem to be at greaterrisk than those with ADHD, predominantly inattentive type, perhaps because of an increased lev-el of impulsivity. In addition, there may be a relationship between ADHD and suicide risk thatrelates to comorbidity with conduct disorder, substance abuse, and/or depressive disorder. Giventhe frequent occurrence of ADHD in patients with other psychiatric disorders, it is important forpsychiatrists to be aware that comorbid ADHD may augment the risk of suicidal behaviors. f) Alcohol use disorders The presence of an alcohol use disorder increases suicide risk. Estimates based on computerizedcurve fitting of data from 27 studies have suggested a 7% lifetime risk of suicide in individualswith alcohol dependence (94). Other approximations of lifetime suicide risk have ranged from3.4% to as high as 15% (148, 157) but vary by country and depend on the definition of alco-holism used. In fact, the vast majority of studies have not used the DSM-IV criteria for alcoholuse disorders, making comparisons across studies difficult. As a result, descriptions of studiesin this document will use the diagnostic terms employed by the study authors. Harris and Barraclough (64) used data from 32 publications, including findings for more than 45,000 individuals with follow-up periods for up to 30 years, to calculate an SMR for sui-cide of 5.86 among persons with alcohol abuse or dependence. The overall suicide rate forwomen with alcohol abuse or dependence was about 20 times the expected rate, whereas therate for men was only about four times the expected rate. Beck et al. (227) also found a risk ofsuicide in alcoholics that was about fivefold greater than in nonalcoholics in a sample of 413patients hospitalized for a suicide attempt and prospectively followed for 5-10 years. They alsonoted that the timing of suicides was spread throughout the follow-up, with no particular pe-riod of increased risk. The association between alcohol use disorders and suicide is also demonstrated by psycho- logical autopsy studies, which show alcohol use disorders to be common among individualswho die by suicide. For example, Henriksson et al. (59), in a random sample of 229 Finnishsuicide deaths during a 1-year period, found that alcohol dependence was present in 43% of Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

(150) found that 39% of 141 individuals who died by suicide over a 2.5-year period had had a history of alcohol use disorder. Significant rates of alcohol use were also seen in a sample of youth suicides that included older adolescents. Brent et al. (151) examined death certificates and coroners' reports for all sui-cides, undetermined causes of death, and questionable accidents for 10- to 19-year-old resi-dents of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, from 1960 to 1983. Altogether, 159 definite suicidesand 38 likely suicides were noted, but the suicide rate increased markedly over the study period,particularly among white males ages 15-19 years. During the study period there was also a 3.6-fold increase in the percentage of suicides with detectable blood alcohol levels (12.9% in 1968-1972, compared to 46.0% in 1978-1983). In addition, the rate of suicide by firearms increasedmuch faster than that by other methods (2.5-fold and 1.7-fold, respectively), and persons whodied by suicide with firearms were almost five times more likely to have been drinking thanindividuals who used other suicide methods. A number of factors have been specifically observed with suicide in individuals with alcohol use disorders (153). Murphy et al. (152), in a study of 50 alcoholics who died by suicide, foundthat 26% had experienced interpersonal loss within 6 weeks of their death. These findings werecomparable to those in a prior group of 31 alcoholics who died by suicides, one-third of whomhad experienced the loss of a close interpersonal relationship within 6 weeks of the suicide. Anearlier study by Murphy and Robins (156) also found a high proportion of recent interpersonaldisruptions, as did a study of suicides in San Diego by Rich et al. (67). To identify other factorsassociated with increased risk for suicide among alcoholics, a subsequent study by Murphy etal. (149) pooled these two similar groups of alcoholics who died by suicide and compared themto two control samples of white male alcoholics, one from a psychiatric patient population andone from the ECA community-based population. Clinical features that were significantly morefrequent among those who died by suicide than among the control subjects included currentalcohol use, poor social support, serious physical illness, unemployment, living alone, and hav-ing made a suicidal communication. Eighty-three percent of the alcoholics who died by suicidehad four or more of the seven risk factors. Pirkola et al. (154) also examined factors associated with increased likelihood of suicide among alcohol misusers. They found that alcohol misusers who died by suicide (N=349) weremore likely to be young, male, and divorced or separated, compared with individuals who didnot misuse alcohol in the several months preceding their suicide (N=648). Alcohol misuserswere also more likely to be intoxicated with alcohol at the time of death or to have died froman overdose of medications. Those with alcohol misuse had also experienced more adverse lifeevents close to the time of their suicide despite having better psychosocial adjustment earlier intheir lifetime. For example, alcoholics who died by suicide had more often worked but werealso more likely to be recently unemployed. A number of studies have identified comorbid disorders as being common among individ- uals with alcohol use disorders who die by suicide. In a series of 1,312 alcoholics admitted toa Swedish psychiatric hospital between 1949 and 1969 and followed through 1980, Berglund(157) found that alcoholics who died by suicide had a higher rate of depressive and dysphoricsymptoms than alcoholics who died of other causes or who were alive at the end of the follow-up period. Murphy et al. (152) also found that concurrent depression was present in most butnot all of their sample of alcoholics who died by suicide, suggesting that depression was neithera necessary nor a sufficient precondition for suicide. In a later study, Murphy et al. (149) foundthat major depressive episodes were significantly more frequent among alcoholics who died bysuicide than among alcoholic control subjects and also found that 58% of the alcoholics whodied by suicide had comorbid major depression. Shaffer et al. (159) compared 120 individuals under age 20 who died by suicide to 147 age- , sex-, and ethnicity-matched community control subjects and found that 59% of the subjectswho died by suicide and 23% of the control subjects met the DSM-III criteria for a psychiatric Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

When information from multiple informants was obtained, 91% of the subjects who died by suicide met the criteria fora DSM-III psychiatric diagnosis. In addition, with increasing age, there was an increased prev-alence of a psychiatric diagnosis in general and of a substance and/or alcohol use disorder inparticular. Previous suicide attempts and mood disorders were risk factors for suicide in bothmale and female subjects, whereas substance and/or alcohol abuse occurred exclusively in malesand was present in 62% of 18- to 19-year-old subjects who died by suicide. Even in individuals whose alcohol use disorder has remitted, suicide risk may still be increased but is likely to be influenced by comorbid disorders. Conner et al. (150) analyzed data from a com-munity sample of 141 individuals who died by suicide and found that 39% (N=55) had a historyof alcohol misuse. Compared with those who were actively using alcohol, those with remitted alco-hol use disorders were predominantly younger individuals with psychotic disorders or older indi-viduals with major depression. In addition to being associated with an increased risk of suicide, alcohol use disorder is as- sociated with a greater likelihood of suicide attempts. For example, Petronis et al. (163) ana-lyzed data from 13,673 participants in the ECA survey and found that active alcoholism wasassociated with an 18-fold increase in the relative odds of making a suicide attempt. Gomberg(162) compared 301 women admitted to 21 alcohol treatment facilities to an equal number ofage-matched nonalcoholic women from the community. Alcoholic women were far more likelyto have attempted suicide (40%, compared with 8.8% of nonalcoholic women), and suicideattempts were particularly likely among alcoholic women under age 40. Alcoholic women whohad attempted suicide were more likely to have used other drugs, and they reported significant-ly more tension, explosiveness, indecisiveness, fearfulness/anxiety, and difficulty concentratingand getting up in the morning. Among alcoholics, differences also have been noted between those who attempt suicide and those who do not. Roy et al. (165), for example, performed a case-control study to determinethe differences between alcoholic suicide attempters and alcoholic nonattempters. Of the 298alcoholic patients studied, 19% had attempted suicide. Compared with the nonattempters, theattempters were significantly more likely to be female, to be young, and to have a lower eco-nomic status. They also were more likely to have first- or second-degree relatives who abusedalcohol, to consume a greater amount of alcohol when drinking, and to have begun heavydrinking and experienced the onset of alcohol-related problems at an earlier age. In addition, comorbid diagnoses are frequently identified among alcoholics who attempt suicide. Roy et al. (165), for example, found the most common comorbid psychiatric diagnosesamong alcoholic suicide attempters to be major depression, antisocial personality disorder, sub-stance abuse, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Hesselbrock et al. (166), in asample of 321 inpatients (231 men, 90 women) in alcoholism treatment centers, found thatsuicide attempters typically had multiple psychiatric diagnoses (e.g., depression, antisocial per-sonality disorder, and substance abuse) and more severe psychiatric symptoms than non-attempters. T wo-thirds of alcoholics who attempted suicide had a lifetime diagnosis of majordepressive disorder, and most reported symptoms of depression within 2 weeks of the inter-view. Alcoholic suicide attempters tended to have a parental history of alcoholism, to have be-gun abusing alcohol at an early age, and to have abused other substances in addition to alcohol. Preuss et al. (167), using data for 3,190 alcohol-dependent individuals from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism, found that alcohol-dependent individuals with a historyof suicide attempts were more likely to be dependant on other substances and more likely to haveother psychiatric disorders. In addition, subjects with suicide attempts had a more severe courseof alcohol dependence and more first-degree relatives with suicide attempts. In a subsequentstudy that followed 1,237 alcohol-dependent subjects over 5 years, Preuss et al. (168) found thatthe 56 alcohol-dependent subjects with suicide attempts during the follow-up period were morelikely to have a diagnosis of a substance-induced psychiatric disorder or be dependent on other Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Furthermore, among 371 alcohol-dependent individuals who had made a suicide attempt and also had had an episode of depression, the 145 individuals (39.1%) with alcohol-indepen-dent mood disturbance had a greater number of prior suicide attempts and were more likely tohave an independent panic disorder but reported a less severe history of alcohol dependence andwere less likely to have been drinking during their most severe attempt (169). These findings sug-gest that in taking a clinical history in suicide attempters it is useful to identify comorbid depres-sion but also to determine whether depressive episodes are alcohol induced or not. That the presence of prior attempts is predictive of future attempts also highlights a need for taking a thorough history of past suicidal behaviors. Preuss et al. (168) followed 1,237 al-cohol-dependent subjects over 5 years and found that the 56 alcohol-dependent subjects withsuicide attempts during the follow-up period were more likely to have made prior attemptsthan subjects with no suicide attempts. Persons with comorbid major depression and alcoholuse have higher rates of suicidal symptoms than those with either alone. Cornelius et al. (170)compared 107 patients with both major depression and alcohol dependence to 497 nonde-pressed alcoholics and 5,625 nonalcoholic patients with major depression assessed at the samepsychiatric facility using a semistructured initial evaluation form. Depressed alcoholics had asignificantly greater degree of suicidality, as reflected by a global measure that included wishesfor death, suicidal ideation, and suicidal behaviors. They also differed significantly from thenonalcoholic depressed patients in having lower self-esteem and greater impulsivity and func-tional impairment. In a subsequent study, Cornelius et al. (171) found that among psychiatrically hospitalized alcoholics with major depression, almost 40% had made a suicide attempt in the week beforeadmission, with 70% having made a suicide attempt at some point in their lifetime. There wasa significant association between recent suicidal behavior and recent heavy drinking, with mostsubjects also reporting drinking more heavily than usual on the day of their suicide attempt. Inaddition, these suicide attempts were usually impulsive. Suicidal ideation, however, was not in-creased by more recent heavy alcohol use, suggesting that alcohol increases suicidal attempts byincreasing the likelihood of acting on suicidal ideation. In summary, alcohol use disorders are associated with increased risks of suicide and suicide attempts. Conversely, rates of alcohol use disorders are elevated among those who die by suicideas well as among suicide attempters. The common occurrence of comorbid psychiatric symp-toms and diagnoses suggests a need for thorough assessment and treatment of such complicat-ing factors in users of alcohol. Also, the frequent presence of psychosocial stressors includingunemployment and interpersonal losses should also be taken into consideration in the assess-ment and treatment planning process. g) Other substance use disorders As with disorders of alcohol use, other substance use disorders may be associated with an in-creased risk of suicide. Harris and Barraclough (172) noted that the SMRs for suicide variedwidely across studies and that calculations were often confounded by the subjects' simultaneoususe of multiple substances and by the difficulties in distinguishing accidental overdoses from sui-cide. Nonetheless, their meta-analysis of published literature found that substance use disorderswere associated with a substantial increase in suicide risk. The SMRs for suicide were 14.0 forthose with opioid abuse or dependence; 20.3 for those with sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolyticabuse or dependence; and 19.2 for individuals with mixed substance abuse or dependence. Among individuals with substance use disorders, suicide may be more likely in the presence of comorbid diagnoses such as mood disorders. For example, in a study comparing 67 adoles-cents who died by suicide to 67 demographically matched community control subjects, Brentet al. (145) found that substance abuse conferred more significant risk when it was comorbidwith affective illness than when it was present alone (odds ratio of 17.0 and 3.3, respectively).Lesage et al. (174) compared 75 male subjects ages 18-35 years who died by suicide to a group Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

They also found that comorbid major depression or borderline personality disor-der was common among those with substance dependence who died by suicide. In psychological autopsy studies, diagnoses of substance use disorders are particularly com- mon among individuals under age 30 who die by suicide. For example, Fowler et al. (173) stud-ied a subset of 128 individuals from the San Diego Suicide Study (67) who were under 30 yearsold and found that 53% had a diagnosis of substance abuse. Of this group, about one-half hadan additional psychiatric diagnosis such as atypical depression, atypical psychosis, or adjust-ment disorder with depression. Despite the young age of the study sample, substance abuse wastypically a chronic condition that had been present for an average of 9 years. Abuse of multiplesubstances was the norm, with marijuana, alcohol, and cocaine being the most frequentlyabused substances. Other data from the San Diego Suicide Study sample as a whole (110)showed that most substance users abused alcohol as well as other substances, with relativelysmall numbers of \"pure\" alcoholics or \"pure\" substance users. They also noted that interperson-al conflicts or loss occurred more frequently near the time of death for substance abusers withand without depression than for persons with mood disorders alone. Although the majority of persons with substance use disorders who die by suicide are male, it is important to recognize that men and women with substance use disorders may differ intheir characteristics and their risk for suicide. Pirkola et al. (175) used data from a nationwidepsychological autopsy study in Finland to study the characteristics of a sample of 172 men and57 women who died by suicide and had a DSM-III-R diagnosis of psychoactive substance depen-dence. They found that women were more likely than men to have abused or been dependent onprescribed medication. In addition, women were more likely than men to have a substance usedisorder preceded by a comorbid axis I disorder (45% and 18%, respectively). Borderline per-sonality disorder, previous suicide attempts, and suicidal communications were more commonin women age 40 years or younger. In addition, alcohol-dependent women died at a youngerage than women with nonalcohol substance dependence and also died at a younger age thanmen with either alcohol dependence or nonalcohol substance dependence. Available evidence suggests that suicide attempts are common in substance users and that substance use disorders are associated with an increased risk of suicide attempts. Borges et al.(176) used data from the U.S. National Comorbidity Survey, a nationally representative sampleof 8,098 persons age 15-54 years that was carried out in 1990-1992, to examine whether ret-rospectively reported substance use, abuse, and dependence are predictors of the onset of suicidalbehavior. After controlling for the effects of sociodemographic factors and comorbid psychiatricdisorders, the investigators found that subsequent suicide attempts were predicted by use of al-cohol, heroin, or inhalants. Current substance use, rather than a history of use, increased thelikelihood of suicidal behavior, with the number of substances used being more important thanthe types of substances used. In addition, among those with suicidal ideation, current substanceuse, abuse, and dependence were significant risk factors for unplanned suicide attempts. Rossow and Lauritzen (178) assessed the self-reported prevalences of nonfatal overdoses and suicide attempts in 2,051 individuals who were being treated for substance abuse. Almost one-half (45.5%) reported having had one or more life-threatening overdoses, and nearly one-third(32.7%) reported one or more suicide attempts. Suicide attempts were more often reportedamong those who had overdosed, and the number of life-threatening overdoses and number ofsuicide attempts were positively and moderately associated. Individuals who had exhibitedboth life-threatening behaviors also showed higher rates of HIV risk-taking behaviors, poor so-cial functioning, and use of multiple substances. Suicide attempters also had more symptomsof depression and anxiety as measured by the Global Assessment Scale. Thus, there is substan-tial covariation between suicide attempts and drug overdoses in individuals with substance usedisorders that is also associated with other risk-taking behaviors and poor social integration.

Beautrais et al. (177) compared 302 individuals who had made medically serious suicide attempts to 1,028 control subjects who were randomlyselected from local electoral rolls. Overall, those who had made a serious suicide attempt hadhigh rates of substance use disorders (odds ratio=2.6). Furthermore, of those with a serious sui-cide attempt, 16.2% met the DSM-III-R criteria for cannabis abuse/dependence at the time ofthe attempt, compared with 1.9% of the control subjects (181). Mann et al. (31), in a study of347 consecutive admissions to a university psychiatric hospital, found that the 184 patientswho had made a prior suicide attempt had a greater likelihood of past substance use disorderor alcoholism. Johnsson and Fridell (179) assessed 125 substance abusers 5 years after hospital-ization for detoxification and short-term rehabilitation. Although seven patients were dead atthe time of follow-up, none of the deaths were from suicide. Of 92 interviewed subjects, nearlyone-half the group (45%) reported having attempted suicide at some point in their lives, withabout 50% of that group having attempted suicide with prescribed psychotropic drugs such asantidepressants or sedatives. Only a few of the suicide attempts were made by using the indi-vidual's primary substance of abuse. The most common reasons given for suicide attempts werethe loss of a person whom they loved and feelings of loneliness. Compared to those who hadnever made a suicide attempt, the suicide attempters were more likely to have had childhoodpsychiatric hospitalizations or experienced loss of significant others in childhood. They alsowere more likely to experience depressive moods or other psychiatric comorbidity. The combination of cocaine use plus alcohol use also appears to increase the risk of suicide attempts. Cornelius et al. (711) found that of 41 consecutively admitted depressed alcoholic in-patients, 16 had made a suicide attempt and 10 had used cocaine during the week before theirhospitalization. The proportion of patients making a suicide attempt in the week before admis-sion was greater in those who had used cocaine than in those who had not (70% and 32%, re-spectively). Suicidal ideation was also more prevalent in the depressed alcoholics who also usedcocaine. Roy (180) studied the characteristics of cocaine-dependent patients in a substanceabuse treatment center and compared the 130 individuals who had never attempted suicide withthe 84 individuals who had made prior suicide attempts (a mean of 2.1 prior attempts). Com-pared with nonattempters, attempters were more likely to be female and to have a lifetime his-tory of alcohol dependence (58.3%, compared with 34.6% for nonattempters) and a familyhistory of suicidal behavior (25%, compared with 5.4% for nonattempters). Attempters also hadsignificantly higher childhood trauma scores for emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse,emotional neglect, and physical neglect than the nonattempters; however, these scores were notcorrected for the differences in the gender ratios in the two groups. Thus, suicide attempts arecommon among individuals seeking treatment for cocaine dependence, and factors that seem toaugment risk are similar to those for other groups of suicide attempters. In summary, studies indicate that substance use is a significant risk factor for suicide at- tempts and suicide. This is particularly true in younger individuals, leading some researchersto hypothesize that increasing suicide rates among youths may be related to increasing rates ofsubstance use. Individuals with chronic substance use disorders, those who have experiencedlife-threatening nonsuicidal overdoses, and those who abuse multiple substances, including al-cohol, may be at even greater risk. Moreover, substance use disorders may complicate mooddisorders (182), increasing susceptibility to treatment-resistant illness and psychological im-pairment, and on that basis may contribute to an elevated risk for suicide and for suicide at-tempts. As a result, it is important to evaluate individuals with suicidality in the context ofsubstance use for the presence of comorbid mood disorders as well as other comorbid psychi-atric diagnoses. The evaluation should also be aimed toward identifying patterns of recent sub-stance use and psychosocial factors such as recent interpersonal loss or history of childhoodtrauma that may also affect the likelihood of suicidal behaviors among substance users.

In addition,among individuals with personality disorders, the rate of suicide may be equivalent to rates inindividuals with other major psychiatric syndromes. For example, in a meta-analysis of 14 case-control samples and nine longitudinal samples of patients with personality disorders, Linehanet al. (184) found rates of suicide that were between 4% and 8%. For patients with borderlinepersonality disorder, studies have shown suicide rates ranging from 3% to 9% (183). Harrisand Barraclough (64) also found suicide risk to be increased, calculating an SMR for suicide of7.08 among individuals with personality disorder. However, the majority of patients includedin their analysis were male and from a Veterans Administration study, raising questions aboutthe representativeness of the population. Baxter and Appleby (188), in a large case registrystudy of long-term suicide risk in the United Kingdom, found even higher risks for suicideamong individuals with personality disorder diagnoses, with a 12.8-fold elevation of risk inmen and a 20.9-fold elevation of risk in women with personality disorders. In a longitudinal follow-up study of individuals with personality disorders, Stone et al. (185) found that 18 of the 196 patients who were able to be located had died by suicide by16.5 years. Compared to a suicide rate of 8.5% for the borderline personality group as a whole,those with alcohol problems had a twofold increase in the rate (19%), with a 38% rate of sui-cide among women who had a combination of alcoholism, major affective disorder, and bor-derline personality disorder. Other factors that appeared to contribute to suicide in individualswith borderline personality disorder were continuing alcohol abuse, impulsivity, and a historyof parental brutality, specifically sexual molestation. Psychological autopsy studies also show significant rates of personality disorder diagnoses among individuals who die by suicide. Duberstein and Conwell (186) reviewed case-based andcohort studies on suicide in individuals with personality disorders and found that approximate-ly 30%-40% of suicides occur in individuals with personality disorders, with increased riskconferred by the presence of borderline, antisocial, and possibly avoidant and schizoid person-ality disorder diagnoses. In a random sample of all persons who died by suicide in Finland within a 1-year period, Isometsa et al. (187) found that 29% of the subjects (N=67) had an axis II disorder. All indi-viduals with a personality disorder also had at least one axis I diagnosis, which in 95% includeda depressive syndrome, a substance use disorder, or both. Individuals with cluster B personalitydisorders were more likely to have substance use disorders and to have had a previous suicideattempt and were less likely to have had a health care contact during their final 3 months of life.In the same group of subjects, Heikkinen et al. (190) examined data on recent life events for 56subjects with personality disorder who died by suicide and matched those subjects to controlsubjects who did not have a personality disorder diagnosis. Those with a personality disorderwere more likely to have experienced one or more stressful life events in the last 3 months of lifeas well as in the week preceding the suicide. Specifically, of those with a personality disorder,70% had a significant event in the week before suicide, with job problems, family discord, un-employment, and financial difficulty reported most commonly. Thus, these findings suggestthat individuals with personality disorders who die from suicide have high rates of comorbiddepression and substance use as well as high rates of significant life stressors that precede suicide. The increased risk of suicide with personality disorders seems to be a particular factor that contributes to risk in young adults. Lesage et al. (174) compared 75 young men who died bysuicide to a demographically matched group of men in the community and found that the 6-month prevalence of borderline personality disorder was substantially increased among thosewho died by suicide (28.0% versus 4.0%). In a study of adolescents and young adults who hadbeen admitted to a regional poisoning treatment center because of deliberate self-poisoning orself-injury, Hawton et al. (384) compared 62 individuals who died by suicide or possible sui- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Suicide attempts may also be more likely to occur in individuals with personality disorders than in those with other diagnoses. In a review of the topic, Linehan et al. (184) noted thatsuicide attempts are estimated to occur in 40%-90% of individuals with personality disorders.Soloff et al. (193) examined data for 84 patien ts who met the DSM-III-R criteria for borderline personality disorder and found that 61 patients (72.6%) had a lifetime history of suicide at-tempts, with an average of more than three attempts per patient. Risk factors for suicide attemptsin patients with borderline personality disorder included older age, prior suicide attempts, an-tisocial personality, impulsive actions, and a depressed mood, but not comorbid mood disorderor substance use disorder. Ahrens and Haug (194), in a case-control study of 226 patients witha personality disorder who were admitted to a psychiatric hospital, found that patients with apersonality disorder (including, but not limited to, borderline personality disorder) were morelikely than other hospitalized patients to have had a suicide attempt immediately before admis-sion, with persistent clinically relevant suicidal behavior within the first 24 hours after admis-sion (39% versus 24%). Furthermore, in patients with a personality disorder, suicidality wasnot related to the presence of a specific mood disorder, since only 3% of the patients with per-sonality disorder met the criteria for a major affective syndrome. However, the rates of reportedsuicide attempts in individuals with personality disorder diagnoses varied with the treatmentsetting. Pirkis et al. (198), in a study of suicide attempts by psychiatric patients under activetreatment, observed a rate of suicide attempts in acute inpatients that was 10-fold greater thanthose for individuals in community-based and for individuals in long-stay inpatient care (22.7attempts per 1,000 episode-days, compared with 2.3 and 2.1 attempts per 1,000 episode-days,respectively). Conversely, among individuals who attempt suicide, personality disorders are commonly observed. Mann et al. (31), in a study of 347 consecutive patients who were admitted to a uni-versity psychiatric hospital, found that comorbid borderline personality disorder was morecommon among the 184 patients who had attempted suicide than among those with no priorsuicide attempts. Beautrais et al. (177) compared 302 consecutive individuals who made seri-ous suicide attempts with 1,028 randomly selected comparison subjects. Multiple logistic re-gression showed that those who made suicide attempts had a high rate of conduct disorder orantisocial personality disorder (odds ratio=3.7, 95% confidence interval=2.1-6.5). Thus, bothborderline personality disorder and antisocial personality disorder appear to occur more fre-quently among suicide attempters. In a study of consecutive patients who had attempted sui-cide, Suominen et al. (191) compared 65 patients who did not have a personality disorderdiagnosis to 46 patients who received a diagnosis of personality disorder. Of those with a diag-nosis, 74% had a cluster B personality disorder and 46% had a diagnosis of borderline person-ality disorder. Individuals with a personality disorder were more likely to have attemptedsuicide in the past (78%, compared to 57% of those without a personality disorder diagnosis)and were more likely to have had psychiatric treatment in their lifetime (85% versus 57%);however, those with and without personality disorders did not differ in their degree of intent,hopelessness, somatic severity, or impulsiveness. Personality disorders were associated with ahigh degree of comorbidity, with comorbid alcohol dependence being particularly commonand associated with greater difficulty in pursuing follow-up. A number of additional factors may act as contributors to risk for suicide attempts among individuals with personality disorders. Brodsky et al. (196) analyzed data for 214 inpatientswith a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder according to a structured clinical interviewand examined the relationship between the specific DSM-IV criteria for borderline personalitydisorder and measures of suicidal behavior. After excluding self-destructive behavior and con-trolling for the effects of lifetime diagnoses of depressive disorder and substance abuse, theyfound that impulsivity was the only characteristic of borderline personality disorder that was Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

In addition, the number of previous sui- cide attempts was associated with having a history of substance abuse. Comorbid mood disorders are also common among suicide attempters with personality dis- order diagnoses. For example, Van Gastel et al. (192), in a study of 338 depressed psychiatricinpatients, found significantly more suicide attempts and more suicidal ideation among thosewith a comorbid personality disorder diagnosis than among depressed inpatients without a per-sonality disorder. In addition, Oquendo et al. (131) found that among 156 inpatients with adiagnosis of a major depressive episode, having a history of suicide attempts was independentlyrelated to the presence of a cluster B personality disorder and to PTSD. Corbitt et al. (195) also examined the effects of comorbid borderline personality disorder in 102 individuals with mood disorders and found that the 30 patients with major depressive dis-order and comorbid borderline personality disorder were just as likely to have made a highly le-thal suicide attempt as the 72 patients with major depressive disorder alone. However, those withcomorbid borderline personality disorder were more likely to have a history of multiple serioussuicide attempts, and past suicidal behavior was better predicted by the number of personalitydisorder symptoms than by the number of depressive symptoms. Thus, they suggested that theseverity as well as the presence of comorbid cluster B personality disorder symptoms should beascertained in assessing the risk of suicide attempts in patients with major depressive disorder. Soloff et al. (197) compared the characteristics of suicide attempts in 77 inpatients with ma- jor depressive episodes to suicide attempts in 81 patients with borderline personality disorder,49 of whom had a concomitant major depressive episode. Compared to patients with border-line personality disorder alone, all of the depressed patients had more severe observer-rated de-pression and lower levels of functioning. Patients with borderline personality disorder hadhigher rates of impulsivity, regardless of whether depression was also present. However, the di-agnostic groups did not differ in their subjective intent to die, their degree of objective planningfor death, the violence of the suicide method, or the degree of physical damage in the attemptas measured by the Beck Suicide Intent Scale. In summary, individuals with personality disorders, and particularly those with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder or antisocial personality disorder, have increased risks for sui-cide and for suicide attempts. These risks appear to be further augmented by the presence ofcomorbid disorders such as major depression, PTSD, and substance use disorders. The severityof symptoms such as impulsivity may also play a role in increasing risk, suggesting that suchfactors should be identified and addressed in the assessment and treatment of individuals withpersonality disorders. 3. Specific psychiatric symptoms a) AnxietyAnxiety has been suggested to increase the risk of suicide even when a specific anxiety disorderis not present. In a review of 46 cohort or case-control studies that used standardized or struc-tured assessments of psychological dimensions to assess psychological vulnerability to suicide,Conner et al. (217) noted anxiety to be one of five constructs that is consistently associatedwith suicide. Busch et al. (218) reviewed the charts of 76 patients who died by suicide while inthe hospital or immediately after discharge and found that 79% (N=60) met the criteria forsevere or extreme anxiety and/or agitation according to Schedule for Affective Disorders andSchizophrenia ratings. In addition, Fawcett et al. (79), in a study of 954 psychiatric patientswith major affective disorders, found that panic attacks and severe psychic anxiety were factorsassociated with suicide within 1 year of index evaluation. In these studies, the anxiety levels as-sociated with suicide often took the form of anxious ruminations, panic attacks, or agitationand were in the severe range (i.e., severe anxiety most of the time).

For permission for reuse, visit APPI Permissions & Licensing Center at http://www.appi.org/CustomerService/Pages/Permissions.aspx.98 APA Practice GuidelinesWith respect to the effect of anxiety on the risk of suicide attempts, the findings are more mixed. For example, Hall et al. (212) studied the characteristics of 100 patients who made a severe suicide attempt and found that severe anxiety and panic attacks were among the factorsthat were associated with the attempt. However, Placidi et al. (220), in a study of 272 inpatientswith at least one major depressive episode, found that agitation and psychic anxiety were moresevere in those who had not reported making a past suicide attempt. Thus, although the relationship between anxiety and suicide attempts is unclear, and spe- cific measures of anxiety have not been found to be predictive of suicide (78), severe anxietydoes seem to increase suicide risk at least in some subgroups of patients. In particular, psychicanxiety, which may not be obvious to the clinician, should be specifically assessed, since suchsymptoms can respond rapidly to aggressive short-term treatment with benzodiazepines, second-generation antipsychotic medications, and possibly anticonvulsant medications (109). b) Hopelessness Hopelessness has been consistently identified as a factor associated with an increased risk of sui-cide, independent of diagnosis (217). Many studies that have assessed hopelessness have usedthe Beck Hopelessness Scale (712), which is described further in Section VI.B.1, \"Rating Scales.\"For example, Beck et al. (222) followed 207 patients who were hospitalized for suicidal ideationbut who had not made a recent suicide attempt to identify predictors of later suicide. After afollow-up period of 5-10 years, 14 individuals (6.9%) had died by suicide. Although a scoreof 10 or more on the Beck Hopelessness Scale correctly identified 91% of the patients whoeventually died by suicide, there was significant overidentification of at-risk patients, with afalse positive rate of 88%. The group who died by suicide also had a higher mean score on cli-nicians' ratings of hopelessness (223). A later longitudinal study that included 1,958 consecutive psychiatric outpatients examined whether the level of hopelessness at intake could predict eventual suicide (221). In this patientpopulation, those with a suicide death scored significantly higher on both the Beck Hopeless-ness Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory. Although a Beck Hopelessness Scale score of 10or more was associated with an 11-fold increase in the likelihood of suicide, the specificity wasagain low. Since a high level of hopelessness is common in psychiatric patients, applying thisBeck Hopelessness Scale cutoff to a larger population would identify 100 patients as being atrisk for every one or two eventual suicides (713). In a subsequent study that included an expanded sample of 6,891 psychiatric outpatients seen between 1975 and 1995 and followed for up to 20 years (with a median length of follow-up of 10 years), Brown et al. (78) used survival analysis to identify factors associated with in-creased risk for suicide. Along with higher levels of suicidal ideation and depression, hopeless-ness was identified as a risk factor for suicide, with patients who scored above 8 on the BeckHopelessness Scale being at four times greater risk for suicide in a given year than those withlower scores. The effect of hopelessness on suicide risk may vary by diagnosis, however. Fawcett et al. (79), in a longitudinal follow-up study of 954 patients with major affective disorder, found that severehopelessness was one of several factors associated with an increased risk of suicide more than1 year after the index assessment. However, among subjects who met the criteria for alcohol orsubstance abuse at any time, those who were not pervasively hopeless had the highest suicide riskat 5-year follow-up (226). This pattern is consistent with the findings of Beck et al. (227), whofollowed 161 alcohol-abusing patients for 7-12 years after they were hospitalized for a suicide at-tempt. Comparison of the 18 individuals who died by suicide to the remainder of the group failedto show a relationship between suicide and either hopelessness or depression. Hopelessness at the termination of treatment may also reflect an increased risk for suicide. Dahlsgaard et al. (236) compared 17 cognitive therapy outpatients with mood disorder whodied by suicide with a matching group of 17 outpatients who did not. Although the sample was Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

In addition to being a risk factor for suicide, hopelessness is more prominent in individuals who have reported previous suicide attempts, compared to individuals without such a history.Cohen et al. (229), for example, found greater levels of hopelessness in the 43 suicide attempt-ers among 184 individuals with a first admission for psychosis. Hall et al. (212), in a study of100 patients who had made severe suicide attempts, also noted feelings of hopelessness to beassociated with suicidal behavior. Among 84 inpatients with DSM-III-R major depression,Malone et al. (230) found that the 45 individuals who had made a suicide attempt had highersubjective ratings of hopelessness and depression severity and that these ratings were inverselycorrelated with \"reasons for living.\" In a study comparing 148 low-income African Americanwomen who had made a suicide attempt to 137 demographically similar women who present-ed for general medical care, Kaslow et al. (230) found hopelessness to be associated with a near-ly eightfold increase in the risk of a suicide attempt in a univariate analysis. In a multivariatelogistic regression analysis, hopelessness was independently associated with an increased risk ofsuicidal behaviors. Van Gastel et al. (192) also found that hopelessness was associated with sui-cidal ideation among 338 depressed inpatients and that the presence of a comorbid personalitydisorder was associated with additional increases in suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Across diagnostic groups, hopelessness appears to relate to the seriousness of suicidal ide- ation and intent. Soloff et al. (197) assessed the relationship of hopelessness to suicide attemptsin inpatients with major depressive disorder (N=77) as well as in inpatients with borderline per-sonality disorder alone (N=32) or in combination with major depressive disorder (N=49).Across groups, increased hopelessness was associated with an increased number of suicide at-tempts as well as an increase in the lethal intent associated with attempts. In addition, in pa-tients with both disorders, higher levels of hopelessness were associated with objective planningof suicide attempts, which would further enhance risk. In a sample of 384 individuals who hadattempted suicide, Weissman et al. (233) found that hopelessness contributed to the severity ofsuicidal intent in those with substance use disorders (N=86) as well as in those without sub-stance use disorders (N=298). Other evidence suggests that the level of hopelessness cannot be considered independently of other factors. For example, Uncapher et al. (228) analyzed data for 60 institutionalized el-derly men and found that the relationship between hopelessness and suicidal ideation variedwith the level of depressive symptoms and was most pronounced at moderate or higher levelsof depression. Mendonca and Holden (232) assessed 97 outpatients and found the strongestpredictors of the seriousness of current suicidal inclinations (as measured by the Beck Scale ofSuicidal Ideation) to be hopelessness (as measured by the Beck Hopelessness Scale) and \"un-usual thinking\" (defined as a state of cognitive distress with confused, disorganized thinking,including \"trouble concentrating\" and \"mind going blank\"). Furthermore, cross-sectional assessments of hopelessness may not necessarily be as relevant to risk as the level of hopelessness at baseline when the individual is not depressed. Young et al.(234), in a longitudinal study of 316 individuals, found that the baseline level of hopelessnesswas a better predictor of suicide attempts than either the level of hopelessness when depressedor the relative change in hopelessness from baseline levels during depression. In summary, hopelessness is well established as a psychological dimension that is associated with an increased risk for suicide and suicide attempts and an increased level of suicidal intent.This relationship between hopelessness and suicidality holds true across diagnostic groups,with the possible exception of individuals with alcohol use disorder. These findings suggest theimportance of inquiring about current levels of hopelessness as well as inquiring about usuallevels of optimism about life and plans for the future. They also suggest the use of interventionsto reduce hopelessness as a part of treatment. Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

In addition, thosestudies that are available have included relatively small numbers of patients, making it difficultto detect differences in rates of suicide or suicide attempts between patient groups. Further-more, in psychological autopsy studies, it is impossible to determine whether command hallu-cinations were present immediately before death or may have contributed to suicide. Two small studies have noted whether command hallucinations had been present on index assessment in individuals who later died by suicide. Breier and Astrachan (102) described 20schizophrenia patients who died from suicide and found that none had previously reported hal-lucinated suicidal commands. In contrast, Zisook et al. (239) found that command hallucina-tions, which were often violent in content, had been reported by 46 of 106 outpatients withschizophrenia, including the two patients who died by suicide during the study. Other studies have tried to determine the rates at which patients follow command halluci- nations and the factors that contribute to following or resisting such commands. For example,Junginger (241) used a semistructured psychiatric interview and hospital chart review to obtaininformation on 51 psychiatric inpatients and outpatients, all of whom had experienced recentcommand hallucinations. Of these subjects, 39.2% reported that they had followed the com-mands, 47.1% reported that they did not follow the commands, and 13.7% were unable torecall their response. Patients with hallucination-related delusions and identifiable hallucinato-ry voices were more likely to follow the commands than patients who were unable to identifythe voices that they heard. In a subsequent study of 93 psychiatric inpatients who had a historyof at least one command hallucination, the most recent command hallucination reported bythe subject was rated for level of dangerousness and level of compliance with the command(242). Of the 93 subjects, 52 (56%) reported at least partial compliance with their most recentcommand hallucination, and 40 (43%) reported full compliance. Individuals who experiencedless dangerous commands or who could identify the hallucinated voice reported higher levelsof compliance, although reported compliance with more dangerous commands was not un-common. Commands experienced in the hospital were less dangerous than those experiencedelsewhere, tended to be specific to the hospital environment, and were less likely to be followed.Based on these self-reports, the authors concluded that psychiatric patients who experiencecommand hallucinations are at risk for dangerous behavior and that a patient's ability to iden-tify the hallucinated voice is a fairly reliable predictor of subsequent compliance. Also, the levelof dangerousness that results from compliance with command hallucinations may be a func-tion of the patient's environment. Erkwoh et al. (245) used a 24-item questionnaire to assess the psychopathological charac- teristics of command hallucinations in 31 patients with schizophrenia. Like Junginger, theyfound that following the commands was predicted by recognizing the voice. In addition, pa-tients were more likely to comply with commands from hallucinations that they viewed as\"real\" and that produced an emotional response during the hallucination. Kasper et al. (243) compared 27 psychotic patients with command hallucinations to 27 pa- tients with other hallucinations and 30 patients with other psychotic symptoms. Although thegroups did not differ in aggressive or violent behavior or in most nonhallucinatory symptoms,84% of the patients with command hallucinations had recently obeyed them, even during theirhospital stays. Among those with command hallucinations, almost one-half had heard and at-tempted to obey messages of self-harm during the previous month. Rogers et al. (244), in a studyof 65 forensic inpatients with psychotic disorders, also found that a significant number of indi-viduals (44%) often responded to command hallucinations with unquestioning obedience. These findings, that significant numbers of individuals comply with at least some hallu- cinated commands, are in contrast with the findings of Hellerstein et al. (240). Among 789consecutive inpatients admitted over a 2-year period, they found that 19.1% had auditory hal- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

It is not surprising that hallucinations were more commonin the 159 patients with schizophrenia, with 50.3% experiencing auditory hallucinations and18.2% experiencing command hallucinations. Among 167 patients with affective disorder,rates of auditory and command hallucinations were 13.2% and 4.2%, respectively. The pres-ence of auditory hallucinations was significantly associated with use of maximal observationand seclusion. However, patients with command hallucinations were not significantly differentfrom patients without command hallucinations on demographic and behavioral variables, includ-ing suicidal ideation or behavior and assaultiveness. This finding suggests that command hal-lucinations alone may not imply a greater risk for acute, life-threatening behavior. In addition,consistent with the findings of Goodwin et al. (714), these findings imply that many patientsare able to ignore or resist command hallucinations. The most specific assessment of the role of command hallucinations in suicidal behaviors is that of Harkavy-Friedman et al. (106). They interviewed 100 individuals with schizophrenia orschizoaffective disorder who were hospitalized on an inpatient research unit about their experi-ences with command auditory hallucinations as well as about suicide attempts. Suicide at-tempts were reported by 33% of the sample, and the relative frequency of individuals withcommand hallucinations did not statistically differ between those who had and those who hadnot reported a suicide attempt (30% and 18%, respectively). Command hallucinations werepresent in 22% of the sample as a whole, and, of these, 45% had made at least one suicide at-tempt. Among individuals with command hallucinations who had made a suicide attempt,however, 80% had at least one attempt in response to the hallucinations. Thus, these findingssuggest that for some individuals, particularly those with prior suicide attempts, suicidal behav-ior may occur in the context of auditory command hallucinations. In summary, study findings are inconsistent about whether patients with command hallu- cinations are likely to obey them. Patients who recognize the hallucinated voices or view themas real or benevolent may be more likely to follow their directives. In addition, patients withprior suicide attempts may be more likely to follow suicidal commands. In terms of suicide risk,per se, patients with command hallucinations may not be at greater risk than other severely psy-chotic patients. However, existing studies include too few subjects to draw strong conclusions.In addition, since some patients do seem to act in response to auditory command hallucina-tions, it is important to identify such hallucinations, assess them in the context of other clinicalfeatures, and address them as part of the treatment planning process. d) Impulsiveness and aggression Factors such as impulsivity, hostility, and aggression may act individually or together to increasesuicide risk. For example, many studies have provided moderately strong evidence for the roles ofimpulsivity and hostility-related affects and behavior in suicide (217, 246). In particular, impul-sivity and aggression have been shown to be associated with suicide in patients with schizophreniaas well as in those with mood disorder. For example, De Hert et al. (89) compared 63 patientswho died by suicide and 63 control subjects from a consecutive admission series of patients witha diagnosis of schizophrenia, all of whom were under age 30 on admission. In this sample, impul-sive acting-out behavior was associated with an increased likelihood of suicide (odds ratio=6.4).Among 529 patients with affective illness who were followed naturalistically for up to 14 yearsand who either attempted suicide or died by suicide, Maser et al. (247) also found that impulsivitywas a core characteristic of patients with suicidal behaviors. In fact, beyond 12 months, higherlevels of impulsivity and assertiveness were the best prospective predictors of suicide. Angst and Clayton (248) found a significant effect of premorbid aggression on the risk of suicide attempts or suicide. T o assess the effect of personality traits on suicidal behaviors, theyadministered the Freiberg Personality Inventory to 6,315 Swiss army conscripts. T welve yearslater, 185 of these individuals were identified as receiving psychiatric treatment during that Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Those who madesuicide attempts or died by suicide were found to have scored higher on aggression than controlsubjects. In contrast, subjects with suicidal ideation alone scored lower on aggression, suggest-ing a role for premorbid aggression in suicidal behaviors. Multiple other studies have demonstrated increased levels of impulsivity and aggression in individuals with a history of attempted suicide. For example, Mann et al. (31), in a study of347 consecutive patients admitted to a university psychiatric hospital, found that rates of life-time aggression and impulsivity were greater in the 184 patients who had attempted suicidethan in those without a history of suicide attempts. Hall et al. (212) found that the recent onsetof impulsive behavior was an excellent predictor of suicidal behavior in 100 patients who hadmade a severe suicide attempt. Kotler et al. (249) compared 46 patients with PTSD to 42 non-PTSD anxiety disorder patients and 50 healthy control subjects and found that impulsivity waspositively correlated with the risk of suicidal behavior in the PTSD group. Impulsivity and aggression have also been associated with suicide attempts among patients with mood disorders. Brodsky et al. (250), in a study of 136 depressed adult inpatients, foundthat individuals with at least one prior suicide attempt had significantly higher scores on mea-sures of impulsivity and aggression than individuals without reported suicide attempts. Placidiet al. (220) analyzed data for 272 inpatients with at least one major depressive episode and foundsignificant increases in measures of aggression and impulsivity in those with a history of suicideattempts, compared to those without suicide attempts. Finally, in a study of 44 individuals witha DSM-III-R diagnosis of bipolar disorder, Oquendo et al. (252) found that suicide attempterswere more likely to have more lifetime aggression than nonattempters, although lifetime rates ofimpulsivity were not increased among those with a prior suicide attempt. Suicide attempters with borderline personality disorder similarly have been reported to ex- hibit increased levels of aggression and impulsivity. Soloff et al. (197) compared 32 inpatientswith borderline personality disorder alone and 77 inpatients with major depressive episode aloneto 49 patients with both diagnoses and found that a greater number of suicide attempts was as-sociated with a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder or with increases in either hopeless-ness or impulsive aggression. Soloff et al. (193) studied the characteristics of 84 patients withborderline personality disorder, of whom 61 had a lifetime history of suicide attempts (72.6%),with an average of 3.39 (SD=2.87) attempts per patient. Those with a history of suicide attemptswere found to have had more impulsive actions than patients who had never attempted suicide. Many individuals with borderline personality disorder and other cluster B personality disor- ders have a history of suicide attempts, but they may also have a history of self-mutilatory behav-iors. However, it is important to recognize that these three characteristics define overlapping butnot identical groups of individuals. Stanley et al. (251) compared 30 suicide attempters with acluster B personality disorder and a history of self-mutilation to a matched group of 23 suicideattempters with a cluster B personality disorder but no history of self-mutilation. Individualswith a history of self-mutilation had higher levels of impulsivity and aggression than those with-out such a history. Herpertz et al. (253) examined characteristics of self-mutilatory behaviors andfound that an ongoing tendency for behavioral dyscontrol was present only in patients exhibitingimpulsive self-mutilatory behaviors and not in those with premeditated self-mutilatory behav-iors. Thus, although self-mutilatory behaviors and impulsivity share many associated featuresand antecedents and are common among individuals with borderline personality disorder or his-tories of physical or sexual abuse, self-mutilatory behavior cannot be regarded as synonymouswith impulsivity. In a similar fashion, the presence of other risk-taking behaviors such as recklessdriving or unsafe sexual practices is not necessarily a reflection of increased impulsivity per se.Nonetheless, the presence of impulsivity, violence, risk-taking, or self-mutilatory behaviors re-quires a careful assessment and plan of treatment to address these clinical characteristics and min-imize their effect on the risk of suicide and suicide attempts.

Other aspects of psychiatric history a) Alcohol intoxication Intoxication with alcohol and/or with other substances is often found in individuals who havedied by suicide, independent of whether they meet the diagnostic criteria for a substance usedisorder. Hayward et al. (255) reviewed coroners' records for 515 consecutive suicides in West-ern Australia and found that 35.8% of the persons who died by suicide had a nonzero bloodalcohol level, with 24.5% being moderately to significantly impaired by alcohol at the time ofdeath. Alcohol consumption before suicide was more prevalent in younger individuals, with44.8% of teenagers and 35.1% of those age 20-24 years having used alcohol, in contrast to25.9% of individuals over age 45 years. In addition, those with nonzero blood alcohol levelswere more likely to have experienced a breakup in a relationship but less likely to have a historyof psychiatric illness or treatment. As part of the National Suicide Prevention Project in Finland (1987-1988), Ohberg et al. (121) conducted toxicological screening in 1,348 consecutive suicides in a 1-year period andfound alcohol use before suicide in 35.9% of the sample. Alcohol was present in men twice asoften as in women, whereas prescribed medications, which were found on toxicological screen-ing in 41.6% of suicides overall, were more commonly noted in women. Brent et al. (151), in a study of suicides in 10- to 19-year-old residents of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, from 1960 to 1983, found that the proportion of persons who died by suicide withdetectable blood alcohol levels rose from 12.9% in 1968-1972 to 46.0% in 1978-1983. In addi-tion, individuals who used a firearm for suicide were 4.9 times more likely to have been drinkingthan individuals who used other suicide methods. That intoxication increases the likelihood of suicide is also suggested by the role of employ- ment in modulating suicide risk among alcohol users. Specifically, Pirkola et al. (260) foundthat alcohol misusers who were employed were more likely to have died by suicide on a week-end than those who were unemployed, suggesting that alcohol use per se contributes to risk,perhaps by increasing impulsivity. Alcohol intoxication is also a common concomitant of suicide attempts. Borges et al. (715) assessed measures of alcohol intoxication in 40 emergency department patients who had at-tempted suicide and compared them to 372 patients who presented to the emergency departmentbecause of animal bites or workplace or recreational accidents. Patients with suicide attempts weresignificantly more likely to be under the influence of alcohol, as measured by breath alcohol test-ing or by self-report of alcohol consumption in the preceding 6 hours. In a study of 325 indi-viduals with deliberate self-poisoning who presented to a Brisbane hospital over a 12-monthperiod, McGrath (453) found that almost one-third had consumed alcohol before their suicideattempt. Varadaraj and Mendonca (454) found similar rates of intoxication in a study of 158emergency department patients who had attempted suicide by overdose, with 41% consumingalcohol prior to the attempt and 29% having serum alcohol levels above 80 mg/dl. Individuals who have made a suicide attempt while intoxicated are also at increased risk of later suicide. A study by Suokas and Lonnqvist (258) included data for 1,018 individuals whomade a total of 1,207 suicide attempts and were evaluated in the emergency department of aHelsinki, Finland, hospital in a single year. Of these patients, 62% had recently consumed al-cohol. Suicide attempts that occurred while intoxicated were more likely to be impulsive. After5.5 years of follow-up, suicide had occurred in 3.3% of those who had used alcohol with theirindex suicide attempt. The majority of deaths occurred within the initial year of follow-up,yielding a 51-fold increase in risk of suicide, compared to the general population in the initialyear, and a 17-fold increase in risk for the follow-up period as a whole. These findings suggesta need for careful follow-up of intoxicated individuals who present with a suicide attempt. Inaddition, they suggest a need to determine whether prior suicide attempts occurred in the con-text of intoxication. Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

For example,Isometsa and Lonnqvist (266) found that 56% of the 1,397 individuals in the Finnish psycho-logical autopsy study had died with their first suicide attempt and that this pattern was partic-ularly evident in males (62%, compared with 38% of females). In addition, however,individuals with nonfatal suicide attempts have an increased likelihood of later suicide. Froma public health standpoint, this finding is particularly important, given the high occurrence ofattempted suicide, which in recent decades has had annual rates ranging from 2.6 to 1,100 per100,000, with lifetime prevalence rates ranging from 720 to 5,930 per 100,000 (2, 518). Multiple studies have indicated that suicide attempts increase the risk of subsequent suicide. In fact, depending on the length of the follow-up period, from 6% to 10% of those who at-tempt suicide will ultimately die by suicide. For example, in follow-up studies of patients seenin psychiatric emergency settings after a suicide attempt, 4%-12% die by suicide within 5 years(268, 269, 275). In 14-year follow-up of patients, Suokas etal. (271) found a 6.7% rate of suicide overall, with the rate in men approximately twice that inwomen. Among 1,573 individuals who had been hospitalized after attempted suicide and fol-lowed up 4-11 years later, Nordstrom et al. (275) found an overall mortality of 11%, with asuicide risk of 6%. Tejedor et al. (272), in a 10-year follow-up of 150 patients admitted to apsychiatric department after a suicide attempt, found an even higher mortality rate from sui-cide (12%) as well as from natural causes (10%). Furthermore, in a meta-analysis of literatureon psychiatric disorders and suicide, Harris and Barraclough (64) found that attempted suicidehad a relative risk of later suicide that was greater than that of any psychiatric disorder. Com-pared to the general population, patients who attempted suicide were at 38 times greater riskof suicide, with the majority of evidence suggesting that this increase in suicide risk is relatedto the recency of the suicide attempt. This effect has also been noted by Nordstrom et al. (275),who found the greatest risk for suicide during the first year after an attempt. In addition,among the 1,397 individuals in the Finnish psychological autopsy study, Isometsa et al. (266)found that a nonfatal suicide attempt had occurred in 19% of the males and 39% of the femalesin the year preceding their suicide. In contrast, Fawcett et al. (79) found that among patientswith a major affective disorder, a history of previous suicide attempts was associated with sui-cide that occurred more than 1 year after index hospital admission. Other factors may also modulate suicide risk following a suicide attempt. Harris and Barr- aclough (64) found that risk for suicide after an attempt varied with measures of social cohesionand was increased by the presence of long-standing physical illness or a history of multiple pre-vious attempts or prior psychiatric treatment. Risk of suicide following a suicide attempt mayalso vary with gender, since Nordstrom et al. (275) found a twofold increase in suicide risk inmales, compared with females, with the risk for younger male attempters being four times thatfor younger females. Other investigators have examined factors associated with subsequent suicide attempts fol- lowing an index suicide attempt. Hjelmeland (164), for example, studied 1,220 patients whohad attempted suicide and compared those who had a repeated attempt within 12 months tothose who did not. Although there were no gender differences between repeaters and non-repeaters, repeaters were more likely to be unmarried, to be unemployed, to abuse alcohol, andto report their own psychiatric problems as their main concern. Repeaters were also more likelyto have had a history of sexual abuse, a criminal record, a recent address change, or a relativeor friend who had attempted suicide. Others have confirmed an increased risk of repeated sui-cide attempts in individuals with multiple prior attempts (272, 278). Aborted suicide attemptsare also common among those who attempt suicide (276). Given this increased likelihood of suicide or additional suicide attempts, particularly in the first few years after a suicide attempt, assessment and treatment of suicide attempters should bean integral part of risk reduction. All too often, however, suicide attempters do not receive a Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Thus, in addition to a thorough psychi- atric assessment, determining a patient's history of suicide attempts (including aborted suicideattempts) yields information that is important in estimating the level of suicide risk of an in-dividual patient. Additional factors such as psychiatric diagnosis, comorbid alcohol abuse,physical illness, or psychosocial stressors may augment risk following a suicide attempt. Fur-thermore, the significant mortality observed in suicide attempters underscores the need forcareful aftercare planning for suicide attempters. c) History of childhood physical and/or sexual abuse Multiple studies have examined the association between childhood abuse and suicidal behav-iors, although few have examined the effect of childhood abuse on risk for suicide per se. Plun-kett et al. (36), however, assessed 183 young people who had experienced childhood sexualabuse and individuals from a nonabused comparison group 9 years after study intake. Thosewho had experienced childhood sexual abuse had a suicide rate that was 10.7-13.0 times thenational rate, whereas no suicides occurred in the control group. The bulk of studies have assessed the effects of childhood abuse on suicidal ideation and sui- cide attempts, both of which are common among individuals reporting childhood abuse. Forexample, in the study by Plunkett et al. (36), 43% of the 183 young people who had experiencedchildhood sexual abuse had thought of suicide, whereas 32% had made a suicide attempt. Other studies have examined the effect of childhood abuse on the risk of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Fergusson et al. (286), in an 18-year longitudinal study of a birth cohortof 1,265 New Zealand children, found that those reporting childhood sexual abuse had higherrates of suicidal behaviors than those not reporting such abuse. In addition, the extent of child-hood sexual abuse was consistently correlated with risk, with the highest risk of suicidal behav-iors in those whose childhood sexual abuse involved intercourse. Even after controlling for theeffects of confounding variables, the investigators found that those who reported harsh or abu-sive childhood experiences were also at increased risk for suicide attempts (282). Brown et al. (294) followed a cohort of 776 randomly selected children over a 17-year period to adulthood and found that adolescents and young adults with a history of childhood maltreat-ment were three times more likely to become suicidal than individuals without such a history.Again, the effects of childhood sexual abuse on suicidal behavior were greater than the effects ofother forms of abuse, with the risk of repeated suicide attempts being eight times greater foryouths with a history of sexual abuse. Several Australian investigators have used data from twin pairs to assess the effect of child- hood abuse on the risk of suicidal ideation or suicide attempts. In structured telephone inter-views with 5,995 Australian twins, Dinwiddie et al. (292) found that the 5.9% of women and2.5% of men who reported a history of childhood sexual abuse were more likely to report sui-cidal ideation or prior suicide attempts. Nelson et al. (35), using data from 1,991 Australiantwin pairs, found even greater rates of childhood sexual abuse (16.7% of women and 5.4% ofmen) but confirmed that a history of childhood sexual abuse significantly increased risk for sui-cide attempts, with the greatest risk associated with sexual abuse that involved intercourse.Even in twin pairs who were discordant for childhood sexual abuse, both twins had increasedrates for many adverse outcomes, probably as a result of shared family background risk factors.Nonetheless, the twin who reported experiencing childhood sexual abuse had an even greaterrisk of a subsequent suicide attempt than the co-twin, which suggests an independent contri-bution of childhood sexual abuse to the risk for suicidal behaviors. In contrast to the authors of the longitudinal studies described earlier, Romans et al. (291) selected a random community sample of New Zealand women and compared those who re-ported having been sexually abused as children to those who did not report such abuse. Thepresence of self-harming behaviors was associated with sexual abuse in childhood and was mostmarked in individuals who were subjected to more intrusive and frequent abuse.

For permission for reuse, visit APPI Permissions & Licensing Center at http://www.appi.org/CustomerService/Pages/Permissions.aspx.106 APA Practice GuidelinesCross-sectional assessments of nonpsychiatric populations in the United States have also found associations between suicide attempts and childhood abuse, particularly childhood sex- ual abuse. Among the 2,918 respondents in the Duke University ECA study, Davidson et al.(293) found that subjects reporting a history of sexual assault also reported higher lifetime ratesof suicide attempts than individuals without such a history. In women, a history of sexual trau-ma before age 16 was a particularly strong correlate of suicide attempts. Among U.S. womenphysicians (N=4,501), data from a nationally distributed questionnaire showed that the 4.7%of respondents with a history of childhood sexual abuse were more likely to report a history ofsuicide attempts (287). Kaslow et al. (230) compared 148 low-income African American wom-en who presented to the hospital following a suicide attempt to a similar group of 137 womenwho presented for general medical care and found a threefold greater risk of childhood mal-treatment among suicide attempters. Molnar et al. (33) analyzed data for 5,877 individualsfrom the National Comorbidity Survey and found that individuals with a history of sexualabuse were more likely to attempt suicide than those without such a history. This risk differedby sex, with a two- to fourfold increase in risk among women and a four- to 11-fold increasein risk among men. Dube et al. (281), in a sample of 17,337 adults (mean age=56 years), alsofound that the risk of suicide attempts was increased in those who had experienced childhoodabuse. They observed this risk to be augmented by multiple other factors, including parentalseparation or divorce, witnessing of domestic violence, and living with substance abusing, men-tally ill, or criminal household members. In addition to the augmentation of suicide risk associated with sexual abuse, risk appears to be further increased among individuals who have experienced multiple forms of abuse. Ander-son et al. (289) examined the association between childhood abuse and adult suicidal behaviorin a sample of low-income African American women. Compared to the women who did notreport experiencing any emotional, physical, or sexual childhood abuse, those who experiencedone, two, or three forms of abuse were, respectively, 1.83, 2.29, or 7.75 times more likely toattempt suicide. In addition, women who reported all three types of abuse were more likely toattempt suicide than women who reported one or two types of abuse. Childhood abuse is particularly frequent among individuals with psychiatric diagnoses and appears to increase the likelihood of suicide attempts even after the effects of psychiatric comor-bidity are controlled. For example, in a study of 251 psychiatric outpatients (68 men and 183women), Kaplan et al. (284) found that 51% of the subjects had reported experiencing child-hood abuse, with 15% reporting sexual abuse alone, 17% reporting physical abuse alone, and18% reporting a combination of physical and sexual abuse during childhood. Abusive experi-ences in adulthood were reported by 38% of the subjects, with physical abuse alone in 21%, sex-ual abuse alone in 8%, and both physical and sexual abuse in 9%. Compared to control subjectswithout a history of abuse, subjects with a history of abuse were more likely to have been suicidalat a younger age and to have made multiple suicide attempts. Among patients with a history ofabuse, suicide attempters could be distinguished from nonattempters on the basis of higher lev-els of dissociation, depression, and somatization. In analyzing data from the National Comor-bidity Survey, Molnar et al. (33) also found that those with a comorbid psychiatric disorder wereyounger at the time of their first suicide attempt than those without concomitant psychiatric ill-ness. In addition, a history of childhood sexual abuse remained a risk factor for attempting sui-cide even after adjustment for the effect of a lifetime psychiatric diagnosis. The presence of childhood physical and/or sexual abuse has also been associated with an in- creased likelihood of suicidality in studies of patients with specific psychiatric diagnoses. Forexample, Brodsky et al. (196), in a study of 214 inpatients with a diagnosis of borderline per-sonality disorder, found that the number of lifetime suicide attempts was correlated with a his-tory of childhood abuse. Van der Kolk et al. (285) assessed 74 individuals with personalitydisorders or bipolar II disorder and found that histories of childhood sexual and physical abusewere highly significant predictors of self-cutting and suicide attempts.

For individuals with major depressive disorder, evidence in the literature is more complex. Brodsky et al. (250) found that adults with major depressive disorder who had a history ofchildhood physical or sexual abuse were more likely to have made a suicide attempt than thosewho did not report an abuse history, even after adjustment for the effects of impulsivity, aggres-sion history, and presence of borderline personality disorder. Zlotnick et al. (716), in a studyof 235 outpatients with major depression, found substantial rates of diagnostic comorbidity,primarily with borderline personality disorder and PTSD. After controlling for the effects ofthe presence of these diagnoses, however, they did not find an independent contribution ofchildhood sexual abuse to the likelihood of suicide attempts. Childhood abuse is also prevalent among individuals with substance use disorders and, again, is associated with increased rates of suicide attempts. In a group of 481 male and 321 femalealcoholic inpatients (age 19-57 years), Windle et al. (288) found a high prevalence of reportedchildhood abuse. For women, the rates of physical abuse only, sexual abuse only, and dual abusewere 10%, 26%, and 23%, respectively, whereas for men the corresponding rates were 19%,7%, and 5%, respectively. For both sexes, a reported history of childhood abuse was associatedwith a higher rate of suicide attempts, with an even larger effect associated with a history of bothphysical and sexual abuse. Roy (290) examined abuse histories in a consecutive series of 100male cocaine-dependent patients and found that the 34 patients who had attempted suicide re-ported significantly higher scores for childhood emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse,and emotional and physical neglect than the 66 patients who had never made a suicide attempt. In addition to increasing risk for suicide attempts within community samples and across sub- groups of psychiatric patients, the presence of a childhood abuse history in individuals who havemade a suicide attempt should alert the psychiatrist to a further increase in the risk of repeatedattempts (284). Elliott et al. (717) compared 65 patients hospitalized for a medically serious sui-cide attempt to 32 patients seen in the emergency room for a suicide attempt but who were notmedically hospitalized. Those with attempts that were not medically serious had higher rates ofprevious sexual and physical abuse as well as higher rates of traumatic life events and borderlinepersonality disorder. Hjelmeland (164) also found that patients in a Norwegian county who re-quired medical treatment after an initial suicide attempt were more likely to have a repeated sui-cide attempt during 6 years of follow-up if they had a history of being sexually abused. In summary, there is consistent evidence, in multiple samples studied with multiple study designs, that a history of abuse augments the risk for later suicidal ideation and suicide at-tempts. The effect of abuse on suicide per se has been less well studied, but the few findingsthat are available suggest that abuse increases suicide risk. Childhood abuse and particularlychildhood sexual abuse appear to be associated with greater increases in risk than childhoodphysical abuse or abuse during adulthood. Individuals who have experienced multiple forms ofabuse are at particularly increased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviors. Although a history ofabuse is common in individuals with suicide attempts and in individuals with a psychiatric di-agnosis, the contribution of childhood abuse to the risk of suicidal behaviors seems to be inde-pendent of the effects of psychiatric diagnoses. Consequently, in patients who have attemptedsuicide as well as in those presenting for any type of psychiatric treatment, it is important toinquire about childhood and adult experiences of physical, sexual, or emotional abuse and toincorporate this information into the risk assessment and treatment planning process. d) History of domestic partner violence Although studies have not directly assessed the effects of domestic partner violence on risk for sui-cide, domestic partner violence has been associated with increased rates of suicide attempts and sui-cidal ideation. For example, after adjustment for the effects of sociodemographic characteristicsand alcohol use in a nationally representative sample of 5,238 U.S. adults, Simon et al. (298) found Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

For permission for reuse, visit APPI Permissions & Licensing Center at http://www.appi.org/CustomerService/Pages/Permissions.aspx.108 APA Practice Guidelinesthat being physically assaulted was associated with suicidal ideation or behavior (odds ratio=2.7) and that this pattern was particularly true for individuals who sustained injury (odds ratio=3.4) orwere assaulted by a relative or intimate partner (odds ratio=7.7). McCauley et al. (300) surveyed1,952 respondents in a primary medical care practice and found that 5.5% had experienced do-mestic violence in the year before presentation. Compared with women who had not recently expe-rienced domestic violence, those with recent experiences of such violence were four times more likelyto have attempted suicide. Among women physicians (N=4,501 respondents) who respondedto the Women Physicians' Health Study questionnaire, suicide attempts were significantly moreprevalent among the 3.7% of respondents with a history of domestic partner violence (34). Domestic partner violence is particularly a risk factor for suicide attempts among women in low-income urban environments. In a group of 648 women, most of whom were young andunemployed and had an annual household income of less than $10,000, Abbott et al. (299)found that among the 418 women with a current male partner, 11.7% reported being recentlyassaulted, threatened, or intimidated by their partner. For the entire sample, the cumulativelifetime prevalence of exposure to domestic violence was 54.2%. Women with any exposure todomestic partner violence had an increased rate of suicide attempts, compared to women with-out such exposure (26% and 8%, respectively). Kaslow et al. (230) compared 148 low-incomeAfrican American women who presented to the hospital after a suicide attempt to a similargroup of 137 women who presented for general medical care. Women who presented with asuicide attempt had a greater likelihood of having experienced either physical or nonphysicalpartner abuse (odds ratios=2.5 and 2.8, respectively). Thompson et al. (301), in a sample oflow-income, inner-city women, found that suicide attempters (N=119) were approximatelythree times more likely to experience significant physical partner abuse, nonphysical abuse, andPTSD than nonattempters (N=85). In addition, increased suicidality in individuals who wereexperiencing physical partner abuse appeared to depend on the presence of PTSD rather thanthe independent contribution to risk of the abuse. Increased risk for suicide attempts is also seen in battered women presenting to emergency de- partment settings or to women's shelters. Muelleman et al. (296) surveyed 4,501 women betweenage 19 and 65 years who presented to 10 hospital-based emergency departments in two cities serv-ing inner city, urban, and suburban populations. Of these, 266 (5.9%) had definite or probablebattering injuries and an additional 266 (5.9%) were currently in a physically abusive relationshipbut did not present with evidence of a battering injury. Compared to the 3,969 women (88.2%)who were not currently in a physically abusive relationship, women in physically abusive relation-ships were more likely to present to the emergency department after an attempted suicide. In across-sectional study of 203 women seeking refuge in battered women's shelters, Wingood et al.(297) found, after controlling for the effects of sociodemographic characteristics, that women ex-periencing both sexual and physical abuse were more likely to have attempted suicide than wom-en experiencing physical abuse alone. Although much more commonly experienced by women, domestic partner violence also af- fects men. Ernst et al. (302) surveyed 233 men and 283 women who presented to an inner-cityemergency department for past and current histories of domestic partner violence and foundthat such experiences were associated with increased rates of suicidal ideation in both sexes. Itis important to note that men with a history of domestic violence toward their partners mayalso be at increased risk for suicide. Conner et al. (303), for example, noted that one-half of the42 male alcoholics who died by suicide and were originally described by Murphy et al. (149)had a history of domestic violence. Domestic violence in the home may also affect the risk for suicide attempts among those who witness that violence. Dube et al. (281) examined the relationship to suicide attempts ofeight adverse childhood experiences, including witnessing domestic violence, in 17,337 adults(mean age=56 years) and found that childhood exposure to parental domestic violence in-creased the risk of later suicide attempts.

In addition, al- though evidence is more limited, individuals who become violent with their partners or whoobserve domestic partner violence may also be at increased risk for suicidal behaviors. Since apast or current history of domestic partner violence is often overlooked, even in settings suchas emergency departments where it is quite prevalent, it is important to specifically ask aboutdomestic partner violence as a part of the suicide assessment. e) Treatment history A past history of treatment of mental illness, including a past history of hospitalization, shouldbe viewed as a marker that alerts the clinician to an increase in suicide risk (64, 198). Further-more, greater treatment intensity is associated with a higher rate of eventual suicide. For exam-ple, Bostwick and Pankratz (77) used meta-analytic techniques to calculate suicide risks foroutpatients, inpatients, or suicidal inpatients and found a hierarchy in suicide risk among pa-tients with affective disorders. The estimated lifetime prevalence of suicide in those ever hospi-talized for suicidality was 8.6%, compared to a lifetime suicide rate of 4.0% for all hospitalizedpatients. For mixed inpatient/outpatient populations, the lifetime suicide prevalence was evenlower, at 2.2%, whereas for the population without affective illness, it was less than 0.5%. Asimilar phenomenon was noted by Simon and VonKorff (718) among patients treated for de-pression in a large health plan in western Washington State. Computerized discharge diag-noses, outpatient visit diagnoses, and outpatient prescription records were used to identify allenrollees who received treatment for depression during a 3-year period. During the study pe-riod, 35,546 individuals received some treatment for depression and accounted for 62,159 per-son-years of follow-up. Thirty-six individuals (4.2% of all deaths) were classified as havingdefinitely or possibly died by suicide, yielding an overall suicide mortality rate of 59 per100,000 person-years, with the rate for men more than threefold higher than the rate for wom-en. Patients who received any inpatient psychiatric treatment had a risk for suicide of 224 per100,000 person-years, with suicide rates among those who received outpatient specialty mentalhealth treatment and those treated with antidepressant medications in primary care of 64 and43 per 100,000 person-years, respectively. No patient with a diagnosis of depression who wastreated only in primary care and who did not receive antidepressant medication died by suicide. In terms of suicide attempts, Pirkis et al. (198) analyzed data for 12,229 patients in 13,632 episodes of care and found that the risk of suicide attempts was 10-fold higher in acute inpa-tient settings, compared with longer-stay inpatient or community-based settings (5.4 attemptsper 1,000 episode-days, compared with 0.6 and 0.5 attempts per 1,000 episode-days, respec-tively). Thus, the rate of suicidality is increased in individuals with prior inpatient treatment,although it is not clear whether the rate is higher because the patients have more severe illnesses(and are deemed to be at increased risk for suicide) or because hospitalization increases suiciderisk by increasing emotional or psychosocial distress. T emporally, the risk for suicide appears to be greatest after changes in treatment setting or intensity (304). Recently admitted and recently discharged inpatients show particularly in-creased risks (64, 72), and this pattern is seen across diagnostic categories (91, 95, 305-308).Rates decline with time since discharge but may remain high for as long as several years (91,306, 309). For example, Pirkis and Burgess (309) systematically reviewed the literature on sui-cide and health care contacts and found that up to 41% of those in the general population whodie by suicide may have had psychiatric inpatient care in the year before death, with up to 9%dying by suicide within 1 day of discharge. Appleby et al. (304) compared individuals who diedby suicide within 5 years of discharge from psychiatric inpatient care to surviving demograph-ically matched patients and found that those who died by suicide were more likely to have hadtheir care reduced at the final appointment in the community before death (odds ratio=3.7).

(91) assessed 5,412 patients admitted to the University of Iowa Psychiatric Hos- pital and found that 331 died over a 9-year follow-up period. Ninety-nine percent of all pre- mature deaths occurred during the initial 2 years after discharge, with the risk for prematuredeath being greatest among women and the young. Over the initial 2-year period, 29% ofdeaths were by suicide and suicide occurred at a rate that was more than 50 times the expectedrate for the group as a whole. Roy (96) compared 90 psychiatric patients who had attempted suicide (53 male patients and 37 female patients) to a group of 90 matched control subjects who had not attempted sui-cide. Of the 75 patients who had died by suicide as outpatients, 58% had seen a psychiatristwithin the previous week, 81% had been admitted in their last episode of contact, and 44% ofthose who had been inpatients attempted suicide within 1 month of discharge. Goldacre et al. (307) determined the risk of suicide within a year of psychiatric discharge in a population-based study in Oxford, U.K., and found that SMRs for suicide in the first 28 daysafter discharge from inpatient care were 213 and 134 for male and female patients, respectively.The rate of suicide in the first 28 days after discharge was 7.1 times higher for male patientsand 3.0 times higher for female patients than the rate during the remaining 48 weeks of thefirst year after discharge. More recently, Appleby et al. (306) analyzed data for 10,040 individuals in the United King- dom who died by suicide over a 2-year period and found that 2,370 (24%) had been in contactwith mental health services in the 12 months before death. Of these, 358 (16%) were psychiatricinpatients at the time of death, and one-fifth of those patients were being monitored with specialobservation procedures. An additional 519 suicides (24%) occurred within 3 months of hospitaldischarge, with the highest number occurring in the first week. Rossau and Mortensen (95) foundthat 508 suicides occurred among 9,156 patients who were admitted to psychiatric hospitals inDenmark between 1970 and 1987 and who received a diagnosis of schizophrenia for the firsttime. Suicide risk was particularly high during the first 5 days after discharge, and risk was alsoincreased in individuals with multiple admissions during the prior year. Similar findings have been reported for suicide attempts, which are also more frequent in the period following hospitalization. Oquendo et al. (267) followed 136 patients after hospitalizationfor major depressive disorder and found that 15% of the subjects made a suicide attempt within2 years, with more than 50% of attempts occurring within the first 5 months of follow-up. Given that the intensity of past treatment is associated with risk for suicide and suicide at- tempts, the treatment history is an important part of the assessment process. In addition, these ob-servations suggest specific points in the course of treatment (e.g., hospital discharge or otherchanges in treatment setting) at which risk of suicidal behaviors may be particularly increased.Awareness of these factors will allow the psychiatrist to take them into consideration in developinga plan of treatment with the patient. f) Illness course and severity In some psychiatric disorders, suicide risk is greater at certain points in the illness or episodecourse. Multiple studies have shown that suicidality tends to occur early in the course of affectivedisorder, often before diagnosis or before treatment has begun (310, 719). These observationsemphasize the importance of early identification of these disorders and early implementationof effective interventions. Appleby et al. (304) compared individuals who died by suicide within 5 years of discharge from psychiatric inpatient care to surviving demographically matched patients and found thatsuicide was more likely in those whose index hospitalization was at the beginning of their illness(odds ratio=2.0). Bradvik and Berglund (317) followed 1,206 inpatients who had received a dis-charge diagnosis of severe depression/melancholia between 1956 and 1969. At the time of theinitial follow-up in 1984, 22% had died by suicide, whereas by the second follow-up in 1998,an additional 4% had died by suicide.

Osby et al. (73) identified all patients in Sweden with a hospital diagnosis of bipolar disorder(N=15,386) or unipolar depressive disorder (N=39,182) between 1973 and 1995 and deter-mined the date and cause of death using national registries. They found that the SMR for suicidewas especially high for younger patients during the first years after initial diagnosis, although anincreasing SMR was found for female patients with major depressive disorder over the course ofthe study. Fawcett et al. (313) found that for the 954 patients with major affective disorder inthe NIMH Collaborative Program on the Psychobiology of Depression, 32% of the 25 suicidesoccurred within 6 months and 52% occurred within 1 year of entry into the study. Suicide has been noted to be more likely early in the illness course in individuals with schizophrenia. Westermeyer et al. (83), for example, compared 36 patients with schizophreniawho died by suicide to a similar group of patients who did not die by suicide and found thatindividuals with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders were especially vulnerable to sui-cide within the first 6 years of their initial hospitalization. Suicides were present throughout thecourse of schizophrenia in the National Suicide Prevention Project in Finland (100). Although patients' risks for suicide and suicide attempts later in the illness course are less than those earlier on, their risks remain greater than those in the general population (74, 100, 316,317). Angst et al. (74) followed 406 hospitalized patients with affective disorder for 22 years ormore and found that the suicide rate was most elevated at the age of onset but that, from age 30to 70 years, the suicide rate was remarkably constant despite the different courses of illness.Ahrens et al. (316) examined the illness course of 310 patients with mood disorder, 98 of whomhad made a suicide attempt, and found no significant correlation between age and suicide at-tempts, suggesting that the rate of suicide attempts was not declining as the patient aged and theillness progressed. Malone et al. (312) analyzed data for 100 inpatients during a major depressiveepisode and noted that the first 3 months after the onset of a major depressive episode and thefirst 5 years after the lifetime onset of major depressive disorder represented the highest-risk pe-riod for attempted suicide, independent of the severity or duration of depression. Risk for suicide may also vary with the severity of symptoms. For example, Brown et al. (78) prospectively followed 6,891 psychiatric outpatients and found that in the 49 (1%) who died bysuicide the severity of depression, hopelessness, and suicide ideation were significant risk factors.In contrast, in individuals with schizophrenia, low levels of negative symptoms have been asso-ciated with increased suicide risk (93). It is also important to recognize that other factors such as age modulate the effects of symp- tom severity on risk. With older adults, for example, milder symptoms may be associated withgreater risk than moderate symptoms in younger adults (66). Waern et al. (207) analyzed datafor 85 individuals over 65 years of age who had died by suicide and 153 randomly selected liv-ing comparison subjects and found that elevated suicide risk was associated with minor as wellas major depressive disorder. In terms of attempted suicide, Mann et al. (31) followed 347 consecutive patients after ad- mission to a university hospital and found that the objective severity of current depression orpsychosis did not distinguish the 184 patients who had attempted suicide from those who hadnever attempted suicide. However, those who had attempted suicide reported higher levels ofsubjective depression and suicidal ideation and fewer reasons for living. Corbitt et al. (195),using data from structured interviews of 102 psychiatric inpatients, found that past suicidal be-havior was better predicted by the number of criteria for borderline personality disorder andother cluster B personality disorders that were met than by depressive symptoms. That the risk for suicidality may be associated with symptom or illness severity suggests that it is important to determine the magnitude and not simply the presence of risk factors as partof the assessment process. In addition, when estimating risk and implementing a plan of treat-ment to address risk, variations in risk with illness course may need to be considered in the con-text of other patient-specific factors.

Physical illness Considerable evidence derived from a variety of sources supports a link between physical illness and suicide (Table 7). Methods used to establish this relationship have included record linkageand prospective cohort studies of clinical samples with specific physical illnesses, as well as ret-rospective examinations of the prevalence of specific physical illnesses in samples of individualswho took their own lives. Harris and Barraclough (25) conducted a comprehensive, systematic literature review and meta-analysis to determine the suicide risk associated with 63 specific physical disorders thathad been posited to influence this risk. They did not include reports of epilepsy, conceding thatthe evidence base was already strong for its association with suicide. Their review yielded 235reports that met the specific criteria for consideration, from which data were abstracted to en-able calculation of pooled SMRs for each condition. The authors concluded that the disordersdemonstrating significantly increased risk for suicide included HIV/AIDS, Huntington's dis-ease, malignant neoplasm, multiple sclerosis, peptic ulcer disease, hemodialysis-treatedrenal failure, spinal cord injury, and systemic lupus erythematosus. The data were insufficientto conclude whether amputation, valve replacement, intestinal diseases, cirrhosis, Parkinson'sdisease, or systemic sclerosis conferred an increased risk for suicide. Surprising findings includ-ed the association of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, blindness, stroke, diabetes mellitus, rheuma-toid arthritis, and hypertension with only average risk that was no greater than that in thegeneral population. Pregnancy and the puerperium were associated with a statistically reducedrisk for suicide. Although the authors were unable to examine the influence of mental disordersor other mediating or moderating effects, many of the disorders associated with increased riskare also associated with mental disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis with depression and peptic ul-cer disease with alcohol abuse). Therefore, when the influence of comorbid psychiatric illnessis accounted for, the independent risk associated with physical illness may be less. Quan and colleagues (337) reported results of a record linkage study conducted in Alberta, Canada, that was designed to establish whether specific illnesses distinguish persons who diedby suicide from comparison subjects who died in accidents. In univariate statistical analysescomparing 822 persons age 55 years and older who died by suicide with 944 subjects of similarage who died in motor vehicle accidents, those who died by suicide were more likely to havehad malignant neoplasm, arteriosclerotic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,peptic ulcer disease, prostate disorders, depression, and other psychiatric diagnoses. In multi-variate analyses in which the effects of demographic and health characteristics were controlled,arteriosclerotic heart disease and peptic ulcer disease did not differentiate the groups. Amongthe physical illnesses, only malignant neoplasm and prostate disorders (excluding prostate can-cer) remained significant predictors, along with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in mar-ried (but not single) men. Grabbe and colleagues (338) used data from the National Mortality Followback Survey to identify health status variables related to suicide in older persons, compared with natural deathsand deaths from injury. In comparing suicides with injury deaths, they found that malignantneoplasm, but not lung conditions, was associated with increased risk. The presence of a stroke,paradoxically, appeared to lower risk. The study reinforced the powerful influence of cancer. Other studies have also specifically looked for associations between suicide and central ner- vous system disorders that are known to increase the rates of depressive syndromes. Stenager etal. (334), for example, found that patients with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis after age 40 wereat no greater risk for suicide than control subjects, but that men and women who received thisdiagnosis before age 40 were at approximately three times and two times greater risk, respective-ly. Stenager et al. (720) also cross-referenced data for all patients discharged with a diagnosis ofa cerebrovascular accident in selected areas of Denmark between 1973 and 1990 with deathrecords and found 140 suicides among almost 38,000 patients with a history of cerebrovascularaccident and increased suicide risks for both men and women with this diagnosis in all age Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

In general, risk for suicide was higher in women than in men and in age groups under age 60 years, compared to older adults. The group at highest risk was women under age 50 witha stroke, who had a risk for suicide almost 14 times greater than that for women of similar agein the general population. These data provide additional support for an association between sui-cide and cerebrovascular disease, particularly among younger and middle-aged stroke patients. Evidence for increased suicide risk in people with epilepsy is similarly strong. Stenager and Stenager (323) examined all published reports concerning the link between suicide and neurolog-ic disorders in order to critically evaluate the strength of the evidence. They identified a variety ofcommon methodologic problems in this body of research, including sources of bias in selectionof cases, inadequate definition of control samples, imprecise definitions of disease, inadequatesample sizes, absent or imprecise definitions of suicidal behavior, and inadequate follow-up inter-vals. Nonetheless, they concluded that sufficiently rigorous studies of patients with multiple scle-rosis, patients with spinal cord injury, and selected groups of patients with epilepsy did establishincreased risk in these conditions. The most rigorous studies examining risk associated with epi-lepsy were conducted by White and colleagues in 1979 (324). They followed 2,099 patients withepilepsy who had been committed for institutional care and treatment and compared their riskfor suicide with that in an age- and sex-standardized control population. They found that indi-viduals with epilepsy were at 5.4 times higher risk for suicide than the control subjects. Rafnsson et al. (326) analyzed data for 224 individuals who first received a diagnosis of un- provoked seizures in Iceland between 1960 and 1964 and who were followed for up to 25 years.Among men, the relative risk of dying by suicide was almost six times the expected risk in thegeneral population, and the rates of death from accidents, poisoning, and violence were aboutthree times the expected rates. Nilsson et al. (325) used data from the Swedish National Cause of Death Register to deter- mine causes of death among 6,880 patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy registered in the Stock-holm County In-Patient Register. In a comparison of 26 individuals who died by suicide and 23individuals suspected of having died by suicide with 171 living control subjects, individuals withan onset of epilepsy before age 18 had a higher risk for suicide than those with comorbid psy-chiatric diagnoses or those treated with antipsychotics. However, unlike other studies, this studydid not find a specific association with particular types of epilepsy, including temporal lobe sei-zures. Suicide attempts also appear to be increased in frequency among patients with epilepsy, compared to the general population. Hawton et al. (330) analyzed data for patients admittedafter deliberate self-poisoning or self-injury over a 2-year period and found that the number ofpatients with epilepsy was five times higher than general population prevalence rates. Mendezet al. (329) compared 175 outpatients with epilepsy to a group of 70 comparably disabled out-patients and found that prior suicide attempts were reported by 30% of the patients with epi-lepsy, compared to only 7% of the control subjects. Rates of depression were similarly increasedamong the patients with epilepsy (55%, compared with 30% of the control subjects). In a sub-sequent study, Mendez et al. (331) compared 62 patients with epilepsy to 62 patients withschizophrenia and to 62 patients with both diagnoses and found that suicidal behaviors weremore common among individuals with epilepsy. The association between terminal physical illnesses and suicide is complex. Brown and col- leagues (721) found that 34 of 44 terminally ill patients receiving palliative care had never wishedfor an early death. All of the 10 patients who had wished for an early death were found to haveclinical depressive illness, but only three reported suicidal ideation. Chochinov and colleagues(342) interviewed 200 patients who had terminal cancer to determine their psychiatric status andwhether they had thoughts of death. Almost 45% had wished for an early death, but in only 8.5%were the thoughts serious and persistent. Predictors of desire for death included pain, a low levelof family support, and clinically significant depression. Diagnosable depressive illness was foundin almost 60% of those with a desire to die and in 8% of those without a desire to die. Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Waern et al. (333) com-pared consecutive records of people who had died by suicide (46 men and 39 women) withthose of living control participants selected from the tax register (84 men and 69 women) inGothenburg, Sweden. In addition to neurological disorders and malignant disease, which wereassociated with three- to fourfold increases in suicide risk, visual impairment and serious phys-ical illness of any type were also associated with increased risk, with odds ratios of 7.0 and 6.4,respectively. Although the number of women in the sample was small, the risk appeared to begreater among men, particularly in those with a high burden of physical illness. Conwell et al.(321) also found physical illness burden and functional limitations to be more common amongindividuals seen in primary care settings who die by suicide. They compared 196 patients age60 years and older from a group practice of general internal medicine (N=115) or family med-icine (N=81) to 42 individuals age 60 years and older who had visited a primary care providerand who died by suicide within 30 days of their visit. Those who died by suicide were signifi-cantly more likely than control subjects to have had a depressive illness, greater functional im-pairment, or a larger burden of physical illness. While several studies have shown that people with HIV and AIDS are at high risk for suicide, the data on the extent of that risk vary. In particular, suicide risk among people with HIV/AIDSis likely to relate to other comorbid factors such as substance abuse and other psychiatric diag-noses, stigma, social isolation, and lack of support (722), as well as the direct effects of HIV onthe brain (335, 723). Even at the time of HIV serum antibody testing, suicidal ideation is highlyprevalent, being noted by about 30% of individuals and diminishing over time after notificationof test results (724). Nonetheless, elevations in the suicide rate are present among persons withAIDS and range from seven to 36 times the rates in comparable age- and sex-matched popula-tions (335, 336, 725). For example, Marzuk et al. (335) studied suicide rates in 1985 in NewYork City and found a rate of 18.75 per 100,000 person-years for men age 20-59 years withouta known diagnosis of AIDS, compared to 680.56 per 100,000 person-years for those with aknown diagnosis of AIDS, a 36-fold increase in relative risk. Cote et al. (336) used public-accessAIDS surveillance data and National Center for Health Statistics multiple-cause mortality datafor the period from 1987 through 1989 to identify suicides among persons with AIDS andfound that all but one of the persons who died by suicide were male. Compared to demograph-ically similar men in the general population, men with AIDS had a rate of suicide that was 7.4-fold higher, at 165 per 100,000 person-years of observation. Cote et al. also noted that the sui-cide risk for persons with AIDS decreased significantly from 1987 to 1989, suggesting that therate of suicide associated with AIDS may be decreasing. In summary, physical illnesses are associated with increased risk for suicide. The strength of the evidence for malignant neoplasms, central nervous system disorders, peptic ulcer disease, andHIV/AIDS is strong. Although the evidence is less compelling, indications are that a range of otherconditions may also be associated with suicide and suicidal behaviors. It is probable that mood andsubstance use disorders, either as precipitants or sequelae, account in part for the increased SMRsfor suicide ascribed to specific physical conditions in the literature. However, further study is need-ed to determine the role of social and psychological factors as mediators or moderators of the re-lationship between physical illness and suicide. As a result, in assessing suicide risk amongindividuals with physical illness, consideration should be given to the presence of comorbid moodsymptoms as well as to the functional effects of the illness. 6. Family history Findings from at least three types of studies suggests that risk for suicide has a familial and prob-ably genetic contribution. These include: 1) strong and consistent findings that risk for suicidalbehavior is much higher among first-degree relatives of individuals with suicide attempts or Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Thesefamilial associations appear to be accounted for only partly by familial risks for major affectiveillness or other clinical risk factors for suicide. Recent efforts to specify molecular genetic mark-ers that segregate or associate with suicidal behavior, including those relating to the serotonin(5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) neurotransmission system, have yielded inconsistent findingsthat are not easily interpreted (17, 366, 368). a) Family studies Evidence from family studies of suicide was recently summarized by T urecki (368). In additionto studies showing increased rates of suicidal behaviors among family members of suicidal in-dividuals (31, 82, 360-364), at least 20 reports of controlled comparisons involving more than11,000 subjects have been published (202, 214, 312, 344-359). The pooled overall relativerisk of suicidal behavior in first-degree relatives of suicidal probands compared to control orpopulation risks, weighted by the number of subjects in each study, was 4.48 (95% CI=3.71-5.25), indicating a nearly 4.5-fold excess of risk of suicidal behavior among relatives of suicidalsubjects, compared to nonsuicidal subjects (R. Baldessarini, personal communication, 2002). Across studies, reported estimates of relative risk for suicidal behavior within families vary greatly, depending in part on the types of behavior included (suicide, suicide attempts of vary-ing lethality, or both) and their defining criteria, the prevalence of psychiatric risk factors forsuicide among the control subjects, the closeness of kinship (first-degree relatives, includingparents and siblings, with or without second-degree relatives), and differences in sample size.Such studies, while demonstrating a powerful association, do not prove genetic risk nor ruleout shared environmental factors. Moreover, it remains to be proved that the relationship forsuicide is separable from the well-known heritability of leading risk factors for suicide, includ-ing major affective illness. Nevertheless, the findings from pooled family studies strongly sup-port the conclusion that overall risk for suicidal behavior is at least four times greater amongclose relatives of suicidal persons than among unrelated persons. b) Twin studies A powerful method of separating risks that result from shared environments from risks that re-sult from genetic factors is to compare the rate of concordance (index condition appearing inboth twins) for a condition between identical, or monozygotic (single-egg), twins and fraternal,or dizygotic (two-egg), twins. Risks for dizygotic twins should be similar to those found amongother first-degree family members in family studies. Seven such twin studies pertaining to sui-cide were identified in the research literature (365, 370-375) and reviewed by Roy et al. (365,369) and Turecki (368). None of the studies involved samples of twins raised separately fromearly life, and, thus, the confounding effects of shared environments were possible. Moreover,the size and statistical power of these studies varied markedly, from an analysis of a singlemonozygotic twin-pair (373) to a study of an entire Australian national twin registry involvingmore than 1,500 monozygotic and nearly 1,200 dizygotic twin-pairs (375). When the datafrom all seven twin studies were pooled, the overall concordance rate for suicide or suicide at-tempts, weighted for the numbers of subjects involved, was 23.5% (401 of 1,704) for mono-zygotic twin-pairs and 0.135% (two of 1,486) for dizygotic twin-pairs, for a highly significant175-fold increase in pooled relative risk in the monozygotic twin-pairs (R. Baldessarini, per-sonal communication, 2002). Given the low frequency of suicidal behavior found among fra-ternal co-twins, this relative risk is likely to be a quantitatively unstable estimate. Nevertheless,its magnitude strongly supports a genetic contribution to suicidal behavior. A highly significantfourfold excess of risk in identical twins remained, even after statistical corrections for depres-sive and other psychiatric morbidity associated with suicide (375).

For thestudy of suicide, this approach has been reported only three times, and each study used thesame Danish health and vital statistics registers that included data for 5,483 adoptions in great-er Copenhagen between 1924 and 1947 (376-378). When data for suicide were pooled acrossall studies, to include affectively as well as psychotically ill probands (376, 378), there was anapproximately fivefold greater risk among biological than among adoptive relatives (20 of 543subjects [3.68%] versus two of 263 subjects [0.76%]). Later, the same American and Danish collaborators (378) compared all adoptees identified as having an affective spectrum disorder (N=71) with matched control adoptees without suchdisorders (N=71). The index disorders included not only DSM-III major depression and bipo-lar disorder but also milder \"neurotic\" depressions and a condition (\"affect reaction\") markedby affective instability that may resemble some forms of personality disorder in current classi-fications. In relatives of affectively ill adopted probands, there was a significant, approximatelysevenfold greater risk for suicide in biological relatives, compared with adopted relatives (15 of387 subjects [3.88%] versus one of 180 subjects [0.56%]). Further analysis of the suicide ratefor biological relatives, compared with control subjects, also yielded a highly significant 13.3-fold difference (15 of 387 subjects [3.88%] versus one of 344 subjects [0.29%]) (378). In strik-ing contrast, however, when suicide attempts were considered separately, there was a 1.16-foldlower but nonsignificant risk in the biological relatives, compared with the adoptive relatives,of affectively ill adopted probands (13 of 387 subjects [3.36%] versus seven of 180 subjects[3.89%]). A similar comparison of the rate of suicide attempts in biological relatives of adoptedprobands and in matched but not affectively ill control subjects showed a modest 2.89-folddifference that failed to reach significance (13 of 387 subjects [3.36%] versus four of 344 sub-jects [1.16%]). Among relatives of index adoptees with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, there wasa nonsignificant 2.67-fold greater risk for suicide in biological relatives, compared with adop-tive relatives (five of 156 subjects [3.20%] versus one of 83 subjects [1.20%]) (376). Matched comparison of 57 early-adopted individuals who died by suicide with other adop- tees lacking evidence of suicide or psychiatric illnesses also showed a great excess risk of suicidein biological over adoptive relatives (12 of 269 subjects [4.46%] versus none of 148 subjects[0.00%]) (378). Risk of suicide was approximately sixfold greater in relatives of suicidalprobands compared to relatives of matched, nonsuicidal control subjects (12 of 269 subjects[4.46%] versus two of 269 subjects [0.74%]). However, this study did not consider the possiblecoincident heritability of clinical risk factors for suicide, such as major affective illnesses and sub-stance use disorders. Overall, these adoption studies indicate a greater risk of suicide, but not of suicide attempts, among biological relatives of suicidal probands, compared with adoptive relatives. They also showgreater risk among biological relatives of probands, compared with control subjects, that is con-sistent with the hypothesis that suicidality is heritable. Given the broader range of severity andlethality of suicide attempts and the greater likelihood of environmentally determined actions inmany instances, the heritability of suicide may well be much greater than that of suicide attempts. 7. Psychosocial factors a) EmploymentUnemployment has long been associated with increased rates of suicide (379, 380, 726). Fur-thermore, the link between suicide and unemployment has been confirmed by a recent study Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

At 2-year follow-up, unem-ployed men were two to three times more likely to have died by suicide, compared withemployed men. Living alone, being divorced, and having lower socioeconomic status increasedthe suicide risk. At or beyond 4 years of follow-up, however, there was no statistical associationbetween unemployment and suicide for men. For women, the relationship between suicide andunemployment was even stronger and longer-lasting. Unemployed women had a much higherrisk for suicide at each year of follow-up than employed women. Unemployed women contin-ued to show an elevated risk at 9-year follow-up, by which time they were three times as likelyto die by suicide as employed women. As with men, younger unemployed women were more at risk than women over age 45 years. While the number of women who died by suicide was small,the results remain significant and powerful. While in the past men were considered most at riskfor suicide after becoming unemployed, it is now known that women are at an even greater riskand for a longer period of time. The relationship between unemployment, suicide, and psychi-atric disorders remains unclear. Persons with psychiatric disorders may be more likely to quitjobs or to be fired as well as more likely to die by suicide (727). Areas with socioeconomic deprivation also have larger numbers of unemployed people, and these differences have been used to examine effects of unemployment on rates of suicide and sui-cide attempts. Hawton et al. (386), for example, analyzed data for different wards, or communi-ties, within Oxford, England, and found that wards with the highest socioeconomic deprivationwere associated with the highest rates of suicide attempts. Individuals who attempted suicide, bothmen and women, were more likely to be unemployed, living alone, and having problems withhousing. For men, but not for women, a strong association was also found between the rate ofsuicide attempts and socioeconomic deprivation. Men living in less deprived areas who had finan-cial problems were even more likely to attempt suicide, suggesting that the dissonance betweenone's own financial status and that of the neighborhood may affect risk. Unemployment and fi-nancial problems can affect suicide in other ways as well. Alcohol consumption and marital con-flict, each of which increases with financial difficulties or unemployment, may also contribute toincreased risk for suicidal behaviors. Political context and large-scale economic changes can also influence suicide and may pro- vide clues about the effect of employment status on suicide rates. During times of war, for ex-ample, suicide rates decline (728), whereas increased suicide rates are found in political systemsassociated with violence or social movements. Areas of the former Soviet Union with high levelsof sociopolitical oppression (i.e., Baltic States) have had higher suicide rates than other regionswith less oppression (729). From an economic standpoint, research on the business cycle andsuicide has relied primarily on unemployment rates, but other indicators include growth ratesof the gross domestic product, the Ayres index of industrial activity, change in the stock marketindex, and the rate of new dwelling construction (730). Especially for men, the data suggestthat the greater the prosperity, the lower the suicide rate, and, conversely, the greater the trendtoward recession, the greater the suicide rate. During periods of high unemployment, such asthe Great Depression, the relationship of unemployment to suicide is strengthened (731).However, studies using the Ayres index of industrial activity and monthly suicide trends havesuggested that large swings in industrial production, such as those that occurred during the1930s, are needed to influence the suicide rate (732). In summary , it is important to ascertain the patient's employment status as part of the as- sessment process, since unemployment may increase suicide risk, whereas employment may of-fer some protection against suicide and suicide attempts. However, a patient's job status shouldalso be considered in terms of other psychosocial stressors that may be related to job loss, suchas financial or marital difficulties. In addition, there is often a complex interplay between em-ployment status and psychiatric illness, including substance use disorder, that may influencetreatment planning.

Pescosolido and Gior-gianna (733) used suicide rates from the National Center for Health Statistics, data on affilia-tion rates in various Christian denominations from the National Council of Churches, anddata on Jewish affiliation from the American Jewish Yearbook to determine whether suiciderates differ according to religious affiliation. They found that religion affected suicide rates,with Catholicism, Evangelical Protestantism, and membership in Church of the Nazarenes be-ing associated with lower rates and Jewish affiliation producing a small but inconsistent pro-tective effect. In contrast, various denominations of mainstream Protestantism tended to beassociated with increased suicide rates. Within specific religious denominations, the strength of religious belief may also play a role. Maris (394) compared suicide rates among Catholics and Protestants in Chicago between 1966and 1968. Scores on church attendance, perception of religiosity, and influence of religion werenegatively associated with suicidal ideation. After controlling for the effects of confoundingvariables such as sex, marital status, and socioeconomic status, Maris found that the perceivedinfluence of religion was the most significant correlate of suicidal ideation. In immigrants fromCentral America, infrequent church attendance and low levels of perceived influence of religionwere related to high levels of suicidal ideation (43). Thus, religious involvement may serve as aprotective factor against suicide, either by helping to buffer acculturative stress (43) or by en-hancing social networks and support (733). In summary, some evidence suggests that religious beliefs and the strength of those beliefs may offer protective effects in relation to suicide risk. At the same time, these protective effects neitherare specific to particular religious denominations nor are invariably present. Indeed, for some in-dividuals, religious beliefs or beliefs about death may increase rather than decrease the likelihoodof acting on suicidal thoughts. Consequently, the clinician may wish to gain an understanding ofthe patient's specific religious beliefs and the depth of the patient's religiosity as well as determinethe ways in which these beliefs influence the patient's conceptions of death and suicide. c) Psychosocial support Although it is often difficult to distinguish perceived from objective measures of social support,available data strongly suggest that the presence of a social network is a powerful and indepen-dent predictor of suicide risk. In particular, those who have (or perceive themselves to have)supportive interpersonal relationships are at lower risk for suicide than those without such ac-tual or perceived supports. Rubenowitz et al. (405) used the psychological autopsy method tocompare 85 persons age 65 years and older who died by suicide with 153 age- and sex-matchedliving persons selected from the tax roster in Gothenburg, Sweden. In addition to identifyinga powerful influence of psychiatric disorders, they found that family discord was a significantrisk factor for those who died by suicide (odds ratio 19). Further, being active in a social club was a significant protective factor for both men and women. Another recent psychological au-topsy study compared 53 individuals age 55 years and older who had either died by suicide ormade a serious suicide attempt with 269 matched control subjects (403). Psychiatric illness wasagain a powerful predictor of suicide case status, but, in addition, those who died by suicidehad significantly fewer social interactions and significantly more relationship problems, com-pared to the control subjects. T urvey and colleagues (400) used data from the Established Pop-ulations for Epidemiologic Studies in the Elderly database to identify 21 elderly persons whodied by suicide over a 10-year follow-up period and compared those subjects to 420 controlsubjects matched for age, sex, and study site. In addition to depressive symptoms, poor per-ceived health status, and poor sleep quality, the absence of a relative or friend in whom to con-fide was a significant risk factor for late-life suicide. Finally, Miller (399) compared 30 men age60 years and older who died by suicide with 30 men, matched on age, race, marital status, andcounty of residence, who died of natural causes. He reported that the control subjects were sig- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Thus, while social support is a complex con-struct and the data on this factor come primarily from elderly populations, decreases in measuresof social support appear to increase suicide risk, and, conversely, increases in social support mayserve as a protective factor in relation to suicide. d) Reasons for living, including children in the home An additional protective factor against suicide is the ability to cite reasons for living, which of-ten reflect the patient's degree of optimism about life. Malone et al. (231) assessed 84 patients,45 of whom had attempted suicide, to determine whether \"reasons for living\" might protect orrestrain patients with major depression from making a suicide attempt. Depressed patients whohad not attempted suicide were found to have expressed more feelings of responsibility towardtheir families, more fear of social disapproval, more moral objections to suicide, greater survivaland coping skills, and a greater fear of suicide than the depressed patients who had attemptedsuicide. Although objective severity of depression and quantity of recent life events did not dif-fer between the two groups, scores for hopelessness, subjective depression, and suicidal ideationwere significantly higher for the suicide attempters. Particularly in women, the presence of children in the home is an additional factor that ap- pears to protect against suicide. Hoyer and Lund (26) used data from the Norwegian CentralBureau of Statistics to prospectively follow 989,949 women over a 15-year period. During thattime there were 1,190 deaths from suicide, with parous women of all ages having lower relativerisks than nonparous women (relative risk=0.4-0.8, depending on age). For both premeno-pausal and postmenopausal women, a strong linear decrease in relative risk for suicide wasfound with an increasing number of children. Consequently, during the assessment and treatment planning process, clinicians should dis- cuss reasons for living with at-risk patients and the need to develop coping skills that may serveas protective factors during periods of high risk for suicide. e) Individual psychological strengths and vulnerabilities A number of personality traits and characteristics have been associated with suicide and suicidalrisk and behaviors. Conner et al. (217) reviewed the literature on psychological vulnerabilitiesto suicide, including 46 publications describing 35 distinct case-control or cohort samples, andfound no evidence for a link between suicide and guilt or inwardly directed anger. They didfind that suicide was consistently associated with five constructs\u2014impulsivity/aggression, de-pression, hopelessness, anxiety, and self-consciousness/social disengagement. Although otherfactors often moderate the relationships between these variables and suicide, they are not alwaysinterpretable in the literature because of measurement and definitional issues. Nonetheless,psychological vulnerabilities likely influence suicide risk by exacerbating other psychiatric orsocial risk factors in individual patients. A number of other concepts have also been explored in relating suicide to individual vul- nerabilities. For example, Duberstein (423) used questionnaires to assess personality dimen-sions in 81 depressed patients over age 50 and found that individuals who reported lower levelsof openness to new experiences were less likely to report suicidal ideation. These findings areconsistent with other work, suggesting that elderly persons tend to deny suicidality, whereasyounger persons tend to exaggerate it. These findings may also provide support for the protec-tive role of expressing suicidal ideation. Thus, when closed-minded people do come into con-tact with treatment services, their psychiatric symptoms may not be as obvious and their needfor treatment may not be appreciated. Hughes and Neimeyer (422) assessed 79 hospitalized psychiatric patients, 91% of whom had a principal diagnosis that included depression, and examined the utility of several cognitive Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Level of pessimism, as measured by the Hopelessness Scale, was the best predictor of subsequent suicidal ideation and was reliably related to place-ment on either one-to-one observation or every-15-minute checks for suicide precautions. Inaddition, hopelessness, self-negativity, polarization (all-or-nothing thinking), and poor prob-lem-solving performance were associated with suicidal ideation, whereas self-evaluated prob-lem-solving ability was not. A low level of constriction was related to the intensity ofsubsequent suicidal ideation and to later suicide attempts. Josepho and Plutchik (409) investigated the relationship between interpersonal problems, cop- ing styles, and suicide attempts in 71 adult psychiatric inpatients. Patients who were hospitalizedafter a suicide attempt had more interpersonal problems and also had distinct patterns of copingmethods, including more use of suppression and substitution and less use of replacement. Thesecoping styles were also associated with higher scores on a rating of suicide risk. After controllingfor the effect of interpersonal problems, the authors found that greater suppression, less minimi-zation, and less replacement were significantly related to increased suicide risk scores. The higherthe risk score, the greater the likelihood that the patient was admitted to the hospital secondary toa suicide attempt. Depressed patients also had higher suicide risk scale scores. Stravynski and Boyer (401) collected data from 19,724 persons who returned the Quebec Health Survey and tested whether there was an association between loneliness and suicidalthoughts or behaviors in the general population. A significant correlation was found betweenexperiencing suicidal ideation or attempting suicide and living alone, having no friends, or feel-ing alone, with psychological distress being the strongest correlate of suicidal ideation. Of indi-viduals who were severely distressed and very lonely, 25% reported serious suicidal ideation oractions. Overall, thoughts of suicide were reported by 3.1% of the population, and 0.9% hadattempted suicide. Maser et al. (247) examined the correlations between suicide and clinical and personality factors in 955 depressed patients who were followed over 14 years as part of the NIMH Col-laborative Program on the Psychobiology of Depression. During that time, 3.8% died by sui-cide and 12.6% attempted suicide. Suicide within 12 months of intake to the study wasassociated with clinical variables, including emotional turmoil plus depression in the index ep-isode, a history of both alcohol and drug use disorders, and meeting the criteria for antisocialpersonality disorder. Additional predictors included hopelessness, delusions of grandeur, inde-cisiveness, definite delusions or hallucinations during the index episode, reduced functionalrole, dissatisfaction with life, or any prior history of serious suicide attempts as of the intakeepisode. Beyond 1 year after intake, suicide was associated with temperamental factors, includ-ing high levels of impulsivity and shyness and low sanguinity scores. Suicide attempters andthose who died by suicide shared core characteristics, including previous attempts, impulsivity,substance abuse, and psychic turmoil within a cycling/mixed bipolar disorder. Kaslow et al. (413) conducted an empirical study of the psychodynamics of suicide among 52 patients hospitalized for a suicide attempt and 47 psychiatrically hospitalized control sub-jects with no history of suicidal behaviors. Overall, 49% of the subjects had depression, 25%had substance use disorders, and 63% had a cluster B personality disorder. Individuals who hadattempted suicide were significantly more likely to report childhood loss combined with adult-hood loss. Furthermore, they had more impairment in their object relations and viewed rela-tionships in a more negative manner, showing lower levels of individuation and separation.Although self-directed anger was associated with homicidal ideation, there was little supportfor the psychodynamic concepts that depression, self-directed anger, or ego functioning wouldbe associated with having made a suicide attempt. In a group of 438 undergraduate college students who ranged in age from 16 to 65 years, Boudewyn and Liem (734) compared low and high scorers on a chronic self-destructivenessscale that measured behaviors such as chronic gambling or unsafe sexual behaviors that had apotential for later negative consequences. Overall, those scoring high in self-destructiveness Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

These findings suggest that othermanifestations of self-destructiveness should be assessed in the individual evaluation of the sui-cidal patient and that childhood and adult maltreatment should be specifically identified andaddressed in the treatment planning process. T ogether with extensive clinical observations on individual strengths and vulnerabilities as they relate to suicidality (410, 412, 420, 426), research on various psychological dimensionshas demonstrated the need to include such features in assessing suicide risk. In particular,personality traits such as aggression, impulsivity, social disengagement and subjective loneli-ness, hopelessness, anxiety, low self-esteem (and protective narcissism), dependence, ambiva-lence, and depression may increase risk for suicidal behaviors. Thinking styles such as closed-mindedness or polarized (either-or) thinking may also augment risk. If dilemmas are seen onlyin black-and-white terms, with fewer perceived options, patients may see no solution to theirproblems other than suicide. In addition to personality traits and thinking style, an individual'spsychological needs, when not met, can cause intense psychological pain, contributing to a sui-cidal state. Early trauma and loss may thwart the development of healthy coping skills. In ad-dition, individual perceptions of interpersonal supports, particularly subjective perceptions ofloneliness, may also contribute to suicide risk. Thus, in weighing the strengths and vulnerabil-ities of the individual patient and developing and implementing a plan of treatment, it is helpfulto assess the patient's past response to stress, vulnerability to life-threatening affects, available ex-ternal resources, perceived sense of loneliness, fantasies about death, and capacity for realitytesting and for tolerating psychological pain. 8. Degree of suicidality a) Presence, extent, and persistence of suicidal ideationSuicidal ideation is common, with an estimated annual incidence of 5.6% (2). Kessler et al.(427) examined the lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in a sample of5,877 individuals age 15-54 years as part of the National Comorbidity Survey. The estimatedlifetime prevalences of suicidal ideation, plans, and attempts were 13.5%, 3.9%, and 4.6%, re-spectively. The cumulative probability of moving from suicidal ideation to an unplanned at-tempt was 26%. The corresponding cumulative probability for transitioning from suicidalideation to suicidal plans was 34%, with a 72% cumulative probability for going from a suicideplan to an attempt. About 90% of unplanned attempts and 60% of planned first attempts oc-curred within 1 year of the onset of suicidal ideation, suggesting a need for aggressive aftercareand attention to potentially modifiable risk factors in individuals with suicidal ideation. Longitudinal studies also demonstrate an increased risk of eventual suicide in patients with sui- cidal ideation. Among 6,891 psychiatric outpatients who were followed for up to 20 years, Brownet al. (78) found that patients' scores on clinician-administered measures of current suicidal ide-ation and depression were most closely associated with eventual suicide. Fawcett et al. (79), usinga case-control method to determine time-related predictors of suicide among 954 patients withmajor affective disorder, examined suicidal ideation as one possible predictor of actual suicide overa 10-year period. They found that the presence of suicidal ideation was associated with an increasedrisk for suicide on a long-term basis but not within the first year after study entry. Others have examined the association between eventual suicide and suicidal ideation at its worst using the Scale for Suicide Ideation-Worst (SSI-W) (428). In a group of 3,701 out-patients in which there were 30 suicides, patients who scored in the high-risk category on theSSI-W had a rate of later suicide that was 14 times greater than that of the patients in the low-risk category. After controlling for the effects of other factors, the investigators found that onlythe SSI-W score, and not the scores on measures of current suicidal ideation or hopelessness, Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

For permission for reuse, visit APPI Permissions & Licensing Center at http://www.appi.org/CustomerService/Pages/Permissions.aspx.122 APA Practice Guidelineswas associated with future suicide (428). Consistent with the findings of Clark and Fawcett (273), the authors concluded that retrospective report of suicidal ideation at its worst may bea better predictor of suicide than currently reported suicidal ideation. Intuitively, since suicidal ideas would be expected to precede suicidal intent or suicidal acts, they may serve as a guide for clinicians in identifying and addressing suicide risk. These studiesalso suggest that past as well as current suicidal ideation is relevant to the assessment process.However, since the vast majority of individuals with suicidal ideation do not die by suicide, ad-ditional factors are likely to be modulating suicide risk even in individuals with suicidal ideas. b) Presence of a suicide plan and availability of a method As noted earlier, about one-third of individuals with suicidal ideas go on to develop a suicide plan,and about three-quarters of those with a plan eventually make a suicide attempt. Other individ-uals, however, go on to attempt suicide in an unplanned manner. Thus, the presence of a suicideplan signifies that the risk of a later attempt is increased, but it by no means indicates that an at-tempt will occur or even the time frame within which an attempt may occur. By the same token,the absence of a suicide plan does not eliminate suicide risk. In general, however, the presence ofa specific plan involving an available method is associated with a greater degree of risk for suicide.In addition, availability of methods with relatively high levels of lethality may increase the likeli-hood that a suicide attempt, either planned or impulsive, will result in suicide. A number of studies have examined population-based trends in suicide rates as they relate to the availability of specific methods for suicide. Ohberg et al. (735), for example, evaluatedtrends in suicide rates and availability of methods used for suicide in Finland from 1947 to1990. For both sexes, the overall suicide rate in Finland rose significantly in that time period,but method-specific rates of suicide varied. For example, the rate of suicide by using the highlylethal pesticide parathion decreased after its availability was restricted, but this decrease was off-set by an increased rate of suicide by other methods. Before 1962, most suicides occurred byhanging or drowning, but after 1963, there was a rapid increase in the use of firearms. Coinci-dent with increases in the availability of antidepressants and neuroleptics, the rates of suicideby overdose of these medications increased. There was a high number of overdoses of tricyclicantidepressants, which accounted for most of the deaths attributed to antidepressants. On theother hand, the number of overdose deaths attributed to nontricyclic antidepressants de-creased, despite increased availability, and the number of overdose deaths attributed to barbi-turates remained stable despite reduction in their availability. Gunnell et al. (436) investigated method-specific trends in suicide between 1950 and 1975 in England and Wales. In the 1950s and early 1960s, domestic gas poisoning was the most fre-quently used method of suicide among men and women, accounting for one-half of all sui-cides. Changes in domestic gas supply and manufacture resulted in a reduction in its carbonmonoxide content and thus lethality, and overall suicide rates declined in men and women ofall ages. In women and younger men (younger than age 55 years), the effects of these reductionson overall suicide rates were partially offset by a rise in the rates of drug overdose deaths, butthere were no immediate increases in the use of other suicide methods. In older men, a reduc-tion in the rate of suicide by gassing was accompanied by only a slight increase in the rate ofsuicide by overdose as well as reductions in rates of suicide by using all other methods. Marzuk et al. (437) investigated the relationship between the availability of lethal methods of injury and suicide rates by prospectively classifying lethal methods according to their accessi-bility in the five counties of New York City over a 4-year period and then comparing the age-and gender-adjusted method-specific suicide rates of the counties. During the study period,there were a total of 2,820 suicides, a rate of 9.81 per 100,000 persons. The study found markeddifferences in overall crude suicide rates among the five counties, which ranged from 15.27 per100,000 persons in Manhattan to 5.58 per 100,000 persons in Staten Island. The counties hadsimilar suicide rates involving methods that were equally accessible to all persons in each county Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Virtually all of the differences in overall suicide risk among the counties were ex-plained by methods that were differentially available, such as fall from height, overdose of pre-scription drugs, and carbon monoxide poisoning (explained by access to private parking). Theavailability of a greater variety of alternative lethal methods in some counties did not suppressthe rates of use of other methods, and a relative lack of the availability of a specific method didnot result in a comparative increase in the rates of use of alternative methods that were available,as the substitution hypothesis would have predicted. Thus, restriction of the availability of amethod may reduce its use for suicide, but other methods may tend to be used instead. At thesame time, the accessibility to and lethality of particular methods of suicide may have definiteeffects on the overall suicide rate. In the United States, firearms constitute the most common method for suicide (736, 737). Fox et al. (738) used mortality data for 1979-1994 from the Wisconsin Center for Health Sta-tistics and the U.S. Census Bureau population estimates for Wisconsin to describe trends forfirearm-related suicides in that state. During that period, there were an average of 588 suicidesannually, with firearms eclipsing all other methods combined as the most common method ofsuicide in the 1980s. Between 1981 and 1992, the proportion of firearm suicides increasedfrom 48% to 57%. While the overall suicide rate remained unchanged over the period, the fire-arm suicide rate increased 17% in all sex, race, and age categories. Among males, the firearm-related suicide rate rose by 13% during the study period, while the rate of suicide by all othermethods combined fell 12%. In comparison, among females, the firearm-related suicide raterose 20%, and the rate of suicide by all other methods fell 26%. Kaplan and Geling (434) investigated the sociodemographic and geographic patterns of firearm suicides in the United States using mortality data from the National Center for HealthStatistics Mortality detail files and death certificate files reported by each state from 1989 to1993. During this time period, 59.2% of the 139,566 suicides were by firearms. Married per-sons had the lowest rate of any form of suicide across all race, sex, and age groups. The adjustedodds of using firearms increased with age among men and decreased with age among women.Widowed men and married women had the highest odds of using firearms, and the odds ofusing a firearm for suicide were also high among those without college education, those whohad lived in nonmetropolitan areas, and those who had lived in the East South Central andWest South Central geographic divisions. Rates of nonfirearm suicides were higher than fire-arm suicides everywhere but in the regions of the South. Thus, the likelihood of firearm suicidevaried significantly across sociodemographic and geographic subgroups of the U.S. populationand paralleled variations in gun ownership, suggesting that regional cultural factors may ac-count for differential rates in suicidal behavior involving firearms. In addition to population-based data on firearm availability and suicide risk, some data also suggest an effect at an individual level. Brent et al. (438) performed a case-control study to de-termine the relationship between the presence of guns in the home, the type of gun, the meth-od of storage, and the risk of suicide among adolescents. Forty-seven adolescents from thecommunity who died by suicide were compared with two control groups from a psychiatrichospital: 47 patients who attempted suicide but survived and 47 patients who had never at-tempted suicide. The study found that guns were twice as likely to be found in the homes ofthose who died by suicide as in the homes of the suicide attempters or psychiatric control sub-jects. There was no significant difference in association with suicide between handguns andlong guns, and there was no difference in the methods of storage of firearms among the groups.The authors concluded that the availability of guns in the home, independent of the type offirearm or storage method, appears to increase the risk for suicide, at least among adolescents. In summary, the presence of a suicide plan and the availability of a method for suicide in- crease risk and are important issues to address as part of the suicide assessment.

Adebate remains over whether a reduction in the availability of a particular method of suicide re-duces overall risk, although most evidence indicates that restrictions on the availability of par-ticular types of popular methods result in a lower overall suicide rate. At the individual level,reducing access to specific suicide methods may also be indicated. See Section II.C.2, \"Elicit thePresence or Absence of a Suicide Plan,\" for additional discussion of inquiries, removal, and doc-umentation issues related to firearms and the suicidal patient. c) Lethality and intent of self-destructive behavior In addition to being increased by the presence of suicidal ideation, a suicide plan, or an avail-able suicide method, suicide risk is also influenced by the patient's subjective expectation anddesire to die as a result of a self-inflicted injury. This factor has generally been termed suicidalintent, although the patient's subjective expectation may or may not correspond to the lethalityof an attempt made by using a given method. Other facets of a suicide plan or attempt that areoften considered when estimating suicidal intent include the severity and potential lethality ofthe suicide attempt or aborted suicide attempt, the patient's degree of premeditation, whetherprecautions were taken to avoid intervention or discovery, and whether the patient's intentionswere communicated to others (263, 433, 440). Several studies have longitudinally assessed the influence of suicidal intent on later suicide risk. In a group of 500 patients who had completed a scale measuring suicidal intent after anepisode of self-injury, Pierce (441) found that the seven individuals who had died by suicide bythe time of a 5-year follow-up tended to have high suicidal intent scores at the time of theirinitial self-injury. In addition, individuals with increasing levels of suicidal intent with repeatedself-injury appeared to be at greater risk for further repetition of self-injury (739). Suokas et al.(271) also conducted a longitudinal assessment of the effect of suicidal intent on suicide risk.They found that 68 (6.7%) of 1,018 deliberate self-poisoning patients had died by suicide by14-year follow-up. Risk factors for suicide included being male, having previous psychiatrictreatment or suicide attempts, having a somatic disease, and having a genuine intent to die atthe time of the index self-poisoning. Thus, for any patient with suicidal ideation, it is important to determine suicidal intent as part of the assessment process. In addition, for any patient who has made a prior suicide at-tempt, the level of intent at the time of the previous attempt should be determined. 9. Weighting of risk factors in suicide prediction As noted previously, it is impossible to accurately predict suicide. Nevertheless, given the largenumber of risk factors and protective factors that can affect the likelihood of suicide, a numberof statistical models have been developed to attempt to pinpoint which patients may be atgreatest risk. In a longitudinal study by Pokorny (160) that followed 4,800 subjects (4,691males and 109 females) over a 5-year period, stepwise discriminant analysis was used to selecta weighted combination of predictive variables from the identified high-risk characteristics, i.e.,being a white male; being single; having a diagnosis of affective disorder, schizophrenia, or al-coholism; having made a previous suicide attempt; or having personality disorder-related traitssuch as manipulativeness and hostility. This method was able to correctly identify 30 of the 67subjects who died by suicide but also falsely predicted suicide in 773 individuals. Thus, whileit may be possible to identify a high-risk group of patients who warrant more detailed clinicalscreening, it may not be possible to identify the particular individuals at greatest risk. Goldstein et al. (740) also used a statistical model that incorporated multiple risk factors for suicide and applied it in a group of 1,906 patients with affective disorders who were admittedto a tertiary care hospital and were followed longitudinally. The identified risk factors includedthe number of prior suicide attempts, the presence of suicidal ideation on admission, gender, Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

The full statisti-cal model, however, was unable to identify any of the patients who died by suicide, highlightingthe difficulty of estimating suicide risk with such methods. In general, statistical models may be valuable in the epidemiological and research arenas by identifying factors that distinguish high-risk populations of patients. They can also suggestclinically important risk factors that, if identified, are potentially amenable to treatment. How-ever, given the low base rates of suicide in the population, accurate prediction of suicide re-mains impossible, regardless of the complexity of the statistical model used. Consequently, thepsychiatric assessment, in combination with clinical judgment, is still the best tool for assessingsuicide risk. In addition, intervention must be based not on the simple presence of risk factorsas identified by statistical models but on the interaction of those factors with the individual pa-tient's personal and clinical manifestations and the clinician's assessment of the patient's risk atthat particular point in time. /L50776 B. PSYCHIATRIC ASSESSMENT TECHNIQUES 1. Rating scales A wide variety of self-report and clinician-administered scales are available that measure various as-pects of suicidal thoughts and behaviors as well as symptoms associated with suicide. These scalesare reliable and have adequate concurrent validity, and they may have application as research tools.However, their usefulness and generalizability in clinical practice are questionable. Most of thescales have been tested in nonrepresentative samples composed of college students or psychiatricpatients and have not been adequately tested in important subpopulations of patients, such as eld-erly patients, minority group patients, and patients in common clinical settings, including emer-gency departments or primary care practices. Few of these scales have been tested in prospectivestudies, and those that have been tested have shown very low positive predictive validity and highrates of false positive findings. As a result, for the practicing clinician, these rating scales are prima-rily of value in learning to develop a thorough line of questioning about suicide (see Section II.C.4,\"Understand the Relevance and Limitations of Suicide Assessment Scales\"). It is for this reason thatthe specific rating scales will be reviewed briefly here. In addition, information about the scales maybe helpful in interpreting the findings of other studies discussed in this guideline. The Scale for Suicide Ideation (8) is a 19-item, clinician-administered scale that takes ap- proximately 10 minutes to administer and was designed to quantify the intensity of current andconscious suicidal intent by assessing the extent and characteristics of suicidal thoughts; the pa-tient's attitude toward suicidal thoughts; the wish to die; motivations, deterrents, and plans fora suicide attempt; and feelings of control and courage about a suicide attempt. Although stan-dardized for use with adult psychiatric patients, the Scale for Suicide Ideation has been used ina variety of settings and has high levels of internal consistency and interrater reliability. Scoreson the Scale for Suicide Ideation have been correlated with the self-harm item of the Beck De-pression Inventory and have been shown to discriminate between depressed outpatients andpatients hospitalized for suicidal ideation, despite similar levels of depression in the two groups(8), suggesting that the scale measures something above and beyond depression alone. Al-though the Scale for Suicide Ideation is one of the few instruments with a demonstrated posi-tive predictive validity for suicide, its positive predictive value is only 3%, and it has a high rateof false positive findings (78). A number of modified versions of the Scale for Suicide Ideationexist, including a 21-item self-report version (741) and a measure of suicidal ideation at itsworst, the SSI-W, which is also a 19-item, clinician-administered instrument (428). The Suicide Behavior Questionnaire (SBQ) is a self-report measure of suicidal thoughts and behaviors that is significantly correlated with the Scale for Suicide Ideation (10).

A 14-item revised version (SBQ-14) is a more comprehensive measureof suicidal attempts, ideation, and acts and includes items on suicidal ideation, future suicidalideation, past suicide threats, future suicide attempts, and the likelihood of dying by suicide inthe future. Although the SBQ has high internal reliability and an ability to differentiate betweenclinical and nonclinical samples (10), the positive predictive validity of the SBQ is not known. The Suicide Intent Scale (9) is a 20-item clinician-administered scale that has high internal and interrater reliabilities and that quantifies a patient's perceptions and verbal and nonverbal behav-iors before and during a recent suicide attempt. It includes questions about circumstances sur-rounding an attempt, the method and setting of the attempt, the patient's perception of thelethality of the method, expectations about the probability of rescue, premeditation of the at-tempt, and the purpose of the attempt. Although scores on the Suicide Intent Scale are associatedwith the lethality of the method, the scale is unable to distinguish between those who attemptedsuicide and those who aborted their suicide attempts, and it does not predict death by suicide (10). The Reasons for Living Inventory (407) is a self-report instrument that takes approximately 10 minutes to administer and uses 48 Likert-type scale items to assess beliefs and expectations thatwould keep one from acting on suicidal ideas. This scale has high internal validity and reliabilityand moderately high test-retest reliability. It is moderately correlated with the Scale for SuicideIdeation and the Beck Hopelessness Scale and is able to differentiate between inpatients and con-trol subjects as well as between suicide attempters and those with suicidal ideation alone (10). A number of other scales have been devised to assess suicidality. Among them are the Risk- Rescue Rating, which assesses lethality of a suicide attempt and the level of suicidal intent(433), and the Suicide Assessment Scale, which assesses suicidality over time in the five areasof affect, bodily state, control and coping, emotional reactivity, and suicidal thoughts and be-haviors (742). Other more general rating scales include items that have also been used in as-sessing suicide risk. For example, the Thematic Apperception Test has been used to indicatedichotomous thinking as a risk factor for suicide (743), and the General Health Questionnaireincludes a subset of four items that can be used to assess suicidal ideation (744). Based on thetheory that psychological pain (or psychache) may be related to suicide, Shneidman (745) de-veloped a psychological pain assessment scale that uses pictures to assess the patient's unmetpsychological needs, providing a measure of the introspective experience of negative emotionsthat may relate to suicidality. By using the scale to explore a patient's perception of psycholog-ical pain, clinicians may be able to identify the patient's coping mechanisms and ego strengths.Use of this scale may also help the clinician assess the patient's mental anguish and address thepsychological needs that the patient views as important and unmet. In addition, because depression and hopelessness are risk factors for suicide, corresponding rating scales are often used as indicators of suicide risk. The Beck Hopelessness Scale is a self-report measure consisting of 20 true-false statements that assess positive and negative beliefsabout the future that are present during the week before administration (712). The Beck Hope-lessness Scale demonstrates high internal validity, adequate test-retest reliability, and moderateto high correlations with clinicians' rating of hopelessness (10). In addition, it is one of the onlyscales that has demonstrated positive predictive validity (10). In a 10-year prospective study ofhospitalized patients with suicidal ideation, the Beck Hopelessness Scale was able to distinguishthose who died by suicide and those who did not (222). Nonetheless, its positive predictive valueis only 1% (78, 713), and its rate of false positive findings is high (221). The most frequently used depression scales for suicide assessment are the Hamilton Depres- sion Rating Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory. As measured by these scales, higher levelsof depression have been associated with suicide in long-term studies of psychiatric outpatients(78, 221). In addition to being associated with the overall Beck Depression Inventory score,suicide has also been associated with specific inventory items. For example, the Beck Depres-sion Inventory item that measures pessimism has been shown to differentiate between patients Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

The correspondingsuicide item in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale measures suicidal behavior on a scaleof 0 (absent) to 4 (attempts suicide), has high interrater reliability, and is similarly associatedwith increased suicide risk (10). Thus, there are a variety of rating scales that are useful for research purposes and that may be helpful to clinicians in tracking clinical symptoms over time and in developing a thoroughline of questioning about suicide and suicidal behaviors. At the same time, because of their highrates of false positive and false negative findings and their low positive predictive values, theserating scales cannot be recommended for use in clinical practice in estimating suicide risk. 2. Biological markers Multiple studies, reviewed elsewhere (366, 746, 747), have suggested that suicidal behaviorsmay be associated with alterations in serotonergic function. As a result, a number of biologicalmarkers of serotonergic function, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of monoamine me-tabolites such as 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), have been suggested for use in assessingsuicide risk. Traskman et al. (748) compared suicide attempters (N=30) to normal control sub-jects (N=45) and found that the attempters, particularly those who had made more violent sui-cide attempts, had significantly lower CSF 5-HIAA levels that were independent of psychiatricdiagnosis. Subsequent longitudinal follow-up of 129 individuals after a suicide attempt showedthat 20% of those with CSF 5-HIAA levels below the median had died by suicide within 1 year(748). Serotonergic function, as measured by the response of prolactin to the specific serotoninreleaser and uptake inhibitor d -fenfluramine, was also found to be blunted in medication-free patients with DSM-IV schizophrenia who had attempted suicide, compared with nonattempt-ers and healthy control subjects (749). Hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been associated with suicide since 1965, when Bunney and Fawcett (750) reported three suicides occurring in pa-tients with very high levels of urine 17-hydroxycorticosteroids. Subsequent literature hasshown evidence of hypertrophic adrenal glands (751-753) and elevated levels of brain corti-cotropin-releasing hormone (754, 755) in individuals who died by suicide. The dexa-methasone test (DST) has also been used to study whether HPA dysfunction is associated witha type of depressive illness that is likely to end in suicide. In 234 inpatients with unipolar de-pression, 96 had abnormal DST results, and of these, four died by suicide, in contrast to onesuicide death in the group with normal DST results (756). In a subsequent longitudinal studyof hospitalized patients with either major depressive disorder or the depressed type of schizo-affective disorder, survival analyses in the 32 patients with abnormal DST results showed anestimated risk for eventual suicide of 26.8%, in contrast to an estimated risk of 2.9% in the 46patients with normal DST results (757). On the basis of a series of population studies (758) and a study by Ellison and Morrison (759) showing associations between low cholesterol levels and increased rates of suicide and violentdeath, cholesterol levels have also been suggested as a putative biological marker for suicidal be-haviors. Fawcett et al. (760) reported decreased mean levels of cholesterol in a sample of 47 in-patients who died by suicide. However, Tsai et al. (82) did not find decreased cholesterol levelsin a chart-review study of 43 bipolar disorder patients who died by suicide. A case-control studyfound significantly lower mean cholesterol levels in a group of 100 psychiatric inpatients whohad attempted suicide, compared with a matched group of patients hospitalized for physical ill-ness (761). No correlation existed between cholesterol levels and ratings of depression or suicidalintent, and a significant negative correlation between cholesterol levels and self-reported levelsof impulsivity was seen across the groups. In a group of 783 outpatients consecutively admittedto a lithium clinic, Bocchetta et al. (762) found a significantly higher likelihood of a history of Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Alvarez (763) also re-ported an association of violent, but not nonviolent, suicide attempts with low cholesterol levels.However, the clinical importance of these findings is unclear, since the use of statin drugs to re-duce cholesterol does not appear to be associated with any increase in violence, aggressiveness,unhappiness, accidents, or suicide (764). Overall, a great deal of evidence suggests that specific biological markers may relate to sui- cidal behaviors, perhaps through links to impulsivity or aggression. Nevertheless, while intrigu-ing and potentially useful in further understanding the biological underpinnings of suicidalbehaviors, none of these putative biological markers are sensitive or specific enough to recom-mend their use in routine screening or in clinical practice. /L50776 C. SPECIAL ISSUES 1. Homicide-suicide Homicide-suicide, which has often been referred to in the literature as murder-suicide, is rela-tively uncommon yet essential to keep in mind when assessing individuals at risk for suicidalideation or behaviors. Suicide is an act of violence toward one's self that may also be an expres-sion of anger or other-directed violence toward another person. After reviewing the literatureon risk factors for suicide and for violence, Plutchik (765) proposed a theoretical model thatnumerically weights a series of variables in order to systematically relate suicide risk to the riskof violence. Of 37 variables noted to be risk factors for violence, 23 were also risk factors forsuicide. Another 17 variables were identified as protective factors that decreased the risks ofboth suicide and violence. Thus, some correlates of suicidal behavior are also associated withviolence, an overlap that may contribute to homicide-suicides. Epidemiologically, homicide-suicide occupies a distinct but overlapping domain with sui- cide, domestic homicide, and mass murder (20). Although definitions of homicide-suicide vary(20, 766, 767), in general, the two acts occur in close temporal proximity, often with the sui-cide occurring within seconds or minutes of the homicide. The annual incidence in the UnitedStates is difficult to determine but has been estimated to be 0.2-0.9 per 100,000 persons, with-out significant changes over the past several decades (19, 20). It is likely that about 1.5% of allsuicides and 5% of all homicides in the United States occur in the context of homicide-suicide.Homicide-suicide between spouses or lovers represents the majority of homicide-suicides in theUnited States (19, 766-768), and shooting is the method used in almost all cases (768). The principal perpetrators of homicide-suicide are young men with intense sexual jealousy or despairing elderly men with ailing spouses (19, 767, 768). In the latter group, associatedsymptoms of depression are often compounded by financial stressors, resulting in despair(768). Histories of violence and domestic abuse are common (19, 768), as is substance use (19,768, 769), although perpetrators tend to be less deviant and have less previous criminal in-volvement than the typical homicide perpetrator (768). Ninety percent of all homicide-suicideincidents involve only one victim, and the principal victims are female sexual partners or con-sanguineous relatives, usually children (20, 768). Although infanticide is an extremely rare phe-nomenon (766), mothers who develop postpartum psychosis need to be assessed for suicidaland homicidal impulses directed toward their newborn or other children (27). The risk is es-pecially high in the first postnatal year, when the suicide risk is increased 70-fold (27). Underall of these circumstances, the common theme is the perpetrator's overvalued attachment to arelationship, which leads him or her to destroy the relationship if it is threatened by real orimagined dissolution. The management of patients assessed to have both suicidal and homicidal impulses should parallel that for either type of risk alone. In particular, in addition to identifying risk factors Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

It is also crucial to inquire about firearms and to address theissue with the patient and others if firearms are accessible (see Sections II.E.8.b, \"Presence of aSuicide Plan and Availability of a Method,\" and V .C, \"Communication With Significant Oth-ers\"). Although the legal duty for psychiatrists to warn and protect endangered third parties var-ies in each state, clinical interventions should endeavor to protect endangered third partieswhenever possible. As for psychopharmacologic management, questions have been raised about the effects of fluoxetine and other serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) antidepressants on violence and sui-cide. Tardiff et al. (770) analyzed data from the New York City medical examiner's office on all127 homicide-suicides that took place in that city from 1990 to 1998. Only three of the per-petrators (2.4%) were taking antidepressants. Given the fact that SRIs were widely prescribedin the 1990s, this finding provides no support for the view that SRI treatment is associated withviolence or suicide. In summary, data on homicide-suicide are limited but suggest that patients who present with a recent suicide attempt, have a suicide plan, or voice suicidal ideation should be evaluatedfor their risk of violent or homicidal behavior. Similarly, patients who present with recent vio-lent behavior or homicidal ideation should be evaluated for suicidal behavior. Clinicians shouldalso assess whether obsessive or delusional jealousy or paranoia is present, especially if suchsymptoms are comorbid with depression in a patient with a history of domestic abuse. In ad-dition, in older individuals, clinicians should assess for signs of depression or dependency ina spouse whose partner's medical condition is deteriorating. Although less common amonghomicide-suicide perpetrators, mothers with postpartum psychosis or depression also requirecareful assessment. Key interventions include treating the mental illness, removing firearms andother lethal methods, and providing assistance with psychosocial supports and social services. 2. Suicide pacts Suicide pacts, defined as a mutual arrangement between two people to kill themselves at thesame time, account for a very small percentage of suicides (0.3%-2.4%, depending on thestudy) (771-773). As with homicide-suicides, the majority of suicide pact deaths occur in mar-ried couples. Social isolation is common, and rates of psychiatric illness, particularly depres-sion, are high in one or both decedents (771-773). Other risk factors also parallel risks forsuicide, in general, suggesting that the best approach to detection of suicide pacts is a thoroughsuicide assessment with attention to psychiatric and psychosocial factors. 3. Deliberate self-harm Deliberate self-harm is a phenomenon related to but distinct from attempted suicide. Althoughdeliberate self-harm behavior can encompass suicide attempts, it also includes self-mutilation,such as burning, cutting, and hair pulling, that is not associated with fatal intentions (520).Three categories of self-mutilation have been described. Major self-mutilation is infrequentand is usually associated with psychosis or intoxication. Stereotypic self-mutilation is repetitiveand driven by a biologic imperative to harm the self. Superficial to moderate self-mutilators useself-harming behaviors as a way to relieve tension, release anger, regain self-control, escape frommisery, or terminate a state of depersonalization (520). Extreme forms of self-harm are very rareand often accompany religious or sexual delusions in patients with prominent psychosis or de-pression (520). Individuals with a history of deliberate and particularly repetitive self-harm alsoshow significantly greater degrees of impulsiveness (774) and are likely to have a diagnosis ofborderline personality disorder (521). In addition, repetitive self-mutilators who become de-pressed and demoralized over their inability to stop the behavior may be at increased risk forsuicide attempts (520).

For example, Soloff et al. (521) ex-amined aspects of self-mutilation and suicidal behavior in 108 patients with borderline person-ality disorder and found evidence of self-mutilation in 63% and suicide attempts in 75.7% ofthe patients. Compared to patients without self-mutilation, those with self-mutilation were sig-nificantly younger and had more serious suicidal ideation, more recent suicide attempts, andmore symptoms, including psychosis and depersonalization. Stanley et al. (251) compared 30 suicide attempters with cluster B personality disorders and a history of self-mutilation to 23 matched suicide attempters with cluster B personality disor-ders but no prior self-mutilation. While the two groups did not differ in the objective lethalityof their suicide attempts, those with a history of self-mutilation perceived their suicide attemptsas less lethal, with a greater likelihood of rescue and with less certainty of death. Suicide at-tempters with a history of self-mutilation had significantly higher levels of other symptoms,such as depression, hopelessness, aggression, anxiety, and impulsivity, that are associated withan increased risk of suicide. Furthermore, self-mutilators had higher and more persistent levelsof suicidal ideation than those without a history of self-mutilation. These findings highlightthe importance of distinguishing self-mutilatory behaviors from other, more lethal forms of de-liberate self-harm. In addition, they underscore the need for a thorough suicide assessment andan appreciation of the multiple determinants of suicide risk in individuals with histories of re-petitive deliberate self-harm. /L50776 D. SOMATIC THERAPIES Evidence for reduction of suicidal risk with specific forms of psychiatric treatment is very lim-ited. The most secure research support pertains to psychopharmacological treatments for majoraffective and psychotic disorders, but even this evidence should be considered preliminary.Moreover, support for reduced suicide risk with psychopharmacological treatment is limited tolithium in various forms of recurrent major affective disorders and clozapine in chronic psy-chotic illnesses. Support for reduction of suicide risk with antidepressants and mood-stabilizinganticonvulsants is very limited and is at best only suggestive and inconclusive. 1. Pharmacotherapy a) AntidepressantsA growing number of antidepressant drugs have been shown to be clinically effective in thetreatment of acute, recurrent, and chronic depressive illness and a number of anxiety disorders(526). Moreover, nontricyclic, non-SRI antidepressants are relatively safe and present virtuallynegligible risks of lethality on overdose (526). Since suicidal behavior is strongly associated withdepressive illnesses and some forms of anxiety, treatment with antidepressants should plausiblybe associated with reduced suicide rates. However, the available evidence remains surprisinglyinconclusive that any type of antidepressant or antianxiety treatment is associated with lower-ing of risk for suicidal behavior (69, 526, 528-532, 563). Specific types of antidepressants vary greatly in their potential lethality on overdose and rela- tive safety for use by potentially suicidal patients. All tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine ox-idase inhibitors (MAOIs) are potentially lethal on acute overdose (526, 556, 557), contributingto their currently limited clinical use, particularly for potentially suicidal patients. Most newer an-tidepressants, including bupropion, mirtazapine, and nefazodone, and the SRIs have very low le-thality in acute overdose (526). The finding of Kapur et al. (557) that tricyclic antidepressantswere associated with greater rates of suicide than the nontricyclic antidepressants fluoxetine and Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Withthe preferential use of nontricyclic, non-MAOI antidepressants by primary care physicians as wellas psychiatrists (526), antidepressant overdoses are less often associated with suicide than theywere formerly (775, 776), although methods of suicide also may be shifting from overdoses tomore lethal alternatives (735, 777). Coincident with wide clinical acceptance of the safer, nontricyclic, non-MAOI antidepressants since the late 1980s, suicide rates in several countries, regions, or subpopulations have fallen appre-ciably (69, 531, 532, 549, 550), although international average suicide rates have remained rela-tively flat for many years, and rates have risen in some subgroups (69, 529, 775, 778, 779). Evenstable suicide rates, however, may suggest some improvement in suicide prevention in view of theepidemiological evidence of rising incidence (or greater recognition and diagnosis) of major affec-tive illnesses over the past several decades (694, 780, 781). Since multiple studies have suggestedthat many depressed individuals do not receive psychiatric intervention or effective antidepressanttreatment prior to suicide (206, 267, 578, 782-784), further decreases in suicide rates might occuras a result of improved recognition and treatment of depression. Longitudinal follow-up data also suggest that long-term antidepressant treatment is associat- ed with a decreased risk of suicide. Angst et al. (74) followed 406 patients with affective disordersfor 34 to 38 years after an index psychiatric hospitalization and found that standardized mortalityrates for suicide were significantly lower in patients with unipolar depressive disorder as well asin patients with bipolar disorder during long-term treatment with antidepressants alone, with aneuroleptic, or with lithium in combination with antidepressants and/or neuroleptics. This low-ering of suicide mortality was particularly striking in light of the fact that the treated patientswere more severely ill than the patients who did not receive long-term medication therapy. Data from one double-blind placebo-controlled study (785) suggested that suicide attempts may also be reduced by long-term antidepressant treatment. In a 1-year trial in nondepressedindividuals with repeated suicide attempts, paroxetine treatment was associated with a decreasedlikelihood of an additional suicide attempt. Although many of the patients in the study met thecriteria for a cluster B personality disorder, paroxetine was significantly more effective in thosewho met fewer of those criteria. More specific information is available from therapeutic trials of antidepressants in depressed subjects, including data on suicides and serious suicide attempts. These findings were recentlyevaluated in a meta-analysis (533, 562) based on 13 pertinent reports that appeared between 1974and 2000 and had data suitable for analysis (534-546). A majority of the studies (eight of 13) in-volved double-blind designs and random assignment to treatment with a then-experimental orstandard antidepressant, to placebo treatment, or to an untreated comparison condition in a totalof 37 separate treatment arms; several of the studies included pooled data from multiple trials. Atotal of 258,547 patient-subjects were included, with a total of 189,817 person-years of risk ex-posure encompassing short-term efficacy trials as well as reasonably long-term treatment trials.Based on these reports, pooled rates of suicide or suicide attempts by type of treatment suggestedthat antidepressant treatment is associated with a substantial, approximately fourfold lowering ofrisk for suicidal behaviors (533). However, owing mainly to the large variance in outcomes be-tween studies, none of the effects of antidepressants in reducing rates of suicidal behaviors reachedstatistical significance. When comparisons were made among specific types of antidepressants,there was a substantial difference between tricyclic and SRI antidepressants, suggesting the possi-ble superiority of tricyclics, but this effect also failed to reach statistical significance. Using data from studies in the FDA database of controlled clinical trials for antidepressant treatment of depressed patients, Khan et al. (548) used meta-analysis to compare rates of sui-cide in patients treated with SRI antidepressants, non-SRI antidepressants, or placebo andfound no significant differences across treatment groups. This result is consistent with the find-ing from many comparisons and meta-analyses that SRIs and other newer antidepressants have Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

After publication of several case reports suggesting that SRI antidepressants might be asso- ciated with increased risks of aggressive or impulsive acts, including suicide (551-553, 787), anumber of investigators retrospectively analyzed clinical trial data to determine whether ratesof suicide and suicidal behaviors are increased with SRI treatment (533, 537, 548, 554, 555,788). These studies did not show evidence that suicide or suicidal behaviors are increased bytreatment with specific types of antidepressants. Nonetheless, the safe and effective use of an-tidepressant treatment for an increasingly wide range of psychiatric disorders should includedue regard to early adverse reactions to any antidepressant. These reactions may include in-creased anxiety, restless agitation, disturbed sleep, and mixed or psychotic bipolar episodes\u2014all of which represent heightened subjective distress in already disturbed patients that mightincrease the risk of impulsive or aggressive behaviors in some vulnerable individuals. At thesame time, these medications are prescribed in order to treat disorders that may have anxiety,agitation, and suicidality as part of the illness course, making it difficult to distinguish the eti-ology of symptoms that emerge in the course of treatment. The evidence supporting an expected lowering of the risk for suicidal behavior during anti- depressant treatment is limited to findings for patients with a diagnosis of major depression andis, at best, only suggestive. At the same time, existing studies in the literature are limited by theshort-term nature of many trials, the widely varying rates of suicide and suicidal acts across tri-als, inclusion of some patients with probably unrepresentatively high pretreatment suicide risk,and, in other studies, efforts to screen out patients deemed to be at increased suicide risk. None-theless, from a clinical perspective, the strong association between clinical depression and sui-cide and the availability of reasonably effective and very safe antidepressants support the use ofan antidepressant in an adequate dose and for an adequate duration as part of a comprehensiveprogram of care for potentially suicidal patients, including long-term use in patients with re-current forms of depressive or severe anxiety disorders. b) Lithium On the basis of present knowledge about pharmacological interventions and risk of suicidal be-haviors, prophylactic treatment with lithium salts of patients with recurrent major affective dis-orders is supported by the strongest available evidence of major reductions in suicide risk of anycurrently employed psychiatric treatment (528, 559-563, 565, 789). In contrast to antidepres-sants, and similar to clozapine for schizophrenia, lithium typically is used in relatively struc-tured settings, including specialized programs for affective disorders, lithium clinics, andprolonged maintenance therapy. This practice pattern may itself contribute to the reduction ofsuicide risk as a result of close, medically supervised monitoring of long-term treatment. Severaldecades of clinical and research experience with long-term maintenance treatment in recurrentmajor affective disorders encouraged the development of controlled and naturalistic studieswith large numbers of patients given therapeutic dosages of lithium for several years. Studiesreporting on the relationship of lithium treatment and suicide in patients with bipolar disorderand other major affective disorders have consistently found much lower rates of suicide and sui-cide attempts during lithium maintenance treatment than without it (562, 563, 565, 789). A recent meta-analysis of studies of suicide rates with and without long-term lithium main- tenance treatment (563) updated other reviews of this topic (314, 315, 528, 558, 560, 562,564, 565, 700, 790, 791) and found 34 reports for the period from 1970 through 2002 bycomputerized and other literature searching (76, 534, 559, 565-595). These studies included67 treatment arms or conditions (42 with and 25 without lithium treatment). The total numberof patients was 16,221 (corrected for appearance of some subjects in both treatment conditions),and treatment lasted an average of 3.36 years with lithium therapy (N=15,323 subjects, for51,485 person-years of risk-exposure) and 5.88 years without lithium maintenance treatment Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Meta-analysis yielded an overall estimated rate for all suicidal acts (including suicide attempts) from all identified studies of 3.10% per year without lithium treatment, compared to 0.21% peryear with lithium treatment, a 14.8-fold (93.2%) reduction that was highly statistically signifi-cant. Moreover, the finding of lower rates of suicide and suicide attempts was consistently seenin all 25 sets of observations except one, an early study with a small sample size and relatively shorttime of exposure to lithium treatment in which no suicidal acts were observed with or withoutlithium treatment (566). For suicides considered separately, pooled rates were 0.942% per year without lithium treat- ment, compared to 0.174% per year with lithium treatment. The corresponding figures for sui-cide attempts considered separately were 4.65% per year and 0.312% per year, respectively.Thus, long-term lithium treatment was associated with a 5.43-fold reduction in the risk of sui-cide and a 14.9-fold reduction in the risk of suicide attempts (563). The apparent sparing of risk of suicide and suicide attempts was very similar in patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and in those with other recurrent major affective disorders, al-though patients with unipolar depressive disorder were evaluated separately in only two rela-tively small studies involving a total of 121 patients that found a reduction in risk of suicidalacts from 1.33% per year to nil (563, 575). In addition, a comparison of subjects with bipolarI disorder (N=263) and those with bipolar II disorder (N=153) found a somewhat greater spar-ing of suicidal risk in the patients with bipolar II disorder (from 1.70% to 0.305% per year,compared to a reduction from 2.73% to 0.898% per year in bipolar I disorder patients) (563). Despite these striking reductions in risk, it is also important to note that lithium mainte- nance treatment does not provide complete protection against suicide. The overall rate of sui-cide during lithium treatment was 0.174% per year, which was much lower than the untreatedrisk of 0.942% per year but was still 10.5 times higher than the average international rate of0.0166% per year in the general population (700, 792). In contrast, the rate of suicide attemptsduring lithium treatment was very close to the estimated risk for the general population, andthe total pooled rate of all suicidal acts with lithium treatment, remarkably, was 33% lowerthan the estimated general population risk. This striking finding may be plausible in that muchof the risk of suicidal behavior in the general population represents untreated affective illnessand because suicide attempts are far more common than deaths by suicide. In addition, theseobservations may suggest a relatively greater effect of lithium treatment on suicide attemptsthan on suicide, although the variability in relationship to general population risks may alsoreflect variance in the samples available for the analysis of rates of suicide and suicide attempts. These studies have several notable limitations, including a potential lack of control over ran- dom assignment and retention of subjects in some treatment trials, inclusion of some patientswith probably unrepresentatively high pretreatment suicide risk, and the presence in several trialsof potential effects of treatment discontinuation (565), which can contribute to an excess of earlyrecurrence of affective illness (315, 791, 793, 794), with sharply increased suicide risk (315, 700).However, there was no evidence that the time at risk influenced the annualized computed rate ofsuicide or suicide attempts. Finding a reduction of suicide risk during lithium treatment alsomight involve biased self-selection, since patients who remain in any form of maintenance treat-ment for many months are more likely to be tr eatment adherent and conceivably also less likely to become suicidal. However, it is not feasible to evaluate any long-term treatment in nonadher-ent patients. Moreover, several of the reported studies involved either the same persons observedwith and without lithium treatment or random assignment to treatment options, minimizing theeffects of self-selection bias. Results of these studies were consistent with the overall findings ofmarked reductions of risk of suicidal behaviors during lithium treatment (565). If lithium is indeed effective in preventing suicide in broadly defined recurrent major affec- tive syndromes, as it appears to be, it seems likely that this effect operates through reduction of Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

An additional factor may be reduction of impulsivity or of aggressive and hostile behavior withlithium facilitation of the central serotonergic neurotransmission system (226, 366, 526, 795),although this hypothesis is inconsistent with evidence that the antiserotonergic agent clozapinemay reduce suicide risk in schizophrenia (603, 796) and the lack of evidence for a beneficialeffect of SRI antidepressants on suicidal behavior (533, 563). An additional nonspecific butpotentially important benefit of lithium treatment may arise from the supportive, long-termtherapeutic relationships associated with the typically structured and relatively closely medical-ly monitored maintenance treatment of patients with recurrent major mood disorders who arebeing treated with lithium. c) \"Mood-stabilizing\" anticonvulsant agents Evidence for a protective effect against suicide of putative \"mood-stabilizing\" agents other thanlithium is extremely limited. Reports from a long-term collaborative German study that in-volved random assignment of patients with bipolar disorder and schizoaffective disorder to 2years of treatment with either lithium or carbamazepine found no suicidal acts with lithiumbut substantial remaining risk with carbamazepine (592, 597). A recent study by Goodwin etal. (598) analyzed computerized records of 20,878 patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder(60,518 person-years of follow-up) in two major integrated health plans who were treated withlithium, divalproex, or carbamazepine. Approximately 27% of the person-years of to lithium alone, 22% were to carbamazepine or divalproex alone, and 47% had no ex-posure to any of the three medications. After adjustment for potential confounds, includingage, gender, health plan, year of diagnosis, physical illness comorbidity, and use of other psy-chotropic medications, the authors found that the risk of suicide was 2.7 times higher duringtreatment with divalproex or carbamazepine than during treatment with lithium. For suicideattempts, the risk during divalproex or carbamazepine treatment was 1.9 times higher for at-tempts resulting in inpatient care and 1.7 times higher for attempts resulting in emergency de-partment care, compared to risk during lithium treatment. Thus, in patients treated for bipolardisorder, risk for suicide attempts and for suicide was significantly lower during lithium treat-ment than during treatment with carbamazepine or divalproex. No studies have addressed the risks of suicide attempts or suicide during treatment with oth- er proposed mood-stabilizing agents. Given the widespread and growing use of divalproex, la-motrigine, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, and other anticonvulsants, often instead of lithium, it isextremely important to include measures of mortality risk and suicidal behavior in long-termstudies of the effectiveness of these and other potential treatments for bipolar disorder. Suchinformation may eventually allow an approximate ranking of the effectiveness of specific agentsagainst the risk of suicidal behavior. d) Antipsychotic agents First-generation antipsychotic agents such as fluphenazine, thiothixene, and haloperidol arehighly effective in treating delusions and hallucinations. However, it is not known whether orto what extent they may have beneficial effects in limiting suicide risk in psychotic patients. Inthe United States, the annual rate of suicide associated with schizophrenia has not fallen appre-ciably since the introduction of neuroleptics in the late 1950s (599-602), suggesting that first-generation antipsychotics have a limited effect on suicide risk. Some first-generation antipsychotic agents may also have beneficial actions in major affective disorders. Virtually all antipsychotic agents are highly and rapidly effective in mania, and antip-sychotic drugs may also have beneficial effects in some patients with major depression, with orwithout psychotic features (596). While these benefits may reflect nonspecific improvements inagitation, insomnia, and other distressing symptoms rather than specific antidepressant effects,they may nevertheless reduce suicide risk in highly agitated patients, especially those with psy- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

On the other hand, haloperidol and perhaps some other first-generation antipsychotics may worsen depression in patients with chronic psy-chotic disorders as well as in those with major affective disorders, with or without psychotic fea-tures (112, 797). Although not well studied, the potentially distressing adverse effect of akathisiamay actually increase risk of suicidal and other impulsive or violent acts (604, 605). Thus, be-cause of the other advantages of second-generation antipsychotic agents in treating psychotic dis-orders (513) and perhaps manic, mixed, and depressive phases of bipolar disorder (512), use offirst-generation antipsychotics in individuals with suicidal behaviors should generally be reservedfor those needing the enhanced treatment adherence afforded by depot forms of medication. Of all antipsychotics, clozapine is, by far, the best studied for specific beneficial effects on sui- cidal behaviors. As the prototype second-generation antipsychotic agent, clozapine differs fromfirst-generation antipsychotics in several respects, including a markedly lesser propensity to in-duce adverse extrapyramidal neurological effects (596). Clozapine has particular utility in thesubstantial subgroup of patients with schizophrenia who poorly tolerate (798) or do not respondadequately to first-generation agents (799) and perhaps to other antipsychotics (596). In addi-tion, clozapine may have beneficial effects on cognition in psychotic patients (800, 801), can im-prove social and occupational functioning (513), may limit the risk of abusing alcohol and othersubstances (802, 803), and may also decrease impulsive and aggressive behaviors (804-806). Evidence for the effect of clozapine on the risk of suicidal behaviors comes from clinical trials involving patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder as well as from registry stud-ies, which include all patients treated with clozapine regardless of diagnosis. Data from the clo-zapine national registry, for example, indicated a 75%-82% reduction in mortality, which isprimarily attributable to a decrease in suicide risk (608, 609). An additional analysis of these reg-istry data found a 67% reduction in risk for suicide attempts (607). Reduced annual risk of sui-cide was also found in clozapine-treated patients, compared to those given other antipsychoticagents, in the Texas State Mental Health System (609) as well as in the United Kingdom (610). Sernyak et al. (611) used data on patients treated within the VA system and compared all patients over a 4-year period who initiated treatment with clozapine while hospitalized(N=1,415) to a control group of patients with schizophrenia who were matched to the cloza-pine-treated patients by using propensity scoring (N=2,830). Over the follow-up period, thepatients who had been treated with clozapine at the index hospitalization experienced a lowerrate of mortality, due to lower rates of respiratory disorders. However, the rate of suicide didnot differ between the groups, although there was a nonsignificant trend for fewer suicidesamong those treated with clozapine. In addition, since patients were not treated with clozapinethroughout the follow-up period, potential effects of clozapine on suicidality may have beenless pronounced (612, 613). The effects of clozapine on suicidal ideation and suicide attempts relative to patients' own baseline levels of suicidality were first examined in a retrospective study of 88 patients withchronic, neuroleptic-resistant DSM-III-R schizophrenia (N=55) or schizoaffective disorder(N=33) and a duration of illness of 14 years (607). Clozapine monotherapy with a meandaily dose of 500 mg was initiated in the hospital, and suicidality was assessed over a mean fol-low-up period of 3.5 years. At follow-up, improvements in symptoms of depression and hope-lessness were noted, and the percentage of patients with no suicidal thoughts, plans, or attemptshad increased from 53% at baseline to 88% with clozapine treatment. Compared to the 2-yearperiod before initiation of clozapine, there was also a decrease in the relative lethality of suicideattempts and a 12.8-fold decrease in the annualized number of suicide attempts. Other studies have compared clozapine-treated patients to patients treated with first-genera- tion antipsychotics. Glazer and Dickson (807), for example, found a 57% lower risk of suicideattempts among schizophrenia patients treated with clozapine, compared with those treatedwith haloperidol (606). In another study, Spivak et al. (808) compared 30 patients with chronic,treatment-resistant schizophrenia who had been maintained on clozapine for at least 1 year with Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

They found that clozapine treatment was associated with significantreductions in ratings of impulsiveness and aggressiveness, along with fewer suicide attempts. In the International Suicide Prevention T rial (InterSePT), a 2-year, multicenter randomized, controlled study with an open-label design with masked ratings, the effects of clozapine (N=479) were compared to those of olanzapine (N=477) in with DSM-IV schizophrenia(N=609) or schizoaffective disorder (N=371). Only 27% of the patients had an illness that wasrefractory to prior treatment, but all were deemed to be at unusually high risk for suicide, onthe basis of having current suicidal ideation or having made a suicide attempt during the previ-ous 3 years. The prestudy rate of suicide attempts in this group was 21% per year, or about fourtimes that of broader samples of patients with schizophrenia (603, 606, 607). Although onlypatients receiving clozapine had blood drawn to monitor white blood cell counts, all patientswere seen weekly for 6 months, then biweekly for an additional 18 months to minimize bias fromthe clozapine-treated patients' more frequent contact with health care staff. Primary endpoints,determined by blinded raters and certified by a three-member independent, blinded, expert Sui-cide Monitoring Board, included suicide attempts (including those that led to death), hospital-izations to prevent suicide, and a rating of \"much worse suicidality\" compared to baseline.Patients randomly assigned to receive clozapine showed a significantly longer time to a suicideevent as defined previously, with a significant reduction in the rate of all suicidal events. In ad-dition, fewer clozapine-treated patients required hospitalization or other clinical interventionsintended to minimize suicidal behavior or were given an antidepressant or a sedative. The sig-nificant advantage of clozapine was evident in patients with schizoaffective disorder as well asthose with schizophrenia. In addition, patients with more prestudy risk factors showed a rela-tively greater reduction in the rate of suicidal behavior. Furthermore, the greater effectiveness ofclozapine was not due to superiority in treating positive or negative symptoms as rated at end-point. Very few of these high-risk subjects died of suicide during the study (eight of 956[0.837%] within 2 years), and the risk of suicide was nonsignificantly greater with clozapinethan olanzapine (1.044% and 0.629%, respectively). The rate of suicide attempts was signifi-cantly less during clozapine treatment than during olanzapine treatment (7.7% and 13.8%, re-spectively, without correction for exposure times). However, the rate of suicide attempts duringtreatment with olanzapine was approximately half that found among these high-risk patientsbefore the trial, suggesting that olanzapine treatment was associated with some beneficial effectson the risk of suicidal behaviors. Overall, studies of the risk of suicidal behaviors during treatment with clozapine or other antipsychotic agents in chronically psychotic patients have involved nearly 134,000 subjectstreated with clozapine and 123,000 given other antipsychotic agents (809). Although the se-lection of high-risk subjects in the InterSePT study (603) resulted in a great degree of hetero-geneity in the frequencies of suicidal acts across studies, together these results indicatesubstantial superiority of clozapine over other antipsychotic agents in preventing suicidal actsin patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders. For other disorders, such as other-wise treatment-resistant bipolar disorder, no information is available about the effects of clo-zapine on risk of suicidal behaviors. In clinical practice, the evident advantage of clozapine in reducing the rate of suicide at- tempts and perhaps the rate of suicide must be weighed against the risks of death from agran-ulocytosis, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and rare atypical forms of a syndrome similar toneuroleptic malignant syndrome (596). Other potential side effects of clozapine, including sei-zures, weight gain, hyperlipidemia, and type II diabetes, may also adversely affect longevity.Thus, in deciding whether to institute or continue clozapine treatment in patients with psy-chosis who are at risk for suicidal behaviors, the clinician will need to weigh the advantages anddisadvantages of clozapine therapy for the individual patient.

For the InterSePT study, olanzapine was chosen as the comparator because of its use in treating schizophrenia as wellas limited evidence that it might have a superior effect in reducing suicidal behaviors, comparedwith haloperidol (810). There is also some evidence that the second-generation antipsychoticagents, including olanzapine and risperidone, may have mood-elevating or mood-stabilizing ac-tions in addition to the ubiquitous antimanic effects of virtually all antipsychotics (112). Theseobservations have led to the inference that second-generation antipsychotics also may have greaterutility than first-generation agents in minimizing suicidal behaviors (811). Compared to first-generation antipsychotics, the second-generation agents are less likely to be associated with nonadherence that results from extrapyramidal side effects and more likelyto be associated with stable or improved cognition and higher levels of social and occupationalfunctioning (801). Thus, there are general reasons for preferring to use second-generation anti-psychotic drugs rather than first-generation antipsychotic drugs to reduce the risk for suicidein patients with schizophrenia. At the same time, it remains to be shown whether specific sec-ond-generation antipsychotic agents differ from each other or from first-generation antipsy-chotics in relative protective effects against suicidal behavior. e) Antianxiety agents Some patients who die by suicide have symptoms of severe psychic anxiety, panic, agitation, or se-vere insomnia close to the time of the suicidal act (79, 217, 218). Such persons may also abuse al-cohol or other substances, perhaps in an attempt at \"self-medication\" for otherwise intolerablydistressing symptoms. Since antianxiety agents can limit such symptoms, they also hold the possi-bility of reducing short-term suicide risk. Several agents, including benzodiazepines, buspirone, old-er sedatives, many antidepresssants, low doses of some second-generation antipsychotics, and somemood-altering anticonvulsants, may have calming effects in highly anxious and agitated patientsand so might be expected to limit suicide risk. However, research addressing this plausible expecta-tion is limited and inconclusive. No clinical trial has demonstrated short- or long-term effects onsuicidal behavior of any type of antianxiety treatment. However, a recent analysis of data obtainedin controlled trials of treatments for anxiety disorders found no significant differences in rates of sui-cidal behavior between those treated with active agents and those treated with placebo (118). In treating potentially suicidal patients, benzodiazepines are often avoided because of con- cerns about their potential for inducing dependency (812), respiratory depression, or disinhi-bition, as has been observed in some patients with borderline personality disorder or mentalretardation (614, 615, 813-815). Nevertheless, the risk of disinhibition appears small (816).In addition, benzodiazepines can limit psychic distress in depressed patients and improve sleepand may thereby potentiate the clinical benefits of antidepressant therapy (617-619). Whethersuch benefits are associated with reduced suicide risk remains unproved, however. In contrast,removal of a benzodiazepine during treatment may be associated with increased risk of suicidalbehavior (817). Thus, decisions about initiating or continuing benzodiazepines in suicidal pa-tients should consider these risks and benefits as they relate to the individual patient. In summary, it is clinically appropriate to provide treatments aimed at reducing anxiety, psy- chic distress, agitation, and insomnia, regardless of the primary diagnosis, as part of a compre-hensive effort to limit suicide risk, and antianxiety agents may have a useful empirical role insuch situations, when employed with due regard to their risk of disinhibiting impulsive or ag-gressive behavior (219). 2. ECT Prominent suicidality is widely considered a clinical indication for ECT (511, 512, 623). Muchof the rationale for this practice is indirect and based primarily on the established and superiorefficacy of ECT in treating severe depression that is often associated with suicidal ideation and Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

ECT affords a more rapid and robust clinical antidepressant response than psychopharmacological, psychosocial, or other treatments, especially in severe, acute major de-pression, with or without psychotic features (623). Only four studies have directly assessed the short-term effects of ECT on \"suicidality\" de- fined as apparent suicidal thinking. Rich et al. (620) analyzed depression and suicide ratings ina study designed primarily to measure treatment response with increasing numbers of alternate-day, right unilateral ECT. Suicide ratings, based on one item of the Hamilton Depression Rat-ing Scale, improved maximally within 1 week and improved significantly more rapidly thanmeasures of mood or lack of energy or interests. Similarly rapid and robust declines in suicideratings were found in a naturalistic study of depressed patients with medication-resistant bipo-lar disorder who were given ECT with pharmacotherapy (818). Prudic and Sackeim (621) alsofound rapid and marked short-term reductions of suicidality with ECT in 148 depressed pa-tients, reductions that even exceeded those in other Hamilton Depression Rating Scale items,especially, but not only, among the 49% of individuals considered clinically responsive to ECT .In data from a larger sample of 405 ECT-treated depressed patients recently analyzed by Kell-ner et al. (622), 58% of the patients were considered suicidal on the basis of suicidal ideationor suicide plans or attempts. The patients were treated with bitemporal ECT , and after a singletreatment, suicidality was considered to have resolved in one-third of these suicidal patients, intwo-thirds after three treatments, and in 95% by the end of a clinically determined series ofECT treatments (averaging just over seven treatments in the acute course). These studies were limited by reliance on a single item from one rating scale. In addition, examination of the effects of ECT on suicidality was incidental to the primary aims of the stud-ies, and any changes in suicidality associated with ECT were possibly incidental to the antide-pressant effects of ECT. Moreover, no data directly address the effects of ECT on suicidalbehavior or suicide fatalities. Nevertheless, and consistent with impressions arising from clini-cal experience, available studies indicate that acute treatment with ECT is associated with fre-quent and rapid reductions in apparent suicidality, possibly even before major improvementsin other symptoms of depression. As a means of evaluating possible long-term benefits of ECT on suicidal risk, several studies have examined rates of suicide in different treatment eras, before and after the introduction ofECT (and other treatments), with follow-up periods as long as 10 years. A recent meta-analysis,which calculated suicide rates from published literature for patients with mood disorder whowere followed naturalistically for at least 6 months after an index hospitalization, indicated a41% decrease in suicide rates, from 1.33% to 0.770% per year, between the pre-ECT years andlater years when ECT and then antidepressants were in widespread use (819). However, inter-pretation of this information for possible effects of ECT is obscured by uncertain reliability inidentifying persons who died by suicide in different eras and by the effect of multiple therapeu-tic developments across the decades included in the analysis. In an earlier study comparing clinically matched samples of depressed patients from a Mon- roe County, New York, psychiatric case register, Babigian and Guttmacher (820) assessed theeffect of ECT on mortality at 5-year follow-up between 1960 and 1975 for 1,587 patientstreated with ECT and 1,587 who did not receive ECT . The groups did not differ in risk forsuicidal behavior or in overall mortality, but their comparison may be confounded by the se-lection of patients with severe symptoms for treatment with ECT . Additional studies involvingECT were reviewed by Tanney (821), Prudic Sackeim (621), and Sharma (822). Thesestudies were primarily nonrandomized, uncontrolled, retrospective clinical observations fromrelatively small case series. It is not surprising that they also failed to find evidence of enduringeffects on suicide rates after short-term ECT . The available data thus suggest rapid short-term benefits against suicidal thinking but do not provide evidence of a sustained reduction of suicide risk following short-term ECT, despiteits superior effectiveness in severe depression (623).

In short, it remains to be tested wheth-er long-term use of maintenance ECT or short-term ECT followed by long-term antidepres-sant or mood-stabilizing treatment may affect long-term risk of suicidal behavior. /L50776 E. PSYCHOTHERAPIES In addition to pharmacotherapies and ECT, psychotherapies play a central role in the manage-ment of suicidal behavior in clinical practice. Although few rigorous studies have directly ex-amined whether these interventions reduce suicide morbidity or mortality per se, clinicalconsensus suggests that psychosocial interventions and specific psychotherapeutic approachesare beneficial to the suicidal patient. Furthermore, in recent years, studies of psychotherapieshave demonstrated their efficacy in treating disorders such as depression and borderline per-sonality disorder that are associated with increased suicide risk (511, 515, 823-830). The ap-parent superiority of combination treatment with psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy inindividuals with depression also suggests a need for further study of such combination treat-ment in individuals with suicidal behaviors (824, 826-830). Other psychosocial interventionsmay also be of value in treating suicidal patients, particularly given their utility in minimizingsymptoms and risk of relapse in patients with bipolar disorder and patients with schizophrenia(512, 513, 831). 1. Psychodynamic and psychoanalytic psychotherapies In patients with suicidal behaviors, experience with psychodynamically and psychoanalyticallyoriented psychotherapies is extensive and lends support to the use of such approaches in clinicalpractice. Research data on the effects of these therapies in suicidal patients are more limited butsupportive. For example, Bateman and Fonagy (624, 625) randomly assigned 44 patients withborderline personality disorder, diagnosed according to standardized criteria, to either a standardpsychiatric care group or a partially hospitalized group who received individual and group psy-choanalytic psychotherapy for a maximum of 18 months. At the end of the treatment period, aswell as at 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-ups, patients assigned to the psychoanalytically orientedpartial hospitalization group had significantly lower numbers of self-mutilatory acts and weremore likely to have refrained entirely from self-mutilatory behavior in the preceding 6 months.In the partial hospitalization group, similar highly significant reductions were seen in the numberof suicide attempts and in the number of patients who had made a suicide attempt during thefollow-up period. During and after the treatment, parallel persistent improvements were seen inother outcome measures, including fewer inpatient days, reductions in depressive symptoms, andimproved social and interpersonal functioning in the psychoanalytically treated group. These datademonstrate the efficacy of psychoanalytically oriented partial hospital treatment in patients withborderline personality disorder. Further, they show that such treatment can improve factors suchas depression and interpersonal functioning that modify suicide risk and can simultaneously di-minish a range of self-harming and suicidal behaviors. Stevenson and Meares (832) studied a group of 30 poorly functioning outpatients with bor- derline personality disorder and found that twice-weekly psychodynamic therapy resulted insignificant reductions in self-harm behaviors as well as in improved overall outcomes, com-pared to the year preceding treatment. In addition, the 30 patients treated with twice-weeklypsychodynamic therapy also had better outcomes and fewer self-harming behaviors relative toa group of control subjects who received treatment as usual (833). Thus, although limited bysmall samples and lack of random assignment to the control condition, these studies also sug- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Clarkin et al. (834) developed a modified form of psychodynamic treatment called Transfer- ence Focused Psychotherapy and used this approach to treat 23 female patients with a diagnosisof DSM-IV borderline personality disorder. Twice-weekly treatment with Transference FocusedPsychotherapy was associated with significant decreases on measures of suicidality, self-injuriousbehavior, and medical and psychiatric service utilization, relative to baseline levels. In addition,compared to the year preceding treatment, there was a significant decrease in the number of pa-tients who made suicide attempts and in the medical risk and severity of physical injury associatedwith self-harming behaviors. Although again limited by a small sample as well as by the lack of acontrol group, these findings coincide with clinical impressions of benefit to suicidal patientstreated with psychoanalytic and psychodynamic approaches. 2. Cognitive behavior therapy Given the evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy in treating depressionand related symptoms such as hopelessness (511, 825, 835-837), it might be expected to alsobe of benefit in the treatment of suicidal behaviors. Again, however, evidence from randomizedtrials is extremely limited. In a randomized clinical trial involving 20 patients, Salkovskis et al.(628) examined whether individuals at high risk for repeated suicide attempts were more im-proved by treatment as usual or by a cognitive behavior intervention that focused on teachingproblem-solving techniques. At the end of treatment and at follow-up up to 1 year later, thegroup randomly assigned to the problem-solving treatment showed significantly more im-provement than control subjects on ratings of depression, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation,and over 6 months of follow-up, there was some evidence for a decrease in suicide attempts.Although the sample was small, these findings provide some evidence for the benefit of cogni-tive behavior interventions in reducing suicidal ideation and behaviors in patients at high riskfor repeated suicide attempts. 3. Dialectical behavior therapy Dialectical behavior therapy, a psychosocial treatment for borderline personality disorder thatcombines individual psychotherapy with group practice of behavioral skills, has also been stud-ied in a randomized fashion with respect to its effects on self-injurious behaviors. Linehan etal. (522, 838) randomly assigned 39 women who had a history of self-injurious behavior andmet the criteria for borderline personality disorder to 1 year of dialectical behavior therapy ortreatment as usual. During the year of treatment, as well as during the initial 6 months of fol-low-up, the patients treated with dialectical behavior therapy had fewer incidents of self-inju-rious behavior and those that did occur were less medically severe. Functioning, as measuredby the Global Assessment Scale, and social adjustment were also better in the group treatedwith dialectical behavior therapy. After 1 year, the group treated with dialectical behavior ther-apy continued to require significantly fewer psychiatric hospital days, but the benefits of theintervention in reducing the number and severity of suicide attempts were no longer apparent.In a subsequent study, Linehan et al. (523) compared dialectical behavior therapy to treatmentas usual in a group of patients with borderline personality disorder and comorbid substance de-pendence. Patients treated with dialectical behavior therapy had more days of substance absti-nence at follow-up intervals of up to 16 months. In terms of self-harming behaviors, dialecticalbehavior therapy showed no benefits over treatment as usual, although patients in both groupsexperienced reductions in self-injury. An additional prospective study (839) evaluated 24 fe-male patients with borderline personality disorder who were treated with dialectical behaviortherapy in a 3-month inpatient treatment program and continued in outpatient treatment withdialectical behavior therapy. Compared to ratings at the time of hospital admission, a signifi- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Additional evidence for the effects of dialectical behavior therapy in treating women with borderline personality disorder comes from a randomized clinical trial conducted by Verheulet al. (840). In this study, 58 women with borderline personality disorder were assigned to 12months of treatment with either dialectical behavior therapy or treatment as usual. Particularlyin patients with a history of frequent self-mutilation, dialectical behavior therapy was associat-ed with greater reductions in suicidal, self-mutilating, and self-damaging impulsive behaviors,compared to usual treatment. Taken together, the data from these trials suggest the possible utility of dialectical behavior therapy in treating suicidal and self-injurious behaviors in individuals with borderline person-ality disorder. However, the sample sizes in these trials were small, and it is not clear whetherthe patients were representative of those seen in usual clinical practice. Larger samples are alsoneeded to determine whether some patients may be prone to paradoxical increases in self-inju-rious behavior with dialectical behavior therapy (841). Finally, since no data are available onthe utility of dialectical behavior therapy in the treatment of patients with diagnoses other thanborderline personality disorder, further study is needed before recommending dialectical be-havior therapy for routine use in the treatment of individuals with suicidal behaviors. 4. Other psychosocial interventions As noted earlier, psychosocial interventions other than psychotherapies have shown clear efficacyin the treatment of a number of psychiatric disorders. To date, however, randomized clinical tri-als and longitudinal studies of various psychosocial treatments have produced conflicting resultsin individuals at risk for suicidal behaviors. Most interventions have focused on the treatmentof individuals identified at the time of an index suicide attempt. For example, van der Sande etal. (842) compared the clinical efficacy of an intensive psychosocial intervention with treatmentas usual in 274 randomly assigned individuals who presented for medical treatment after at-tempting suicide. At 12-month follow-up, the authors found no difference in the number of re-peat suicide attempts in patients receiving treatment as usual, compared to those given intensivepsychosocial treatment, which consisted of brief admission to a crisis-intervention unit andproblem-solving aftercare. In contrast, in a randomized trial that compared brief psychologicaltreatment to treatment as usual in 119 individuals seen in an emergency department for self-poisoning, Guthrie et al. (843) found significant decreases in suicidal ideation and in additionalself-harm. Also, in a study of 120 suicide attempters, Welu (844) found a statistically significantreduction in suicide attempts in those who were randomly assigned to a 4-month follow-up out-reach program, compared with those randomly assigned to receive treatment as usual. The three studies just described (842-844) were included in an extensive review and meta- analysis of randomized clinical trials of psychosocial interventions for the treatment of patientswith deliberate self-harm by Hawton et al. (627, 633). The interventions considered in themeta-analysis were diverse and included problem-solving therapy, dialectical behavior therapy,home-based family therapy, provision of an emergency card to quickly gain access to care, andintensive intervention plus outreach. While promising results were noted for problem-solvingtherapy and provision of an emergency card, as well as for dialectical behavior therapy, the sam-ple sizes were too small and the studies too underpowered to detect clinically significant differ-ences in effects on repetition of deliberate self-harm. Thus, a number of psychosocialinterventions have been targeted to individuals who have made suicide attempts or engaged inother self-harming behaviors; however, current evidence from randomized clinical trials is toolimited to support reliable conclusions about the efficacy of these approaches in individualswith suicidal behaviors. In addition to specifically targeting suicidal behaviors, psychosocial interventions may indirect- ly decrease rates of suicide attempts by enhancing the treatment of the patient's underlying diag- Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

(595) treated 175 patients with bipolar I disorder for a 2-year period using primarily lithium pharmacotherapy and either psychotherapy specific to bipolar disorder, whichincluded help in regularizing daily routines, or nonspecific intensive clinical management involv-ing regular visits with empathic clinicians. Before patients entered the trial, the rate of suicide at-tempts was 1.05 per 100 person-months. During the acute treatment phase, patients experienceda threefold reduction in the rate of suicide attempts, with a 17.5-fold reduction during mainte-nance treatment, suggesting that treatment in a maximally supportive environment could signifi-cantly reduce suicidal behaviors in high-risk patients with bipolar disorder. During the follow-upperiod, fewer suicide attempts occurred in patients treated with psychotherapy specific to bipolardisorder; however, because of the low numbers of suicide attempts during treatment, it was notpossible to determine whether the two psychosocial interventions were statistically different in theireffectiveness. Nonetheless, these findings suggest that combinations of psychosocial interventionsand pharmacotherapy offer promise in diminishing risk of suicidal behaviors in at-risk individuals. PART C: FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS In assessing and caring for patients with suicidal ideas and behaviors, multiple questions remainto be answered and would benefit from additional research. These future research directionscan be divided into three major categories: delineating the neurobiological underpinnings ofsuicide and other suicidal behaviors, more precisely defining the factors that affect short-termand longer-term risk for suicide and other suicidal behaviors, and determining the most effec-tive interventions for diminishing such risks. In terms of the underlying neurobiology of suicide and other suicidal behaviors, a great deal of work has already focused on the role of the serotonergic neurotransmitter system in suicideattempts and in suicide (366). Additional research has suggested an association between suicideand hyperactivity of the HPA axis (757, 845), while still other work has suggested a correlationbetween suicidal behaviors and serum cholesterol levels (758, 759, 846). In keeping with theremarkable recent advances in molecular genetics, there has also been intense interest in seekingassociations between candidate genes (primarily relating to serotonergic function) and suiciderisk. Although polygenic inheritance is suspected, a specific genetic model for suicidal behav-iors remains elusive (17, 368). Furthermore, while the biological markers described earlier arepotentially useful in understanding the biological underpinnings of suicidal behaviors, noneare sufficiently sensitive or specific enough to recommend their use in routine screening or inclinical practice. Additional work is clearly needed to identify specific genes, biological mark-ers, or imaging findings that are indicative of a particularly high risk for suicide or suicidal be-haviors. Availability of such markers would allow at-risk individuals to be identified and treatedmore readily, presumably decreasing their risk for suicide. In addition, identification of morehomogenous groups of at-risk individuals might permit more precise targeting of treatmentsto address underlying neurobiological abnormalities. Many studies have already examined particular risk and protective factors for suicide and suicidal behaviors; however, more information is needed. Specifically, future research shouldfocus on determining factors that are associated with modifying short-term risk (days toweeks), compared with intermediate-term risk (weeks to months) or longer-term or lifetimerisks. In addition to strengthening the existing evidence base on the multiple factors alreadyreviewed, future research should also address the effects of multiple co-occurring risk factors as Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

For example, studies of the relationship between physical illness and suicide areneeded to determine the contributions of social and psychological factors to suicide in patientswith physical illnesses. Similarly, with increased rates of suicide in specific occupational groups,more research is needed to determine whether suicide risk relates to preexisting factors such aspsychiatric illness or to specific occupational stressors and/or characteristics such as access tolethal methods. In addition, data for individuals who die from suicide should be clearly distin-guished and analyzed separately from data for individuals exhibiting other suicidal behaviors,since the two groups almost certainly constitute distinct although overlapping populations.Furthermore, given the low population rates of suicide and other suicidal behaviors, all studiesof risk factors will need to have adequate statistical power in order to draw meaningful conclu-sions from their results. The ultimate goals of these avenues of research would include an im-proved ability to estimate suicidal risk in the clinical context. Such findings may also permitdevelopment of a reliable scale for suicide assessment that would have greater positive predic-tive value and might be usable for clinical screening of at-risk individuals at the initiation oftreatment or for ongoing assessments of risk during treatment. Rather than simply identifying associations between suicide and static risk factors such as de- mographic variables, research should have the specific goal of identifying factors that may be mod-ifiable with interventions. In addition, future research should provide information on rates ofsuicide and other suicidal behaviors in clinically important subgroups of at-risk individuals thatcould serve as a baseline for studies of specific interventions to decrease risk. Although most effortsin the past have been aimed at decreasing the effects of suicide risk factors, research should also de-velop approaches to increase the effects of factors that protect against suicide. Finally, an improvedunderstanding of risk factors for suicidal behaviors may suggest selective or population-based ap-proaches to suicide prevention that could then be subjected to empirical testing. In terms of treatment, studies with lithium and with clozapine have clearly demonstrated that interventions are capable of reducing the likelihood of suicide and of other suicidal behav-iors. Additional research with these agents should focus on delineating factors such as serumlevels that may correlate with improved response and on defining the patient populations inwhich these medications are most likely to be effective (e.g., patients grouped by diagnoses anddiagnostic subtypes, associated clinical symptoms, treatment histories, and estimated level ofsuicide risk). Clinical trials are also needed to determine whether similar benefits are seen withother second-generation antipsychotic medications and topiramate). Pharmacoepidemio-logic studies may provide additional information to complement the results of clinical trials. With ECT , it remains to be tested whether long-term reduction of suicide or other suicidal behaviors can be accomplished by long-term use of maintenance ECT or by an acute course ofECT followed by long-term antidepressant or mood-stabilizing treatment. If other somatictreatments such as transcranial magnetic stimulation or vagal nerve stimulation continue toshow promise in the treatment of depressive and/or psychotic disorders, their ability to affectthe risk for suicide and other suicidal behaviors should also be examined. Clinical trials with psychotherapy should not only examine the effects of specific psycho- therapeutic approaches in reducing the rate of suicide and other suicidal behaviors but shouldalso aim to identify specific aspects of those psychotherapeutic approaches that are associatedwith beneficial outcomes. Additional studies should compare combined treatment with psy-chotherapy and pharmacotherapy to treatment with either form of therapy alone. Studies inclinically important patient subgroups, such as those with chronic suicidality or with comorbidphysical diagnoses or substance use, are also essential. The effects of other interventions should also be examined, including comparisons of ap- proaches such as hospitalization that have been inadequately tested but are assumed to be \"bestpractice.\" Given the frequent use of suicide prevention contracts in clinical practice, their safety Copyright 2010, American Psychiatric Association.

Other possible interventions might be designed to improve treatment adherence, con-tinuity of care, or access to emergency services. When designing studies of pharmacotherapies, psychotherapies, and other interventions, consideration should be given to targeting particular factors or time periods that are associatedwith increased risk (e.g., immediately after hospital discharge or after a serious interpersonalloss). As with studies of specific risk factors, intervention studies should have adequate statisti-cal power. They should clearly distinguish between effects on suicide and effects on other sui-cidal behaviors and should also be designed to give information about treatment effects overspecific time periods of risk (e.g., immediate versus lifetime). In addition, they should attemptto determine whether effects on suicidal behaviors occur as a result of or are independent fromeffects of treatments on associated psychiatric disorders. Finally, they should establish the du-ration and intensity of treatment that produce optimal benefits to suicidal patients. INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT SUBMITTED COMMENTS Aaron T .
