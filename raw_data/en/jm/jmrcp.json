(FDIHB) SUBJECT: Influenza Vaccine and Healthcare Personnel REFERENCE #: CDC, APIC 2010 : Section 5 Employee Health PAGE: 1 OF: 2 DEPARTMENT: Employee Health EFFECTIVE DATE: January 25, 2013 POLICY TYPE: Hospital Wide REVISION DATE: APPROVED BY: FDIHB Board of Directors I. Purpose: To decrease the risk of transmission of influenza. II. Policy: Persons with mild (subclinical) or moderate to severe influenza can transmit influenza virus to persons at high- risk for complications from influenza (immunocompromised, elderly, children at risk). Vaccination of healthcare workers (HCWs) has been associated with decreased deaths from influenza among some patients. Transmission via large-particle droplets requires close contact between source and recipient persons, because droplets generally travel only short distances (approximately 6 feet or less) through the air. Indirect contact transmission via hand transfer of influenza virus from virus-contaminated surfaces or objects to mucosal surfaces of the face (e.g., nose, mouth) may also occur. Airborne transmission via small particle aerosols in the vicinity of the infectious individual may also occur. Preventing transmission of influenza virus and other infectious agents within healthcare settings requires a multi-faceted approach. Spread of influenza virus can occur among patients, HC Ws, and visitors; in addition, HC Ws may acquire influenza from persons in their household or community. The core prevention strategies include: A. Administration of influenza vaccine B. Implementation of respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette C. Appropriate management of ill HC Ws D. Adherence to infection control precautions for all patient-care activities and aerosol -generating procedures E. Implementing environmental and engineering infection control measures. Influenza Vaccine and Healthcare Personnel Page 2 of 3 III. Procedure: A. Annual education and vaccine campaigns should be enacted to encourage influenza vaccination of healthcare workers, especially those caring for high -risk patients. B. The facility will educate staff and licensed independent practitioners about the following: 1. Influenza vaccination 2. Non-vaccine control measures (such as use of appropriate precautions) 3. The diagnosis, transmission, a nd potential impact of influenza C. The facility will evaluat e annually the vaccination rates and reasons for non - participation in the immunization program. D. The facility will enhance the program to increase employee participation. E. Employees refusing the influenza vaccination will complete a declination form and must wear a mask throughout flu season when entering any patient care area. F. Any employee experiencing influenza -like symptoms should wear a surgical mask and exercise proper respiratory, cough and hand hygiene etiquette. G. Compliance with this influenza policy i s a condition of employment. H. Employees violating this policy are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination.
