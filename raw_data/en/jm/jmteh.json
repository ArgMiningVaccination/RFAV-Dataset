John Hogenesch, PhD, Director, Center for Chronobiology at Cincinnati Children's, led a team of several collaborators on two recent studies that significantly advance the science of circadian medicine. The work involved col - laborators from several divisions at Cincinnati Children's, as well as experts at Vanderbilt, the University of Pennsylvania and Procter & Gamble. Marc Ruben, PhD, was first author for findings published Sept. 12, 2018, in Science Translational Medicine , that found a surpris - ing number of genes affected by circadian rhythms. The team developed the CYCLOPS algorithm (CYCLic Ordering by Periodic Struc - ture) to analyze thousands of human tissue samples to measure the timing of gene-to- tissue interactions in 13 tissue types. OUR BODIES HAVE MANY CLOCKS \"We identified rhythms in gene expression across the body in a large and diverse group of people,\" Hogenesch says. \"It doesn't matter if you're male, female, young or old, or what your ethnicity is, your body's internal clock regulates half your genome.\" Says Ruben, \"Overall this connects thou - sands of different drugs, both approved and experimental, to nearly 1,000 cycling genes.\" Many of these genes code for proteins that help transport or metabolize drugs are themselves drug targets\u2014including genes with well-known connections to the cardiovascular system. THE ULTIMATE 'WEARABLE'? Next, first author Gang Wu, PhD, and col - leagues published findings Oct. 30, 2018, in PNAS , concluding that a number of cycling genes in the skin function are more effective biomarkers for measuring an individual's par - ticular internal clock than current methods based on genes found in the blood. This study included NIH funding and other sources. Criti - cal data was provided by Procter & Gamble, which also paid for the clinical work involved. \"We showed that human epidermis has a stronger clock than blood and developed a panel of biomarkers that can phase individuals to within three hours from a single sample,\" the authors wrote. The researchers emphasize that addi - tional studies are needed before the findings can be applied to clinical practice. But the findings suggest that a practical method may soon become available to allow doctors to instruct patients more precisely on when to take medications at peak times for maximum effectiveness, or at trough times to minimize side effect risks. Is Now the Time for Circadian Medicine? Left: This heat map of clock gene expression in skin from 239 donors shows robust population-based clock function in humans.

John Hogenesch, PhD Marc Ruben, PhD Gang Wu, PhD Healthcare providers now have consistent, evidence- based guidance for diagnosing and managing mild traumatic brain injury, or concussion. Shari Wade, PhD, Director of Research, Division of Re - habilitation Medicine, was one of the clinical experts who worked with the Centers for Disease Control and Preven - tion (CDC) to develop 19 clinical recommendations that cover diagnosis, prognosis, management and treatment. The guidelines were published Sept. 4, 2018, in JAMA Pediatrics . The recommendations include several key, practice- changing guidelines, says Wade, including identifying risk factors that might contribute to slower recovery; advice on avoiding routine neuroimaging for diagnosis; and optimizing recovery by allowing children to return to non-sports activi - ties within days, rather than weeks, of injury. The CDC followed a rigorous process guided by the American Academy of Neurology, and the 2010 National Academy of Sciences' methodologies for developing evi - dence-based guidelines. The guideline authors also reviewed 25 years of scientific research.Evidence-based Guidelines Emerge for Concussion Shari Wade, PhDThe experimental drug CASIN improved the harvest of donor blood stem cells and lessened toxicity in transplant recipients, according to two preclinical studies led by our researchers, both recently published in Leukemia . Both studies were led by senior investigator Yi Zheng, PhD, and a team of experts at the Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute. In June 2018, Zheng's team reported using CASIN to mimic the action of the gene Cdc42 , which helps regulate blood stem cells. Tests showed that CASIN effectively mobilized blood- making stem cells and promoted their exit from the bone marrow. The harvested stem cells also were hardier following transplant than cells harvested with current clinical regimens. Then in September 2018, researchers used CASIN to make the mouse bone marrow more receptive to healthy blood stem cells, lessening the chemotherapy needed prior to transplant. The researchers caution the procedure remains in preclini - cal testing and results from such studies may not translate to human patients.Improving the Odds of Bone Marrow Transplants A donor stem cell harvested from a mouse treated with CASIN (bottom) is depolar - ized and shows several colorized polarity markers. This cell has better mobilization potential than the untreated stem cell in the top image. -CASIN +CASIN 2 RESEARCH HORIZONS / SPRING 2019 CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 3Researchers here have grown a human esophageal organoid entirely from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Scientists in our Center for Stem Cell and Organoid Medicine (CuSTOM) reported the breakthrough Sept. 20, 2018, in Cell Stem Cell . This is the first success at growing human esophageal tissue entirely from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), which can form any tissue type in the body. The latest advance follows previous successes at using PSCs to bioengineer human intestine, stomach, colon and liver organoids. The long-term goal: develop all the organoids needed to create an entire human gastrointestinal system on a chip. \"In addition to being a new model to study birth defects like esopha - geal atresia, the organoids can be used to study diseases like eosinophilic esophagitis and Barrett's metaplasia, or to bioengineer genetically matched esophageal tissue for individual patients,\" says lead investigator Jim Wells, PhD. Many esophageal conditions need better treatments, be they congenital defects like esophageal atresia or conditions that appear later in life such as esophageal cancer, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or achalasia, a rare disease that prevents the esophageal muscle contractions needed to pass food. All of these conditions need more precise understanding of the genetic and biochemical mechanisms causing them. The ability to grow organoids based on a person's own cells provides a powerful opportunity for finding such causes\u2014and targeting treatments accordingly. The CuSTOM center, launched in November 2017, will continue its efforts to develop organoids and investigate their therapeutic potential.This outstanding image of the new organoid also appeared online in National Geographic.Scientists Grow First Human Esophagus in Lab Deleting an RNA-Silencing Protein Speaks Volumes About Obesity Researchers here say that blocking an RNA-silencing protein in the livers of mice keeps the animals from getting fat and developing diabetic conditions. Findings appeared Sept. 10, 2018, in Nature Communications . Takahisa Nakamura, PhD, and colleagues genetically deleted a protein called Argonaute 2 (Ago2) from the livers of mice. Ago2 slows energy metabolism and the liver's ability to process a high-fat diet. When the scientists deleted the protein, it stabilized energy metabolism, staved off obesity and prevented the mice from developing diabetes and fatty liver disease. \"Although this is still basic science, our findings may have important translational implications for metabolic disorders like diabetes, fatty liver diseases, and other obesity-associated illnesses,\" says Nakamura, a member of the Division of Endocrinology. \"This allows us to explore the potential of finding a novel therapeutic approach that alters energy balance in obesity and modulates the associated diseases.\" Takahisa Nakamura, PhDFindings Explain Gene's Role in Autism Scientists here have clarified how mutations in the gene CHD8 harm the brain and contribute to autism spectrum disorders. They reported their findings June 18, 2018, in Developmental Cell. Previous studies had linked CHD8 mutations to autism and abnormalities in the brain's white matter, but the underlying biol - ogy has been a mystery. This study showed that disruption of CHD8 hinders production and maintenance of nerve insulation, harming the brain's neuro - nal connections and contributing to white matter damage. Mice engineered to lack CHD8 protein in the oligodendrocytes\u2014cells that produce the protective nerve sheath\u2014exhibited behavioral anomalies and seizures, according to lead investigator Q. Richard Lu, PhD, Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology. Although study results are early, Lu says the work could lead to treatments that restore function to faulty CHD8 -dependent processes. This micrograph shows the presence of basic myelin protein and normal oligodendrocyte cell differentiation in the brain of a mouse. The cells form a protective sheath of insulation around nerves in the outer layers of the brain. When a Cancer Suppressor Becomes a Driver The protein AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) is best known as a cancer suppressor. But in a study published online June 18, 2018, in Nature Cell Biology, scientists here report that the protein actually drives growth of certain deadly brain cancers. \"AMPK is considered to play a suppressive role in cancer because it inhibits cancer-promoting enzymes like mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) carboxylase (ACC),\" says senior PhD, who collaborated with first author Rishi Raj Chhipa, PhD, and others. \"Our study uses analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas to show that AMPK proteins are expressed in lethal human glioblastoma, and inhibiting AMPK by genetic means shrinks brain tumors and prolongs survival in mice.\" The researchers say they hope the study will en - courage pharmaceutical companies to search for AMPK inhibitors. This micrograph shows the AMPK target protein (stained green) in a glioblastoma grown from transplanted human cancer cells in a mouse brain. Inhibiting the protein slowed tumor growth, suggesting a potential treatment for humans. 4 RESEARCH HORIZONS / SPRING 2019 CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 5In 2004, Cincinnati Children's physician-scientist Michael Jordan, MD, led a study in mice that identified what appeared to be molecular drivers of the mysterious and fatal immune disorder hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). That discovery led Jordan and a corps of parents, advocates and fellow researchers on a nearly 15-year journey to the first approved treatment specifically for HLH. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave the drug, Gamifant (emapalumab-IZsg), the green light in November, 2018. Jordan calls the approval \"amazing.\" \"My goal for our work over all these years has been to use scientific exploration and practical medical approaches to make a difference in the lives of these children,\" he says. \"It's been a privilege to help develop this idea from an unexpected laboratory discovery to an approved medicine.\" Jordan's 2004 mouse study, published in the journal Blood , showed that elevated levels of the protein interferon gamma (IFNg) are essential to the HLH disease process. Gamifant, made by Sweden-based Sobi, specifically targets and blocks IFNg. Reaching this point included patient families and advocacy groups working closely with Jordan and colleagues at Cincinnati Children's HLH Center of Excellence. Fundraising efforts included more than $1 million raised in seven annual \"700 Miles to Hope\" marathon bicycle rides from Jackson, MS, to Cincinnati.15-Year Research Journey Leads to FDA Approval of Drug for Deadly HLH Michael Jordan, MD An epigenetic signature in patients' intestinal epithelial cells may predict inflammation risk in Crohn's disease, according to new research led by Theresa Alenghat, VMD, PhD, Division of Im - munology. The findings, published Sept. 20, 2018, in JCI Insights , provide more evidence of the close links between chronic inflammatory diseases and our intestinal microbiota. \"This study suggests that the microbiome triggers epigenetic change that could make some individuals more prone to intestinal inflammation,\" Alenghat says. \"Each person's microbiome is driven by genetics as well as external environ - mental factors, such as food, where we live, pets, mom's microbiome, etc.\" The research team studied mice and intesti - nal epithelial cells from newly diagnosed inflam - matory bowel disease patients. They found strong correlations between S100A8 expression\u2014a gene linked to the severity of disease\u2014and levels of the histone H3-lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) found in microbiota-sensitive genes. These alterations in histone levels affected path - ways involving immunoregulation, cell survival and signaling, and metabolism. These previously unrecognized pathways may offer new molecular targets for IBD diagnosis and therapy. Next steps include developing intes - tinal organoids to further study these pathways in functional human tissue.Emerging Pathway for Predicting the Severity of Crohn's Disease Above: This confocal microscopic image shows epithelial cells lining the intestine of a mouse.

But an Oct. 23, 2018, study in Nature Communications , led by scientists here, highlights a potential limitation. Immunotherapies work by disabling the molecular cloaking abilities cancer cells use to evade the body's immune system. Removing these abilities allows immune cells to attack the cancer and helps make che - motherapy and other treatments more effective. However, a study led by Kakajan Komurov, PhD, and colleagues in the Cancer and Blood Diseases Institute discovered that kidney cell carcinoma, metastatic melanoma and some other cancers have tran - scription elongation defects. This defective genetic process impairs pro-inflammatory response in the cancer cells, which in turn limits the effectiveness of immunotherapies that rely on pro-inflammatory signals. Although the study points to some potential limitations for immu - notherapy, the findings suggest it also may be possible to test cancer patients to determine whether they are candidates for immunotherapies.In Some Cancers Flawed Gene Translation Can Hinder Immunotherapy Kakajan Komurov, PhDInserting just enough human DNA into mice allowed research - ers to study an important contributor to the problem of human preterm birth. In September 2018, scientists in our Perinatal Institute and the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine reported in PLoS Biology that they hope to discover what controls expression of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the placenta. CRH expression is linked to birth timing. The precise biology of preterm birth in humans has been dif - ficult to study in animal models. Having transgenic mice with the human DNA to express CRH in the placenta should help researchers learn about how CRH works, says senior investigator Louis Muglia, MD, PhD. Muglia and his team plan to explore whether manipulating placental CRH levels can alter the timing of birth. Transgenic mouse models that mimic key aspects of human pregnancy also should help researchers learn more about how epigenetics affect birth timing. Louis Muglia, MD, PhDHuman DNA in Mice Sheds Light on Causes of Preterm Birth Common Genetic Variant Found for Fatal Lung Condition PAH Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disorder caused by blockage of the pulmonary arteries, resulting in heart failure and premature death. Treatments have advanced in recent years, but PAH remains a devastating disorder. Now, an international team of scientists that included investiga - tors from Cincinnati Children's has advanced our understanding of PAH genetics through genome-wide association studies that analyzed data from 11,744 people of European decent. The study, published in Lancet Respiratory Medicine , is the larg - est genetic analysis to date for PAH. It reports that PAH is associated with two genes, SOX17 and HLA-DPA1/DPB1 . Although many genes with rare variants have already been identified in PAH, this the first study identifying common variants in a large population of patients. \"This is the first finding of common variation associated with PAH and all of the U.S. patients in the study are enrolled in the National Biological Sample and Data Repository for PAH at Cincinnati Chil - dren's,\" says William Nichols, PhD, Director of the PAH biobank here and a senior investigator on the study. \"The biobank is the world's largest sample and genetic data repository in the world for patients with this disease.\" Michael Pauciulo, MBA, Division of Human Genetics, was a co- first author on the study. A study published in Lancet Respiratory Medicine shows an association between the lung disease HLA and the genes SOX17 and HLA-DPA1/DPB1. Statins Effective in Treating Lung Disease PAP Cholesterol-busting statins can effectively treat pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), a disease that causes air sacs in the lungs to clog with surfactant, according to new research led by Bruce Trapnell, MD, Director of our Translational Pulmonary Sci - ence Center. Years ago, Trapnell and colleagues showed that PAP is linked to disrupted cell regulation by the molecule granulocyte-mac - rophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). On Aug. 7, 2018, Trapnell and first author Cormac McCarthy, MD, PhD, reported in Nature Communications that the disruptions caused by GM- CSF reduce the ability of macrophages to process and clear out cholesterol. This contributes to the accumulation of surfactant that causes PAP and hinders breathing. The discovery \"will change thinking in the PAP field,\" Trapnell says. \"Now that we know cholesterol in macrophages is a target for therapeutic development, repurposing statins is a straightfor - ward pharmacological approach for treating people with PAP.\" The findings are expected to lead to a larger clinical trial to test statin therapy. This micrograph shows alveolar macrophages from the lung of a patient with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). The red in the macrophage cells indicates an excess accumulation of cholesterol. 8 RESEARCH HORIZONS / SPRING 2019 CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 9Two Weapons Poised for Progress Against Sickle Cell Disease Experts at Cincinnati Children's are advancing two powerful projects that could sharply reduce the harm caused by sickle cell disease: one that could accelerate the use of a life-saving, low-cost treatment in Africa, and another to evaluate a potential gene therapy that could someday reverse the disease. Reaching Out to Africa Sickle cell disease affects more than 90,000 people in the United States, but it affects millions more in sub-Saharan Africa. In a groundbreaking study published online in December, 2018, by The New England Journal of Medicine , researchers report that daily hydroxyurea pills reduced rates of sickle cell pain by an average of 55 percent, infections by 38 percent, malaria by 51 percent, transfusions by 67 percent, and deaths by 70 percent. The findings come from the REACH multinational clinical trial, in which more than 600 African children in four nations took hydroxyurea daily for six months. \"Hydroxyurea was safe and offered many benefits to these young patients, including improved anemia, fewer sickle cell pain events, less malaria, and better survival,\" says Russell Ware, MD, PhD, the study's senior investigator. Now, Cincinnati Children's is working with the National Institutes of Health and partner organizations in Africa to con - tinue the work to expand access to this low-cost therapy while monitoring longer-term outcomes. Early Clinical Data for Gene Therapy Shows Promise In December 2018, Punam Malik, MD, presented preliminary data from a Phase 1-2 clinical trial involving a gene therapy that has been under development at Cincinnati Children's for more than a decade. The therapy uses a modified lentivirus to carry a healthy fetal hemoglobin gene into a patient's blood stem cells. \"One year after treatment of our first patient, and six months after treatment of our second patient, both have seen a re - markable improvement in the quality of life due to remarkable reduction in disease symptoms. This includes near elimination of chronic pain and sickling events and improved anemia,\" Malik said at the American Society of Hematology's (ASH) annual meeting in San Diego. \"Although it's still early post-treatment, these preliminary results are quite promising.\" While other research teams also are developing gene therapies for sickle cell disease, this approach requires a less intense pre-treatment conditioning regimen, which could make the therapy more practical for hospitals in developing nations. Cincinnati Children's also recently partnered with Roivant Sciences to create Aruvant Sciences, a joint venture that will work to accelerate the therapy's development.As the Ebola virus continues to cause deadly outbreaks in other nations, a Phase 1 clinical trial has started here to test a combination vaccine that researchers hope will help protect first responders and others who encounter infected people. Cincinnati Children's has a long history of vaccine research, from developing the Sabin oral polio vaccine in the 1950s to more recent advances against rotovirus, norovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. Cincinnati Children's also evaluates annual flu vaccines and others as one of nine Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Units funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), \"Researchers are looking for new ways to stop these outbreaks and to treat people who become infected and develop Ebola virus disease. The development of preventive vaccines for Ebola is a top global public health priority,\" said Paul Spearman, MD, lead investigator and Director of the Division of Infectious Diseases. Laboratory evaluations will be led by Karnail Singh, PhD, an Ebola expert here. The clinical trial is recruiting up to 60 healthy volunteers to determine immune response to a combination of two vaccines; the ChAd3-EBO-Z vaccine and the MVA-BN\u00ae-Filo vaccine. Participants will be followed for six months. For more information, visit ClinicalTrials.gov or use the identifier NCT03583606. To enroll, follow this link or call 513-636-7699. The new Pediatric Asthma Risk Score (PARS) outperforms the current gold standard and 29 other methods as a tool for predicting which children with signs of allergy face elevated risk of developing asthma, according to data published online in December 2018 in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Im - munology . \"PARS is superior to the Asthma Predictive Index (API) in its ability to predict asthma in children with mild to moderate asthma risk, with an 11 percent increase in sensitivity,\" says Gurjit Khurana Hershey, MD, PhD, director of Asthma Research at Cincinnati Children's and senior author of the study. \"Children with mild to moderate risk may be the most likely asthma pa - tients to respond favorably to prevention strategies.\" The study found that the API missed 43 percent of asthmatic children identified by PARS as mild to moderate risk. PARS and the API equally predicted asthma risk for children with the most risk factors. A notable achievement of the PARS over the API is that it delivers a personalized asthma risk score to the patient. While useful for predicting which children will not develop asthma, the API test \"leaves much room for improvement in terms of identifying children who will,\" says Jocelyn Biagini Myers, PhD, lead author of the study. The PARS tool is available for download at no cost. A PARS web application, which provides fast and easy calculation, is accessible here. Apps also are being developed for the iPhone and for Android phones.The REACH clinical trial (Realizing Effectiveness Across Continents with Hydroxyurea) involved more than 600 children in four nations. Co-investigator Leon Tshilolo, MD, PhD, Centre Hospitalier Monkole, said the project lived up to its name.

This fragmentation has allowed researchers and clinicians to concentrate on different functions controlled by the brain\u2014movement, cognition, emotion, mental health, behavior, and so on. However, this narrow approach has tended to limit the power of discovery. Now leaders at Cincinnati Children's are building new con - nections and deeper collaborations across disciplines with its Mind Brain Behavior collaborative (MBB), launched internally in 2017. The mission: to serve as a catalyst for transforming our research and clinical care models with the goal of helping all children with behavioral, mental health and neurological condi - tions reach their optimal quality of life. \"This has been needed for a long time,\" says Tracy Glauser, MD, Associate Director, Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation. \"Our research and care delivery systems continue to fragment into more and more subspecializations as we break topics down into smaller units that we can better understand. But if we hope to make transformational advances, we need to put the parts back together and look at the brain more holistically.\" REDUCING BARRIERS TO INNOVATION The concept of a Mind Brain Behavior initiative took shape as dozens of leaders at Cincinnati Children's joined initial work - ing groups co-chaired by Margaret Hostetter, MD, Research Foundation Director and Chair of Pediatrics, and Brian Coley, MD, Radiologist-in-Chief. Some groups focused on the clinical side, looking for ways to drive adoption of best practices and to streamline overlap - ping lines of care. Other groups focused on research\u2014basic and translational. \"Ultimately, we don't want to just improve treatment of disease. We want to get to health and wellness. The only way to get there is to bring all these disciplines back together again.\" 12 RESEARCH HORIZONS / SPRING 2019 CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 13Glauser and Lori Stark, PhD, Director, Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, were chosen to co-direct the MBB initiative. Their goals include building a larger community of brain-focused researchers, recruiting new faculty in selected fields, assessing infrastructure needs and accelerating innova - tion, and building integrated models of clinical care. Much of this work will continue for months and years to come, but several initiatives are underway. A team led by Steve Danzer, PhD, has launched the Center for Pediatric Neuroscience to provide a \"virtual home\" for basic scientists working on MBB projects across divisions. (See story on page 16.) Another team led by Susmita Kashikar-Zuck, PhD, is building the Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science to focus on later stages of the research pipeline. (See story on page 20.) An internal application and funding process also has begun to support pilot projects in these areas through the Research Innovation Pilot Funding Program. \"We believe investing in infrastructure and key recruits will speed discovery,\" Stark says. \"We believe that building alignment and synergy across basic and translational research will help drive improvement in clinical areas.\" CLINICAL FOCUS ON NEW MODELS OF CARE Clinically, MBB is re-shaping multidisciplinary teams to bring new models of care to more patients, starting with traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy, and mental health. Mental health is a particularly challenging area. The National Alliance on Mental Illness estimates that one of every seven children aged 2-8 years, and one in five youths aged 9-17 years, experience a behavioral or mental condition. However, interven - tions often can be delayed by a decade or more with only 15 to 25 percent of children receiving the care they need. MBB is addressing this crisis in our community by developing an early intervention model that places psychologists in primary care clinics to address emotional and physical health needs as they emerge, in one seamless system. \"This integration will make behavior services available to substantially more children in a trusted setting\u2014their primary care home. This reduces barriers of stigma and the inconvenience of extra visits that can occur in a subspecialty system of care,\" Stark says. Likewise, we are building alternative management models to help children and adolescents in mental health crisis with the goals of preventing emergency room visits and reducing unnecessary hospitalizations. Similar integrated care models are being developed for other clinical conditions within MBB. A LONG-TERM EFFORT With so much to be done, it will take several years for the MBB initiative to bear its most important fruits. \"Ultimately, we don't want to just improve treatment of dis - ease. We want to get to health and wellness. The only way to get there is to bring all these disciplines back together again,\" Glauser says. \"And because of our strong resources, because of our cul - ture of collaboration, we really believe we can do this here.\" < MIND BRAIN BEHAVIOR INITIATIVES Center for Pediatric Neuroscience With hundreds of neuroscience studies and related projects underway at Cincinnati Children's and the University of Cincinnati, the new Center for Pediatric Neuroscience will serve as a clearinghouse to help basic scientists and clinicians find each other. \"Our hope is that we get to a point where we can under - stand the bigger questions about behavior, emo - tion and consciousness,\" says center Director Steve Danzer, PhD. (See page 16.). Alliance for Clinical Translational Science How can a behavioral scientist learn from an expert in sports medicine? And how might such a partner - ship provide insights into controlling chronic pain? Forging these kinds of cross-cutting collaborations is the mission behind the MBB's new Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science. \"Teens love having a trainer, they do not love having a therapist,\" says alliance leader Susmita Kashikar-Zuck, PhD. \"And the results indicate that there might be something about exercise that chang - es the tone of the brain, the way pain is perceived and reduced.\" (See page 20.) Internal Seed Funding Through 2021, Cincinnati Children's plans to provide internal seed funding grants of up to $75,000 each to accelerate Mind Brain Behavior collaborations. Projects to be funded will emphasize translational work that builds clinical and basic science teamwork across specialties. Inviting Experts The Mind Brain Behavior collaborative invites speak - ers from within Cincinnati Children's and brain sci - ence experts from other research centers to share their knowledge. The program is inspiring faculty and students at multiple levels to find new ways to apply their skills to neuroscience and related fields. Topics range as widely as brain science itself, includ - ing ways to apply imaging technology, genomics, computer algorithms and other methods to deepen understanding of autism, pain, seizures, tumors, maternal depression, and more. Enhancing Care, Expanding Reach As many as one in five children aged 9 to 17 experi - ences a behavioral or mental condition, but only 15 to 25 percent get the care they need. Cincinnati Children's is addressing this crisis by embedding more psychologists in pediatric primary care clinics. Leaders also are hiring more Mind Brain Behavior experts in autism and other fields while working to enhance patient and family experiences at the hospital, and to streamline services that involve multidisciplinary clinic care. Tracy Glauser, MD, and Lori Stark, PhD 14 RESEARCH HORIZONS / SPRING 2019 CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 15An Amazing Journey to Explore the Mind New Center for Pediatric Neuroscience Builds Collaborations to Accelerate Basic Brain Research by Nick Miller As far as we know the human brain is the most complex structure in the universe. That's what Cincinnati Children's neuroscientist Steve Danzer, PhD, tells his students at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine (UC), where he's an associate professor of Anesthesiology. However, while the brain's complex - ity makes the jobs of these future doctors and scientists more difficult, the brain's ability to restructure and rewire itself creates opportunities for developing entirely new therapies. About the size of two clenched fists, this oblong globe of tis - sue fits 200 billion electrically sensitive neurons and glia cells and more than 100 trillion synapses into our heads. The components all work together inside that relatively small space to help make us what and who we are. It controls the function of our organs and limbs, is capable of logic, reason, love, hate and fear and can burst forth with brilliant creativity. Danzer's challenge\u2014and that of his colleagues in the Center for Pediatric Neuroscience\u2014is to figure out more about how it works and why. Scientists and physicians see great potential to use the brain's abilities to improve medicine and human health. To some extent medicine already does this, but there is still far more about the brain that we don't know than we do. \"Neurology and neuroscience affect almost everything,\" says Danzer, center director and a neuroscientist in the Department of Anesthesia. \"We know the brain has tremendous adaptive capabilities\u2014like restructuring itself to recover the ability to walk or speak after stroke\u2014but these endogenous processes of - ten are insufficient. We need to learn more about how the brain repairs itself so that we can help these processes to work better, and prevent them from going wrong and producing pathological outcomes, like chronic pain. That journey is still relatively early, according to Danzer. A lot more foundational science work is needed. \"We are getting a good understanding of how neurons and individual cells work and how neural networks work,\" Danzer explains. \"Our hope is that we get to a point where we can un - derstand the bigger questions about behavior, emotion and con - sciousness. We're not there yet and the answers are still kind of wide open.\" ENDLESS FORKS IN THE ROAD Hundreds of studies and related projects focused on the neuro - sciences are underway at Cincinnati Children's and its research affiliate, UC. They point in a multitude of different and often complementary directions. The Center for Pediatric Neuroscience serves as a centralized scientific clearing house. It helps basic scientists in laboratories and physicians in patient clinics find each other. \"Numerous skill sets are involved in neurosciences\u2014all the way from psychology and psychiatry where people work with 16 RESEARCH HORIZONS / SPRING 2019 CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 17injuries and among people with epilepsy or other kinds of brain seizures. \"There is still a debate in the field over whether spreading depolarizations are good or bad and if they should be prevented or stopped,\" explains Candi LaSarge, PhD, a neuroscientist work - ing with Danzer and pediatric neurosurgeon Jesse Skoch, MD, to find out. Basic research about SDs has lagged in part because current technologies allow viewing them only to a limited degree. To change that, LaSarge, Skoch and Danzer worked with Matt Batie in our 3-D Printing and Design Engineering service to develop a tiny stereotaxic frame that lets researchers measure SD intensity with high clarity in living mice. The 6- by 4-inch black box is equipped with optical imag - ing and anesthesia access ports that allow a confocal electron microscope to record SDs in mice with brain tissues tagged to \"light up\" as the waves spread. The team plans to use the tool to map SDs in real time while modeling seizures, brain injury, and other conditions. \"Clinically we don't have highly effective or sensitive ways to observe and monitor brain activity during spreading depolarizations in people,\" says Skoch, who operates on children with epilepsy and other neurological conditions. \"This research eventually will give us a diagnostic tool for injured brains or those with disease. Being able to visualize activity with the device gives us a sensitivity that electrodes cannot, which allows us to study SDs in ways that we could not before.\" MORE TO COME The SD project highlights a key goal of the new center\u2014to meet the challenges of advancing neuroscience in the 21st century by bringing together basic scientists, clinicians, engineers, bioin - formatics specialists and other experts. \"Our combined efforts will be essential if we are to gain an understanding of the most complex structure in the universe,\" Danzer says. <patients to studying gene mutations and subcellular structural changes in neurons,\" Danzer says. \"We have a very strong neuro - sciences group at Children's and UC. The center makes it easier for clinicians and basic scientists to coordinate our research and overall efforts.\" So far about 60 basic scientists and physician-scientists have joined the center's expanding lineup. Some teams study the molecular processes underlying the formation of neural circuits in the spinal cord. Others study neuroplasticity\u2014the ability of the brain to use its muscle-like characteristics to adapt and recover from injuries and illnesses. Other studies seek to identify the molecular processes that cause brain and central nervous system diseases\u2014including epi - lepsy, autism spectrum disorders, cancer, hydrocephalus, sleep disorders and more. Still others specialize in biomedical infor - matics, where computer algorithms and systems biology concepts can be applied to analyze massive amounts of biological data. CHASING TSUNAMIS One study underway at the new center explores the mysteries of spreading depolarizations (SDs), popularly referred to as \"brain tsunamis.\" Scientists know these fluctuating waves of neural activa - tion can spread throughout brain's cortex, but no one knows exactly what they mean. Are SDs a symptom or biomarker of brain problems, or a cause? Do they have diagnostic potential? Some of these tsunamis appear linked to the strange dizzy feeling or \"aura\" that some people feel before agonizing migraine headaches. Depolarizations also can occur after traumatic brain Left: Researchers at Cincinnati Children's use confocal electron microscope images like these to track waves of brain depolarization in mice. Eventually, data like this may help better understand and diagnose seizure disorders. From left, the multidisciplinary team includes Matt Batie, a specialist in Clinical Engineering, Candi LaSarge, PhD, a neuroscientist on the brain depolarization research team, pediatric neurosurgeon Jesse Skoch, MD, and Steven Danzer, PhD, CPN Director and a neuroscientist in the Department of Anesthesia.The team used 3-D printing technology to design this tiny stereotaxic frame to help researchers measure spreading depolarization intensity in mice. 18 RESEARCH HORIZONS / SPRING 2019 CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 19ACTS One, Scene One Novel Caf\u00e9-Style Approach to Collaboration Leads to More Bridges and Fewer Silos Among Researchers in the Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science by Tom O'Neill In creating a semi-structured strategy to improve collabora - tion among researchers of mind, brain and behavior, Susmita Kashikar-Zuck's approach provided a dash of simplicity\u2014 add art to science and stir. The clinical psychologist decided to bypass the siloed, meeting-heavy mentality of many large research institutions. She wanted to engage faculty on the cross-pollination of ideas in small groups, emphasize overarching themes over narrowly defined topics, and keep it short. Her secret ingredients included conversation, cookies, cray - ons and craft paper. It was a winning recipe. The Discovery Caf\u00e9 concept is part of the Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (ACTS), an initiative launched as part of the larger Mind Brain Behavior Collaborative at Cincinnati Children's. The caf\u00e9 was born from a listening tour Kashikar-Zuck undertook in fall 2017. Researchers told her they wanted com - munication and culture, not more lectures, especially long ones. In its first year, ACTS has grown into an impassioned group of scientists in 16 divisions who share data, grant opportunities, resources and insights. Kashikar-Zuck likens the process to a qualitative study. \"The goal was to identify synergies, to galvanize research across Cincinnati Children's,\" says Kashikar-Zuck, PhD, Research Director in the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology (BMCP). \"That's how it was different. Some research - ers were working together, some were not, but generally there were many clinical and research silos. It's one of the mind/brain areas where we could show how people can cross-cut their ideas.\" Its name is borrowed from the World Caf\u00e9, a similarly infor - mal approach that has gained traction at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United Nations, and in the corporate and governmental worlds. The Mind Brain Behavior (MBB) initiative at Cincinnati Children's has two arms: basic research, headed up by Steve Danzer, PhD, of the Department of Anesthesia (page 16), and the translational arm that Kashikar-Zuck leads. Creating ACTS was suggested by MBB directors Lori Stark, PhD, Director, BMCP and Tracy Glauser, MD, Associate Director of the Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation. \"I told Lori and Tracy, this novel approach to bring faculty together could really flop,\" she recalls with a smile. \"But, I said, let's see how people react to the full idea of getting together under this umbrella. I was, frankly, a little concerned.\" She needn't have been. \"We needed a catalyst,\" says Greg Myer, PhD, Director of Research in the Division of Sports Medicine. \"Crayolas are not part of our usual tool box, but I think they were critical to our expanded thinking.\" 20 RESEARCH HORIZONS / SPRING 2019 CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 21Dean Beebe, PhD, Director of the Neuropsychology Program in BMCP, put it this way: \"I didn't know what to expect going in. I had no doubt about the goals, and I do think it's the right thing to do. I'm open to the idea of trying things out. Besides, precon - ceived notions kind of defeat the whole purpose, don't they?\" CONNECTING THE PARALLEL ROADS OF RESEARCH WITH SIDE STREETS In the first two sessions of the Discovery Caf\u00e9, Kashikar-Zuck, who specializes in pediatric pain research, saw common meth - odologies used in different ways. \"For example, pediatric migraine, fibromyalgia, and func - tional abdominal pain are conditions treated by neurology, rheu - matology and GI specialists,\" she says, \"and what they all have in common is that the pain is brain-based.\" From Beebe, caf\u00e9 participants learned about research using a mobile device called an actigraphy sensor, a wristwatch-like unit that assesses children's rest/activity cycles. He also was awarded MBB's first Research, Innovation and Pilot grant for his clinical-translational project on sleep and traumatic brain injury. Chris King, PhD, Department of Anesthesia, shared his in - sights into inflammation and gene expression. Ernest Pedapati, MD, MS, of the Division of Psychiatry, contributed his extensive knowledge of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and fragile X syndrome. From Jeffery Epstein, PhD, Director of the Center for ADHD, the team learned about his web-based, information portal that both clinicians and families can access. With new language, the template can be easily replicated by other care providers and researchers. Kashikar-Zuck, who directs the Behavioral Pain Management Research Lab, provided expert analysis of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), particularly in juvenile fibromyalgia (JFM), a painful musculoskeletal disorder. That makes her something of an unlikely research partner with Myer, who focuses on injury treatment and prevention in athletes. \"One thing I liked about the caf\u00e9 was that it pulled you out of your comfort zone,\" Myer says. \"It forced us to think and talk to other types of researchers. That was a really important component.\" Kashikar-Zuck had not previously seen much crossover potential in the science of biomechanics. JFM is a pain condition associated with reduced physical function. While athletes are often highly self-motivated and conditioned for physical chal - lenge, exercise can prompt the very pain JFM patients try to avoid. So, she wondered, what do biomarkers and biomechanics have to do with kids undergoing CBT for chronic pain? Turns out, a lot. MIXING MIND AND MUSCLE \"All credit to her for the godsend and gumption to pull this off,\" Myer says of Kashikar-Zuck and the Discovery Caf\u00e9. \"We're not two groups that would normally collaborate. She's opened my eyes to that. It's taught me that while we focus on training the muscles, we may be missing something with the mind. Likewise, she trains the mind but less so the muscles.\" Co-authors Sumita Kashikar-Zuck, PhD, (left) and Greg Myer, PhD, have led several recent studies examining the efficacy of neuromuscular exercise training.Pre-ACTS studies led by co-authors Kashikar-Zuck and Myer, published in 2015 and 2016 in Arthritis Care & Research , demonstrated that CBT was effective in improving physical activity, but had little or no impact on pain reduction. In response, they developed a specialized program, as - signing their 36 subjects to either CBT-only treatment or their novel intervention called Fibromyalgia Integrative Training for Teens (FIT Teens)\u2014a blend of CBT strategies and specialized neuromuscular exercise training. Much of exercise occurred at the Sports Medicine lab, a first for Kashikar-Zuck. Meanwhile, she passed along her new insights to Beebe and others. \"Susmita is doing the biomechanics,\" says Beebe, who studies the impact of childhood sleep pathology on neuropsychological functioning. \"And I've done really interesting research in simu - lation work. We're not a classic collaborative, so the question is, how do we harness that? That's when you realize how cool these things are.\" NEW INSIGHTS ON PAIN, MOVEMENT Research teams had Kashikar-Zuck's patients do things Myer's patients do: climbing stairs, resistance exercises, jumping off boxes of varying heights, and so on. \"We kept it health-focused. Teens love having a trainer, they do not love having a therapist,\" she says. \"And the results indicate that there might be something about exercise that changes the tone of the brain, the way pain is perceived and reduced.\" In September 2018, the team published results from a pilot study in The Journal of Pain , reporting that FIT Teens outper - formed CBT-only treatment, even in pain reduction. \"It has worked out beautifully. The training is group-based, so it has a social aspect that energizes teens with fibromyalgia,\" Kashikar-Zuck says. \"Once they decide to participate, we've had 95 percent retention. Parents have been blown away.\" We are now conducting the largest clinical trial for the treatment of juvenile fibromyalgia with seven study sites across North America. CAN INTERNAL SUCCESS BE EXPORTED? Collaboration across divisions has been a tradition at Cincinnati Children's that the MBB effort seeks to accelerate in neuroscience. But can this kind of sharing also extend beyond the campus? As teens grow up and transition into adult care settings, how will these patients continue the progress they've had in FIT Teens? It may be a challenge. \"People have tried and ran smack dab into organizational types of issues. Institutions are set up in different ways, so you think, OK, that's not going to work,\" Kashikar-Zuck says. \"But there's so much interest in improved approaches, whether it's for pain, epilepsy or migraine. And as researchers, we're trained to be persistent.\" < Pilot study data published in The Journal of Pain , reports that the FIT Teens approach outperforms cognitive behavioral therapy alone.Randomized (n=40) Allocated to CBT (n=20) Allocated to FIT Completed Intervention: n=17 Did not complete (n=2)Completed Intervention: n=19 Did not complete intervention: n=1 analysis due to dropout (n=1)Analyzed (n=17) Excluded from preliminary analysis due to dropout (n=3)AnalysisCONSORT Flow Diagram Excluded (n=50) Not meeting inclusion criteria (n=10) Declined to participate (n=28) Other reasons (lost to follow-up) (n=12) 40 30 20 10 0Adjusted Means with 95% Confidence IntervalsCBT Only FIT Teens Study ConditionFDI Baseline FDI Post Treatment FDI 3-month Follow-up 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3Adjusted Means with 95% Confidence IntervalsCBT Only FIT Teens Study ConditionPain Baseline Pain Post Treatment Pain 3-month Follow-up Assessed for eligibility (n=90)Enrollment 22 RESEARCH HORIZONS / SPRING 2019 CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 23Teaming Up to Solve a Headache about Headaches Mind Brain Behavior Collaborative Brings Experts Together to Take Fresh Look at Migraine Pain By Tim Bonfield Clinicians describe chronic migraine as having at least 15 days per month of headache for more than three months with at least two aggravating symptoms. The pain tends to come with a pulsating quality. Sufferers often feel nausea, an aversion to light, or other discomfort severe enough to disrupt normal activity. Nearly 2,000 children and teens visit the Headache Center at Cincinnati Children's each year seeking help to relieve mis - ery that often keeps them out of school, off the field and curled up in a dark room. Many families hope that doctors can simply prescribe a pill to make the pain stop. Many are surprised to find out that medications\u2014especially by themselves\u2014are not necessarily the right answer. Experts in the field say a seismic shift is occurring in mi - graine pain management. While one surprisng study reports that two of the most frequently prescribed migraine medications show no better results than placebo, other studies suggest prom - ising results from non-medication approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Now, a team of scientists at Cincinnati Children's is work - ing to learn more about why. They are combining expertise in brain imaging technology, neurology, behavioral therapy, and other fields to lay the foundation for a new set of best practices in migraine control. Bringing varied skill sets to bear in the hunt for better solu - tions for migraine pain is no accident. Forging working partner - ships from bench to bedside is a prime mission of the Mind Brain Behavior Collaborative, say co-leaders Lori Stark, PhD, Director of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and Tracy Glauser, MD, Associate Director of the Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation. \"One of our strengths over the years has been our collabora - tive nature. But collaboration can either occur passively, or we can \"So now we're going back to the bench and asking, 'When we attempt a treatment, what parts of the brain are being affected? What mechanisms are involved? Why is the placebo effect so powerful?\" 24 RESEARCH HORIZONS / SPRING 2019 CINCINNATICHILDRENS.ORG/RESEARCH 25actively encourage and support collaboration by being a catalyst,\" Glauser says. \"The pain group is a perfect example of bringing medical providers, behavioral health providers, researchers, patients and families, all together in an active fashion to allow them to improve care and make discoveries.\" MOVING FORWARD BY GOING BACK TO THE BENCH A surprising study of teens with migraines, published in 2017 in The New England Journal of Medicine , helped spark a fundamental reexamination of pain treatment. The study, led by Cincinnati Children's investigators Scott Powers, PhD, and Andrew Hershey, MD, PhD, reported finding no statistical difference between the two most-prescribed migraine medications\u2014amitriptyline and topiramate\u2014and placebo. The study did not conclude that the medications offered no value. Instead, the co-authors reported that the expectation of benefit from taking any pill, including a placebo, was powerfully strong. The unexpected findings meant that scientists have much more work to do. \"So now we're going back to the bench and asking, 'When we attempt a treatment, what parts of the brain are being affected? What mechanisms are involved? Why is the placebo effect so powerful?\" Powers says. \"Then as we find those connections, we can design treatments that intentionally trigger those parts of the brain.\" CAN PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENTS FOR PAIN BE IMAGED? With the nation facing an epidemic of opioid abuse, safely and effectively managing pain has become a more complex challenge. In previous research, Powers and colleagues have reported significant success in controlling migraine pain through cog - nitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Instead of medication, CBT components focus on cognitive modification and distraction, and behavioral change strategies such as relaxation training, biofeedback, activity pacing, and adherence plans. Clinical trial data reported as far back as 2013 shows that CBT helps reduce headache frequency and disability. And yet, many physicians remain reluctant to trust CBT over medication. To some providers, if pain can be controlled without a pill, then maybe the pain isn't real. With many young patients already facing doubts and questions about exaggerating their suffering, some tell doctors that having a prescription medication provides validation. But what if CBT produces detectable, measurable changes in brain function? Robert Coghill, PhD, an expert in using brain im - aging to study pain, has teamed up with Powers to use functional Andrew Hershey, MD, PhD (left) and Scott Powers, PhD, led a study reporting that the placebo effect is just as strong as two top migraine medications. magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine how CBT influences brain activity and connectivity. Coghill and Power's pilot study is demonstrating real brain changes from CBT. \"Our preliminary data tell us kids who get more than eight migraine days a month see this reduced by 33 percent after they get cognitive behavioral therapy to teach them coping skills,\" Coghill says. \"Amazingly, fMRI data shows changes in the func - tion of several regions of the brain in children who receive be - havioral therapy.\" Regions including the prefrontal cortex, the posterior cin - gulate cortex and the precuneus showed the most significant increases in activation after CBT. To study changes in brain connectivity, Coghill and Powers focused on the amygdala, a brain region thought to be the lynch - pin for controlling the emotional-affective dimension of pain. So far, the study suggests that CBT helps control pain by changing interactions between the amygdala, the insular cortex and other regions that are important in the processing of pain. Based on these early findings, Powers and Coghill have em - barked on a full-scale study to directly compare brain changes produced by CBT with those produced by drug treatment in youth with migraine. Stark sees enormous potential in the visual power of fMRI imagery to convince patients and families that treatments are making a difference.\"This technology can help in a number of ways,\" Stark says. \"It can help convince people that the pain a child feels is real. It also can show that a treatment that does not involve medication can affect the parts of the brain that can inhibit headaches just as much as a chemical can. Obtaining that kind of result is only possible through collaboration across disciplines.\" < Robert Coghill, PhD, is working with colleagues at Cincinnati Children's to use advanced brain imaging techniques to determine how cognitve behavior therapy (CBT) influences how the brain reacts to pain. Early data indicates that CBT affects several brain regions.
