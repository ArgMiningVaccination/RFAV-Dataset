It supports your body's innate ability to heal itself through natural therapies. Naturopathic doctors are highly educated health care providers who integrate standard medical diagnostics with preventative medicine and natural therapies. A naturopathic doctor has completed four years of pre-med studies, four years of graduate school at an accredited naturopathic medical university and has successfully passed NPLEX, the North American licensing exam. | These therapies may include: - Herbal medicine - Many plant substances are powerful medicines when used properly. As with nutritional supplements, botanicals can be used in conjunction with conventional treatments to reduce their side effects and enhance their effectiveness. Naturopathic doctors are experts regarding pharmaceutical and herb interactions. - Homeopathy - This gentle yet effective system of medicine is more than 200 years old and is based on the principle that \"like cures like\". Homeopathic medicines are very small doses of natural substances that can stimulate the body's self-healing response without side effects. - Diet - Doctors look at dietary patterns and make recommendations to balance blood sugar, decrease inflammation, eliminate food sensitivities, and optimize wellness. - Nutritional supplements - These can help to address underlying nutritional deficiencies, balance hormones, support detoxification, improve mood, boost immunity and improve digestive function. Lifestyle counseling and Stress Management - Mental attitudes and emotional states can be important elements in healing and disease. Naturopathic physicians are trained in counseling, nutritional balancing, stress management and goal setting. They also address environmental and lifestyle factors that affect their patients' health.
