One member is appointed from each of the 13 congressional districts, and five are appointed from the state at large. The Board of Regents exercises broad jurisdiction over all institutions of the University System of Georgia and establishes policies and procedures under which they operate. The Board receives all state appropriations for the University System and allocates these appropriations to the institutions and institution-related agencies. While the Board engages in both policy-making and administrative functions, each unit of the System has a high degree of academic and administrative autonomy. The Chancellor of the University System, the chief administrative officer, is appointed by the Board as its chief executive officer and serves at the Board's request. The chancellor has broad discretionary power for executing the resolutions, policies and rules, and regula - tions adopted by the Board for the operation of the University System. The System currently includes 34 institutions: four research universities, two regional universities, 13 state universities, two state col - leges, and 13 two-year colleges. These institutions are both individually distinctive and interrelated. They are geographically dispersed so that approximately 96 percent of the people in Georgia reside within 35 miles of at least one university or college.UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF GEORGIA The University System of Georgia, which began operation in 1932, is among the oldest unified statewide systems of public higher education in the United States and includes all state-operated universities, four-year colleges, and two-year colleges in Georgia.

Since its inception in 1981, the program has maintained as its objective, the selection and enrollment of students who have demonstrated excellence in academic and leadership per - formance and have strong potential to become leaders on campus and in the community. The scholarship offers four levels of awards. For the 2003 competition (for students who entered Georgia Tech as freshmen in summer or fall of 2002), the four-year award amounts were: Georgia resident: and $12,000. To apply for the President's Scholarship, a student must submit the Georgia Tech application for admission by October 31 of the senior year. The most qualified applicants in terms of high school grades, standardized test scores, writing ability, and demonstrated leadership and involvement in activities are selected as scholarship semifinalists. Each semifinalist is sent a supplemental application in December and interviewed by a Regional Committee in January. Approximately 110 of the top-ranked candidates in the competition are invited as finalists to attend the President's Scholarship Weekend on campus in the spring. HOPE -- Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally -- is Georgia's unique program, created by Governor Zell Miller, that rewards students' hard work with financial assistance in degree, diploma, or certificate programs at any eligible Georgia public or private college, university, or public technical institute. Additionally, other HOPE assistance is available for students who received a GED after July 1, 1993. HOPE is funded by Georgia's Lottery for Education.Table 4.8 President's not expendituresPage 6 6 ADMISSIONS AND ENROLLMENT2003 Georgia Tech Fact Book Page 6 7 2003 Georgia Tech Fact Book ADMISSIONS AND ENROLLMENT1.

Student interest in study abroad has been grow - ing steadily for several years. Until some programs in Asia were canceled due to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, 2002-2003 was on track to be a record year for study abroad participation. Georgia Tech remains committed to providing academically and culturally valuable international programs and will continue to work to expand program offerings and increase study abroad par - ticipation.

This new unit offer the traditional Cooperative Plan of education as well as Undergraduate Professional Internships. The Co-op option has been offered since 1912, and is the fourth oldest program of its kind in the world. It is a five-year, totally optional plan for undergraduates who wish to combine career-related experience with classroom studies. Students who enroll in this program alternate between industrial assignments and classroom studies on a semester basis, taking the same course work on the campus that is completed by regular four-year students. Graduates of the program are awarded a degree in their field with the designation \"Cooperative Plan.\" By completing work assignments abroad and exhibiting proficiency in a foreign language, students may earn the \"International Cooperative Plan\" designation. The Co-op Program is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Cooperative Education, and was recently listed as one of the top 10 \"Programs that Work\" by U.S. News & World Report . Students who participate in Co-op have the opportunity to develop career interests, become more confident in their career choices, and develop human relation skills through their work experiences. Since all Co-op positions are paid, students are able to save a portion of their salaries to apply toward educational expenses. Approximately 700 employers participate throughout the U.S. and internationally. With average starting salaries over $13 per hour for students, the aggregate amount earned last year by all co-ops was about $17 million. The Undergraduate Professional Internship (UPI) program had its first students participating in the Spring Semester 2003. This program is geared toward those students who, for some reason could not or did not participate in Co-op, but desire some career-related experience before graduation. Aimed mainly at rising juniors and seniors, over 50 students have been able to take advantage of the UPI program since its inception.

engineer.\" Those words from one of America's most famous fight songs typify the spirit of athletics at Georgia Tech, a school with a tradition of integrity and success that is second to none. Ever since 1892, when the first football team was organized on The Flats, Georgia Tech teams in all sports have represented the Institute in outstanding fashion while producing some of the best-known names in athletics. David Braine, the current director of athletics, oversees teams in 17 sports, and also the following departments: the Total Person Pro - gram, compliance, business, development, finance, accounting, ticketing, marketing, sports information, sports medicine and strength and conditioning. The Georgia Tech Athletic Association is a non-profit organization responsible for maintaining the intercollegiate athletic program at Tech. The Athletic Association is overseen by the Georgia Tech Athletic Board, chaired by the president of the Institute, Dr. G. Wayne Clough, and composed of seven faculty members, three alumni members, and four student members. Braine follows in the footsteps of four of the most honored men in college athletics: John Heisman, for whom football's Heisman Trophy is named, William Alexander, Bobby Dodd, and Dr. Homer Rice. Since 1904, Tech has had only 11 head football coaches: John Heisman, Bill Alexander, Bobby Dodd, Bud Carson, Bill Fulcher, Pepper Rodgers, Bill Curry, Bobby Ross, Bill Lewis, George O'Leary, and the present coach, Chan Gailey. Tech has won four National Championships in football in the years 1917, 1928, 1952, and 1990, and the Yellow Jackets have the nation's third best record in bowl games at 20-11. Other major athletic highlights include an NCAA Final Four appearance by the Tech men's basketball team in 1990, a NWIT women's basketball title in 1992, two College World Series berths in baseball and nine top 10 national finishes by the Tech golf program. Some of the most prominent names in Georgia Tech athletic history have been Grand Slam winner Bobby Jones, Masters champion Larry Mize, British Open champion David Duval as well as Stewart Cink, Matt Kuchar and Bryce Molder in golf; Mor - ris, Robert Lavette, Maxie Baughan, Marco Coleman, Shawn Jones and 1999 Heisman Trophy runner-up Joe Hamilton in football. Tech boasts four recent Olympic gold medal winners in track Derrick Adkins, Antonio McKay, Derek Mills, and Angelo Taylor; several current Major League Baseball stars including Nomar Garciaparra and Kevin Brown; Roger Kaiser, Rich Yunkus, Mark Price, John Sal - ley, Stephon Marbury and Matt Harpring in men's basketball; and basketball player Kisha Ford and trackster Andria King in women's sports. Tech's facilities rank among the finest in college athletics. Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field, one of America's oldest and most recognized football venues, has undergone a two year, $75-million expansion and renovation project that has raised its capacity to 55,000 for 2003. Tech boasts the new Russ Chandler Baseball Stadium, which seats 4,000 and is one of the nation's finest baseball facilities, as well as the famed Alexander Memorial Coliseum at McDonald's Center, home to the men's and women's basketball pro - grams. Construction is nearing completion on the enclosure and expansion of the on-campus swimming and diving facility that hosted the aquatic events for the 1996 Centennial Olympic Games. The hub of Georgia Tech athletics is the Arthur Edge Athletic Center, which houses administrative and coaching staffs, a dining hall, locker rooms, training and weight facilities, and the Andrew Hearn Academic Center. The Homer Rice Center for Sports Performance is the home of the Total Person program, the best of its kind in the United States. The Center is comprised of seven sports performance and wellness clinics. Georgia Tech teams participate in the Atlantic Coast Conference, regarded as one of the finest collegiate conferences in the country. The primary purpose of the Athletic Association is to help each student-athlete grow as a person, develop as an athlete, earn a meaningful degree and become a good citizen.

The mission of the Georgia Tech Alumni Association is to promote the Institute and serve our alumni. We will strive to create relevant and meaningful programs for current and future alumni to foster lifelong participation and philanthropic support. We will communicate the achievements of the Institute, maintain its traditions and strengthen relationships with the campus community. Underlying all that we do is the belief in the value of education, the commitment to integrity, exceptional customer service, and a pledge that we will perform in a fiscally responsible manner. The Association is organized into eight departments: Administration, Alumni Relations/Business Development, Campus Relations, Com - munications, Event Management, Career Development/Human Resources, Marketing Services, and Roll Call. Administration is responsible for accounting, purchasing, finance and budgeting, management of the Associations extensive database, computing and information services, management of the organizations facilities. Accounting maintains business records, manages investments, assesses cash flows, and produces all financial reports. Computing and information services maintain the Associations database of more than 110,000 alumni and friend records and is responsible for computing needs. The department also maintains the Alumni Faculty house at 190 North Ave. Alumni Relations/Business Development manages alumni clubs and groups, travel programs, affinity programs, advertising and mer - chandising. The Association 's 76 Georgia Tech clubs, which are located throughout the United States and abroad, provide opportunities for alumni to socialize, recruit students, raise funds, and network. Alumni Tours offer educational trips for alumni to travel throughout the world. Business Development for the Association manages advertising and sponsorships, merchandise and affinity relationships with the Associations vendors. Campus Relations is responsible for activities facilitating and promoting interaction among students, alumni, parents, and friends of Georgia Tech and campus organizations, including Tech 's faculty and staff. Its responsibilities include student organizations and pro - grams, campus initiatives, and parent relations. Communications produces alumni publications, BUZZwords (reaching about 40,000 people), and directs the Living History programs, which records the personal memories of select members of the Georgia Tech family. Communications publishes two major periodicals that serve as the primary news link between Georgia Tech and its alumni. TECH TOPICS is a quarterly tabloid mailed to more than 110,000 alumni and friends. The GEORGIA TECH ALUMNI MAGAZINE focuses on technology, the management of technology and alumni successes. Its mail list of more than 32,000 includes faculty and staff and Roll Call donors. Since its founding in 1994, Living History has produced more than 400 video interviews with alumni, key Geor gia Tech faculty, staff, and friends. Event Management plans and stages Homecoming, Family Weekend, and other Association events. Event Management engaged more than 65,000 alumni through more than 200 events ranging from the George C. Griffin Pi Mile Road Race to home football tailgates. The centralization of event planning has led to a greater efficiency and professional standard for Alumni Association events. Homecoming included all of the favorite traditions, along with a new tradition, showcasing Buzz Bash, the all-alumni reunion party, which was even more spectacular than last year, its inaugural year. The Event Management planning team partnered with all departments to produce Family Weekend, Phoenix Dinner, Alumni Career Conference, and Leadership Georgia Tech. Event Management also planned and executed the annual Presidents Dinner, a dramatic celebration held at the Galleria. Career Development and Human Resources provides career advisement, job postings and resume database through JobNet, career-building workshops and the annual Alumni Career Conference. The department also manages human resource systems for the Association. Marketing Services provides data to help shape the Associations strategies and planning, and maintains the Association 's Web presence.

Roll Call is the single largest source of predictable, unrestricted funds at Georgia Tech, representing the broadest base of support for the Institute. More than 26,000 donors contributed to the 56th annual Roll Call total of $7.4 million. The Roll Call uses research-driven direct marketing and telemarketing and personal contacts to manage a program that leads all public institutions in the percentage of alumni annual giving.

Source: Office of Sponsored ProgramsPage 132 RESEARCH2003 Georgia Tech Fact Book Page 133 2003 Georgia Tech Fact Book RESEARCHSource: Office of Sponsored ProgramsSPONSORED PROGRAMS The Vice Provost for Research and Dean of Graduate Studies has the responsibility for all research programs conducted by the Georgia Institute of Technology and works with the deans, chairs, directors, and other department heads in establishing research policies and procedures. In partnership with the Office of the President, the Georgia Tech Research Corporation (GTRC) and its subsidiary, Georgia Tech Applied Research Corporation (GTARC), the Office of Sponsored Programs (OSP) provides program development assistance as well as overall contract management for the sponsored research program at Georgia Tech. Organizationally, OSP reports to the Associate Vice Provost for Research who also serves as the General Manager for GTRC and GTARC. The Associate Vice Provost for Research is responsible, in cooperation with Grants and Contracts Accounting, for negotiating facilities and administrative (indirect) cost rates. Also, the Office of the Associate Vice Provost is responsible for the design and maintenance of an interactive automated database which integrates all contract administration functions and is used for management control and reporting. The database is used to produce and distribute a variety of periodic management reports including: a) a monthly listing of all deliverables due the following month, b) a quarterly overdue deliverables report, c) a monthly report of all sponsored activity, and d) a monthly report of cost-sharing commitments. In addition, specialized (ad hoc) reports are prepared on request. Prior to funding, OSP provides assistance that leads to the submission of formal proposals. OSP is responsible for submitting all proposal and grant applications for sponsored research and instruction from GTRC, GTARC and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Contracting Officers review proposals and cost estimates for compliance with sponsor requirements and Institute policies, and prepare the business portion of proposals. Contracting Officers serve as the sponsor's point of contact for business matters during the evaluation process, negotiate the final terms of the contract or grant, and sign, in conjunction with an officer of GTRC or GTARC, the resulting agreement. After sponsored research projects are funded, OSP has the responsibility for monitoring active grants and contracts. Upon receipt of a signed agreement, an initial in-depth review of the award documents takes place and relevant initiation forms are prepared and distributed. Complete project files are established and maintained for the duration of the program. All post-award project modifications to existing programs are processed by OSP. OSP is also responsible for the preparation and monitoring of subcontracts and consulting agreements issued by Georgia Tech under sponsored programs. Liaison with project sponsors is maintained by OSP Contracting Officers through responses to contractual situations or requests on day-to-day administrative matters. Responsibilities include monitoring programs to see that potential problems in meeting contractual obligations (i.e., assurance of satisfactory performance, submission of all deliverables, etc.) are called to the attention of Georgia Tech management in a timely manner. OSP is responsible for all contractual closeout actions, i.e., submission of final billing and research property and patent reports, accounting for the disposition of classified documents, and verification that deliverable requirements have been satisfied. OSP is also responsible for the preparation and administration of Small Business Administration (SBA) subcontracting plans. Research Administration, Communications, Training, and Technologies (ReACTT) within OSP provides a multitude of services internally to OSP as well as to the entire Institute. ReACTT furnishes specialized educational, informational, and technological support to research administrators and faculty. Workshops are offered on a variety of topics of interest to research faculty and administrators. ReACTT is the focal point for electronic research administration at Georgia Tech. ReACTT researches the literature and electronic sources and publicizes announcements of funding opportunities, orders and/or electronically downloads Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and other solicitations, and distributes them to the campus. ReACTT also assists individual researchers in program development activities through database searches, and obtaining guidelines, application forms, etc. A newsletter, Research News , is published monthly by this division; it is also posted to the internet. ReACTT has access to several databases and assists with individualized searches for funding opportunities and sponsor information. These databases have also been made accessible through the OSP Internet homepage at http://www.osp.gatech.edu . ReACTT administers the Community of Science (COS) program at Georgia Tech and assists researchers in maintaining their COS profiles and in using the COS database. ReACTT helps researchers with electronic submission of proposals via FastLane and other systems. ReACTT distributes all proposals and deliverable reports and serves as the filing center for project files and progress reports, pending receipt of final reports, and subsequent submission to the Archives section of the Georgia Tech Library.
