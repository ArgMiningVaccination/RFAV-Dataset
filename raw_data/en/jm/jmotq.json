ensure that medications to treat infusion-related reactions and cardiopulmonary resuscitative equipment are available for immediate use prior to initiation (see Black Box Warnings) Incidence of hand-foot syndrome in 1 trial was 51%, including 24% grade 3 or 4 toxicity (see Dosage Modifications) Secondary oral cancers, primarily squamous cell carcinoma, have been reported Based on animal data, can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women Cardiomyopathy - Can result in myocardial damage, including acute left ventricular failure; risk of cardiomyopathy is generally proportional to the cumulative exposure (see Black Box Warnings) - Include prior use of other anthracyclines or anthracenediones in calculations of cumulative dose; risk of cardiomyopathy may be increased at lower cumulative doses in patients with prior mediastinal irradiation - Assess left ventricular cardiac function (e.g. MUGA or echocardiogram) prior to initiation of therapy, during treatment to detect acute changes, and after treatment to detect delayed cardiomyopathy - Administer therapy to patients with a history of cardiovascular disease only when the potential benefit of treatment outweighs the risk Infusion reactions - Ensure that medications to treat infusion-related reactions and cardiopulmonary resuscitative equipment are available for immediate use prior to initiation of treatment - Initiate infusions at a rate of 1 mg/min and increase rate as tolerated - Withhold therapy for Grade 1, 2, or 3 infusion-related reactions and resume at a reduced infusion rate - Discontinue therapy for serious or life-threatening infusion-related reactions Pregnancy & Lactation Pregnancy Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, therapy can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman; avoid use during the 1st trimester Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating therapy Contraception - Females - Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during and for 6 months after treatment - Males - Therapy may damage spermatozoa and testicular tissue, resulting in possible genetic fetal abnormalities; males with female sexual partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during and for 6 months after treatment Infertility - In females of reproductive potential, therapy may cause infertility and result in amenorrhea; premature menopause can occur; recovery of menses and ovulation is related to age at treatment - In males drug may result in oligospermia, azoospermia, and permanent loss of fertility; sperm counts have been reported to return to normal levels in some men; this may occur several years after end of therapy Animal data - In animal reproduction studies, therapy was embryotoxic in rats and abortifacient in rabbits following intravenous administration during organogenesis at doses approximately 0.12 times the recommended clinical dose - Available human data do not establish presence or absence of major birth defects and miscarriage related to use of doxorubicin hydrochloride during 2nd and 3rd trimesters; advise pregnant women of potential risk to a fetus Lactation Not known whether drug is present in human milk; because many drugs, including anthracyclines, are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed infants from therapy, discontinue breastfeeding during treatment Pregnancy Categories A: Generally acceptable. Controlled studies in pregnant women show no evidence of fetal risk.B: May be acceptable. Either animal studies show no risk but human studies not available or animal studies showed minor risks and human studies done and showed no risk. C: Use with caution if benefits outweigh risks. Animal studies show risk and human studies not available or neither animal nor human studies done. D: Use in LIFE-THREATENING emergencies when no safer drug available. Positive evidence of human fetal risk. X: Do not use in pregnancy. Risks involved outweigh potential benefits. Safer alternatives exist. NA: Information not available. Pharmacology Mechanism of Action Anthracycline; intercalates between DNA base pairs, impairs topoisomerase II function and subsequently inhibits DNA and RNA replication Doxorubicin is a strong chelator; doxorubicin-iron complex binds to cell membranes and DNA and produces free hydroxyl radicals that mg doses in 250 mL & >90 mg doses in 500 mL D5W (do NOT use other IV fluids) Refrigerate at 2-8\u00b0C & administer within 24 hr Red translucent dispersion (will not be a clear solution) IV Administration Initial infusion at 1 mg/min, if no infusion reaction may increase rate to complete infusion in 1 hr Do not administer as bolus injection or undiluted suspension Do not use in-line filter Use cytotoxic precautions for handling, administration, and disposal Extravasation Management Stop infusion immediately Do not remove the needle until attempts are made to aspirate extravasated fluid Do not flush the line Avoid applying pressure to the site Apply ice to the site intermittently for 15 minutes 4 x/day for 3 days If the extravasation is in an extremity, elevate the extremity Liposomal doxorubicin may cause heart problems, including possibly fatal heart failure. Heart problems may occur during liposomal doxorubicin therapy or months to years after receiving this medication. Your risk of developing heart problems depends on your dose, medical history (including previous heart disease, radiation therapy in the chest area), and previous use of this and other drugs (including daunorubicin and cyclophosphamide). Children are at higher risk and should be monitored later in life for delayed heart problems.
