The countries reporting the majority of cases are mainly in Europe and the Americas.2 Africa update (endemic3 and non -endemic countries): Since the beginning of 2022, the continent has reported 6,870 cases (5,945 suspected; 925 confirmed) and 173 deaths (CFR: 2.5%) of monkeypox from eight endemic Africa Union (AU) Member States (MS): Benin (0 sus pected; 3 8; 2), Congo 3), Democratic Republic of 0) and Sudan (0; 11; 0). This week, a total of 41 new cases and no new deaths of monkeypox were reported from Cameroon (6), Liberia (1) and Nigeria (31). Additionally , Benin and Liberia have updated the ir figures for suspect cases that were previously reported. Benin: There are no new reported cases of monkeypox in Benin. All three previously listed suspect cases tested negative for monkeypox and have now been removed from the total cases reported for the country. Cumulatively three confirmed cases and no deaths of monkeypox were reported from Benin. Cameroon: Since the last update (21 October 2022), the Ministry of Health ( MoH ) reported six new cases (3 suspected; 3 confirmed) with no new deaths of monkeypox. There is a 50% increase in the number of confirmed cases compared to the previous update. Cumulatively, 50 cases (38 suspected; 12 confirmed) and two deaths (CFR: 4%) were reported. Liberia: Since the last update (28 October 2022), the MoH reported one new suspected case and no new deaths from monkeypox. This is a 94% decrease in the number of new suspected cases compared to the previous report. Fifty -one previously listed s uspect cases tested negative for 1 Global case and death numbers are inclusive of numbers being reported in Africa. 2 US CDC - https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/world -map.html ; WHO - https://worldhealthorg.shinyapps.io/mpx_global/ 3 Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Ghana, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Liberia, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, and Sierra Leone 2 monkeypox and have now been removed from the total cases reported for the country. Cumulatively 4 cases (1 suspected; 3 confirmed) and no deaths of monkeypox were reported from four counties: Grand Bassa, Montserrado, Maryl and and Bomi. Nigeria: Since the last update (28 October 2022), Nigeria Centre for Disease Control ( NCDC ) reported 31 new confirmed cases and no new death from monkeypox in Nigeria. This is a 48% increase in the number of new confirmed cases compared to t he last update. Cumulatively, 1,855 cases (1,272 suspected; 583 confirmed) and seven deaths (CFR: 0.4%) of monkeypox were reported from 30 states and the federal capital. Figure 1. New confirmed monkeypox cases reported by epidemiological week in AU MS s ince January 20224 The majority of AU MS reporting cases are from the central and western Africa regions with DRC, Ghana and Nigeria accounting for 9 8% of all confirmed cases reported (Table 1). Most cases were reported after the week of 21 July and this could be a result of enhanced surveillance in MS (Figure 1) . 4 The high numbers of confirmed case s reported from DRC in week 15 July is likely the result of batch reporting. 3 Table 1.

Given that this outbreak is currently affec ting multiple countries both on and outside of the continent, the geoscope assessment is high. If additional AU MS report disease linked to this outbreak, we will reassess and elevate accordingly. For the risk assessment level, we looked at the following c riteria: morbidity and mortality of the disease, probability to spread within and to other AU MS, and the availability of effective treatments, vaccines, or other control measures. We have listed the risk level as moderate given that monkeypox is not an ea sily transmissible, self -limiting disease with low mortality, which lacks effective treatment for those infected. We are closely monitoring the situation and we will reevaluate the risk periodically. New Africa CDC Response Activities On 8 August 2022, the Africa CDC Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was activated to support preparedness and response efforts of African Union Member States, in close collaboration with relevant partners The Africa CDC continues to provide support to AU MS with laboratory test kits on request. The Africa CDC continues to engage with Ministries of Health in Member States reporting cases to provide support as requested Africa CDC continues to communicate with global partners to secure adequate access to test kits and vaccines for AU Member States Recommendations for AU Member States Member States are advised to: Establish laboratory diagnostic and genomic sequencing capacity for orthopoxviruses, including monkeypox. Establish and/or strengthen existing monkeypox surve illance efforts. Develop and distribute both general and tailored risk communication messages for the community at large as well as specific populations currently impacted and at risk (e.g. sex - workers, immunocompromised individuals, children). Strengthen knowledge of monkeypox clinical management and infection prevention control measures. Report new cases of monkeypox as part of the current multi -country outbreak to Africa CDC (AfricaCDCEBS@Africa -Union.org ). The general public is advised to: Seek medical attention if you experience any monkeypox -like symptoms (e.g. develop rash with or without prior symptoms of fever, swollen lymph nodes, body aches, and weakness), especially if you have been in con tact with a positive case Practice effective hand hygiene by washing hands with soap and water or using an alcohol - 5 based hand sanitizer, especially after contact with any infected animal or human Avoid contact with animals that could harbor the virus, incl uding animals that are sick or found dead in areas where monkeypox occurs Avoid contact with any potentially contaminated material, such as clothes and bedding, with which animals with monkeypox have been in contact with If deemed a close contact of a monkeypox case, individuals should self -monitor for the development of symptoms up to 21 days from the last exposure to a case If you are infected with monkeypox, adhere to recommended isolation protocols prescribed by your medical provider to minimize tra nsmission to others, including pets and other animals that may be susceptible to monkeypox infection References 1.
