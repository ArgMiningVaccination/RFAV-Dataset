Vitamin C works with metals in the body to create hydrogen peroxide. Whereas normal cells have the ability to reduce the effects of hydrogen peroxide, cancer cells do not. The high concentration of the resulting hydrogen peroxide damages the DNA of the cancer cells and cuts off their energy supply. Vitamin C, even in very high doses, is toxic only to the cancer cells without harming the healthy cells. What Other Benefits Does High Dose IV Vitamin C Have? In addition to it's benefit as a non-toxic chemotherapeutic agent, intravenous vitamin C also boosts immunity. It can stimulate collagen formation to help the body wall off the tumor. It inhibits hyaluronidase, an enzyme that tumors use to metastasize and invade other organs throughout the body. It induces apoptosis to help program cancer cells into dying early.

The intestinal tract limits the amount of Vitamin C that can be absorbed and is not tolerated by the digestive system at these levels.
