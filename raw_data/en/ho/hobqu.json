This review article exam - ines 3 popular herbal immune stimulants that are often of in - terest to cancer patients. Echinacea, a native of NorthAmerica, is widely used to prevent, or provide early treat - ment for, colds. Preclinical studies lend biological plausibil - ity to the idea that echinacea works through immunemechanisms. Numerous clinical trials have been carried outon echinacea preparations: it appears that the extractsshorten the duration and severity of colds and other upperrespiratory infections (URIs) when given as soon as symp-toms become evident. However, trials of long-term use ofechinacea as a preventive have not shown positive results.Ginseng has been studied in some depth as an antifatigueagent, but studies of immune mechanisms have not pro-ceeded so far. Preclinical evidence shows some immune-stimulating activity. There have been several clinical trials ina variety of different diseases. Astragalus is the least-studiedagent. There are some preclinical trials that show intriguingimmune activity. The herbs discussed appear to have satis-factory safety profiles. Cancer patients may wish to use thesebotanicals to inhibit tumor growth or to boost resistance toinfections. However, passive immunotherapy with herbs,with no mechanism to expose tumor antigens, is unlikely tobe effective in inhibiting tumor growth. Although the marginof safety for these herbs is large, more research is needed todemonstrate the clear value of using herbs to improve resis - tance to infections. Keywords: ginseng; echinacea; astragalus; immune system; can - cer; upper respiratory infections In recent years, natural products from the plant kingdom have been investigated for their immune-modulating potential against infectious and neoplas - tic diseases. Herbal therapy, or \"phytomedicine,\" thetherapeutic use of plants, plant parts, or plant-derivedsubstances, is generally considered a form of comple - mentary medicine. 1,2Herbal agents can comprise the whole plant as well as any of its component parts:leaves, flowers, stems, seeds, roots, fruits, bark, orother parts used for therapeutic impact, foodflavoring, or fragrance. In traditional medical systemsdifferent plant parts are believed to have specificmedicinal properties that were identified over centu - ries of trial-and-error observation. 3Among these prop - erties are the ability to stimulate the body's disease-fighting mechanisms, including those now consideredfacets of the immune system. Within the US population, there is widespread interest in the therapeutic and preventive potential ofherbal agents. 4,5Recent estimates of the size of the US herbal market range from $3.2 billion to $5.1 billion.6,7 From 1993 to 1998, according to surveys conducted byEisenberg and colleagues, the proportion of Ameri-cans who sought out a provider of herbal medicinegrew from 10.2% to 15.1%. 8,9The proportion of peo- ple who self-prescribe is considerably larger, as herbsare commonly perceived by the public as having a highmargin of safety. 10The potential impact on public health is unknown but could be substantial, given thatthese products can be readily purchased at healthfood stores, pharmacies, and supermarkets. 11Several national polls in 1997 and 1998 reported that 32% to37% of Americans use herbal agents in any givenyear. 6,12These percentages appear to be much higher in Germany and other European countries where con - sumer demand has been more vigorous and whereherbal agents are more widely accepted by medicalprofessionals. 13,14Ginseng and echinacea are among the herbs reported to be used most widely. Forinstance, a recent study of women aged 40 to 60 yearsat an urban university hospital found that 18%reported use of ginseng, and 15% use of echinacea. 15 Use of complementary medicine in cancer patientsundergoing conventional cancer treatment in theHerbal Immunostimulants Evanston, Correspondence: KeithI.Block,MD,InstituteforIntegrativeCan - cer Care andBlock Center for Integrative Cancer Care, 1800 Sherman Avenue, Suite 515, Evanston, IL 60201.

Echinacea wasamong the herbal products most frequently used. 16 From the perspective of Western herbal medicine systems, herbal remedies that affect the immune sys - tem may be classified as either adaptogens orimmunostimulants, or both. Adaptogens include sub - stances that are reputed to increase the body's resis - tance to physical, chemical, and biological stressors.Immunostimulants (immunopotentiators, immune enhancers), as opposed to immunosuppressors, areagents that activate the body's nonspecific defensemechanisms against infectious organisms (notablyviral and bacterial pathogens) or against neoplasticcells. The primary goal of immunotherapy is to stimu - late the activity of immunologic cells that are in directlocal contact with neoplastic cells or infectiousagents. 17In general, it is claimed that herbal immunostimulants have minimal effects on the nor - mal immune response, but may help rectify the mod- erately compromised cell-mediated immuneresponse. 18,19 Herbal agents are claimed to have therapeutic effi- cacy for a variety of immune-related problems, rang- ing from upper respiratory infections (URIs) to auto-immune and neoplastic disorders. Based on earlystudies, some of these plant extracts appear to affecthumoral (acquired) immunity, but most appear toenhance cellular (innate or natural) immunity.Changes in humoral immunity would includemitogenic effects on B lymphocytes (increased prolif - eration) and production of specific types of antibod - ies. Changes in cell-mediated immunity, the more common outcome in phytomedicinal studies, aremeasured in terms of natural killer (NK) cell number and activity, lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) phagocytic activity,and proliferation of specific T-lymphocyte subsets.The relevance of each of these parameters to specificdiseases is beyond the scope of this article. However,there is some evidence that natural immune mecha - nisms can be modulated to impede the developmentand progression of certain infectious and neoplasticdiseases. 20,21Cancer patients commonly seek complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)remedies to \"boost the immune system,\" sometimeswith the notion that this will retard tumor growth.However, other than for cancers known to be affectedby the immune system, such as renal cancer and mela - noma, the impact of the immune system on malig - nancy is questionable. 22Active immunotherapy utiliz - ing tumor antigen exposure and presentation toimmune cells, followed by effector cell response,could conceivably benefit various solid tumors. More passive immunotherapy approaches such as those rep - resented by herbal supplements are less likely to have direct effects in most cancers. The role of immuneactivities arguably has more relevance in resistance tocommunity-acquired respiratory viruses, which, it hasrecently been noted, contribute to many cases of idio - pathic pneumonia that affect cancer patients, withcommonly fatal consequences. 23This finding makes the clinical role of immune stimulating herbs, asagents that may potentially aid in resisting the effectsof such viral illnesses, one of strong relevance to thehealth, well-being, and ultimately the survival of thesepatients. Echinacea,Ginseng,and Astragalus in Alternative Cancer Treatment Among the herbal agents thought to function (at least in part) as immunostimulants are echinacea, ginseng,and astragalus (Table to be immunostimulants, with echinaceaextensively studied in the United States and Europe,and research on astragalus coming primarily fromChina. Ginseng, widely researched in Asia and else-where, is considered both an immunostimulant andan adaptogen, although most research to date has fo-cused on the latter characteristic. All 3 herbs are recommended in alternative and tra- ditional medicine literature for cancer patients. Echinacea is recommended by practitioners of West-ern alternative medicine methods. For example, tak-ing several capsules of echinacea each day to increaselymph flow is recommended by a naturopathic doctorin one Internet site. 24Another naturopathic doctor recommends it for prostate cancer, along with severalother herbs that are typically characterized as cleans - ing, or able to rid the body of foreign substances,including pathogenic organisms. 25A further Internet site recommends echinacea as one of the herbs thatcan stimulate the immune system to fight cancers, andalso notes its cleansing nature. 26Ginseng and astragalus are associated chiefly with traditional Chi - nese medicine recommendations. Such recommen - dations are fairly commonly consulted by cancerpatients interested in alternative and integrative medi - cine. Ginseng and astragalus are both recommendedfor replenishing of qi (vital energy or the instigator ofbody functions, a concept closely linked to immunity)in Chinese traditional medicine texts on fu-zhengtherapy, or anticancer therapy aimed at increasing thebody's resistance to cancer. 27Other specific functions attributed to these herbs are increasing the numbersof white blood cells and enhancing immunologicalfunctions. The first author of this article has observedBlock, Mead 248 INTEGRATIVE CANCER THERAPIES 2(3); 2003 by ezgi erdal on September 27, 2010 ict.sagepub.com Downloaded from cases in the clinic that appear to support the benefits of these herbs in cases of treatment-inducedneutropenia. Both herbs appear in numerous herbalformulas for specific aspects of a variety of cancers,chiefly the formulas that are used to replenish qi andyin and strengthen resistance. 27 An examination of scientific evidence concerning the immune function of these herbs would helphealth practitioners in counseling patients interestedin their use. This review examines the effect of each ofthese herbs on immune function in experimental ani-mal models as well as in humans and explores theirproposed modes of action. Also addressed are thestrengths and limitations of studies that have focusedon the potential efficacy of the agents in the treatmentof immune-related disorders. The amount and qualityof the evidence for the use of herbal agents in cancer,both for affecting the course of malignant disease andfor prevention or treatment of infections in late-stagepatients, will be discussed. It is hoped that such infor - mation will encourage further research in the use ofherbal agents and improve our understanding of theirpotential impact on cancer treatment andmanagement. Echinacea Background on Echinacea The genus Echinacea (coneflower, family Asteraceae) is endemic to North America, where it was first used byNative Americans in the Great Plains region and lateradopted by White settlers. Echinacea preparations,commonly perceived as herbal immunostimulants or\"cold fighters,\" are among the most widely used di - etary supplements in Europe and the United States. 28 Echinacea-containing products have the greatest pop - ularity in Germany, where they are approved for sup - portive treatment of respiratory and urinaryinfections and for the external treatment of wounds.29 More than 800 echinacea-containing products and phytopharmaceuticals (plant-based medicines, in - cluding homeopathic preparations) are currently onthe market, 30,31and more than 3 million prescriptions containing echinacea are written by German physi-cians annually. 32,33The presence of echinacea products in the German market meant for intravenous adminis-tration should be noted; such products are not avail-able in the United States. Different preparations sold under the common name echinacea can show substantial disparities in composition. These variations are primarily due to dif-ferent species of echinacea as well as different modesof extraction, though some preparations also includeother substances such as goldenseal and ascorbic acid(vitamin C). Three species are commonly used medic - inally: Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench, E. angustifolia DC., and E. pallida (Nutt.) Nutt. Preparations of the root and of the above-ground parts of the 3 echinaceaspecies are all marketed as immune stimulants. It hasbeen suggested that echinacea preparations may beuseful in the treatment of URIs (eg, colds and flu), 34,35 infections with syndrome,37herpes infections,38cancer,39,40 arthritis,41and a variety of skin diseases, wounds, and ulcers.42To date, more than 400 papers, mostly in German, have been published on the bio - chemistry, immunopharmacology, and clinical uses ofE. purpurea, and to a lesser extent E. angustifolia andE. pallida. 18,26,31,43-46 This literature must be regarded with extreme cau - tion, however, due to the excessive chemical variabilityof echinacea preparations. Numerousphytochemicals in the 3 species have been suggestedas possible active components:a recent study quanti - fied cichoric acid and some of the echinaceaalkamides, proposed active constituents, in 25Herbal Immunostimulants INTEGRATIVE CANCER THERAPIES 2(3); 2003 249Table 1.

The cichoric acid and alkamide levels were found to vary substan - tially among various commercial echinacea prepara - tions, depending upon the species, plant part, andtype of extract. Preparations comparable as to botani - cal origin were found to vary chemically among differ - ent manufacturers. 47In a further example of the com - plications of using echinacea preparations, an in vitrostudy of echinacea herb and root, as well as prepara - tions standardized to phenolic preparationsenhanced murine cytokine mononuclear cells; the standardizedpreparations were and anti-inflam - matory activities. 48Lack of agreed understanding of the specific mechanisms of action of echinacea prepa - rations, and of the importance of various allegedactive constituents, will continue to limit the accuracyand reproducibility of clinical trials until these prob - lems are resolved. Preclinical Studies of Echinacea The reputed immune-enhancing effects of echinaceaare thought to be mainly directed toward nonspecificimmune mechanisms including phagocytic activity,macrophage activation, and NK cell activity. These ef-fects have been demonstrated in vitro and in animalstudies for the expressed juice of the upper plant partsofE. purpurea as well as for alcoholic extracts of the roots of E. purpurea, E. angustifolia, and E. pallida. 49,50 Among the constituents echinacea reportedto have activities are polysaccharides,glycoproteins, acid). 50Purified polysaccharides of E. purpurea were found to induce macrophage activation and increase phagocytic activity in vitro and in vivo inmice. 51,52 Reports of enhancement of immune function have suggested that such effects could be mediated byincreased monocyte secretion of several cytokines,including tumor necrosis factor-alpha as well asinterleukins 1, 6, and 10. 53However, another study found no evidence of increased levels of cytokines forechinacea-supplemented cultures of leukocytes fromcancer patients. 54By inducing acute phase reactions and activation of phagocytes, E. purpurea polysaccha - rides were observed to augment the resistance ofimmune-compromised mice against systemic infec - tions with Candida albicans andListeria monocytogenes. 32 In mice given the croton oil ear test (to induce inflam - mation), E. angustifolia inhibited the infiltration ofinflammatory leukocytes and reduced edema.55,56An E. purpurea preparation was found to increase signifi - cantly the number of NK cells in leukemic mice and toprolong survival time in treated mice. 57An arabinogalactan-protein fraction isolated from E. purpurea was found to stimulate the classical and alter - native pathways of complement activation.58 Finally, rats treated with E. angustifolia showed an increased production of the specific antibody sub - class, immunoglobulin G (IgG), following antigenicchallenge. 59However, another study, which used - mercial echinacea preparations and echinacea tinc - tures marketed by local herbalists, found that anti - body formation was suppressed in the female but notthe male rats in the study; no evidence was found foraltered NK cells or T-cell-mediated delayed-typehypersensitivity. 60In general, immune stimulators are thought to have no antigenic relationship to specificpathogens, and thus their action is nonspecific (cell-mediated via macrophages, leukocytes, and granulo - cytes). Responses of other antibody subclasses remain to be investigated. Thus, effects in cell-mediatedimmunity appear to be the primary immuno-modulatory activity of echinacea preparations. Echinacea extracts and phytochemicals have been observed to display other properties that may be rele- vant to effects on disease resistance seen in traditionaluse or clinical testing. These include antiviral 61and anti-inflammatory62,63activities. Clinical Studies of Echinacea Homeopathic Preparations In 5 randomized controlled clinical trials (RCCTs;using a placebo control, and either single-blind ordouble-blind designs), Melchart et al studied theimmunomodulatory activity of various echinaceapreparations in healthy males (18-40 years old) whohad not taken any immunomodulating drugs in theprevious 2 weeks. 64They reported increased phagocytic activity for men receiving either the oral al - coholic extracts of the E. purpurea root or intravenous homeopathic complex preparations containing E. angustifolia. The benefit obtained from the homeo - pathic remedies may seem perplexing given that suchpreparations assign only extremely small doses:theoriginal base substance must first undergo a series ofdilutions in alcohol or water. 65However, several well- designed controlled trials of homeopathy have dem - onstrated therapeutic efficacy for a variety of healthproblems, so it is not possible to rule out effects ofhomeopathic preparations at this time, despite lackof comprehension of any confirmed mechanism ofaction. 66-69Block, Mead 250 INTEGRATIVE CANCER THERAPIES 2(3); 2003 by ezgi erdal on September 27, 2010 ict.sagepub.com Downloaded from Effects in Healthy Individuals Some studies have examined the immune effects of echinacea in healthy individuals. A placebo-controlled,double-blind randomized trial in which echinacea ex - tracts were given to healthy females observed a signifi - cant 21% increase in complement properdin as well asan improvement in health-related quality of life asmeasured by the SF-36 form after 4 weeks of adminis - tration. 70In another trial, with a double-blind random - ized crossover design, expressed juice of enchinaceahad no effect on phagocytic activity ofpolymorphonuclear leucocytes or of monocytes anddid not influence production of TNF- or IL-1, even though increases in phagocytic activity have been re - ported in vitro. 71 Herbal Extracts:Cancer and Other Diseases Clinical trials of echinacea preparations have beenconducted in a variety of conditions. Lersch et al re - ported on several uncontrolled trials of \"far advanced\"cancer patients showing extensive metastases and whohad become immunosuppressed following conven-tional cancer therapy. 39,40,72In these studies, modest clinical and immunologic improvements were notedin several cases following immunotherapy that in-cluded (a thymus- stimulating and low-dose cyclophosphamide,which has been reported to counteract tumor-inducedsuppressor functions. In one of these studies, the com-bination of these 3 agents increased the activities ofLAK cells by 180% (p < .05) among patients with inop- erable, far-advanced liver cancer. 40It is not possible, however, to disentangle the effects of echinacea fromthose of the other immune modulators in the studiesreported by Lersch, nor can one determine to what ex - tent the immunologic changes in these studies influ - enced the course of disease. Controlled trials usinglarger groups of patients would be needed to assess thevalidity of these findings. In a comparative study ofhealthy individuals and immunocompromised pa - tients (with either AIDS or chronic fatigue syndrome),increased cellular immunity resulted in both groupsafter in vitro exposure of the patients' NK cells andother peripheral blood monocytes to E. purpurea. 37E. purpurea extract did not decrease the frequency or se - verity of attacks of recurrent genital herpes in a ran - domized, placebo-controlled crossover - tered intravenously to 15 patients with advanced gas - tric cancer, starting 3 days prior to chemotherapy.Outcomes were compared to historical controls. Leu - kocyte number 2 weeks after chemotherapy was signif - icantly higher in the experimental patients than in thehistorical controls, but no impact on phagocytic activ - ity or lymphocyte subpopulations was observed. 74Herbal Extracts:Upper Respiratory Infections Fluid extracts of E. purpurea are currently most often used for the relief of colds and other URIs. NumerousRCCTs have examined the role of echinacea prepara - tions in the treatment of acute URIs after onset ofsymptoms. Twelve of these studies demonstrated a sig - nificant reduction of the duration and/or severity ofURIs following echinacea treatment. 75-86Two treat - ment studies showed a trend toward significance,87,88 and 2 showed no significance.89,90In the area of preven - tion, only 2 out of 6 studies found a significant reduc - tion in the risk of developing URIs with regular use ofechinacea. 91,92Four other risk studies were nonsignificant.93-96Giles et al published in 2000 a sys - tematic review of clinical studies including both treat - ment and prevention designs.97The majority of studies (13 of 15) indicated effectiveness in treatment ofURIs, but the authors concluded that the results over - all were inconclusive due to deficits in study designand use of nonstandardized dosage forms. A discussion of some of these studies provides some insight into the problems with these clinical trials.Among the treatment studies, Braunig and coworkersstudied the efficacy of 2 different doses (450 mg/dayand 900 mg/day) of expressed juice of E. purpurea roots compared to placebo in 180 volunteers withrecent-onset colds and URIs. 77There were 60 partici- pants in each of the 3 groups\u2014placebo, low-dose, andhigh-dose\u2014and each of the latter 2 groups receivedtwice daily doses of either 1 dropperful (about 4.5 ml)or 2 dropperfuls (about 9 ml) of echinacea juice. Themain parameters for assessing efficacy, as recorded bythe investigators, included a sum score of 8 symptoms(cough, sore throat, nasal symptoms, fatigue, head - ache, tearing, sweats, or chills) and 1 global indicator of severity rated ona0t o3scale as either absent, mild, moderate, or severe. Assessments of efficacy were done after 3 to 4 days and again after 8 to 10 days offollow-up. Whereas the lower dose of echinacea hadlittle impact (not significant), the higher dose of E. purpurea root extract significantly improved the sum score of patients' symptoms and clinical findings atboth follow-up times. This is the only study to date thathas reported a dose-dependency effect of echinaceaon URIs. The same investigators also conducted a placebo- controlled, double-blind study that compared the effi - cacy of an ethanolic extract of E. pallida roots (900 mg/day) and placebo juice for reducing symptomsand infection duration in 160 patients with colds andupper respiratory infections. 76The investigators treated and observed all participants for 8 to 10 daysand categorized colds and URIs as either viral or bacte - rial infections. For bacterial infections, there was a sig - nificantly shorter mean infection duration of 9.8 daysHerbal Immunostimulants INTEGRATIVE CANCER THERAPIES 2(3); 2003 251 by ezgi erdal on September 27, 2010 ict.sagepub.com Downloaded from in the echinacea group compared to 13.0 days in the placebo group. For viral infections, the mean durationwas 9.1 days in the echinacea group compared to 12.9days in the placebo group. However, as in their previ - ous study, the investigators did not report details con - cerning their randomization methods, the drop-outrate for participants, or the adequacy of patients' andphysicians' blinding. Hoheisel et al carried out a double-blind controlled trial of Swedish adults recruited at the first sign of URI,but before a full cold had developed. 80The 120 partici - pants were randomly assigned to either placebo orechinacea (called either Echinagard or Echinacin, acommercial preparation made from the juice fromthe above-ground parts of E. purpurea) and were fol - lowed up until symptoms had resolved. Participantswere instructed to take 20 drops every 2 hours for thefirst day, and 3 times per day thereafter. The investiga - tors reported that 40% of the echinacea group devel - oped a \"real cold,\" compared with 60% of the placebogroup. Among those participants who developed areal cold, the median time to resolution was 4 days inthe echinacea group and 8 days in the placebo group.Among the main limitations of this study were poorlydefined inclusion and exclusion criteria and lack ofevidence of indistinguishability between the placeboand echinacea preparations. Also, as noted by Grimmand Muller, 93one must question the use of retrospec- tively defined criteria for progression from \"first signof a cold\" to \"real cold.\" In another recent study, Brinkeborn et al treated approximately 119 participants for 8 days with 3 dosesof 2 tablets each of Echinaforce, a dried ethanolicextract of E. purpurea. 81An \"overall clinical picture\" and 10 URI symptoms were assessed by physicians on aseverity scale of 0 to 3 on day 1 or day 2 of an acute URI.Based on an intention-to-treat analysis, there was a sta - tistically significant improvement in relief of URIsymptoms, with an indexed score declining from 9.0to 4.1 in the treatment group and from 8.8 to 5.3 in theplacebo group (P = .045). However, the investigators did not adequately report their inclusion criteria,exclusion criteria, and verification of randomizationand blinding procedures. The construction of theindex was, moreover, not explained, and the defini - tion of \"an overall clinical picture\" could be subject toinconsistent or unreliable interpretation. The problem of heterogeneity of echinacea mix - tures (hence lack of comparability between studies) isexemplified in a randomized double-blind trial byDorn. 83One hundred participants were recruited within 2 days of URI onset. Each participant received30 ml of either echinacea or placebo on the first andsecond day, and 15 ml from the third to the sixth day.The outcomes were scored on a 0- to 3-point scale(none, mild, moderate, severe) and included 7 self-reported symptoms as well as several physician-recorded signs. For echinacea versus placebo, therewas a significant reduction in symptoms of sore throat,cough, pharyngitis, and running nose. The echinaceapreparation in this study consisted of Resistan, a com - mercial preparation made primarily from E. angustifolia herb and root but also containing extracts from Eupatorium perfoliatum, Baptisia, and Arnica. This study's findings may be comparable to the one otherResistan study 78but not to the majority of echinacea studies, which focused on E. purpurea. The same prin - ciple applies to the other commercial preparation,Esberitox, which contains E. purpea and E. pallida along with Baptisia andThuja occidentalis. Reitz followed 150 URI patients who received Esberitox-N. 88Outcomes consisting of 8 symptoms, 3 signs, and comprehensive blood work were measuredat 7 and 14 days, and monthly thereafter. The majorityof symptoms and signs at 7 and 14 days were claimed tobe significantly better in the Esberitox group com - pared to placebo. In the report, however, the author provided little statistical analysis to support this con-clusion. Whether echinacea was the active herb in thispreparation cannot be determined. Placebo controls in some studies have sometimes included agents that may protect against colds, or immunologically active ingredients. The studies byReitz, 88Vorberg,87and Vorberg and Schneider82used a placebo containing vitamin C (ascorbic acid). How-ever, in a population-based cross-sectional analysis,Ness et al reported that vitamin C may be protectiveagainst URIs throughout the whole normal range ofdietary intake and lung function. 98A number of clini - cal studies have reported that supplemental vitamin C,either alone or in combination with other micronutri - ents, may enhance immune function 99-103and reduce the risk of respiratory infection.104-108The use of a vita - min with known immunostimulating propertieswould seem to undermine the intended purpose of aplacebo. Equally problematic is the addition of vita - min C to a number of echinacea preparations, whichraises questions of either synergisms or additiveeffects. The issue of possible interactions betweenechinacea and other nutrients must also be consid - ered, as nutritional influences on susceptibility toinfection or on the ability to combat infection are well-documented. 109,110 A well-conducted double-blind, randomized placebo- controlled trial conducted by Barrett et al,90involving 148 students, also used an unrefined echinacea prepa - ration consisting of E. purpurea herb and root and E. angustifolia root, in doses of 1 gram of powdered mate - rial. The preparation was taken 6 times on the first dayof self-reported common colds and 3 times dailyBlock, Mead 252 INTEGRATIVE CANCER THERAPIES 2(3); 2003 by ezgi erdal on September 27, 2010 ict.sagepub.com Downloaded from thereafter. No differences between the echinacea and placebo groups on outcomes of severity, and self-reported symptoms were observed. The mean dura - tion of colds was not significantly different. Associatedwith this trial was the development of a new surveyinstrument for detecting the severity of cold symp - toms; validity testing is planned for this instrument. 111 Availability of a validated symptom assessment ques - tionnaire for studies of this sort should contribute sig - nificantly to future research on echinacea. In contrast with the studies of echinacea's thera - peutic efficacy, there is little evidence supporting theprolonged use of echinacea for the prevention of URIs. Inadequate sample sizes may have accounted for thenull findings of several prevention trials. 91-96Forth and colleagues estimated a relative risk reduction of 38%for nasal symptoms in echinacea versus placebogroups, but the sample size may have been too small(n = 95). 91Schmidt and coworkers reported a 15% lower incidence of infection (for echinacea versus pla - cebo, n = 646) that approached but did not reach sta - tistical significance (P = .08).92A subgroup analysis of those participants judged to be more prone to infec-tion (3 or more colds per year for each of the previous3 years) showed a statistically significant relative riskreduction in echinacea versus placebo. Grimm and Muller randomly assigned 109 patients to either E. purpurea (4 ml fluid extract) or placebo juice twice a day in a double-blind manner for 2months. 93All patients had reported a history of at least 3 colds or other URIs in the preceding year. Eachpatient's physical and hematologic examinations wereperformed at baseline, after 4 weeks, and at the finalvisit 8 weeks after enrollment. Patients were instructedto notify their physician of typical URI signs or symp - toms such as tearing eyes, earache, loss of hearing,stuffed or runny nose, sore throat, coughing, head - ache, or general weakness or tiredness. After 2months, there was a nonsignificant 12% reduction inthe relative risk of developing URIs in the echinaceagroup. The average number as well as mean durationand severity of URIs indicated protective trends forthe echinacea group, but these trends were not statisti - cally significant. In their report, Grimm and Muller acknowledged that the size of the study sample was not large enoughto detect small to moderate differences in the inci - dence and severity of URIs between the echinacea andplacebo groups. Statistical power may have beenenhanced by the use of all types of URIs; however, bymixing different types of infections together, it is possi - ble that the intervention had an impact on one out - come, such as colds, that was obscured by a lack ofimpact on the other URIs. In addition, there were sub - stantial differences in the baseline characteristics ofpatients, such as more women, more patients withinfluenza vaccination, and fewer patients whoengaged in regular sports activities in the echinaceagroup. With the relatively small sample size, such dif - ferences could have markedly affected the associationof the use of echinacea with the risk of URIs. More - over, in their analysis, the investigators did not adjustfor differences in baseline characteristics between thetreatment groups. In the study by Turner et al, 96117 patients were treated with 300 mg of an echinacea preparation for14 days prior to being challenged with infectiverhinovirus. Viral infection was documented by viralculture and antibody responses, as well as a measure ofcold severity. Rhinovirus infection occurred in 44% ofechinacea-treated and 59% of the placebo-treated groups developed colds. Echinaceatreatment did not affect symptom scores. Power calcu - lations for the study showed that it had a 75% power todetect a reduction in cold incidence from 59% to20%, a size of reduction that may be overly optimistic.Phytochemical analysis of the echinacea preparationshowed that it contained 0.16% cichoric acid but noechinacosides or alkamides. The methodology ofTurner et al is admirable in the precision with whichthey were able to induce and assess presence of colds:they did not rely on potentially inaccurate passivereporting of colds, which has been the usual pattern ofother prevention studies. They point out, also, thatnone of the prevention studies (and few of the treat-ment studies) used chemically characterized extracts. Despite the modest methodologic quality of the majority of echinacea trials, one may conclude thatthere is evidence for a beneficial effect of echinaceaon URIs. It is plausible that echinacea could exertsome effects against other forms of infection as well asURIs; however, the current reputation of echinacea asa \"cold remedy\" has narrowed the research focus anddiverted attention from echinacea's potential impacton other types of infection. As Barrett observed in arecent review, 112preclinical studies have demonstrated immunomodulatory effects of echinacea, includingphagocytic leukocyte NK cell activation,macrophage activation, and number andactivity of T- and B B-cell leukocytes. The actual role ofthese effects in the results observed with URIs, how - ever, has not yet been elucidated. Safety and Quality Concerns Safety of echinacea has recently been reviewed.113 None of the clinical trials of echinacea has reportedhigher rates of adverse effects in the treatment than inthe placebo groups. There is some concern, however,with allergic reactions to echinacea, particularlyHerbal Immunostimulants INTEGRATIVE CANCER THERAPIES 2(3); 2003 253 by ezgi erdal on September 27, 2010 ict.sagepub.com Downloaded from among atopic patients. Cases of atopic patients experi - encing reactions to echinacea without prior exposure raise the possibility of cross-reactivity.114No colchicine was found in validated echinacea samples in a recentphytochemical analysis of 26 samples of ginkgo andechinacea purchased from pharmacies in Chicago, 115 in contrast to a previous report suggesting the pres - ence of colchicine in these products (which would notbe expected from chemotaxonomy or previous chemi - cal analysis). Quality of echinacea preparations, how - ever, is far from completely satisfactory. In a recentanalysis of commercially obtained echinacea, only halfof the samples showed chemical evidence of contain - ing the species listed on the label, whereas 10% had nodiscernable echinacea content. 116No evidence of herb-drug interactions was found for echinacea in arecent systematic review. 117 Ginseng Background on Ginseng Ginseng, meaning \"man-root,\" is a slow-growing rootherb that has been used medicinally for more than3000 years by practitioners of traditional Chinesemedicine (TCM). 118Touted by many TCM-trained physicians as the \"root of longevity,\" ginseng is consid-ered to be an adaptogen, a substance thought to en-hance the body's ability to resist physical and mentalstress. 119,120Traditional herbalists also consider it to be a \"general tonic,\" a substance that helps protect thebody against disease, much as one would expect froman immunostimulant. Several species are commonly referred to as gin - seng. The 3 most commonly used are Asian or Koreanginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Meyer [Araliaceae]), American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius Sibe rian more properly called \"eleuthero\"(Eleutherococcus senticosus Maxim. [Araliaceae]). The Panax species are sometimes considered \"true\" gin - seng; eleuthero is not in the same genus but comesfrom the same family and has effects reputedly similarto those of the Panax species. As a result, all 3 forms are typically lumped together as \"ginseng\" and used inter - changeably in Western countries. Other species, quiteunrelated to the Araliaceaeous ginsengs, are alsocalled \"ginsengs\" in commerce and are asserted tohave similar effects. All mentions of the term ginseng in this article that are not further specified will refertoPanax ginseng, the most prominent and best-stud - ied of the ginseng species. American ginseng willrefer to P. quinquefolius, whereas eleuthero will refer toE. senticosus. The main active components of ginseng are glycosidal saponins (glycosylated steroids) known asginsenosides. In P. ginseng, 36 different ginsenosides and many minor constituents (essential oils,phytosterols, amino acids, peptides, vitamins, andminerals) have been extracted and isolated from theroot, stem, and leaves. 119Cui et al reported that the ginsenoside content of 44 different ginseng productsvaried by more than 4-fold (from 2% to 9%). 121In another study, which examined products sold as \"gin - seng,\" the contents of ginseng per capsule, when mea - sured by weight, varied by more than 6-fold, and theginsenoside content per capsule varied by more than20-fold. 122However, the latter study may not have dis - tinguished eleuthero from true ginseng products.Eleuthero contains low concentrations of saponinsand no ginsenosides. 123Another recent effort at assess - ment of the chemical contents of ginseng prepara - tions, the Ginseng Evaluation Program, analyzed mul - tiple lots of 13 standardized ginseng products todetermine the extent to which they met label claims asto percent ginsenosides contained in the products. Ifno claim as to percent ginsenosides was made, thelevel of 4% ginsenosides was used as a comparisonstandard. 124Of the 8 products that made specific claims, 4 contained the claimed levels of ginsenosidesin 80% to 100% of the lots analyzed. For those prod-ucts that did not make specific claims of ginsenosidecontents, 4 of 5 met the standard of 4% totalginsenoside content in all lots tested. Substantial varia-tion does, thus, exist even among standardized prod-ucts in the reliability of product claims. Unstandard-ized products may be assumed to be even morevariable. Preclinical Studies of Ginseng In the discussion of preclinical and clinical work onginseng, we will concentrate on studies of the effects ofP. ginseng on immune parameters. Based on extensive in vitro and in vivo studies, the main activities of gin - seng can be summarized as follows: immunostimulation, increased antitumor activity, - antioxidant activity (increased oxygen radical-scavenging and decreased lipid peroxidation),hypoglycemic activity, and stimulation of the pituitary-adrenocortical system (steroidal effect). 125,126Mitiga - tion of oxidative stress, or excessive free-radical dam - age, may be especially relevant. Many ginsenosidesfunction as antioxidants that protect the outer mem - branes of cells, particularly nerve and immune cells. 127 The cell membranes of circulating lymphocytes have avery high phospholipid content, rendering them vul - nerable to oxidative damage. High concentrations ofreactive oxygen intermediates, such as superoxideand hydrogen peroxide, can suppress NK activity, 128-130Block, Mead 254 INTEGRATIVE CANCER THERAPIES 2(3); 2003 by ezgi erdal on September 27, 2010 ict.sagepub.com Downloaded from whereas antioxidant micronutrients have been re - ported to enhance immune function in laboratory and human studies.131-134 Panax ginseng has been examined for its immunomodulatory properties in vitro and in animal studies. In vitro, ginseng activated macrophages toproduce reactive nitrogen intermediates and becometumoricidal. 135Ginseng enhanced of macrophages in mice infected with Candida albicans136 and in mice exposed to the cold-water swim stress,which causes immunosuppression. 137Ginseng also stimulated basal NK cell activity following subchronicexposure and helped stimulate recovery of NK func - tion in mice that had become immunosuppressed viacyclophosphamide treatment. 138,139These studies did not find that ginseng enhanced mitogen-induced T-lymphocyte proliferation. Similarly, treatment withginseng had no effect on cell-mediated immuneresponses during viral infection 140and actually sup - pressed T-cell proliferation in vitro.141Mouse macrophages were exposed to ginseng and chemokine measured. Sig-nificant but probably biologically increasesin IL-2 expression were observed for ginseng but noteleuthero. No changes in IL-1, IL-15, TNF-, or MIP-1mRNA were observed for either plant. 142Other studies, however, reported that ginseng stimulatedmitogen-induced lymphoproliferation 143and enhanced the graft-versus-host reaction and expul-sion of Trichinella spiralis in mice. 144Ginseng treatment also increased the resistance of athymic rats to Pseudo- monas aeruginosa pneumonia (a lung infection mim - icking cystic fibrosis that is virtually impossible to treat with antibiotics), probably via a cell-mediated mecha - nism. Observations included changes in IgM, lung IL- 4, IFN-, and TNF-.145-147Controlled experiments in farm animals indicate that ginseng has adjuvanteffects in stimulating antibody responses to immuniza - tion against various pathogens in cattle and pigs 148-150 and that subcutaneous ginseng extract injectionsincreased phagocytosis and oxidative activity, aswell lymphocytes ininjected cows with subclinical mastitis; a trend towardreduced bacteria counts in milk from treated animalswas noted. 151 Multiple immune functions may be simultaneously activated by ginseng,122although some studies sug - gested that the immunologic effects are relativelyselective for NK cell activity. 152,153Such disparities may have arisen from differences in dose levels, exposureduration, or composition of the extract (total ginsengor ginsenoside content) between the studies. Oneintriguing study by Mizuno et al indicated thatimmunomodulating effects of wild Panax ginseng may be substantially stronger than those of cultured ordomesticated Panax. 154Whereas hot-water soluble extracts of wild ginseng resulted in increased lympho - cyte proliferation in vitro, extracts from cultured gin - seng did not. In mice, the percentages of T-helper andcytotoxic T cells were significantly higher in animalstreated with wild versus cultured ginseng. The effectsof individual ginsenosides on immune function havealso been studied. One ginsenoside (Rg1) enhancedinterleukin-2 activity, a stimulator of T-cell prolifera - in cell culture 155and in aged rats.156In vitro stud - ies suggested that ginsenosides Rg1 and Rb1 were ableto stimulate the proliferation of human granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells. 157 Clinical Studies of Ginseng More than 300 scientific papers have been publishedon ginseng and its diverse therapeutic effects, empha - sizing enhancement of performance and diminutionof fatigue. Based on the findings of 15 controlled tri - als, Schulz et al conclude that ginseng users show sig - nificant improvements in mood, as well as in physical and intellectual performance. 19Two recent systematic reviews, by Vogler et al and by Bahrke and Morgan, have evaluated these studies.158,159They point out nu- merous problems with the design of the clinical stud-ies and suggest that the performance-enhancingeffects of ginseng is not currently supported by theavailable evidence and that considerable advances instudy design and use of standardized preparations willbe necessary to validate these effects. Relatively few clinical studies have focused on the possible immunomodulating properties of ginseng.Liu et al reported that the ginsenoside Rg1 stimulatedproliferation of lymphocytes drawn from 10 youngand the fluidity of lymphocyte membranes ofthese individuals. 160Such increased fluidity, possibly attributable to the antioxidant activity of ginsenosides,has been reported to enhance cellular immune func - tion in studies with other natural substances. 161,162In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 20 healthyadults, Scaglione et al reported that ginseng extractsled to significantly increased phagocytic activity andchemotaxis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells(PBMCs). 163The stimulatory effect on PBMCs was also demonstrated using the whole ginseng extract inpatients with either chronic fatigue syndrome or AIDS(acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). 37The small size of both studies may have resulted in inadequatestatistical power. In a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind trial, Scaglione et al followed 227 volunteers over a 3-month period who had been treated with an influenzavaccine plus either placebo or 100 mg of a standardginseng extract called G115. 164These participantsHerbal ezgi erdal on September 27, 2010 ict.sagepub.com Downloaded from received the vaccination during the fourth week of the study, which took place at 3 private medical facilities inMilan. The frequency of URIs (colds and flus) showeda highly significant reduction following ginseng treat - ment:only 15 cases of influenza or the common cold occurred in the ginseng group, compared to 42 casesin the placebo group. In addition, antibody titers andNK activity were significant at 8 and 12 weeks:NK activ - ity of the experimental group at both follow-up timeswas twice as high as that of the placebo group. Themain adverse effect of the ginseng appeared to beinsomnia, which was seen in 4 ginseng participantsand in 1 placebo participant; 2 ginseng participantscomplained of nausea, whereas 1 other reportedincreased anxiety. This trial is of interest in view of thevaccine adjuvant activities in animals noted above. 148-151 Cancer patients represent a unique group for the study of these agents because cancer is inherentlyimmunosuppressive due to tumor-derived factors, 165 and standard cancer treatments (notably chemother - apy) are likewise immunosuppressive.166Herbal immune stimulants may be used by patients to attemptto overcome immunosuppression or to counteract theinfections that are of concern among patients withadvanced-stage diseases. It has been hypothesized thatginseng extracts may exert anticancer activity modu-lated by improvements in the cell-mediated immunesystem (most notably macrophage and NK cell activ-ity), which is part of the body's anticancer defenses. 167 Lin et al randomized 63 patients with stomach cancerto chemotherapy combined with injections of anherbal combination, Shenmai, which contains gin - seng, versus chemotherapy alone. 168Shenmai treat - ment resulted in significantly increased T-cell and NKlevels; a trend toward increased T-helper/T-suppressorratios was also reported. In marked contrast, the con - trol group showed decreases in each of these parame - ters. It should be noted that herbs used asimmunostimulants in TCM are typically provided incombination with other herbs; this applies to most gin - seng preparations used in TCM. 169,170In a group of 131 patients receiving radiotherapy for nasopharyngealcarcinoma, 64 were randomly assigned to receive gin - seng polysaccharide injections. 171Clinical remission rates were similar among the treatment and placebogroups, as were overall survival and rate of disease-freeand metastasis-free survival. The activities of NK andLAK cells, and T3 and T4 values in peripheral blood,were significantly higher in the treatment group. Notoxic effects of ginseng injections were observed.Patients with stage 3 gastric cancer taking red ginsengwere observed to have a higher 5-year disease-free sur - vival rate than control patients in a study with 42 par - ticipants. 172Ginseng was also associated withrestoration of CD4 levels to initial preoperative values during adjuvant chemotherapy. No clinical trials on immune effects of Panax quinquefolius have been located, although an in vitro study indicates increased production of cytokines inmacrophages treated with P. quinquefolius extracts. 173 Some clinical trials of eleuthero, however, have beenpublished. In a nonrandomized study, Vereshchaginet al studied the course of infectious disease and hostimmunocompetence in 258 children suffering fromacute dysentery attributed to Proteus infection. 174Treat - ment with eleuthero in combination with antibioticswas found to reduce the duration of disease when com - pared to antibiotics alone. In a placebo-controlledstudy of healthy volunteers, an experimental groupreceived eleuthero extract daily for 4 weeks. Flowcytometric analysis showed a large increase in thenumber of immunocompetent cells in the experimen - tal group, especially T-helper/inducer cells, and alsoincreases in cytotoxic cells and natural killer cells. 175 Safety Safety of ginseng has recently been reviewed else-where. 176The ginsengs are generally considered to have a relatively low level of adverse reactions. Possiblecontraindications include hypertension and use ofwarfarin, for which concerns with drug interactionshave been noted. Some reports of adverse reactions toginseng are attributed to adulterated or contaminatedpreparations. Because of ginseng's antifatigue effect,sleep difficulties may be seen if it is taken in the eve-ning, and excessive doses may result in feelings - tant place in traditional Chinese herbal medicine.Physicians in that system use astragalus for cardiovas - cular disease, and in addition for all diseases caused by\"insufficient qi\" (life energy) that typically include thefollowing symptoms:feelings of weakness, fatigue, ap - athy, poor appetite, clammy hands, and vulnerabilityto infection. 177For many centuries, the herb has been used by TCM practitioners to correct a condition re - ferred to as \"spleen deficiency,\"178which has been asso - ciated with cellular immune dysfunction.179Some preliminary confirmation of these adaptogenic prop - erties is seen in reports that it increases the produc - tion of white blood cells, notably T cells andmacrophages, 180and that it enhances both adrenal181 and cardiovascular functioning.182Block, Mead 256 INTEGRATIVE CANCER THERAPIES 2(3); 2003 by ezgi erdal on September 27, 2010 ict.sagepub.com Downloaded from In the TCM system, astragalus is usually prescribed in combination with other Chinese herbs depending on the diagnosis and desired therapeutic impact. Anumber of Chinese herbs, collectively known as Fu-zheng therapy, are used to enhance host defensesagainst infectious and neoplastic diseases. 183,184Human and animal studies of astragalus, combined with otherherbs in the herbal formula called Juzentaihoto (TenSignificant Tonic Decoction), report immunopot-entiating effects that include increased NK activity andproduction of interleukins. 143This formula was claimed to potentiate the activity of chemotherapydrugs, prevent recurrences, prolong survival time, andreduce host toxicity due to chemotherapy. However,randomized controlled trials have not been con - ducted to test these observations. Major constituents of astragalus found in astragalus are thought to have considerablefree-radical-scavenging ability. 186 Preclinical Studies of Astragalus In vitro and in vivo studies suggest some immune- stimulating effects. Astragalus has shown in vitro al astragalus stimulated murine macrophages to pro - duce interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor.187In mice infected with coxsackie B-3 virus, astragalusblocked viral replication in the myocardial tissue whileimproving myocardial electric activity. 188-190In an in vi - tro study,191proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and production of cytokines andIgM were stimulated by an astragalus extract. The success of recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) in immunotherapy is limited by toxicity at higher doses. Renal cell carcinoma is a highly immunogenic cancer,which suggests that immunotherapy may have a sub - stantial impact on this particular disease. In a study ofmurine renal carcinoma cells, astragalus resulted in a10-fold potentiation in the in vitro antitumor activityof rIL-2-generated LAK cells. 192In 2 separate studies, Chu and colleagues reported in in vitro studies thatastragalus significantly potentiated the LAK cell-inducing activity of rIL-2 against a melanoma cell line:rIL-2 combined with astragalus was more effectivethan rIL-2 used alone with the interleukin doseincreased by 10-fold. 193,194Mice implanted with renal cell carcinoma showed a significantly improved cure rate following treatment with astragalus and another TCM herb, Ligusticum lucidum Miller (Apiaceae), though the response was halved when tumor size doubled.195It has been pro - posed, based on cell culture studies, that astragalusexerts an antitumor effect via abolition of tumor-associated suppression of macrophage function. 196 Additionally, in vivo studies in mice suggest thatastragalus may reverse the suppressed T-cell func - tions induced the chemotherapy agents,cyclophosphamide C.199However, this immune restorative effect was subsequent rat study of cyclophosphamide. 200The polysaccharide astragalan, isolated from astragalus,enhanced the in vitro secretion of tumor necrosis fac - tor in human peripheral mononuclear cells. 201 Clinical Studies of Astragalus Sun et al sought to determine whether astragalus rootextract was capable of restoring a graft-versus-host(GVH) reaction in cancer patients. 202The T-lympho- cytes isolated from 10 cancer patients showed subnor-mal GVH reactions in all 10 compared to the 10healthy controls, all with normal GVH. When the cellsfrom cancer patients were treated with astragalus exvivo, the GVH reaction was restored in 9 of 10 samples.In some samples, the immune restoration even ex-ceeded that seen in normal controls. In a similar studyof GVH reactions in blood samples from 13 cancer pa-tients, Chu et al concluded that treatment ofmononuclear cells with extracts and fractions ofastragalus corrected the immunosuppression ob - served in the lymphocytes of these patients. 203 Hou et al found that 8 grams of astragalus given orally to 14 healthy volunteers for 2 months led to a sig - nificantly increased interferon-inducing ability ofblood cells as compared to controls. 204Two months after therapy had halted, the interferon-inducing abil - ity remained significantly higher than that of the con - trols. In an older article, healthy adults were givenastragalus extract for 20 days, and increases in serumIgM, IgE, and CAMP were observed. 205In another study, 54 consecutive cases of small-cell lung cancer(SCLC) were treated with a combination of conven - tional treatment, astragalus, and other Chinese herbs.Ten out of 12 SCLC patients, including 4 with exten - sive disease, survived for between 3 and 17 years whenthe herbs were included with chemotherapy and radi - ation. 206In a randomized study involving 120 patients, an astragalus preparation was administered intrave - nously along with cancer chemotherapy. The treatedgroup showed a lower incidence of disease progres - sion, smaller chemotherapy impact on white bloodcells and platelets, improved CD4/CD8 ratios,Herbal on September 27, 2010 ict.sagepub.com Downloaded from increased IgG and IgM levels, and higher Karnofsky scores relative to the control group.207Patients with gastrointestinal cancers were injected with a ginsengand astragalus preparation in a Chinese study. It wasobserved that patients in the treatment group had alower degree of suppression of white blood cell count;differences in phagocytic index and percentage ofphagocytes were reported as well. 208 Viral myocarditis patients, when given an oral extract of astragalus, showed improved T3, T4, andT4/T8 cell ratios, indicating an enhancement of theimmune response. 209Natural killer cell activity was reported to be enhanced in myocarditis patientsdosed with astragalus extract for 3-4 months. 210Finally, 28 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)had significantly lower natural killer cell activity whencompared to normal controls. Preincubation of theirperipheral blood mononuclear cells with astragalusstimulated natural killer cell activity in SLE patientsand in healthy controls. 211 Safety Astragalus membranaceus appears to have a very low tox- icity. A report indicates an LD50 in mice of greaterthan 1 gm/kg. 212Astragalus is traditionally used for cardiovascular conditions in TCM. Reports from stud-ies in rabbits indicate potential hypotensive activity 213; patients who are hypotensive or are taking antihyper-tensive drugs may need to avoid use of large doses ofthe herb although no clinical observations of adverseeffects from this hypotensive activity have been noted.Cardiotonic activity, antiarrhythmic activity, and im - provement of myocardial ischemia have also were re - ported in laboratory studies. 214-216The antiarrhythmic activity may have been due to antiviral effects, as it wasreported from rat myocytes infected with Coxsackievirus; other antiviral effects have also been reportedfor this herb from in vitro studies. 217 Discussion This review indicates that immunomodulating activityof various types has been reported for all 3 herbs, in - cluding enhancement of levels or activities of specificcell types associated with disease resistance to infec - tion and cancer. All 3 have demonstrated cytokine-modulating and either macrophage- or NK-cell-activating activity in vitro and in animal studies. Allhave also had, to a greater or lesser extent, trials in hu - mans that indicate relevance in some immune-relatedconditions. But the quality of available preclinical evi - dence is mixed in the 3 herbs, and specific designproblems pertain to the clinical studies of the 3 agents.In addition, overarching concerns about the design ofclinical trials of herbs used in traditional Chinese med -icine and the lack of phytochemical standardizationcloud the meaning of existing work. The relevance ofthese herbal immune modulators in cancer treatmentis also still in question. Echinacea Echinacea has substantial support from randomizedcontrolled trials, though studies of higher quality areneeded, particularly in the area of prevention. Spe - cifically, the clinical efficacy of various preparations ofechinacea in the treatment of acute URIs has beendemonstrated in more than a dozen well-designed tri - als. As noted above, however, many of the clinical trialshave limitations that cast some doubt on their find - ings, and it is not certain how immune effects reportedin preclinical and human studies relate to effects onURIs; since antiviral and other activities have been re - ported for echinacea, it is conceivable that these couldbe responsible for the effects on duration and severityof URIs. In addition to the problems discussed abovesuch as sample size, inclusion of potentially immuno - logically active materials in placebo preparations, and lack of clarity of inclusion and exclusion criteria in tri-als, the study of the effects of echinacea on URIs wouldbe greatly clarified by the use of reliable and validatedmeasures of assessment of URI symptoms. A wide vari-ety of physician and patient assessments of URI symp-toms have been used in existing echinacea trials, notall of which have been validated, casting into questionthe basic outcome measures of these studies, and thusthe clinical import of their findings. Finally, no testingof the effects of echinacea on URIs in immune-com-promised cancer patients has been published. Ginseng Preclinical studies on ginseng have indicated a num - ber of immunologically relevant biological activities, including activation of macrophages, increases in NKcell activity and lymphocyte proliferation, increasedgraft-versus-host reactivity, and antioxidant activity.Substantial clinical work on ginseng has been done inthe area of fatigue and enhancement of performance;however, many fewer studies have been reported inthe widely available literature on the immunologicaleffects of ginseng in humans. There have been reportsof increases in lymphocyte proliferation andphagocytic activity in human trials, and increased re - sponse to vaccination. There are few reports on immu - nological effects of eleuthero in humans. Few trialshave been done on the ability of ginseng to affect thecourse of specific diseases that have strong immuno - logical components, although the Chinese literaturecontains a large number of reports of treatment of spe - cific diseases with multicomponent herbal prepara - tions that contain ginseng along with other herbs.Block, Mead 258 INTEGRATIVE CANCER THERAPIES 2(3); 2003 by ezgi erdal on September 27, 2010 ict.sagepub.com Downloaded from Astragalus Astragalus has been reported to have antibacterial and antiviral activity in vitro, in addition to immunologicalactivities such as potentiation of rIL-2 generation ofLAK cell antitumor activity, and rather equivocal re - sults on reversal of T-cell suppression after administra - tion of cyclophosphamide in vivo. Specific extractsand fractions of astragalus have been reported to haveimmunological activities in ex vivo settings, includingincreasing activity in graft-versus-host rejection mod - els. Antiviral activity has been noted for the herb. Verylittle clinical work on astragalus is available, althoughsome human studies do indicate stimulation of activityof immune cells in clinical populations. As is the casewith ginseng, the Chinese literature contains many re - ports of clinical uses of astragalus in multicomponentherbal preparations that are outside the scope of thisarticle. Clinical Trials on TCM Herbs The various design deficits noted in the Chinese stud - ies of astragalus and ginseng arise in part from the medical philosophy of TCM, according to which treat-ment must be highly individualized. 218There are sev- eral inherent difficulties in studies of ginseng and astragalus in the context of the individualized proto-cols used in traditional Chinese medicine. The classi-cal Chinese herbal prescriptions often includebetween 5 and 10 botanicals per formula. Althoughthese are typically provided in very specific propor-tions, there may be hundreds of potentially active in-gredients. In a recent detailed comparison of theconstituents of some of these herbal formulas,Borchers and colleagues concluded that many ofthese formulas have similar compositions, often differ - ing by only 1 or 2 components. 219Astragalus and gin - seng, considered to be highly effective tonics oradaptogens, are among the most commonly includedcomponents. Borchers et al suggest that mixtures ofseveral crude extracts could have greater beneficial ef - fects compared with a single plant extract because ofsynergistic interactions as well as interactions that di - minish possible adverse side effects of one or morecomponents. Another proposed rationale for herbalcombinations is the prevention of the gradual declinein effectiveness observed when single drugs are ad - ministered over long periods of time. 220 Such formulas, however, do not readily lend them - selves to the Western model of analyzing a solitaryagent for a specific effect. It would certainly be possi - ble to study standard multicomponent agents in ran - domized trials. However, as individual responses toherbal extracts may vary, it seems reasonable to con - clude that such variations would only increase withincreasing complexity of the herbal mixtures. Thiswould thus require conducting studies with muchlarger sample sizes than are typical in Western modelsoutside of expensive multisite trials used late in drugdevelopment. Large-scale studies conducted on com - plex formulas were not included in this article, as theydid not conform to the single-agent emphasis favoredby the Western scientific model. However, it should berecognized that in studying TCM herbal medicines inisolation, there is a risk that some biological effects,mediated by synergistic activities, may be overlookedqualitatively or quantitatively. Chemical Standardization This is perhaps the most worrisome concern with theherbal immune stimulants, since lack of standardiza - tion casts doubt on the very identity of the formulasused, in both preclinical and clinical testing. Assess - ment of the phytochemical composition of the avail - able preparations of these herbs is complicated by thelack of agreement on acceptable standards and conse - quent confusion as to the clinical relevance of work done on different types of extracts. For echinacea, several different chemical com- pounds with evidence of some type of relevant biologi- cal activity have been described, and formulas havebeen made that are standardized on each of these.Preclinical and clinical studies have used a wide varietyof extract types, with little attention being paid towhether the biological activities reported for theseextracts (such as increases in macrophage activation,increased phagocytic activity, increases NK cellnumbers and increases in cytokine secretion) are infact directly relevant to treatment of common URIs. Ifwe are to have a scientifically meaningful assessmentof the effect of echinacea, the question of whethereven standardized echinacea preparations actually areexerting effects on URIs through immune mecha - nisms needs to be studied with greater seriousness\u2014preferably before more randomized clinical trials onechinacea preparations take place. The possibility thatechinacea preparations might act through symptom-relieving, rather than immune, mechanisms shouldalso probably be explored. The methods of bioassay-guided fractionation, commonly used in the discoveryof natural-product drugs, can be used to determinewhich specific components of echinacea or otherherbal species are active in specific tests of biologicalactivity. These methods are now being used in theanalysis of herbal medicines to produce specific con - clusions as to the active compounds and actual biolog - ical activities of herbs that can then be used to guidestandardization. 221 In the case of ginseng, standardization on ginsenoside content has been agreed to be the mostrelevant marker, at least for fatigue and performance-Herbal Immunostimulants INTEGRATIVE CANCER THERAPIES 2(3); 2003 259 by ezgi erdal on September 27, 2010 ict.sagepub.com Downloaded from related studies. There is a minimal amount of evi - dence that ginsenosides are the immunologically active components in ginseng, in addition to a strongmedical tradition indicating that ginseng may be use - ful to increase bodily resistance. Commercial ginsengpreparations reliably standardized on ginsenosidecontent are widely available and have been used innumerous performance-related clinical studies. Pre - clinical investigation of ginseng's immune activitiesshould proceed using either ginsenosides orginsenoside-standardized extracts, to determinewhether the ginsenosides are indeed immunologicallyactive, or whether other components of the species\u2014which can be isolated through bioassay-guided frac - tionation\u2014are the active components. Once this hasbeen determined, clinical studies of ginseng in condi - tions for which immune system activation would bebeneficial can be rationally undertaken. Randomizedstudies of ginsenoside-standardized extracts beforethis preclinical step is completed can certainly bedone, but if we do not know whether the ginsenosidesactually have the biological activity necessary to affectimmune modulation, we risk studying the wrongagent. Smaller-scale pilot trials or retrospective studiesof ginseng preparations in immunologically relateddiseases may make some contribution to the study ofginseng in assisting in the determination of the condi-tions for which ginseng use might be most fruitful, andthus guiding the choice of bioactivities to be studied. Astragalus, like many herbal medicines, is currently in the status of a traditional medicine remedy forwhich some evidence of specifically active compoundshas been published, and which has a small back - ground of clinical trials with some intriguing results. Like ginseng, there is a strong traditional use justifica - tion for the investigation of astragalus as a resistance- enhancing herb. Much further basic research needs tobe conducted to determine the constituents ofastragalus that affect the immune system, and their rel - evance to specific diseases. As is the case with ginseng,small-scale pilot trials or retrospective studies ofastragalus used as a traditional medicine might givesome guidance as to the selection of appropriateimmune activities for study. At the present time, thereare no reliable standardized extracts of astragalus thatcould be used in clinical trials. Herbal Immune Stimulants in Cancer As reviewed above, all 3 of these herbs have some re - cords of use in cancer and may be of interest to cancerpatients who are suffering from immune suppression,or who are searching for additional agents withantitumor activity. Modest clinical and immunologicimprovements were reported in patients withhepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer whowere given a preparation that included echinacea and a thymus-stimulating agent, 39,40although another study recorded no increases in cytokine incancer patients given echinacea. 54Tests of echinacea in leukemic mice indicated increases in NK cells.57 Reports of enhancement of NK activity and macrophage activity by ginseng suggest usefulness in cancer. Clinical studies of ginseng in cancer are lim - ited to those of herbal combinations in the Chinese lit - erature, such as those reported for the Shenmai com - bination, which increased T-cell and NK activityduring chemotherapy. 168Ginseng has been reported to stimulate NK cells in healthy adults and in AIDSpatients, 37and in mice.135,143 In animal studies, astragalus was reported to reverse the suppression of T-cell function aftercyclophosphamide treatment in mice, but notrats. 197,200It was also reported to increase antitumor activity of LAK cells from cancer patients.193,194 Astragalus extracts restored the suppressed activitiesof T-lymphocytes and monocytes from cancer patientsin a local graft-versus-host reaction model. Finally,herbal combinations containing astragalus and gin-seng are reported to have immune effects in TCMhuman studies. 204,205,207,209 Several of these reports indicate stimulation of NK cell activity. NK cells play an integral role in host resis-tance to tumor growth 222and in the control of solid tumor metastases.223,224NK cells also play important roles in combating viral infections, as these cells cancause the lysis of virus-infected cells. 225This may have special relevance to cancer patients, since infection isa common cause of death, frequently occurring as aconsequence of chronic immune dysfunction andtreatment-induced granulocytopenia (notablyneutropenia). 226,227Low NK activity has been corre - lated with a poor prognosis for cancers of the lung,228,229 breast,230bladder,231stomach,232and colon.233,234The diverse activities of NK cells may become profoundlyimpaired due to surgery or chemotherapy, 235as well as marijuana smoking (which may be favored by somecancer patients for relief of nausea and other symp - toms), 236morphine,237sleep disturbances (common among stressed cancer patients),238xenobiotic expo - sures,239,240and emotional distress241; emotional distress accompanied by low NK function has been found tobe correlated with breast cancer prognosis. 242,243 These studies offer intriguing glimpses of potential clinical helpfulness in cancer but no solid evidence ofusefulness either in restoring suppressed responses orfighting malignancy. However, because of the lack ofeffective conventionally tested agents in many can - cers, the clinical urgency facing many patients, andthe good safety record of the herbal immune stimu - lants, patients may choose to use these herbs with theBlock, Mead 260 INTEGRATIVE CANCER THERAPIES 2(3); 2003 by ezgi erdal on September 27, 2010 ict.sagepub.com Downloaded from understanding that their efficacy in those with malig - nant disease is not clearly established and that useful - ness to the individual patient will be observed empiri - cally, rather than supported in an evidence-based manner. Conclusion This review has focused on 3 representative examplesof herbs classically used as immunostimulants:echinacea, ginseng, and astragalus. Although by nomeans exhaustive, the review demonstrates some pre - clinical and clinical research indicating beneficial ef - fects of each of these botanical agents on immunefunction. In particular, the safety profile of echinaceaappears favorable, and the use of echinacea productsas early treatment for URI seems reasonably sup - ported. A few studies for each herb indicate some rele - vance for use in restoring the immunosuppressioncommonly seen in cancer patients; such use, however,would have to be undertaken with the understandingthat minimal scientific evidence supports it. One pos - sibility is that herbal agents may be used in conjunc- tion with more conventional forms of immuno-therapy, such as vaccines, to further enhance immuneresponsiveness in the oncologic setting; to our knowl-edge, such combinations have yet to be investigated.Numerous immunologic mechanisms are likely in-volved in the various actions of each of these agents,and the mechanisms become complicated by addi-tional synergisms that are introduced when the herbsthemselves are combined, as in TCM. Additionally,limited studies with astragalus and ginseng demon - strate some potential for tumoricidal and survival im - pact. Whether or not the elucidation of these mechanisms will improve our understanding of the ef - ficacy and safety of these herbal immunostimulants, there is a need for well-designed studies of thephytochemical standardization and the potentialimmune-enhancing value of echinacea, ginseng, andastragalus. With their low toxicity and long history ofempirical support, the use of these herbs asimmunostimulants may have therapeutic applicationsin the setting of integrative medicine. References 1.
