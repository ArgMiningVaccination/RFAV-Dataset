As an escaping strategy, the RBD of the [virus]is highly variable, evolving [mutations]to thwart a natural [immune response]or [vaccination]. Targeting non-RBD regions of the S [protein]thus provides a viable alternative to generating potential, robust NAbs. Using a pre- [pandemic]combinatorial antibody [library]of 1011, through an alternate negative and positive [screening]strategy, 11 non-RBD-targeting [antibodies]are identified. Amongst one NAb that binds specifically to the N-terminal domain of the S [protein], SA3, shows mutually non-exclusive binding of the [angiotensin-converting enzyme 2]receptor with the S [protein]. SA3 appears to be insensitive to the conformational change and to interact with both the \"open\" and \"closed\" configurations of the trimeric S [protein]. SA3 shows compatible neutralization as S-E6, an RBD-targeting NAb, against the wild type and variant of concern (VOC) B.1.351 (Beta) of the [SARS-CoV-2]pseudo [virus]. More importantly, the combination of SA3 with S-E6 is synergistic and recovers from the 10-fold loss in neutralization [efficacy]against "}
