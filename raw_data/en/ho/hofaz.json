The Subcommittee accepted the significant amount of work and responsibility to create the plan presented here. The Subcommittee met regularly and publicly as an entire body, and developed workgroups with specific areas of focus. The workgroups made the Subcommittee more efficient by allowing multiple topics to be explored simultaneously. These workgroups convened weekly during the summer and drafted the substance of the plan presented here. Both the Subcommittee and workgr oups were supported by subject matter experts, community member input , and background research. As part of this process, at the request of the Subcommittee, Impact Justice also conducted focus groups and interviews with current ly and formerly incarcerated youth, both locally at the Juvenile Justice Center (JJC) and virtually with those in state custody at the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ). The input of these young people was invaluable, and we sincerely thank them for their willingness to share their experiences and recommendations with us. Subcommittee Composition & Membership Our Subcommittee was approved by the Board of Supervisors, whose members are included in the following table: Agency Name & Title Agency Name & Title Chief Probation Officer (Chair) Marcus Dawal, Interim Chief Probation Officer Juvenile Justice Delinquency Prevention Commission Vamsey Palagummi, Chair District Attorney's Office Matthew Golde, Assistant District Attorney Delinquency Prevention Network Emily Young , Co-Chair or Lynn Gardner , (Designee) Co-Chair Public Defender's Office Alphonso Mance, Deputy Public Defender Free Our Kids Coalition Hayden Renato Department of Social Services Michelle Love, Assistant Agency Director Community Member , District 1 Representative Caryn Quezada Department of Mental Health Juan Taizan, Community Member , Davida Scott Impact Justice: 4 Forensic, Diversion, & Re-Entry Services Director District 2 Representative Office of Education Monica Vaughan, Chief of Schools Community Member , District 3 Representative Erin Palacios Court Representative Honorable Judge Ursula Jones Dickson Community Member , District 4 Representative Trevor Arceneaux Community Member , District 5 Representative Kelly Thompson Purpose & Intentions Moving Forward This SB 823 Realignment Plan, if approved by the Board of Supervisors, shall be submitted to the Office of Youth and Community Restoration (OYCR) no later than January 1, 2022, and will r emain in effect through April 30, 2022. The SB 823 Subcommittee will convene to review, revise, and update this document prior to the next required submission to the OYCR, which is on or before May 1, 2022. The SB 823 Subcommittee will do so annually in o rder to update and develop the SB 823 Realignment Plan for submission to the OYCR on or before May 1 of each year. However, the SB 823 Subcommittee will undertake a complete review of the SB 823 Plan every third year , beginning with the plan due on or befo re May 1, 2025. It is the intent of this Subcommittee to remain regularly engaged in the SB 823 planning and to receive regular reports on implementation , conven ing monthly through April 2022 and at least quarterly thereafter. It is intended that the stru cture and composition of the Subcommittee remain the same. Bylaws and procedures for member selection and approval will be developed. Clear procedures regarding membership turnover, including setting term limits, will also be articulated. The following Cha rter and Values statements were developed by the Subcommittee to clearly articulate and guide its work. Charter The Alameda County SB 823 Subcommittee is charged with preparing a plan to serve youth realigned under SB 823. This plan shall be comprehensive, addressing not only Impact Justice: 5 detention and housing, but treatment, services, reentry preparation, and reentry as well. Ultimately, this will prepar e young people for success outside of the system. We are charged to identify and use evidence -based and promising practices and programs that improve the outcomes of youth and public safety, reduce the transfer of youth into the adult criminal justice system, ensure that dispositions are in the least rest rictive appropriate environment, reduce and then eliminate racial and ethnic disparities, and reduce the use of confinement in the juvenile justice system by utilizing community -based responses and interventions. Values The Alameda County SB 823 Subcommi ttee is committed to the success of system - involved youth through the implementation of innovative strategies that promote healing and address their needs, the needs of victims and families, improve public safety, and promote overall community wellbeing. The Subcommittee recognizes that system -involved youth have overwhelmingly experienced trauma and neglect on both individual and systemic levels, which has often resulted in their system involvement. Thus, the Subcommittee considers that providing youth wi th healing -centered and trauma -informed services that address these harms is vital in preventing harms from recurring . To this end, we are committed to complying with the mandates of SB 823, ensuring that impacted youth have access to education, programmin g, treatment, and services that are both developmentally and therapeutically appropriate. We are determined to go above and beyond these requirements whenever possible, with the ultimate goal of best supporting youth success outside of the system. We also recognize that family (defined as broadly as possible) relationships and reunification are often key components of successful treatment and reentry, and will seek every opportunity to promote and strengthen familial connections. We a cknowledg e that victim s of crime and communities have been harmed, and approach those harms directly. We address the needs of victims , in compliance with the California State C onstitution and Mar sy's Law, and provide a meaningful opportunity for accountability . The Subcommittee is strongly committed to the values and principles of restorative justice , which centers the needs of the person harmed while providing support and structure to the young person as they seek to make things right. The work of the Subcommittee is guided by a public health approach and is informed by evidence -based practices that improve outcomes for system -involved youth, reduce recidivism, and increase public safety. The Subcommittee recognizes that the juvenile justice system disproportionately impacts co mmunities, families, and youth of color. To this end, we are committed to reducing and eliminating racial/ethnic disparities and to promoting racial /ethnic equity through culturally affirming practices and programming. Impact Justice: 6 Defining the Target Population1 Overview As of March 2021, there were 21 youth from Alameda County committed to the California Division of Juvenile Justice and a total of 55 youth detained in the Juvenile Justice Center (includ ing 44 youth pending resolution of 707(b) offenses ). This num ber represents 80% of the current population. The section that follows provides an overview of the 21 youth currently committed to DJJ, with the earliest registered in 2014. Since the passage of Proposition 57 , in 2016, there have been three youth transfer s from Alameda County to the adult system. Demographics Youth's age s at commitment ranged from 14 to 25 years old , with a mean age of 18.9. Male youth comprised most of DJJ's population (20 , or 95% , of all youth ) , compared to one female youth (5%). Youth of color were disproportionately committed to DJJ , and were mostly Black (57%), Hispanic (38%) , and Asian (5%) . Primary Offenses All of the youth committed (100%) to DJJ had WIC -707(b) offenses. The most common offenses were murder (33%) and robbery (24%). Youth committed for assault with a firearm or a deadly weapon and voluntary manslaughter each accounted for 14% of commitments. Youth committed for attempted murder, lewd act with a minor, and rape each made up 5% of the remaining commitments. Prior System Contact Prior to DJJ commitment, youth had an average of 5 referrals to Probation. Almost half (48%) had up to 3 referrals while just under one-fourth ( 24% ) had 7 or more referrals. The average age at first referral was 14 years old , with a bout 43% aged 13 or younger and 19% aged 17 or older. The average span of time between a youth's first referral and DJJ commitment was 4.4 years. Significantly, no youth went from first referral to DJJ commitment in under one year, and only 2 youth (9.5%) went fro m first referral to DJJ commitment in under 2 years. The offenses for these two youth were murder and lewd act with a minor. Before the DJJ commitment, youth were booked into custody an average of 6.2 times, with 24% of them having 10 or more bookings pri or to commitment. On average, before their 1 Based on data provided by Alameda County Probation Department. Impact Justice: 7 DJJ commitment , youth had 4 true2 findings. Approximately 1 in 3 (33%) youth had 5 or more true findings before the DJJ commitment. Projected Number of Youth to be Served Based on the past five -year average (201 5-2020), Alameda County Probation Department (ACPD) has projected the number of youth expected to be served. Although Alameda County only committed an average of 6 youth per year over the last five years, an analysis of 2020 disposition data showed there w ere 70 youth who were eligible for commitment with 707(b) offenses sustained . Based on the past 5 -year average in Alameda County (excluding 2019 as an outlier) , the ACPD projects the DJJ will serve 7 youth per year. The past three -year average length of st ay for Alameda County youth in DJJ is 2.8 years, plus an estimated year -long average pre -disposition court process is also used to calculate the projected number of youth to be served by year. It is important to note that the length of the court process v aries by individual youth due to a number of factors, and the number of youth that may be booked in on 707(b) charges in the future can be affected by variables not factored in this projection . Such variables may include the dispositional track and broader sociodemographic, political, and economic factors in Alameda County (e.g., an increase in the crime rate ). One factor that we expect will have an immediate impact on average length of stay is the proportion of youth adjudicated for murder and other seriou s crimes. The average dispositions in these cases are much longer than the \"average .\" The average length of stay for 1st degree murder , for example, was 60.9 months in 2020 (approximately 5 years) and 47 months (approximately 4 years) in 2019 .3 In the future, t his data will be tracked very closely to ensure that youth are being retained in the juvenile justice system and not being transferred into the adult system. Similarly, data will be tracked to ensure that net -widening doesn't occur. Given that Ala meda County has utilized less severe options for many 707(b) cases in the past, it is intended that these less severe options continue to be utilized wherever possible. Retaining the Target Population ACPD strongly believes that youth are best served clos e to home \u2014 enabling smoother community reintegration as well as more opportunities for family engagement, access to high quality services , programming in the local facility and community. ACPD recognizes the harms caused by any system contact, but also rec ognizes that youth transferred to the adult criminal court face some of the most harmful outcomes (e.g., increased recidivism rates, increased likelihood of victimization during incarceration, poorer mental health 2 This refers to a formal finding , made by the Court , that the youth was involved in a delinquent act . 3 Court decisions determine what the length of stay will be. Impact Justice: 8 outcomes, etc.) . Specifically, transferrin g youth to adult courts tends to increase their recidivism rates, while processing youth in juvenile courts is related to reduced recidivism rates. Additionally, sentencing youth to adult prisons tends to aggravate mental health issues which, in turn, is a ssociated with prison misconduct (particularly for younger inmates ). While the decision to transfer youth lies with the Court, ACPD is committed to doing all in its power to ensure that youth remain out of adult criminal courts . Thus, ACPD will prevent an increase in transferred youth by: A. Ensuring secure -track placement opt ions are available for consideration by the court. This not only refers to the Secure Placement Treatment Facility (SPT F), but also the array of programs and services that will be utilized to address the needs of the youth committed to the SB 823 program.4 B. Establishing sufficient high -quality programs that are culturally responsive, trauma - informed, evidence -based, age appropriate, centered on youth and family engagement, and based on positive youth development. This will ensure that programming approach youth with specificity and in a way that they are able to relate to and engage with. Culturally affirming staff will also support youth. C. Guaranteeing that specialized treatment and programming options meet high - need youth that garner confidence of juvenil e court judges. D. Certifying that formal recommendations from Probation to the Court , for adult transfers , are approved at the Chief Probation Officer level. This ensures several layers of review and discussion before a recommendation for transfer proceeds. A detailed, updated report from the Multi -Disciplinary Team ( MDT ) and the youth's counsel will be considered and submitted as part of the overall recommendation. E. Tracking d ata of youth transfers to adult criminal court and report ing to justice partners to monitor and review at least bi -annually and at all SB 823 Subcommittee meetings. This will ensure a level of oversight and input, contributing toward the goals of transparency and fairness. Both the juvenile justice system and adult criminal system aim t o protect the safety of the public, but the adult system is arguably more punitive and focuses on retribution, while the juvenile system is designed to be rehabilitative. As stated in the language of SB 823, the goal of the legislation is not to increase t he number of transfers to adult criminal court, and ACPD clearly states its commitment to prioritize juvenile justice system retention. 4 The SB 823 program is intended to be a high -quality program that relies on data -driven decision making that incorporates feedback from youth as well. Impact Justice: 9 Promoting Healthy Adolescent Development Youth are more susceptible to engaging in risky behaviors due to the developmen t of the brain's prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for complex reasoning and functioning, and will not fully mature until their mid -twenties.5 Youth are more likely to be impulsive, fail to evaluate the impacts of their decisions, and assess long -term consequences. 6 Transfers to adult court can potentially entrench youth in a life of criminal behavior that they otherwise would have matured away from. Youth afforded the opportunity to remain in the juvenile system will, on the other hand, hav e access to age -appropriate education and rehabilitative services that are designed for them. One approach that takes this perspective into account is known as positive youth justice , which is built upon the idea that youth can be developed with in a caring community of adults who work to help them learn and practice key skills. The goal of this approach is to recognize that many of the youth's behaviors and challenges a re developmentally typical (rather than pathological and/or abnormal) responses to unaddr essed needs. ACPD recognizes that many of the youth from the target population may not have had the support and experiences necessary to build the core skills to manage emotion and make effective decisions. When programming and services prioritize skill de velopment for all youth, their mental, physical, psychological, and emotional wellness benefit . Therapeutic Milieu ACPD recognizes the need for a new approach to in -custody and in -community programming , designed to better serve the long -term needs of youn g people and the public. Based partially on its existing TAY programs and the programming available at Camp Sweeney, ACPD will develop a new program to serve youth committed to the secure placement treatment facility. The County's new program will focus on supporting youth in their development of core competencies (described below ). The program will be designed to both meet and flexibly respond to youth's individual needs. The goal of this program i s not to \"save \" young people, but rather to provide an enriching, nurturing environment that supports their inherent potential to succeed as individuals. Both the program and the environment will be designed to ensure that all youth feel safe, cared for, a nd valued. Thus, ACPD shall construct a developmentally appropriate and restorative \"milieu ,\" or social environment . This approach will enable all service providers to contribute to a 5 Cohen, A. O., & Casey, B. J. (2014). Rewiring juvenile justice: the intersection of developmental neuroscience and legal policy. Trends in Cognitive Sciences , 18(2), 63 -65. 6 Giedd, J. N. (2008). The teen brain: insights from neuroimaging. Journal of Adolescent Health , 42(4), 335 -343. Impact Justice: 10 comprehensive program designed to address the core needs of youth. The c oming sections shall provide the framework for this milieu . Focus on Relationships Decades of research on therapeutic modalities7 related to both mental health and delinquency have produced a set of best practices . The quality of the relationship between the helper and the youth is one component of success , and reflects a more general indicator of long -term wellbeing: fostering quality social connections . The attributes identified as most important across the literature include the ability to empathize, demonstrate commitment and belief in the young person, display warmth and authenticity, and \"recognize and acknowledge the 'reality' of the 'lived experiences' of young people .\"8 ACPD shall commit to develop a comprehensive team of staff \u2014through training and instructive supervision \u2014who will collaborate with contracted providers and volunteers to offer an array of services and supports for youth. A secondary component for long -term success is that these trusted relationships have the capacity to t ranscend the walls of the facility and follow the youth in meaningful ways into their communities of origin or chosen living environments. In focus groups with youth previously served by the DJJ system, Impact Justice facilitators noted that youth identifi ed mentors \"that you really connect with one -on-one\" as instrumental in helping them successfully transition back into their communities. They also stressed that they needed mentors to have regular contact with them on an individual basis , especially in th e first few weeks after their transition. Achieving this goal entails b uilding the social environment in such a way to include , from the beginning, mentors who can advocate for and support the youth throughout the process. Research related to services that were most effective in reducing recidivism lists mentoring as one of the most effective interventions in recidivism reduction .9 Additional evidence for a relationship -based approach to the provision of service and supports comes from the literature on im plementation of Positive Youth Justice10. Credible Messengers 7 Therapeutic modalities refers to the \"wide array of treatments and interventions that provide a variety of therapeutic benefits\" (Bellew, Mich lovitz, and Nolan Jr. 2016, 3).

Positive youth justice: Framing justice interventions using the concepts of positive you th development Impact Justice: 11 Incorporating Credible Messengers into a secure treatment facilit y requires much more than adding a program that provides time, space , and opportunity to meet with youth residing there. While that is an important component, credible messengers in secure facilities will be given a broad array of responsibilities supported by the facility leadership. These responsibilities require the abil ity of Credible Messengers to have access to youth throughout their waking hours (and a presence at critical late -night hours , when many youth struggle the most). In order to leverage the ir knowledge and perspective with in the facility milieu, Credible Messengers will be incorporated into staff meetings, trainings , and other processes that inform the way the facility is run. Incorporation of Credible Messengers and their collaboration with clinical, restorative , and other treatment -oriented personne l requi res probation and institutional staff to relinquish some portion of their control in defining and facilitating overall youth engagement. The purpose of incorporating credible messengers from the community is to minimize institutionalization and maximize po sitive ties in the community. In essence, if youth cannot be in the community, then the effort should be to bring the community to them. In order to successful ly prepare youth for safe and successful community reintegration , , they have to develop trusting, positives ties with in the community . The institution will support that process by \"making room\" for Credible Messengers to contribute to such a culture and milieu . Restorative Justice Practices The milieu must also account for inequities , social injustices , and violations of social contract s that are specific to the youth's experiences. Common models for intervention focus on \"changing\" a young person's way of thinking to reflect a more pro -social perspective. However, the lives of many youth who find themselves involved with the justice system have been impacted by severe inequities, trauma , and violence that contribute to ingrained ways of thinking consistent with the ir realit ies. Retraining and re - evaluating one's thinkin g will occur in the context of a safe restorative environment. Restorative justice (RJ)/transformative justice principles and practices must guide the SB 823 milieu community structure and all related policies, practices, programs , and procedures. At the core of such a program is a kind of relation al, physical , and emotional safety, as well as transparency and empowerment. Different from the inequitable circumstances and social injustices that have existed within the youth's community of origin, ACPD will ensure that the social environment with in this community is firmly steeped in restorative/t ransformative justice principles and practices. Restoration will not only be practice for youth , in address ing harm they may have caused but also a n opportunity to offer social environment services to help the youth identify and begin to find ways to heal harms that they have endured. This form of healing makes room for the youth to understand and accept responsibility for their actions while learning healthy ways to respond to their own experiences. Impact Justice: 12 The milieu's core values and practices will stand on the pillars of restorative justice : accountability, competency development , and community safety . It will also incorporate common RJ core values : equity , respect , honesty , accountability , empowerment, and hope . ACPD will ensure that this approach is woven through any level or stage system designed to encourage progress, youth code of conduct, incident response, disciplinary practices, staff training , and supervision. Culturally Responsive Programming Equally as important to healthy adolescent development is ACPD's commitment to design a high -quality, culturally responsive program. The term cultural responsiveness generally refers to an approach that considers and responds to individuals' cultural frame of reference, includi ng demographic, sociopolitical, and other contextual characteristics. When applied to youth programming, a culturally responsive approach takes into account the cultural characteristics, experiences, and perspectives of youth in the design and implementati on of the program. Research suggests that an effective implementation of a culturally responsive program makes youth, particularly those from ethnic and racial minorities, feel safe and valued and better prepared for their futures .11 To improve youth's successful participation in program activities, ACPD will take on a culturally responsive approach across two main program components: structure and staffing. As stated earlier, Alameda will adhere to the Risk, Need, Responsivity (RNR) principle which , togeth er, make up one of the eight principles of effective interventions.12 To ensure adherence to the Responsivity Principle, ACPD will adopt programs, services , and interventions that are relevant to youth of color, given the disproportionate rate at which they are represented in the target population. As previously mentioned, h aving youth participate in activities that are meaningful to their everyday lives and interests is one way to foster efficacy and is particularly important for fostering engagement of et hnic and racial minority youth .13 ACPD will implement programs that youth can connect with, understand, and find value in. For instance, youth will participate in activities that promote their socio -political consciousness, such as designing and participat ing in social justice projects that can have an impact in their communities. Relatedly, ACPD will ensure youth 11 Simpkins, S. D., Riggs, N. R., Ngo, B., Vest Ettekal, A., & Okamoto, D. (2017). Designing culturally responsive organized after -school activities.

Youth will also be offered religious and/o r spiritual services to assist with providing a holistic array of services that they can choose from as part of their growth and development. Most evidence -based models have been created by individuals immersed in Western, Eurocentric culture, many of whom developed these models by \"studying others ,\" (i.e., not as a result of actual lived experiences ).14 This means that many evidence -based programs have not been implemented with racial or ethnic minorities, and will not necessarily be the most relevant options for the target population. Facility staff are also an integral component of a culturally responsive approach since they play an essential role in the implementation of programs. ACPD will thus provide the appropriate training of all facility staff , including on how to engage youth in the design and implementation of program activities. Staff will be prepared and willing to actively seek youth's input regarding their interests, goals , and community concerns. Introducing youth with the opportunity to co-construct program activities is fundamental to developing culturally responsive programming15. Staff will help youth thrive by ensur ing that materials are written in a language that is accessible for all literacy levels and remain attentive for when in terpretation or translation services are needed .16 Mentioned previously, s ince youth's realities and needs are likely to change over time, staff will remain flexible and prepared to adapt programs in order to remain responsive to the youth. Culturally Resp onsive Mental Health Services ACPD shall commit to expanding its traditional interpretation of mental health and program services . Based on historical Youth Level of Service (YLS) assessment information, youth committed to the SB 823 program will require programming to target judgment and decision -making, emotion al regulation/ management , and social engagement . ACPD will ensure that these services are provided via an interwoven mech anism that clearly shows how building these skills helps the youth move from surviving to thriving. n Most of the youth currently at DJJ are Black, Indigenous, and/or People of Color ( BIPOC ) Thus, ACPD will adopt theoretically relevant , evidence -informed , or promising interventions 14 Khumalo, M.

Impact Justice: 14 developed by BIPOC individuals for BIPOC individuals and/or will commit to delivering or contracting for the delivery of Culturally -Adapted Treatments (CATs).17 Restorative Justice will also serve as one of the frames for this program and , as such , youth shall be provided with curriculum related to restorative justice practices. One model that has been developed for youth in the justice system is the \"RJ Ready\" curriculum developed by Rashida George at the Institute for Restorative Future. Interventions that focus on racial socialization and ethnic pride may reduce the reliance on criminogenic knowledge structures . 18 Thus, ACPD will ensure a rich array of programs that provide youth opportunities to explore their history and culture to enhance BIPOC racial/ethnic pride as a way of building resilience and combatting criminogenic knowledge structures ( CKS). The primary interventions selected for this unit will have a manual or written protocol, facilitators who have been tr ained in the interventions , and a mechanism to ensure fidelity to the interventions. Gender Responsive Approach Although girls constitute the largest growing segment of the juvenile justice population, there are very few programs that have been designed t o meet their specific needs .19 Similarly, lesbian, gay, bisexual, questioning, and/or gender non -conforming and transgender (LGBQ/GNCT) youth are overrepresented in the juvenile justice system . And yet, few systems have protocols in place to collect sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression (SOGIE ) data to better understand the pathways and experiences of LGBQ/GNCT youth in the system .20 As a result, girls and sexual minority youth in the system are unlikely to receive appropriate, evidence -based services suitable for t heir rehabilitative needs. This is particularly concerning given that the inclusion of gender - specific risk and protective factors in the design and implementation of programs is 17 CAT's are \"systematic modifications of evidence -based treatment or intervention protocols that consider langua ge, culture and context to increase compatibility with the client's cultural patterns, meanings and values\" (Bernal, Chafey, and Bernal, Guillermo & Chafey, & Domenech Rodr\u00edguez, Melanie.

Impact Justice: 15 crucial for accomplishing positive outcomes for all youth .21 In a national su rvey conducted with parole and probation staff, the overwhelming majority (97%) agreed that girls have unique needs and most of them (94%) thought there should be gender -responsive programming .22 Although there is no exhaustive list of gender -responsive program s, there are some key elements that ACPD will consider in the development of SB 823 programs for girls. Female youth For the purposes of this section, \"girls\" shall refer to all young peopl e who identify as such, including those who may be classified as transgender. This definition is consistent with both state23 and federal law ,24 as well as research indicating that policies failing to do so may result in psychological and physical harm .25 In terms of placement, girls will be treated in the least restrictive environment .26 They will be housed in units that are exclusive to young women and are as close to their homes as possible in order to maintain family and other community relationships .27 Programs will be developed in line with female adolescent development .28 This includes providing girls with spaces and opportunities to build and maintain healthy romantic and non -romantic relationships .29 Additionally, programs will stress the role of re lationships between staff and girls. Programs and services should also be restorative in nature, helping them navigate the system with attention to their trauma and victimization histories. At the same time, there will be program activities designed to enc ourage leadership and developing other key strengths. Above all, programs will be individualized and tailored to meet the specific situation of each girl , including having the structures in place to address parenting and pregnant youth. 21 Grans ki, M., Javdani, S., Anderson, V.

Impact Justice: 16 Given that it is anticipated that young women will rarely be referred to the SB 823 program, ACPD will engage in discussions with other Bay Area counties to co -develop a program for y oung women. Transgender and Intersex youth ACPD has developed a policy to guide the care and services of transgender and intersex youth. The policy appropriately states that \"if a youth requires clinically necessary treatment that is not available at the Juvenile Facilities, as determined by a medical or behavioral health provider, the ACPD must provide transportation for the youth to receive treatment.\"30 An alternative mechanism that may be more appropriate for youth in the SB 823 program may be to con tract with a provider who has the requisite training and practice to provide onsite services. Mental Health Services Mental health services are central to the SB 823 program , since youth in the justice system are very likely to have mental health needs.31 However, mental health needs cannot be disconnected from the totality of needs that must be addressed to help youth thrive in the community. These needs do not exist in a vacuum and are often driven by other social determinants of health and wellbeing suc h as inadequate educational systems, lack of safe affordable housing, poor social supports, inadequate family income and employment opportunities, and barriers to accessing health care. These identified inadequacies do not happen accidentally but are a res ult of the forces of structural and institutional racism over generations in BlPOC communities. Therefore, ACPD will be holistic in their approach to achieving broad mental, physical , and spiritual wellness and healing and take the opportunity to address these needs in a restorative and sustainable manner that places the youth in the position to flourish, not just survive. ACPD will create a comprehensive healing community on the SB 82 3 unit led by Probation staff and supported by the consistent , integrated partnership of a licensed mental health provider that has requisite training and experience work ing with youth and young adults, educational and /or vocational specialists, and traine d juvenile specific Credible Messenger mentors all working collaboratively to identify and meet youth needs via culturally responsive, developmentally appropriate , and innovative services and opportunities. ACPD will also engage an expert consultant (or group of consultants ) to develop, implement , and monitor the fidelity of this program and the essential training elements. 30 ACPD Juvenile Hall Facilities Manual.

Impact Justice: 17 Mental Health Needs in Context An analysis of the Youth Level of Service Case Management Inventory (YLS -CMI 2) domains in the current DJJ population (see Table 1) suggest that DJJ youth committed to the SB 823 program are likely to demonstrate challenges in problem solving, judgement, decision making , and behavior and emotion management (especially related to anger and aggression ). These specific needs may be defined as \"criminogenic\" in the juvenile justice vernacular or as originating from an underlying mental health concern , but neither label changes the recommendations related to appropriate services and supports. Services and suppor ts must be rooted in a clear conceptualization of the potential drivers of symptomatology. Understanding the drivers provides insight regarding the methods of intervention. For many youth in the justice system , the drivers lie in their experiences at home and within the community and society at large. Longitudinal research shows that youth who witnessed and experienced high levels of community violence ( i.e., potential trauma exposure) were most likely to develop hostility and paranoid ideation.32 And African - American youth were consistently more likely to experience high levels of violence over the period studied.33 A second study determined that youth who were exposed to chronic violence over extended time frames developed traits that predicted higher levels of self - reported offending as young adults.34 Finally, \"interpersonal racial discrimination\" \u2014 particularly when experienced by youth who live in under -resourced communities with high rates of violence \u2014can develop criminogenic knowledge structures or adaptive cognitions designed for survival.35 The criminogenic knowledge structures include a desire for immediate gratification, disregard for \"conventional\" norms, and lack of trust in relationships. ACPD will see the youth through neither pathological nor moral lenses , but rather as youth in need of support to overcome strategies developed to deal with the structural challenges experienced in their everyday lives . 32 Thomas A.

Impact Justice: 18 Assessments of Needs and Case Planning ACPD and its partners will commit to comprehensively identifying the \"criminogenic\" and mental health needs that must be addressed to support the youth to become thriving community members. Traditionally , ACPD, Alameda County Office of Education (ACOE) , and ACBH conduct their assessments ind ependently and develop their own Individual Rehabilitation Plan, Mental Health Treatment Plan , and Educational/Vocational Plans based upon their assessments. However, lack of integration , understanding , and coordination of case planning can lead to disjoi nted services that may fail in supporting youth reach the defined goals. In order for the program to appropriately meet the needs of youth in a comprehensive cohesive fashion, ACPD shall ensure that assessment , from its inception , is a multidisciplinary process. ACPD and other service providers will develop a unified assessment and case planning process in which the Individual Rehabilitation Plan completed is informed by both formal and informal assessments. It is understood that each Department/service provider will also develop their individual plans to detail and document their specific services, but these plans will reflect a shared vision and the role each will play in assisting the youth along the journey to successful return to their community of choice. Summary of Assessments Probation Assessment At pre -commitment , the Alameda County Probation Department routinely completes a YLS-CMI 2 to assist the Court in making determinations about care and placement. The YLS/CMI is a validated assessment tool developed to estimate the level of risk for recidivism but its most effective use is to identify needs across a broad array of life that can be targeted by services and addressed in the Individual Rehabilitation Plan. One static and seven dynamic risk/need domains are assessed by the YLS. The domains that relate to youth need s include Family Circumstances/Parenting, Peer Relations, Attitudes/Orientation, Education/Employment, Personality/Behavior, Substance Use , and Leisure Recrea tion. Appropriately matched interventions that meet the youth's level of need reduces the likelihood of recidivism.36 This is not the same as thriving but is the minimum standard of care for any juvenile services agency. Current Data Nineteen of 21 youth currently served by DJJ (90%) took part in the YLS risk and needs assessment at pre -commitment. Table 1. shows the are as rated highest overall for those who completed the assessment. Leisure Recreation (13), Peer Relations (13) , Personality 36 Baglivio, M. T., Wolff, K. T., Howell, J.

Alameda Youth in DJJ. March 2021. Peer Relations, Personality Behavior, and Attitudes and Orientation domains align most closely with externalizing disorders , such as Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Conduct Disorder , and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) \u2014all of which can be driven by traumatic stress responses. The provided data suggests that youth wh o will be assigned to the SB 823 program will benefit from opportunities to engage in programming that increase s social decision -making, emotion management , and impulse control. As previously noted, however, many of these \"needs\" are driven by the same social determinants that contribute to the marginalization of BIPOC youth and BIPOC communities. So, while providers may want a youth to focus on the decisions that they make, that cannot be done effectively without acknowledging their valid anger regarding their circumstances and providing \"viable alternatives .\" In addition to the primary risk and needs assessed, the YLS will also determine Other Needs and Special Considerations. This factor helps to recognize the family environment and needs, including quality of relationships in the home and the presence of depression, anxiety, trauma, learning disabilities, youth -as-parent challenges, domestic violence, and neglect (to highlight just a few ). ACPD provides this assessment pre -adjudication and thus is not completed by the SB 823 probation officer. Therefore, the SB 823 deputy probation officer will review the YLS and collateral documentation for all newly placed youth to ensure that the information entered is comprehensive and consistent with th e current understanding of youth need. If the tool was administered greater than 6 months ago or appears to lack the necessary Impact Justice: 20 information to appropriately contribute to the development of an Individual Rehabilitation Plan ( IRP), the tool will be readmini stered by the SB 823 deputy probation officer. Given that the normal youth sample for the YLS -CMI ranges between 12 and 18, ACPD will explore the use of this tool for youth above age 18 when re -assessing youth. Mental Health Assessment ACBH proposes to provide a biopsychosocial assessment and to use that information to determine need for services and develop an appropriate mental health treatment plan. The primary areas that ACBH proposes to include as a part of their biopsychosocial assessment shall in clude: Demographic information Identification of mental status Identification of specific mental health symptoms and behaviors Identification of functional impairments Description of mental health history Description of history of trauma or exposure to tra uma Description of clinical risk factors Psychosocial history (including family history and cultural considerations) Education/vocational history and goals Developmental history from pre -birth to 17 years of age Medical history Medication history Prior mental health history/treatment Substance use/exposure screening and assessment Diagnosis As a part of this assessment , ACBH will use standardized screening and assessment tools designed specifically to measure the presence of depression, anxiety, s ubstance use , and trauma -related symptoms (including race -related trauma) . The information gathered by ACBH will be shared in the coordinated assessment process with ACPD and the other service team members. Conceptualization of Needs and Approach to Care In July 2021, Impact Justice had the opportunity to conduct a series of focus groups with youth who were released from DJJ. One of their chief concerns related to services that were not culturally congruent and did not provide opportunities to gain neede d skills. To bolster and potentially clarify information gained from the probation and behavioral health assessments, qualitative assessment of culturally specific needs will be completed by a person with \"lived experience\" who has the training and experie nce to assess youth needs. Thus, ACPD will contract with a community -based organization (CBO) to provide Impact Justice: 21 Credible Messenger services that include the provision of qualitative assessment of youth needs utilizing culturally relevant assessment modalities. ACPD has indicated that it will hire a recreational therapist to provide services. As a part of this service , ACPD will ensure that the therapist participate s in the assessment process, particularly in terms of determining appropriate leisure and recreation services . The therapist will also ensure these services incorporate a wide variety of activities that include culturally specific activities as well as expo sure to activities that can help youth enhance their emotion and behavior regulation skills. Leisure/Recreation is noted as one of the high need areas for youth in the program according to the data of previously administered YLS assessments for youth curr ently in DJJ. The youth focus group also yielded other valuable reflections that may suggest improvement for the program. One of the major notes is that youth felt demoralized going before the Parole Board and being denied release. That in and of itself in creased frustration and anger. Though it is not possible to know the reason for each youth's denial, a critical component of a comprehensive case planning process will be transparen t and will begin with ensuring a clear and comprehensive assessment to iden tify needs and develop agreed upon commonly understood goals that relate to preparation for release. Specialized Treatment Individual Services In addition to collaborative milieu -based interventions previously recommended, it will be important for ACBH to provide individual services to some youth who present mental health needs that are not addressed by the more general program. This will be determined based upon the initial mental health assessment as well as referrals related to newly identified needs. T he level of service need will be driven by the youth's functional capacity or desire for greater wellness. Sex Offender Services Youth committed on charges related to sexual offenses will receive a comprehensive assessment provided by a clinician who has the requisite skills to assess the needs of sexual offenders. These youth will participate in all other programming and receive sex offender programming individually or in a small group (i f there are enough youth) with a licensed and trained therapist whose scope of practice includes youth who have committed sexual offenses. Importantly, the body of evidence consistently demonstrates that youth adjudicated for sexual offenses are psychologi cally and behaviorally distinct from adults convicted for similar charges. Namely, justice -involved youth demonstrating problematic sexual behaviors ( PSB) are, on average, remarkably similar to the general population of justice -Impact Justice: 22 involved youth (i.e., withou t PSB) in terms of rehabilitative needs .37 Thus, they may be appropriately and effectively treated using non -PSB-specific methods.38 Nonetheless, there remains a limited proportion of this population who may benefit from PSB -specific treatment methods. For this group, the County will explore expanding its local capacity. In exploring an expansion of local capacity, the County intends to consider partnering with at least one community -based provider to coordinate and synchronize therapeutic methods for the p urpose of ensuring consistency and continuity of service across the continuum of care (i.e., from the secure treatment facilities to less restrictive placements and through reentry). Indeed, research finds that community -based care is more effective than f acility -based care in reducing recidivism among youth with PSB.39 While this may not be possible in some cases, the County embraces these findings in principle and will appropriately weigh these facts as it determines its programmatic strategies. Youth wit h Significant Mental Health Needs Youth with significant mental health needs may require both psychiatric and psychological treatment in order to be able to be included in the milieu. At a minimum , it will be necessary to ensure that there is a clinician with the requisite training in assessment, diagnosis , and treatment of individuals with significant mental health needs. This person will also have been trained or show significant supervision exper ience working with adolescents and young adults. Most ACBH clinicians are trained to assess, diagnose, develop treatment plans, and provide individual therapy for clients who meet this level of acuity. A Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) who has exper ience serving such clients has already been hired as the mental health professional assigned to the unit. This individual will provid e joint services in the milieu , serving as the MH specialist for all youth and monitor ing for destabilization. In cases whe n youth need to be placed on an involuntary hold, they will be transferred to the crisis stabilization units at Willow Rock (< 18 years old) or John George (18 years+). 37 Chaffin, M.

Impact Justice: 23 Youth would return to the unit once stabilized. If youth are not stable enough to be on the unit because of their mental health, then ACBH will work with Probation, the Court partners, and Willow Rock or John George to identify other solutions to meet the youth's level of care (e.g., a hospital setting ). The vast majority of the youth who h ave been committed to DJJ over the last several years would not be categorized as youth with significant mental health needs who would require hospitalization. The main diagnoses provided by Guidance Clinic clinicians for youth committed to DJJ have been P TSD, depression, and anxiety. Most youth who have significant mental health needs that severely impact their daily functioning have been identified while in detention and have been diverted to short -term residential therapeutic programs, the Regional Cente r, or to a locked treatment facility. Over the last 5 years, less than 5 youth (< 18 years) have been conserved and transferred to a locked treatment facility. Family Interventions Given that the program is built on a restorative frame \u2014and mentioned previously \u2014it is likely that youth committed to the SB 823 program may have interest in healing relationships with their family of origin or partner. ACBH , in collaboration with ACPD , will contract family and couples therapy and parenting services as requested by the young people in the program. The youth's primary therapist will not serve this dual role but will participate in assisting the youth in preparing for family sessions. Family Eng agement Research in the field of family engagement has demonstrated the important role that family members play in supporting individuals while they are incarcerated. Specifically, having strong family ties during confinement is related to fewer violent in cidents, as well as lower levels of stress and anxiety.40 Additionally, detained individuals who can stay connected with their family members are more likely to be successful after their release and less likely to be re -incarcerated.41 Family engagement is about relationship building. As youth are learning skills around social engagement, boundaries, and emotion management , such relationships offer them the space to put those skills into use. Programming that focuses on RJ, identifying and restoring harm, a nd developing boundaries can be voluntarily practiced during family engagement opportunities. 40 Shanahan, R., & Agudelo, S. V. (2012). The family and recidivism. American Jails, 18(2), 40 -55. 41 Martinez, D. J. & Christian, J. (2009). The familial relationships of former prisoners: Examining the link between residence and informal support mechanisms. Journal of Contemporary Ethnography, 38(2), 201 -224. Impact Justice: 24 Consistent with this research, ACPD recognizes the importance of strong bonds with family and/or community support person(s) for youth's success. ACPD has alread y been providing resources and support for families, especially with regards to maintaining regular contact, and will continue to do so. As outlined in the Youth in Custody Practice (YICPM), ACPD will prioritize family engagement and family -focused strateg ies. ACPD will also use the broadest definition of family, biological and extended, as well as other important individuals involved in the youth's life such as romantic partners, friends, neighbors, mentors, coaches, and clergy. Following evidence -based pr actices, ACPD will consider the use of a Relational Inquiry Tool (RIT), which allows individuals who are detained to work with staff in identifying their family resources. The use of a RIT has been shown to be particularly beneficial for building rapport a nd establishing trust between detained individuals and facility staff.42 Once the youth's family has been clearly defined and identified, ACPD will provide access through both formal and informal means and will work to remove all physical and economic barr iers to ensure that these relationships are preserved. Youth and their families shall be offered formal and informal opportunities to provide input and plan family activities that occur on a regular basis. These activities may include opportunities for sharing family meals, recreational activities, and participation in community events. ACPD will also provide opportunities to practice engaged parenting for youth who have children. Some potential program options that could be explored include the Baby Elmo program for those with younger children and the Parenting Inside Outside Program.43 Given the impo rtance of family engagement, fostering family -oriented environments in confined facilities is crucial for youth's overall success during incarceration and after release. One program that has been successful at accomplishing this is known as Restoring Promi se.44 Restoring Promise creates prison housing units designed for young adults and focuses on eliminating barriers to family connections. All Restoring Units hold family orientations where families can visit and see the facility and spaces where youth live. In some cases, families are also allowed to bring personal items, such as sheets and comforter sets and even stay to make the beds of their family members who are confined.45 This process is overseen by staff who are trained to facilitate visits and answ er any questions families might have. Since ACPD already plans to train facility staff on the importance of family engagement and presenting a strength -based approach, consideration will be given to training for the facilitation of family visits using a similar 42 Shanahan, R., & Agudelo, S. V. (2012). The family and recidivism. American Jails, 18(2), 40 -55. 43 Barr, R., Brito, N., Zocca, J., Reina, S., Rodriguez, J., & Shauffer, C. (2011).

Keeping Incarcerated People from Their Families Is Cruel. August 2021. Impact Justice: 25 approach. Relatedly, ACPD will ensure that any spaces identified for family engagement events, to the degree possible, mirror a home -based setting environment to provide a sense of normalcy that is grounded in dignity for youth and their families. Family Therapy Family therapy may not be appropriate for all youth and will not be the only mechanism to achieve increased family engagement. In a more comprehensive framework, family engagement and development of supportive relationships should be prioritiz ed for youth. Most families won't want therapy ; instead, they will often seek opportunities to build effective relationships. For this reason, it is critical that family engagement opportunities be co -created by the clinician unit staff, credible messenger s, restorative justice facilitators , or other team members who can help in healing.46 Many of the youth in this program will emerge as adults who have choices about where and with whom they live and call family. Some families have been harmed by the youth and vice versa , and thus a restorative justice model toward healing familial bonds is appropriate and necessary. One example that may be considered for reference as an adjunctive service for interested families is Anchored in Strength, which is a family su pport group built around empowering families of youth involved in the juvenile justice system. Anchored in Strength provides an emotionally safe venue for families to draw on the strength of each other as they share their individual experiences while navig ating their family members' involvement in the justice system.47 Core Programming: Building Core Competencies Identifying & Defining Core Competencies Program development Developing the therapeutic milieu requires a coordinated effort among all partners and shall include the development of a full daily and weekly program schedule that embraces the core concepts of the program. ACPD will partner with an expert consultant(s) to assist in developing, implementing , and ensuring the core program 's fid elity over the course of the first two years of implementation , at a minimum. This will include the design of a training program for staff and coaching and mentoring sessions for the milieu team. Guided by the latest positive youth development research \u2014as well as discussions with community partners (local CBO's, community members, system leaders, and social justice 46 Ibid. 47 Department of Youth and Rehabilitation Services. Anchored in Strength family support group. Impact Justice: 26 leaders ), and formerly and currently incarcerated youth and their families \u2014we have identified 20 core competencies necessary to support \"thrivin g.\" As discussed further below, these competencies are success indicators, allowing the program to adequately measure youth progress, determine which types of programming should be offered, create staff training and accountability frameworks, and guide the design of the environment. Additionally, thriving will be the key outcome that the youth's individual success plan and programming ultimately seek to achieve . This will be informed by the various mental health, risk/needs, and social emotional assessments ; collateral information from the youth's success team ( i.e., the individual youth and their family, Credible Messenger, clinician, JIO, educational partner, and relevant CBO partners ). Put in another way, every aspect of the Program should intentionally a lign to build these core competencies. Due to the broad nature of the core competencies, successful implementation of the Program will require a close partnership between local community -based organizations, the milieu staff (combination of Credible Messengers, clinician, and Probation staff), and youth development experts. This program aims to develop the following core competencies, in partnership with youth, staff, community partners, and their families (in no particular order) : Develop and Understand Self as Individual Develop and Understand Self within Community Develop Sense of Agency See Your self Into the Future Demonstrate Mathematical Literacy Demonstrat e Scientific Literacy Develop Critical Consciousness Innovat e and Design Professional Skills: Working Collaboratively Working Independently Time Management Technology and Media: Proficient Use Responsible Use & Online Safety Ability to Analyze Read to: Learn Analyze Enjoy Writ e: Proficient ly Effective ly Persuasive ly Civic Engagement and Activism Connect ion to Physical and Natural Environment Practice Social Justice Develop Social Connectedness and Healthy Relationships Goal Setting, Achievement and Pride in Own Contributions Health: Wellbeing and Agency Openness to Challenge and Discovery Emotional Connectedness Impact Justice: 27 Develop and Understand Self as Individual : Adolescence is crucial for many aspects of developing self and identity, including commitments, personal goals, motivations, and psychosocial well -being. When given multiple opportunities to explore themselves, youth are mor e likely to experience self -confidence, resiliency, and make positive choices. Similar to a typical college experience, self -exploration is best facilitated through exposure to multiple and new experiences, including the arts, music, books, articles, etc. The Program shall provide multiple opportunities for youth to engage in various activities, based on their interests, but also through exposure to new experiences, = that will push them out of their comfort zone, in a safe and structured setting. Examples include Ted Talks and engaging in new experiences (e.g., cooking , coding, etc. ). Develop and Understand Self within Community : Developing an understanding of self within the community requires defining community both as their immediate surroundings and re lationships with peers, staff, and other trusted adults . Youth will also learn of the larger, broader communities they belong to based on geography, affinity, culture, and relationship s. Both of these framings of community are critical for youth to develop a sense of empathy for others and eventually move towards positive social action or change. Therefore, youth will understand how they fit in with in their immediate environment, and how their actions affect others . They will also be able to make sense of, and begin to transform, their social world. Youth shall explore their own and others' experiences with oppression and privilege to understand and change the underlying causes of social and historical processes that perpetuate problems that they face daily. Develop Sense of Agency : Youth perceive and have the ability to employ their assets and aspirations to make or influence their own decisions about their lives and set their own goals, as well as to act upon those decisions in order to achieve desired o utcomes. A key ingredient to forming agency is first building self -efficacy, or the youth's belief that they are capable of changing their own conditions. Similar to above, agency is built through exposure to new activities, ideas, and social connections and pushing youth to move away from their comfort zones, while celebrating successes along the way. Agency also includes control over one's thoughts and emotions. As such, mindfulness techniques and practices shall be incorporated throughout critical progr amming aspects, along with facilitated programming. For example, morning circles will begin with mindfulness techniques, and ACPD will partner with experts to explicitly teach youth and staff about the most effective practices . See Yourself into the Future : One powerful protective factor against engaging in harmful behavior is feeling optim istic about the future. If young people feel helpless or hopeless when thinking about their lives, they are more likely to engage in short -term thinking and decision making. It should be noted that rather than pathologizing youth who feel pessimistic about their futures, we should recognize that this is a common outcome of exposure to violence and serious harm and trauma. Helping youth develop a sense of Impact Justice: 28 optimism, an expansive view of their potential and options for the future, and self -efficacy should be r einforced through as many programs and policies as possible. Social Connectedness : Building skills for understanding and appreciati ng oneself, one's own culture, language, history, and contributions as well as appreciation for others, are essential compone nts of positive youth development. These skills include self -discipline and decision -making; the ability to work and communicate with others; develop financial literacy; technological access and skills; parenting skills; empathy for others ; and the ability to solve problems without domination, retribution , or violence. Support Others : It is critical to give youth the opportunity to support others within their immediate environment, larger community, and families. ACPD is committed to partnering with the JJD PC to develop a program in which youth are paid for their work and contributions to maintaining the Facility . They will be given opportunities to financially contribute to their families or loved ones. This will help foster their sense of pride, empathy, a nd dignity. Being able to meaningfully contribute financially will also help mitigate any feelings of guilt for being locked up, particularly to wards their families and loved ones. Health -Wellbeing and Agency : Good health as well as knowledge, attitude , and behaviors ensure future health . This includ es access to trauma -informed physical, emotional, and mental health services and healing ; substance use services ; and nutrition, sports , and recreation services. Youth will also be given the information and fre edom to make healthy choices (health agency) regarding nutrition, participation in mindfulness, yoga, etc. Connection to Physical and Natural Environment : Skills for understanding and appreciating environmental health, justice , and sustainability also incl udes built environment, environmental racism , and access to housing and resources oriented toward personal wellbeing . This will require examination of the policies, laws , and regulations that impact one's healthy development as well as access to and knowledge about green jobs, urban farming , and environmentally sustainable agricultural, housing , and urban development. Cognitive and Creative Competencies : Knowledge and abil ity to appreciate and participate in areas of healing -centered, creative expression will be fostered. This includ es access to quality education, critical thinking pedagogy, analysis , and problem solving; literacy, academic support , and college preparation; self-expression and empowerment through the arts; ability to examine and address systemic oppression and root causes of inequity ; and awareness of power, privilege, prejudice and social justice. Social Justice & Civic Engagement : Youth will be offered op portunities to u nderstand and develop skills related to personal values, moral and ethical decision -making , and participation in efforts contributing to the greater good . This includes the right to speak out, organize to serve and change one's school, comm unity and society (e.g., leadership pipelines, advisory groups, County commissions and board memberships ). Youth shall Impact Justice: 29 also be given opportunities to register to vote in local, state , and national elections. Youth shall be provided with election informatio n if needed. Programmatic Advisory Subcommittee of the JJDPC In consultation with the Chief of Probation, the JJDPC shall immediately develop a programmatic advisory subcommittee to review programming and advise ACPD regarding a) requests for proposals to provide services to the target population or in connection with the Realignment Plan ; b) proposals to provide services ; c) proposed extensions, increases, or other substantive or durational amendments to contracts for services ; and d) programming utilized (or proposed for use ) by ACPD staff. The JJDPC Programmatic Advisory Subcommittee shall include a minimum of three comm unity members as defined by Welfare and Institutions Code Section 1995(b), and at least one of those members must be a youth member who is 24 years of age or younger. The JJDPC Chair and the Chief of Probation shall develop a process for the Programmatic A dvisory Subcommittee to receive, review, and advise the ACPD with respect to the items listed and any additional programmatic service items for which ACPD seeks advice or comment. The Programmatic Advisory Subcommittee will review proposals and options fo r the items listed in the preceding paragraph and will advise ACPD and provide community perspective on the applicants or proposed options. The Programmatic Advisory Subcommittee will use the Core Competencies to make their assessments and recommendations. The Programmatic Advisory Subcommittee will gather information from the community and directly impact ed young people and families in order to develop its recommendations. Life Skills Programming Life Skills education will also be provided, including prog rams related to meal planning and preparation that allow youth to cook some meals for themselves and eat family style. Courses will also be offered covering; including civic engagement & responsibility education. All youth who are old enough will be given the opportunity to pre - register/register to vote, with voting actively supported and encouraged by ACPD. Prior to each election, ACPD will ensure that youth are provided information on ballot issues by a non-partisan group such as the League of Women Voter s. Programs will also be offered that are designed to teach about money management and investing with the opportunity to begin an investment portfolio while in facility, based upon funds earned in the program. Many systems have some form of a \"point or to ken\" economy for good behavior or achieving unit goals. This program will move beyond \"tokens for Takis,\" which reinforces compliance and short -term goals, instead focusing on helping youth invest and plan for the future. This also supports the youth in le aving the program with the necessary financial resources to transition to community, acquire safe Impact Justice: 30 affordable housing, and meet their basic needs while seeking employment. Programs will also be offered on housing and home ownership. SB 823 Youth will also b e provided financial awareness courses with the goal of teaching them budgeting and savings skills, as well as how to manage their credit ; build or rebuild credit scores ; and planning for taxes, benefits, and retirement. Currently Available Programming Within the framework of positive youth justice, Alameda County Probation is determined to provid e services to encourage the continued growth and enrichment of youth committed to our program. In alignment with appropriate practices, the following services will be offered: Write to Read Program : The Alameda County Library is currently working to build out a robust complement of literacy services at both JJC and Camp Sweeney, which will include a combination of one -on-one literacy tutoring and small group instruction, with referrals from ACOE and facility staff. Library : The Alameda County Library operate s full -service libraries at both JJC and Camp Sweeney. Youth at JJC visit the library once per week during free hours. Full - size collections are maintained with a vast array of reading materials at all reading levels. o The Alameda County Library also provides an array of programming for youth at both facilities that includes visits from popular authors throughout the year, book groups, creative writing classes, and STEAM programming during the summer and throughout the y ear. o The Alameda County Library at the Juvenile Justice Center provides a collection of books and reading materials that are culturally relevant, age appropriate, and in keeping with current trends. We refresh our collection throughout the year to ensure that the collection is consistently reflective of the cultures, languages, and experiences of the young people we serve. o The authors and programming that the Library offers throughout the year are culturally responsive and relevant to the lives of the youn g people who visit the library at JJC. Supplemental Education (Tutoring): Supplemental educational services are offered through Sylvan Learning Center and Excel. Reading and Homework Hour : Volunteers from the community come in and help youth work on their reading skills with the goal of improving the young people's academic abilities and forging meaningful relationships between the youth at Juvenile Hall and responsible adults. Mind Body Awareness Program : Mindfulness -based techniques are taught through med itation and yoga to the detained youth. Impact Justice: 31 The Beat Within : Creative writing workshops are conducted resulting in a magazine that features the work of the participating youth. Recreational Activities : ACPD intends to hire a recreational therapist to develop programming for individual and group activities. They will lead and instruct physical, social, and culturally relevant programs to encourage progress toward therapeutic goals. ACPD recognizes the importance of providing a wide array of engaging and high -quality programming to ensure that youth are able to make progress toward their goals and are also provided with multiple opportunities to fill their time with prosocial activities. Given the relatively low anticipated population (<10) in the first year, ACP D will continue existing contracts for programs and services. For the immediate future, ACPD intends to replicate the TAY programs and Camp Sweeney contractors in the SB 823 program48 and will continue to seek opportunities to partner with community -based organizations to fill any gaps in programming, as well as to provide additional opportunities for programming to meet any individual needs. Partnerships with Community -Based Organizations Community -based partnerships are essential and key to the success o f this program model. ACPD plans to leverage existing and new contracts with a variety of community - based service providers to facilitate in -custody programs and services, as well as to provide services in the community during \"inside/outside\" and reentry phases. Alameda County Probation intends to partner with community -based organizations (CBOs) to provide a vast array of re -entry services including but not limited to case management, housing, mental health, systems navigation, substance use, education/vo cation/college, employment, mentoring, and on -going cognitive behavioral treatment, as necessary. Alameda County will incorporate structured decision -making based on a foundation rooted in Evidence -Based Practices (EBP), but also open to locally developed and other promising practices. While implementing EPBs for program development will be prioritized, it is important to point out that there is no standardized approach for working with all youth. Moreover, ACPD will identify locally developed programs that have offer indicators of success as part of its commi tment to support the growth and work of its community partners. This is in line with ACPD's plan to implement a community capacity fund (CCF) grant program in order to build capacity amongst youth -serving organizations. Implementing locally promising or re levant programming that attends to the specific needs of the target population opens the opportunity for the creation of new EPBs that are more relevant for youth in the juvenile justice system. 48 JJC & Camp Sweeney Programs 8.19.21 (DRAFT).pdf Impact Justice: 32 ACPD will also pursue the identification of other innovative programs within the community. For example, ACPD will partner with a Credible Messenger or a community provider to have an emotional or therapeutically trained animal , such as a dog who will be available regularly according to a set schedule. Developing tr ust with animals helps build empathy, responsibility, and can be incredibly rewarding. Sharing responsibility for the animal ( e.g., feeding, walking, grooming, etc.) can help to build a larger sense of community , responsibility , and belonging. ACPD will a lso partner with CBOs to plan and \"host\" \u2014whether at the facility or in the community, as appropriate \u2014community events on a regular, hopefully monthly, basis. This event planning can also involve the youth themselves , not only on the \"theme\" or focus of the event, but also planning the logistics. Some examples of these events might include BBQ s/cookouts; Town Hall s for Civic Engagement ; Resource Fair s; Cook Off s and other light -hearted \"competitions\"; Art Exhibit s, including youth works and community artists ; Musical events ; etc. Input from the youth themselves, as well as from the Youth Council, will be taken into consideration when planning the content and scheduling for these events. Developmentally Appropriate Scheduling It is widely accepted that delaye d start times in education and other programming is preferable for adolescents. It is universally accepted that adolescents experience a biologically driven sleep delay.49 During this phase of development , adolescents experience a sleep -wake phase delay un related to social factors or circumstances. This change in sleep pattern does not correspond to a decreased need for sleep though, and early scheduling requirements thus contribute to sleep deprivation in adolescents. In a 2014 report, American Academy of Pediatrics referred to adolescent sleep deprivation as an epidemic and recommended a delay in school start times.50 Sleep deprivation is associated with a number of increased risks and poorer outcomes including increased drug use and risk -taking behaviors, depressive symptoms and higher prevalence of mood disorders, and a decrease in academic performance.51 In fact, given the essential relationship between sleep and human development, it has been postulated that sleep deprivation during the sensitive develo pmental period of adolescence \"may permanently alter the developmental trajectory of the brain and behavior.\"52 49 Hagenauer, M. H., & Lee, T. M. (2013). Adolescent sleep patterns in humans and laboratory animals. Hormones and behavior, 64(2), 270 -279. 50 Adolescent Sleep Working Group. (2014). School start times for adolescents. American Academy of Pedi atrics Hagenauer, M. H., & Lee, T. M. (2013). Adolescent sleep patterns in humans and laboratory animals. Hormones and behavior, 64(2), 270 -279. Impact Justice: 33 Combating sleep deprivation with a delayed start time for daily activities has been shown to improve grades, decrease irritability and depress ive symptoms, decrease disciplinary issues, and reduce athletic injuries.53 Despite widespread agreement that delayed start times are beneficial to adolescents, many schools are unable to accommodate later times because of other considerations such as transportation, childcare, and other scheduling conflicts. Those challenges are largely absent in this programming environment, and thus sleep needs can be accommodated more readily. ACPD, in recognition of the importance of sleep and the delay in sleep onset and wakefulness, will develop programming and daily schedules to meet the s leep hygiene needs of youth. This will be routinely reassessed and include increased flexibility on weekends. ACPD will also consider and implement options to accommodate the needs of young people in its facility setup and provisioning \u2014 for example, ensuri ng young people are able to have lights for reading or other nightly activities, are offered sufficient darkness and quiet for sleeping, and meeting other such needs as they arise. The established daily schedule, or a sampling of weekly schedules, and any accommodations or modifications made to meet these needs will be reported to the subcommittee prior to the approval of the Annual Realignment Plan. Sample Core Programming Schedule This schedule is not intended to be proscriptive, but rather provide an i llustration of the intent to provide a wide variety of tailored programming. Key features of this sample schedule include relatively later shower/personal hygiene time, plenty of personal time, varied weekend schedules, daily outside time, and significant time for family engagement. 53 Suni, E., & Vyas, N.

That's just a notch above survival. If ACPD acknowledges that racism entrenched in the laws, policies , and practices of our society have contributed to these youth attending substandard schools and living in severely under -resourced , often violent communities, then it will commit to contributing to repair these injustices by providing youth with equitable \u2014not just equal \u2014 resources, knowledge , and experiences. Focus on High School Diplomas & Higher Education The ACOE and ACPD will continue existing agreements to include the development of educational curriculum as part of the treatment program to assist the youth in work toward earning a high school diploma. Credit recovery courses, in addition to regular course enrollmen t, will be offered to propel the youth to their proper grade level more quickly than in public school. Youth absent a high school diploma or General Education Development (GED) certification will be in school for a large portion of the day. The education p rogram will comply with the State Education Code and County Board of Education policies and provide for annual evaluations of the education program offerings through existing evaluative processes, such as WASC and Local Control and Accountability Plan (LCAP). Attendees are provided quality educational programming that includes instructional strategies designed to respond to the different learning styles and abilities of students. Courses which are offered include , but are not limited to , instruction in Engl ish/Language Arts, Social Sciences, Physical Education, Science, Health, Mathematics, Fine Arts/Foreign Language, and Electives (including career education). Older youth who have already completed their GED or high school diploma will spend much of their d ay in workforce development, continuing and higher education, and other programming areas. Every student should have an Individualized Learning , and Transition Plan (ILTP). Assessments for IEPs should be conducted as needed. Students will have the opportun ity to provide feedback regarding education and other services they are receiving while in the SB 823 program. A clear and meaningful protocol for response to feedback will be developed. The initial cohort of students in the SB 823 program will likely be o lder than the average youth at JJC. It is important for older and TAY youth to feel empowered and have agency over their education and vocation paths (i.e., not infantilized or patronized ). However, research also demonstrates that integration and programmi ng with other youth \u2014similar to them in age and social -emotional development \u2014is beneficial. Thus , learning environments will be integrated whenever possible, knowing that some individualization will likely be needed. The youth's input and preferences will a lso be discussed during the MDT Meetings and included in the ILTP. If there are enough older students, regardless of Impact Justice: 36 SB 823 status, the ACPD will consider the creation of a cohort of older students with separate classes. This determination should be made b y age or educational needs, not SB 823 status. While we're anticipating older youth in the first few years of the SB 823 program, it is important to create a program that is flexible and responsive to a range of ages and developmental and learning needs. A fter a few years, it is likely that the SB 823 program will include students with a wide range of ages. The ACPD is strongly committed to making college available to high school graduates. The ACPD will bring in college -level courses that would be availab le to students who are not yet in a position to go out of the secure setting into the community, if feasible. Given the wide array of online courses available, the ACPD will provide internet access consistent with Title 15 and the Welfare & Institutions Co de, necessary technology and equipment, and the opportunity to take advantage of online higher education options as soon in the SB 823 program as possible. We emphasize that many students may need foundational courses that may not be credit -bearing but are nonetheless essential to their success in college. Thus , the ACPD will focus on these courses for those still in the secure setting. This will enable students to complete necessary foundational courses without incurring significant debt , which will greatl y benefit their success . Eligible high school students will also be given the opportunity to participate in dual enrollment in community colleges and vocational training. Dual enrollment is especially beneficial to youth, as those courses are free. ACPD wi ll consider expansively college courses that may also promote wellness and self-care (e.g., yoga, meditative practices, etc ). ACPD is also considering programs such as San Mateo's Project Change program, since such a program could be adapted and/or improve d for local use. For both youth still in the secure setting and those in an inside/outside setting, ACPD will develop partnerships with community colleges . These institutions will offer transition support, enrollment services, academic advising, financial aid, etc. ACPD will also pursue partnerships with existing campus -based groups54 that are supporting formerly incarcerated students and will prioritiz e relationships with groups that are able to bring in programming and supports into the facility. Post-high school education be formally managed by an educational third party. Ideally, these services would be provided by ROC at Laney Community College. This organization would be supported by ACOE and Probation. Recognizing that higher educational opportunities will be extremely limited for those still in the secure setting, ACPD will provide the supports and resources needed for students to \"step -down\" and m ove into an inside/outside setting as quickly as possible. We recognize that this decision is ultimately made by the Court . However, the MDT and assigned DPO will keep this goal in mind and will provide the Court with detailed updates that would be 54 Examples of such groups include: Underground Scholars, ROC, Project Rebound, RISE (Chabot Community College) Impact Justice: 37 suffici ent for the Court to make informed and timely decisions in the best interest of the youth. Vocational Training Vocational Program training will be expanded through community partnerships with local colleges \u2014ideally , coordinated by ROC. The mission of thes e vocational programs will be to create meaningful, living wage career pathways and provide opportunities for in -person apprenticeships and employment outside of Juvenile Hall. Direct linkage to job and apprenticeship opportunities will better prepare yout h for success upon their release as these opportunities will allow SB 823 youth to gain valuable work experience, build references, develop professional networks, and open a savings account. ACPD will explore collaborative opportunities with local unions55 who will be able to provide training and apprenticeships for which youth will be eligible. For those youth who are interested in vocational training outside of union trades, efforts will be made to connect them with a vocational mentor working in their de sired field. ACPD will pay initial union dues for those youth who successfully complete union -trade related programs. ACPD will also purchase the first set of tools and supplies for graduates. These supports both remove potential economic barriers to acces sing the careers of their choice, and also helps to set youth up for success in their chosen field. ACPD also recognizes the importance of youth exploring different fields of work and developing a passion for a career of their choice . Therefore , ACPD will actively engage SB 823 youth and provide youth with career aptitude and assessment tests in order to explore their skills and interests. Based on these assessments and discussions will be provided access to a direct linkage to training in that field in the community. Access to facilities that enable hands -on learning (e.g. , auto repair shops, commercial kitchens, computer labs, etc.) will also be provided. A focus on employment for our youth must elicit and develop their strengths and skills, be meaningful, and assist in the selection of a field that can promote sustainability. Work that is offered will be structured and closely monitored, and will not interfere with other important adolescent development activities. Currently at Camp Wilmont Sweeney , workfo rce development programs create employment and educational pathways for sustainable careers. On -campus programs , such as Multi -Core Craft Curriculum (MC3) and Google Technology Certification courses , will allow youth to develop the skills and obtain the ce rtifications needed to obtain employment. Other vocational training programs will be explored and pursued as well \u2014including, but not limited to , coding and technology - related certifications, real estate licensing, etc. These programs will be available for SB 823 youth at JJC and will work to create a direct connection between training & actual jobs. 55 Such as: SEIU 1021, UA Local 342, Plumbers & Pipefitters Carpenters Local Union 713, and LiUNA Laborers Local 304 Impact Justice: 38 Throughout the entire process, ACPD will continue to offer innovative programs with demonstrated success, such as Raising Leaders workshops for SB 823 youth, wh ich are already in progress, and will explore the expansion of the program as well. ACPD also recognizes that when SB 823 youth obtain jobs , they may face barriers getting to and from work (once they are back in their communities ). ACPD will therefore explore opportunities for SB 823 youth to obtain their driver's license or CA ID while they are in custody. Reentry Planning, Coordination, & Services Background Determining how to support youth returning from a period of confinement requires understanding the harm confinement inflicts upon a young person during a crucial period of their development.56 The disconnection from one's family, friends, and community impairs the potential for successful reentry.57 For young people, these cha llenges are complicated by the already trying transition from adolescence to adulthood.58 Reentry interventions that center adolescent development are effective in reducing recidivism and ensuring long -term success, particularly when they involve the famil y in treatment and target higher -risk youth.59 To ensure better reentry outcomes as they transition from confinement to their communities, the county's reentry support system will tap into the strengths, assets, and aspirations of justice -involved youth an d their support systems, and combine targeted programs and services to address the immediate needs of youth returning to their communities. Some of these needs include, but are not limited to: housing ; employment ; education ; substance abuse ; physical and m ental health ; social - emotional development ; mental, legal, and familial support ; and transportation. 56 De Nike, M., Shelden, R., Macallair, D., & Menart, R.

Impact Justice: 39 Programming To improve the odds of success for youth reentering their communities, the County, related agencies, and community will begin to plan for what a youth needs to be successful in their reentry process when they first enter the juvenile justice system. Coordination and collaboration between agencies and across services and supports are necessary at multiple phases of a youth's confinement.60 The reentry services and supports youth need to succeed will be tailored , high quality, and provided in the least restrictive environment possible.61 Youth in confinement show significantly lower levels of psychosocial maturity (responsibility, perspective, and short -term decline in temperance). As a result, confined youth hav e lower levels of educational and employment attainment in young adulthood compared to all other youth.62 As these are critical components to successful reentry, ACPD will ensure programming allows youth to build psychosocial maturity skills through activi ties that mirror typical adolescent responsibilities, behaviors, and tasks. Incorporating a reentry perspective in all aspects of facility programming and operations can help minimize the harmful effects of removal and increase the likelihood of sustainabl e and successful reintegration of youth back into the community.63 Probation will keep the following concepts in mind to help guide their practices. First, in the immediate term, the Juvenile Hall (JJC) is a vital part of the reentry process.64 Thus, ACPD will purposefully and clearly articulate the goals of preparing youth to become contributing members of their community upon their return. Consistent with that mission, every aspect of confinement programs should be designed and evaluated through the lens of how well they meet that goal. This will require, where needed, changing the focus of institution programs and policies from simply managing youth inside the facility to promoting skills that lead to successful reentry. 60 Clark, H.

Juv. & Fam. Ct. J., 46, 3. Impact Justice: 40 Phased Approach ACPD will employ a phased approach to programming in order to respond to the changing needs of youth throughout the duration of their time in custody. Once ordered into the SB 823 program by the Court, Phase 1 (Orientation) begins. This phase is not intended to last more than 30 days and primarily consists of convening the MDT, orientation to the Secure Treatment Facility, and administering any additional assessments that may be needed to ensure proper programming is available and assigned. According to Welfare and Institu tions Code 875(d), within 30 days of making an order to commit a youth to a secure placement treatment facility (S PTF), the court shall receive, review, and approve an individual rehabilitation plan (IRP) that meets the certain requirements. The IRP must be submitted to the court by the probation department and any other agencies or individuals the court deems necessary for the development of the plan. The MDT will be primarily responsible for the development of the IRP. Prior to submission to the Court, t he IRP will undergo a quality control mechanism to ensure it is compliant with WIC 875(d) and is reflective of additional parameters set forth by this Plan. Note that reentry planning should also begin immediately. Once Phase 1 Orientation is complete, th e youth will move into Phase 2 \u2014where the bulk of programming, education, training, and skill and relationship building will take place. Phase 2 will also include a reward/sanction system that rewards good behavior , disincentivizes poor behavior , and allows for increases in freedom and privileges over time. As noted above, this reward/sanction system should be less focused on short -term rewards and behavior management and should instead be oriented toward long -term goals. During this Phase, close attention w ill be paid to ensure that the \"least restrictive environment\" is used to engage youth and provide services. Phase 2 will include regular contact with the community, both \"inside\" (through Credible Messengers and other community -based staff who will provi de programming within the facility ) and also through utilizing a step -down approach that will incorporate an inside/outside component. This will allow for community integration and \"normalizing\" the process of undoing institutionalization , early on . As noted above, ACPD recognizes that progression of an inside/outside program will depend on youth success with in the program and the Court 's decisions . However, ACPD will clearly articulate the goal of \"step - down\" and will provide the Court with the inf ormation it needs to make informed, timely decisions. Phase 3 involves Community Reintegration, and ideally will begin between 6 and 9 months before anticipated release. One of the current challenges facing reentry is that the exact date of reentry is oft en unknown until the Court sets the final baseline term of confinement or step -down date within the secure track. These decisions will generally take place at progress review hearings. In order to ensure youth have the smoothest transition and greatest acc ess to reentry support, planning will begin no later than 9 months prior to Impact Justice: 41 the initial baseline date set for release, and adjusted to be earlier as soon as it becomes apparent that release will be earlier. To help address some of these challenged, ACPD wi ll ensure that Community Reintegration planning, services, and programming begins well before any anticipated release. Discussed in further detail below, this phase will include access to education, vocational training, and employment outside of the facili ty. The Reentry Service Coordinator \u2014ideally from a CBO \u2014will be assigned during this time, as well as a community -based Credible Messenger who will continue to mentor the youth throughout their reentry journey, including post release. These individuals will also begin attending the MDT meetings. Ideally , these supports will continue throughout the duration of their community supervision. Reentry Case Management ACPD will also ensure that transitions for youth into and out of reentry programs are as seamless as possible. Efforts to redirect youth are more likely to succeed when youth are offered consistent expectations, services, and support as they move into, through, and out of confinement facilities.65 In an effort to minimize the possible confusion youth a nd their families may encounter from dealing with multiple agencies, a case manager (from outside of probation ) will ensure that care is coordinated among all service -providing agencies.66 This case manager will be assigned several months (ideally , 6-9 mon ths) before anticipated release. Successful case managers are culturally sensitive and come from similar backgrounds and experiences as reentering youth. These attributes help to foster a closer relationship between the reentering individual and their supp ort system,67 and achieves positive youth development outcomes in the long term.68 ACPD shall contract with a third -party non -profit that will provide a reentry case manager, who will be primarily responsible for coordinating the reentry plan for the youth. San Francisco's Juvenile Collaborative Reentry Unit (JCRU) can serve as an example for seamless transition. The Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice (CJCJ) participates in the JCRU, which comprises the Probation Department, court, Public Defende r's Office , and CJCJ. Reentry planning begins upon disposition, incorporating the young person and family members in every decision along the way, and blending together service plans from all participating agencies. When the youth reenters the community, t here is a coordinated and comprehensive plan in place. CJCJ delivers most of these supports directly, but also 65 McCarthy, P., Schiraldi, V. N., & Shark, M.

Impact Justice: 42 brokers access to outside programs that correspond to the youth's needs, strengths, and interests.69 ACPD and the Public Defender's office alread y have an existing collaboration with many of these practices in place, however further coordination with the Court and the Case Manager would be a significant benefit to the youth. Addressing Basic Needs Upon Release Many youth with justice involvement ha ve few, if any, financial resources and may not have family members that they can rely on for food and shelter. These young people cannot afford to volunteer, take unpaid internships, or engage in some of the job -search behaviors that are available to more privileged young people. Involving youth with justice involvement in paid work, service, or other employment related activity as soon as possible is key to success. Examples of successful approaches include wage -subsidized internships, stipends for commun ity service, and transitional jobs, which are time -limited subsidized work experiences that help establish a work history and develop skills to access unsubsidized employment.70 In partnership with the County, ACPD will expand the use of subsidized employm ent programs and paid internships to help bridge the unemployment gap that many youth face upon release. ACPD will prioritize under -resourced areas of the County \u2014particularly , South County. Ideally , all youth would have access to these opportunities well before their release. ACPD will utilize the existing innovative Transition Center and expand services to ensure that youth \u2014and the families they are returning to, where applicable \u2014are connected to resources they are eligible for. These resources are not limited to housing, (including , Section 8 ) and other forms of public assistance (including SNAP, Medi -Cal, etc. ). Vital documents are often a hindrance to housing and employment, especially for those who have been incarcerated for long periods of time. Thus, ACPD will offer assistance in preparing vital documents (e.g., Social Security Card, original birth certificate, CA ID &/or Driver's License) , SSI (needs to start while in custody), and voter regis tration (if changing address, etc. ). It should be noted that some of these resources can be accessed prior to release, while some ( e.g., public assistance ) must be accessed after release. The Transition Center and its services will remain available to yout h (and their families where appropriate) post -release. Through the Transition Center, ACPD will develop an MOU with the Department of Social Services to ensure that youth and their families are maximizing their social service benefits. ACPD re -entry staff will be connected to the Alameda County Probation Department's Transition Center \u2014 a collaboration of partners, who stand in alignment with our mission 69 See: Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice. San Franci sco Juvenile Collaborative Reentry Team (JCRT). 70 O'Sullivan, K., Spangler, D., Showalter, T., & Bennett, R. (2020). Job Training for Youth with Justice Involvement: A Toolkit. National Youth Employment Coalition. Impact Justice: 43 to support and restore communities. Alameda County Probation recognizes that engaging in the justice system can be emotionally difficult for those involved. As such, we place emphasis on a family -focused and trauma -informed process. The Transition Center empowers youth, families, and their caregivers by removing barriers to success and connecting them to supportive resources and healthy alternatives in the community. The Transition Center, with the Probation Department as the lead agency, works in partnership with Alameda County Office of Education, the Center for Healthy Schools and Communities, Oakland Unified School District, Oakland Unite, Alameda County Behavioral Health, and Alameda County Public Health. The Transition Center is equipped with two confidential conference rooms furnished with computers, telephones, and current community resourc es and events. Alameda County Probation has committed to addressing all the stabilizing needs of a family and is prepared to provide concrete services such as transportation , food vouchers , relocation supports, clothing, school supplies, and household ite ms. ACPD also recognizes that the stigma of a criminal record may follow the youth during and after re -entry, and may present a significant barrier to successful reentry. Thus, ACPD commits to training re -entry staff in the procedures required to seal rec ords according to Welfare and Institution Code 781. Re -entry staff will relay such information to the youth and their families during and throughout Phase 3 while the youth prepare to transition back to the community. Continuity of Care The Reentry Case Ma nager will coordinate with various agencies, departments, and community -based organizations to ensure that smooth continuity is ensured without interruption in physical and mental health , as well education , services . The Reentry Case Manager will ensure th at warm handoffs and transportation occur \u2014not just passive referrals to services. Any medications currently prescribed will be filled prior to release. The amount of medication provided will be determined by the prescribing physician, who will be informed of the transition to release. Ideally 30 days or more of medication will be provided. In the case that this is not indicated by the prescribing physician due to safety or health considerations, transportation to and from necessary appointments and the appr opriate pharmacy will be provided . Education For youth still pursuing their high school diploma, ACOE and ACPD will coordinate to ensure youth are enrolled in a school or program that will meet their goal of a HS diploma. The Reentry Case Manager will ens ure that this coordination is taking place, as well as involving parents and ensuring that a warm handoff is provided. The Reentry Case Manager will leverage resources needed to foster a successful transition, including transportation support, school supp lies, uniforms, etc. ACOE will ensure that all needed transcripts and other student records are provided and given to the school or program, including any prior transcripts from other districts. IEPs will be up to date prior to Impact Justice: 44 release. ACOE will collaborate w ith K -12 schools to develop 30 -Day Change of Placement IEPs when enrolling students. For youth who are pursuing higher education, ACPD will coordinate with the community - based Community College services provider (ROC) in much the same way. ACOE and ACPD will ensure that all transcripts and other student records are given to the student or Educational Rights Holder. Transcripts and other student records will also be released to schools enrolling students in K -12 programs. The Reentry Case Manager will assis t in this coordination and make sure that a warm handoff is provided. For students with IEPs who are graduating High School, ACOE will complete an Exit IEP outlining accommodations needed to continue vital educational and learning supports in higher educat ion. An exit IEP will outline the supports and/or accommodations that a student will need to succeed in Higher Education. Community -based Community College services provider (ROC) will support with any additional referrals, including with Student Disabilit y Services needed on campus. For youth attending college outside of Alameda County, the Reentry Case Manager will support the youth in enrolling, as well research ing, identify ing, and connect ing students with services at the appropriate institutions. Fami ly Programs need to find ways to engage these support systems as part of an overall case plan in which everyone is working together toward the same goals. To help achieve these goals , Probation will develop individualized plans and programs and refrain fro m one -size- fits-all approach to policies, programs, and practices within the JJC. Youth will be regularly consulted regarding who they want included in their \"family\" group to ensure that positive, trusted adult relationships are encouraged and supported. Family members under the age of 18, especially children of the youth themselves, will be allowed to visit as well. As previously mentioned, ACPD will use the broadest definition of family, to includ e biological and extended family, as well as other importa nt individuals involved in the youth's life such as romantic partners, friends, neighbors, mentors, coaches, and clergy. Additional Considerations for Reentering TAY The multiple challenges faced by transitional -aged youth can present barriers to meeting normative developmental milestones of this age (e.g., vocational and educational success, development of stable relationships, and maturation into productive adults ). Transitional - aged youth (TAY) also have the highest level of mental health problems compar ed to non - transitional -aged youth in the juvenile justice system, and serious mental illnesses often emerge during these years as well.71 However, perhaps even more importantly, reentering 71 Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality. (2012). Comparing and evaluating youth substance use estimates from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health and other surveys. HHS Publication No. SMA 12 -4727, Methodology Series M -9. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administratio n, Rockville, MD. Impact Justice: 45 TAY will most likely be experiencing overlapping and compounding st ressors related not only to this often -difficult developmental stage, but also of reentry (after having spent much of their adolescence in custody ). While we know this to be true from existing research, this was also clearly reflected in the focus group wi th young men who were previously held at DJJ. They discussed the shock, anxiety, and stress of release , even though it was something they were eager for . The County will, thus, provide adequate supports for reentering youth , ensur ing that planning includes provisions for mental health transitions from juvenile -to-adult systems of care. ACPD will coordinate with Credible Messengers to provide the necessary programming TAY youth need to address these unique barriers. Options for Step -Down In addition to a continuum -of-care process, transitional or step -down programming in a secure setting will also plays a critical role in the reentry process.72 The decision as to when to transfer youth to a less restrictive facility will depend less on benchmarks or milestones achieved by a given young person, and will instead be dependent on where an individual is more likely to receive the services most tailored to their needs.73 In fact and as previously mentioned , youth are most likely to succeed whe n they receive high -quality, tailored services in the least restrictive environments possible.74 We recognize that the decision to allow a step -down relies on the Court, which must also consider public safety. ACPD will strive to ensure step -down programs are individualized and involve a number of options that are geographically spaced throughout the County. While in a transitional or step -down program, youth will be immersed in a therapeutic community that prepares them for their reentry. Treatment exercises in the step -down program should mimic as much as possible the challenges that youth will fac e in the outside world. The program exercises become a dress rehearsal for reentering youth so that they can role -play new skills before reintegrating into their community. Potential facilities that may serve as appropriate step -down options are discussed in more detail below. Data & Evaluation Plans Programmatic administrative data will be collected for each program offered to the SB 823 realigned youth. Each program must capture basic demographic and participation data, as 72 Fretz, R. (2005). Step Down programs: The missing link in successful inmate reentry. Corrections Today, 67(2), 102 -107. 73 Lowenkamp, C. T., & Latessa, E. J. (2005). Developing successful reentry programs: Lessons learned from the what works research. Corrections Today, 67(2). 74 Ibid. Impact Justice: 46 well as outcome measures tied e xplicitly to the Core Competencies supported by the program. Both quantitative and qualitative data are acceptable. The intention is not to create undue burdens on program staff, but to document progress and the impact of the program \u2014which is essential to program development and improvement. This data will be reviewed regularly by program and ACPD staff to ensure programs are meeting their intended goals. Importantly, ACPD's program evaluations processes will be transparent and accessible to the general pub lic. Program evaluations will be regularly submitted to the JJDPC Programmatic Advisory Subcommittee to help inform their recommendations. ACPD will implement a data -driven accountability framework as part of its program evaluation process. This framework will support Alameda in its efforts to move toward data -driven strategies that use evidence to evaluate program outcomes, impacts, and/or cost effectiveness. ACPD will also use performance data by working with contractors to monitor progress in its contrac ted activities. Ultimately, these strategies will produce better outcomes for youth while also supporting cost efficiency efforts. At the same time, ACPD recognizes that there are limitations in using existing evaluation frameworks . Particularly, these fra meworks are mostly quantitative and do not always take an equity lens into account . In response to this, ACPD will include the use of qualitative data that incorporat es youth voice s as part of its program evaluation process. When youth are not progressing in a program as expected, system leaders may conclude that youth are either not compliant, or not progressing in treatment . However, it is also possible that youth have not received individualized services. ACPD will thus facilitat e focus groups, administer feedback surveys, and/or set up suggestion boxes. This process will help inform the development of future programs as well as whether any modifications need to be made as programs are being implemented. To define youth success in the program, ACPD will move beyond outcomes that are traditionally analyzed in correctional settings ( e.g., recidivism ) and will instead examine other indicators of youth success . Some proposed outcomes t o evaluate include youth mental and physical well-being , self -efficacy, optimism for the future, critical consciousness, and socio -emotional development. ACPD will seek to conduct thorough process and outcome evaluations of the SB 823 program on a regular basis. These types of larger evaluations typically take several years to complete and often occur every 3 -5 years. Such evaluations will be timed to be able to inform large -scale decision making . Evaluation results will also be made transparent and availa ble to the public through reports to the JJCC. Impact Justice: 47 Facilities: Immediate, Intermediate, & Long -Term Plans Overview & Background Research indicates that youth's perceptions of an institutional environment have important implications for their future success. Specifically, positive perceptions within and across dimensions of the juvenile setting reduce the likelihood of future antisocial activity, rearrest, or a return to a facility.75 The facility environment and public safety are inherently connected. In line with this research, ACPD is committed to providing as homelike an environment as possible, designed to allow developmentally appropriate normative behavior and daily life. Mentione d above, ACPD recognizes the key role that family, friends, and community play in positive youth development and will seek to allow outside community and family involvement to the greatest extent possible. Thus, both the physical facility \u2014as well as the po licies implemented within \u2014will promote positive development and dignity, physical , and psychological safety. ACPD recognizes that the current facility (discussed in more detail below) places some limitations on these goals , but remains committed to pursuin g them as future secure and step -down placement facilities are explored and developed. The SB 823 program will serve older adolescents and young adults (based on anticipated average age) . These youth may be living in SB 823 program for several years and s hall require both indoor and outdoor space to program, eat, and engage in leisure activities. The staff and providers leave each day and return , but the youth do not have such privileges . ACPD will explore all environmental options to ensure that youth hav e access to: Rooms for sleeping and relaxing that provide some level of privacy and autonomy. Leisure recreation both indoor and outdoor that is not solely adjacent to their sleeping environment Kitchen space for youth meal preparation and family -style eating . (College campuses have purposely designed these elements into their student living environments. ) Appropriately designed space for family engagement. This needs to include child appropriate spaces with related developmentally appropriate activities . 75 Schubert, C. A., Mulvey, E. P., Loughran, T. A., & Losoya, S. H. (2012). Perceptions of in stitutional experience and community outcomes for serious adolescent offenders. Criminal Justice and Behavior, 39(1), 71 -93. Impact Justice: 48 Eradication of Inhumane and Re-Traumatizing Practices Restoration cannot exist alongside harm or fear of harm. This milieu shall serve as a nurturing social environment and thus cannot include the tools of degradation and control that create physically and psychologically unsafe environments and have proven to contribute to increased mental health symptomatology and trauma. ACPD shall commit to eliminate these practices in this milieu. Camp Sweeney ACPD has already eliminated the use of pepper spray and has included that in the policy. ACPD shall utilize the same policy to eliminate the use of pepper spray on the SB 823 program. Isolation and room confinement is non -existent at Camp Sweeney , and all available alternatives to these practices shall be expl ored for the SB 823 program. Several programs throughout the country may serve as models for the elimination of such practices.76 Clothing, and personal items of comfort will not be used as rewards or sanctions. All youth will have access to \"civilian\" clothes , and ACPD will coordinate with the JJDPC and youth council to develop a plan to work toward allowing youth to wear their own clothes. There may be a dress code related to security and community standards, but there will not be a set unif orm. Youth who enter the program without sufficient clothing will be provided an initial wardrobe that they work to select with staff. While budget limits may provide a necessary constraint, the intent is to allow youth as much personal expression and freedom as possible. Minimum clothing requirements set by the BSCC will be reviewed by the JJDPC and youth council during the first year of implementation to ensure that ACPD policies meet or exceed these regulations. The intent is to promote both agency and personal dignity among youth. Given that SB 823 realigned youth will most likely be incarcerated for longer periods of time than other youth at the JJC, personal items are especially important in order to promote a homelike environment. Allowable personal items \u2014both in the individual rooms and within the unit \u2014will be examined with the goal of expanding the policy as broadly as possible. Culturally relevant p ersonal items such as toiletries and hygiene products will be provided to all youth, regardless of Ph ase or level of privilege. These items will not be restricted by sanction in any way. In addition to toiletries, youth will also be allowed a photo album in which to keep photos beyond those immediately displayed. A small bookcase or other storage option w ill be provided in each individual room to store books and other personal items. Art supplies and writing supplies will be made available. A cabinet, closet, or locker that youth can lock will be provided for each youth somewhere in the unit. Staff may hav e keys or access codes, but youth will utilize locks to promote a sense of independence and agency. Food is not only a matter of proper nutrition, quantity, and quality but represents an important connection to human self -worth and dignity. Food is centra l to cultural expressions and offers a sense of familiarity, comfort, and home. Meal planning and 76 Resources related to this may be found at: https://www.stopsolitaryforkids.org/. Impact Justice: 49 preparation provide important opportunit ies to connect with other tradition s and people. Families will be allowed to bring \"outside\" food to all family engage ment activities and times (whether brought from a restaurant or vendor or prepared at home). Finally, sleep is particularly important (and is easily disrupted) for adolescents and young adults , as noted earlier. The ability to feel safe and relaxed while sleeping is essential for healing and rest both physically and emotionally . While some lighting is necessary for safety of both youth and staff, proper darkness is needed for proper sleep. Thus, sleeping masks will be provided for all youth. Similarly , access to lighting for evening reading and other activities will be provided. Compliance with Federal and State Laws that Protect People with Disabilities Alameda County Probation will maintain full compliance with the various federal and state laws that pro tect people with disabilities (e.g., Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 and 2008, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), etc. ) to ensure protecti on for youth with disabilities . Our compliance will achieve the following: Ensure youth with disabilities receive and are able to use the same services and types of care , as all other youth within the facility. Ensure youth with disabilities are not harassed and/or discriminated against. Ensure youth with disabilities are provided with accommodations needed for equal access to programs and services. Ensure supporting aids and services are available for youth with disabilities. Ensure all structural ba rriers are removed. As part of the standard admittance process and in accordance with Title 15 regulations, youth will be screened by the appropriate staff ( i.e., medical, mental health, dental, educational , etc. ) to determine if they have a physical, men tal, or intellectual disability. Alameda County staff have and will continue to receive training to assist youth with disabilities and will make available a mechanism for referrals and evaluations. Immediate Plan for Facilities In the immediate future, AC PD intends to utilize Unit 3 at its existing Juvenile Justice Center (JJC), while exploring other options for long -term commitments. ACPD recognizes that it is not in the youth 's best interest to remain in this type of secure setting for a long period of t ime and acknowledges that the JJC was not built with long -term commitments in mind. However, it is also true that the process to design and build any new facility or campus will likely take many years. Thus, ACPD will consider and outlin e all other existin g Impact Justice: 50 possible options that could serve as a temporary Secure Placement Treatment Facility while longer -term solutions are being developed. In the meantime, ACPD is committed to transforming the space where youth will be housed to ensure the most therapeutic environment possible is immediately available. ACPD will make basic improvements to the unit, including but not limited to installing new furniture, upgrading the paint, and ensuring quality food services. The space will also be filled with images and sign s that have positive affirmations and messages, culturally relevant images, artwork, historical figures, etc. There is already wi -fi installed, which allows the youth to have access to wireless tablets with both educational and age - appropriate entertainmen t content. All rooms have chalkboards and chalk to allow for personalization and self -expression within the youth's personal spaces. The ACPD will also review policies to ensure they are truly supporting as homelike an environment as possible and are respo nsive to the needs of youth who will be in custody for several years. ACPD will prioritize reviewing policies that directly impact the youth 's daily lives, such as being able to wear their own clothes, allowing families to bring in food during visits, and reviewing and expanding the personal items that are allowed. ACPD will ensure there is a space within the unit intended for private, personal \"cool - down\" or self -regulation time. These spaces are often furnished with dimmable lighting, bean bag chairs and other soft furniture , writing and drawing supplies, aromatherapy, squeezable stress balls, etc. Spaces such as these have shown success in school environments and have shown promise in juvenile correctional settings (e.g., Sacramento County 's successful de-escalation room ).77 As part of this process, ACPD has also hired Dr. Monique Khumalo as a consultant to help flesh out the immediate plans to further soften Unit 3 and offer additional input and recommendations for renovations that might be made in a short period of time. Dr. Khumalo brings experience in providing technical assistance as it relates to the impact of trauma to child -serving systems, including juvenile justice, child welfare, education, and behavioral health. During this process , ACPD shall explore making alterations and adjustments to allow for/create the following: o Kitchen Access , or micro kitchen access o New , more homelike furniture o Mini basketball hoop o Mood lighting throughout (e.g., ceiling panels that mimic the starry nigh t) o Gym enhancement o Carpeting and rugs in the interim 77 Udesky, L. (2021, March 31). Youth detention f acility finds culture of kindness more effective than punishment. ACEs Too High. Retrieved September 20, 2021, from Justice: 51 o Outdoor space (increased space) space to eat, hangout, and exercise outside , as well as regular access to a garden space o Remov al of all possible caging, bars, locks, and barriers that are not required for licensing or mandated by reg ulation s o Open as much of the space as possible to create less confinement and more free flow o Multiple sitting areas for down time multiple TVs for group viewing projector for outdoor space (e.g., for movie nights , programming use ) String lights for outdoor space (especially any space where bars or cage not removed ) Comfortable outdoor furniture (with cushions and an umbrella ) Plants for outdoor space attached to unit De-escalation or \"cool -down\" space o Purcha se additional equipment needed to make daily life comfortable and functional Wireless headphones Tablets Mini fridges, microwaves, toaster ovens, coffee pot Desk lamps/ reading light The ACPD shall provide updates regarding these items to the Realignment Subcommittee. To the extent that any of the items are not able to be delivered due to existing legal or regulatory restrictions \u2014or due to the physical constraints of the existing facility \u2014 ACPD will report to the SB 823 Subcommittee and provide an explanat ion. Relevant updates and progress will be reported to the Subcommittee as often as it convenes. Intermediate Plan for Facilities As part of the effort to explore existing potential alternatives to the JJC, ACPD will review the possibility of using Camp Sw eeney as a Secure Treatment Facility while long -term planning is taking place. Similarly, ACPD will explore and outline the possibility of using Camp Sweeney as a possible \"step -down\" facility. Guiding this process is ACPD's belief that youth should only b e housed in a secure facility for the shortest time needed. ACPD will also begin a concurrent process of planning for the long term needs of the Department, including, but not limited to, the needs of the SB 823 realigned youth. The ACPD prioritizes beginn ing this work immediately . They are clear in their belief that the current facility is not satisfactory, and they have no intention to \"coast\" and use the JJC indefinitely. As a part of this process, the ACPD will explore how to meet the legal and regulatory requirements of a Secure Placement Treatment Facility while holding to the principles, values, and research underlying the ideal of a homelike, therapeutic environment. Impact Justice: 52 In exploring the feasibility of using the Camp, t he following issues will be addressed throughout this process : o Examine the feasibility of adding a secure perimeter . o Determining whether SB 823 secure living/programming spaces need to be at all separated from the existing camp population . o Determine whether existing Camp facilities can be ut ilized or repurposed or whether it is needed to build additional separate facilities . o Costs/ projected costs of necessary changes . o Explore whether the Camp could be used as a step -down facility. Updates on information gathered, findings, and analyses wil l be reported to the SB 823 Subcommittee. It is expected that ACPD will complete a full assessment of the possibility of using Camp Sweeney as a Secure Treatment Facility and as a potential option for a step - down facility during the first year of implement ation of this plan. ACPD will also continue to explore other existing facilities and options that may be possible for secure track use, including any regional or out -of-county facilities that may be considered. Updates on these efforts will also be provid ed to the SB 823 Subcommittee as often as it convenes. Long -Term Planning for Facilities Alameda County is committed to reimagining the possibilities for children in the county and to developing a new approach to responding to young people (even those who have committed the most serious offenses ). This includes the commitment to move away from the current juvenile hall and ultimately close or repurpose that facility, and to instead establish a complete continuum of services and housing options to meet the n eeds of young people. A full array of juvenile justice housing models to accommodate security, treatment, developmental , and emotional needs. This Subcommittee has determined that even our most secure environments should be small, homelike, and designed t o allow for normative development, emotional healing, and connectedness. The prison -like facilities that so many believed we required have been proven unnecessary and harmful. The scores of youth offenders that were predicted to fill them did not emerge. I nstead, our community, like most around the country, has witnessed unprecedented declines in juvenile crime and perhaps the generation with the lowest rates of criminal activity ever recorded. This does not guarantee that crime rates will decrease forever as that is highly dependent on a host of societal factors. However, the fact that the population is vastly smaller than predicted does offer a moment of great opportunity, and this Subcommittee has determined to capitalize on that opportunity to build a be tter approach for youth in Alameda County. Impact Justice: 53 There is no way to fully develop and implement this new approach in the time provided \u2014 nor should a plan to develop a new model that takes the County well into the future be created without a community -based plann ing process . There is no way to meet the many lofty goals of juvenile justice realignment without also addressing other aspects of the system and our overall response to children. None of our services and responses can work or be developed in a vacuum. While the development of such a process is beyond the scope of this Subcommittee, it is our intent to remain involved as the SB 823 realigned youth are particularly vulnerable to harsh system responses and the impacts of long -term confinement. The County sho uld include a broad range of stakeholders, including significant and meaningful participation of system -impacted youth and their families. The planning process should be transparent and equitable, and the resulting plan should be fiscally efficient and gro unded in equity. Other Options for Step -Down, Transitional, & Post -Release Facilities One significant task remaining for the SB 823 Subcommittee is the consideration of other facility options for step -down, transitional, and post -release facilities. The current housing crisis in the Bay Area makes the consideration and development of these options simultaneously both more challenging and more urgent. In accordance with the research and intentions included in this Plan, a focus on homelike environments will be maintained. For example, we know that converted hotels and single -room -occupancies do not work well for TAY , since the se spaces do not typically have shared common spaces to socialize, etc. One option for consideration is the developm ent of Credible Messenger Healing Homes. This concept grows out of the larger idea of credible messengers filling the role of the primary level of engagement with young justice involved youth. That role includes forming trusting relationships, providing cr isis intervention and stabilization support, advancing healing through restorative practices, supporting the development of individualized life plans, and co -navigation of progress towards achieving short -term, intermediate , and long -term goals. Given this core role and set of responsibilities, Credible Messengers can have transformative impacts in various settings, including the community, secure facilities , and transitional housing settings. Conceptually, Healing Homes are small home -like residences with 4-8 bed s that are staffed by a team of caregivers . One or two credible messengers actually live in the home and serve as on -site leaders. Other staff involved in the home may include social workers, clinicians, educational specialists, and other relevant providers. The home should serve as a safe space where youth can engage in various processes, including healing circles, restorative justice activities, and entrepreneurial projects while they prepare to be reconnected to their homes, schools, and full com munity in a safe way. Impact Justice: 54 Healing homes can be a viable option at various points in the continuum of the justice process. They can serve as viable alternatives to secure detention on the front end of the system for pre -adjudicated youth, as well as \"step down \" options for youth transitioning out of facilities. All step -down, transitional, and post -release housing options should be community -rooted assets that are resourced to connect youth and families in a healthy way, and do not involve private, for -profit e ntities with limited investment back in the communities they serve. Safety & Protection Discipline & Behavior Management Correctional policies that are not developmentally appropriate threaten the wellbeing of youth and fail to reduce recidivism.78 Hindering protective factors for desistance \u2014 including utilizing institutional confinement instead of less restrictive measures \u2014may backfire, leading to slower progress or even a reversal in progress. As discussed above, ACPD will move to eliminate the har shest behavioral controls: pepper (OC) spray, prone restraint, and room confinement. Restraints and room confinement will only be used in the case of extreme, immediate safety risk to youth or staff, and the use of prone restraints will be eliminated. Phys ical restraints have likewise been shown to cause harm and lack utility , indicating that \"high risk safety procedures that can result in severe injury or death ,\"79 and that \"can be counter -productive to treatment, disrupt essential adult -child relationshi ps, and impede children's social and emotional learning, especially among vulnerable children with severe trauma histories.\"80 In particular, there has been significant evidence regarding the dangers of prone restraint and reports highlighting the high likelihood of restraints being misused or incorrectly applied . All restraints on children may lead to numerous and serious physic al injuries, deaths, and emotional trauma. In light of the dangers of physical intervention, many have arrived at the conclusion that room confinement or seclusion present a safer or more appropriate options -- this is simply not the case. The research and empirical evidence of room confinement and isolation practices in juvenile facilities has shown that it has a harmful impact on youth's brain development, emotional health and growth, frustrates other programming efforts, hinders effective youth -staff rel ationships, and contributes to a less safe environment. 78 Adolescent and Teenage Offenders Confronting the Challenges and Opportunities of Reentry 79 Nunno, M.A., McCabe, L.A., Izzo, C.V. et al.

Child Youth Care Forum (2021). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10566 -021-09646 -w 80 Ibid. Impact Justice: 55 Isolation of adolescents can also contribute to depression, anxiety, psychosis, and other psychological as well as developmental harm. Research has demonstrated that \"overly harsh correctional polic ies and ones that are not age-specific or developmentally appropriate may hinder the reintegration of adolescent and teenage offenders\".81 Hindering protective factors for desistance, including utilizing institutional confinement instead of less restrictiv e measures, may backfire, leading to slower progress or even a reversal in progress.82 While Title 15 sets the minimum standards for compliance, Alameda County is committed to exceeding all minimum standards in the treatment and care of its youth. To that end, ACPD will develop and implement a plan to end the use of room confinement . As long as room confinement , pepper spray, and physical restraint s are used, reviews of each instance will be conducted to determine appropriate use and compliance with policy . Incident data will be provided to the appropriate body, which would also include community representation. Positive Behavior Model Consistent with the Eight EPBs of Effective Interventions, ACPD currently utilizes a point - based positive reinforcement behavior model to encourage and incentivize positive behavior and achievement of daily and weekly goals. This model relies heavily on incentives and utilizes sanctions only as a last resort and for the duration of time necessary to correct or change behavior. In line with best practices, incentives and sanctions will not be based around basic items or items of basic comfort. Moreover, rewards and incentives will be individually determined and go beyond the usual items. MDTs could help inform a ppropriate incentives based on the individual youth's plan. ACPD intends to continue utilizing this model, while remaining open to exploring other models that are intended for use in long -term stays, and that are developmentally appropriate for older youth . If and when a model is identified , which will support the target population, staff will be extensively trained in the application of the model, emphasizing the importance of incentives in encouraging positive behavior. Refresher training in the model wil l be conducted regularly, in accordance with model recommendations. Discipline and Management shall not be tied to or alter any of the following: Participation in programming Change to the food and meal policy Change to the clothing policy Participation i n extracurricular activities related to school Family visitation and communication 81 (Altschuler & Brash, 2004 ) 82 (Baglivio et al., 2018 ) Impact Justice: 56 Time and/ or supplies related to the basics of daily living such as toiletries and hygiene products, clean clothing and access to laundry, Program Refusal Lack of progress from initial assessment to reassessment may indicate the need to revise treatment/case plans and adjust how the program is working with the youth.83 If a youth refuses to participate in programming or other structured parts of the day, punishment s, or sanctions will be avoided. A trusted adult from among the therapeutic milieu will instead \"check in\" with the youth to see what might be hindering their participation. If an issue persists, it will be discussed among the MDT with the goal of identify ing the internal, intrinsic motivations of the youth that might be leveraged to encourage a positive change in behavior. Formal sanctions in these situations will be avoided and only used as a last resort. The operati ng assumption should be that youth beha vior is often the result of their environments; thus, a sincere discussion of what changes could be made to their environments to encourage a more positive reaction or behavior is warranted . In the case that this refusal may cause harm to peers, a restorat ive process, outlined below, will be relied upon. Conflict Resolution ACPD is committed to using non -punitive approaches to address conflict resolutions. A restorative justice framework will be used in cases of interpersonal conflict between youth. Restora tive responses should include all members of the unit & members of the therapeutic milieu. Credible Messengers will be relied upon for conflict resolution. Such an incorporation of credible messenger insight, experience , and expertise can have a direct im pact on conflict resolution, mediation, restorative practices , and graduated approaches to disciplinary issues. For example, one jurisdiction incorporated credible messenger contributions to their policy formation process and was able to successfully incor porate restorative approaches, while preventing/eliminating isolation, use of mechanical restraints, use of pepper spray , and other practices found to be harmful and ineffective in promoting safe spaces. Oversite & Appeals Process of All Disciplinary /Sanction Decisions SB 823 created a new local commitment option and a new category of county facilities for justice involved youth : the secure placement treatment facility (S PTF). Pursuant to Welfare 83 Baglivio, M. T., Wolff, K. T., Piquero, A. R., Howell, J. C., & Greenwald, M. A. (2017). Risk assessment trajectories of youth during juvenile justice residential placement: Examining risk, promotive, and \"buffer\" scores. Criminal justice and behavior, 44 (3), 360 -394. Impact Justice: 57 and Institutions Code 875, the Board of State and Community Corrections is charged with developing \"standards for the establishment, design, security, programming and education, and staffing\" of a secure youth treatment facility by July 1, 2023. Until those standards are finalized, S PTF must \"co mply with applicable minimum standards for juvenile facilities in Title 15 and Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations.\" In part because this is a new category of facilities, the State has yet to establish a youth bill of rights for young people co mmitted to a S PTF. A bill of rights exists for foster youth, including those placed in STRTPs, and for youth committed to DJJ. Until the State establishes a specific youth bill of rights applicable to S PTFs, Alameda County will consider the adoption of the following Youth Bill of Rights for children committed to county juvenile facilities: A. To live in a safe, healthy, and clean environment conducive to treatment and rehabilitation , and where they are treated with dignity and respect. B. To be free from physical , sexual, emotional, or other abuse s and corporal punishment. C. To receive adequate and healthy food and water, sufficient personal hygiene items, and clothing that is adequate and clean. Clothing and grooming /hygiene products shall respect the child's cultu re, ethnicity, and gender identity and expression. D. To receive adequate and appropriate medical, dental, vision, and mental health services. E. To refuse the administration of psychotropic and other medications consistent with applicable law or unless immediat ely necessary for the preservation of life or the prevention of serious bodily harm. F. To not be searched for the purpose of harassment or humiliation or as a form of discipline or punishment. G. To maintain frequent and continuing contact with parents, guardia ns, siblings, children, and extended family members, through visits, telephone calls, and mail. H. To make and receive confidential telephone calls, send and receive confidential mail, and have confidential visits with attorneys and their authorized represent atives, ombudspersons , and other advocates, holders of public office, state and federal court personnel, and legal service organizations. I. To have fair and equal access to all available services, placement, care, treatment, and benefits, and to not be subje cted to discrimination or harassment on the basis of actual or perceived rac ial/ethnic group identification, ancestry, national origin, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, mental or physical disability, or HIV status. J. To have regular opportunity for age -appropriate physical exercise and recreation, including time spent outdoors. K. To contact attorneys, ombudspersons and other advocates, and representatives of state or local agencies, regarding conditions of confinement or violations of rights, and to be free from retaliation for making these contacts or complaints. Impact Justice: 58 L. To participate in religious services and activities of their choice. M. To not be deprived of any of the following as a disciplinary measure: food, contact with parents, guardian s, or attorneys, sleep, exercise, education, bedding, access to religious services, a daily shower, a drinking fountain, a toilet, medical services, reading material, or the right to send and receive mail. N. To receive a quality education that complies with state law, to attend age - appropriate school classes and vocational training, to have access to postsecondary academic and career technical education courses and programs, and to continue to receive educational services while on disciplinary or medical stat us. O. To attend all court hearings pertaining to them. P. To have counsel and a prompt probable cause hearing when detained on probation or parole violations. Q.

S. To request additional child and family team, or MDT meetings to address concerns, including, but not limited to, change in s ervice needs, addressing barriers to sibling or family visits, and addressing difficulties in coordinating services. T. To have both informal and formal support people participate in team meetings, consistent with state law. U. To be informed of these rights in an age and developmentally appropriate manner by probation officer or credible messenger and to be provided a copy of the rights in this section at the time of intake and at least once every six months. V. The rights listed are broad expressions of the rights of the rights of youth in S PTFs and are not exhaustive of all rights set forth in the United States Constitution and the California Constitution, federal and California statutes, and case law. Grievance and review process Youth are entitled to appeal all disciplinary (sanction) decisions. With any appeal, the original penalty may remain unchanged, there may be a decrease in the severity of the sanction, or the sanction may be completely removed. Youth will have the right to file a grievance if there are c oncerns related to the conditions of their confinement and may file a grievance if it is believed that they have received unfair treatment related, but not limited to the following: Health care services (medical or mental health) Program participation Telephone usage Impact Justice: 59 Mail Visiting Food Clothing or bedding Participant safety and/or well -being is at risk Mishandling/mismanagement of personal property Program rules or procedures that adversely affect participant Mistreatment, harassment, o r violations of the nondiscrimination policy by staff Incident data Incident data will be provided to the JJCC or the JJDPC, whichever body meets more frequently. The presentation and discussion of incident data may occur in closed session if the identity of the youth may be revealed, even inadvertently. Staff With regards to staff -to-youth ratios, ACPD will adhere to national PREA standards. Under PREA standards, in secure juvenile facilities, the Department of Justice (DOJ) defined minimum staffing as \"1:8 during resident waking hours and 1:16 during resident sleeping hours. Agencies may depart from these minimum ratios during limited and discrete exigent circumstances, which are fully documented for audit purposes.\" Key Probation and Camp S taff Roles & Responsibilities : Agency/ facility leadership: set vision & tone for infusing credible messengers into the culture and framework of the facility. Ensure appropriate staffing levels, space and resources are available Safety, security and operati ons staff: support credible messenger work by facilitating access, Movement and coverage of relevant facility spaces. Behavioral Health Staff: spearhead the facilitation of the development of an overall youth engagement (programmatic and treatment) framewo rk for youth in the facility; assist with incorporating Credible Messengers into the framework ; and co - facilitate various interactions with youth. Restorative justice staff: co -facilitate development of youth engagement framework and various interactions w ith youth. Milieu Providers The therapeutic milieu/community relies on structure and predictability to include dedicated staff with clear roles and responsibilities for each community team member. It Impact Justice: 60 is proposed that a 10 -bed SB 823 programming unit be su pported by a core group of ACPD staff, ACBH clinicians , and professional Credible Messengers. Though the current position descriptions of the Probation staff do not naturally fit a clean unit management structure the ACPD shall explore mechanisms to create a more typical unit management structure with clear lines of supervision and roles and responsibilities to support the milieu. This requires a manager with the capacity and role responsibility to manage all functions on the unit and provide direction to a ll staff on the unit. At the moment , the only position with this level of supervision is the Facility Superintendent for both Camp Sweeney and the SB 823 unit. The Unit Supervisor supervises the Deputy Probation Officer only , and the Institutional Supervis or only supervises the Juvenile Institutional Officers. On its face , this split line of supervision has the capacity to create misdirection in services and programs. If this cannot be resolved , the Unit Supervisor assigned to the unit and the Institutional Supervisors must be engaged in regular discussions regarding how to jointly manage the community and all staff supporting the community to ensure cohesive practice in the milieu. This will require regular/weekly meetings between these two \"supervisory pos itions\" to determine the best strategy week to week. This is definitely possible but requires a concerted effort to avoid a divided community approach. The unit team shall consist of the following members in addition to the ACPD staff: 1-2 Dedicated Licensed Mental Health Clinicians (1 -2 FTE's) with expertise in working with BIPOC youth in the justice system and who have the capacity to engage with a team of individuals to support a milieu approach to core services. Clinicians(s) should possess the requisite education, training, and experience to provide culturally congruent individual mental health services to youth who need this level of care and participate in the designed milieu programming for the unit which should include a core pro gram focused on the development of interpersonal skills, social problem solving , and emotion management. The clinician should co -lead groups/circles with the DPO and credible messengers and/or JIO. The clinician(s) shall also provide adjunctive services su ch as suicide and self -injury assessments, and assistance in developing and implementing trauma -focused safety plans and Behavior Management Plans when necessary. The clinicians, like other team members, shall work a schedule congruent with supporting the milieu which will require mid-day to evening schedules and a rotating weekend. It is expected that only one clinician will be needed at least until the unit reaches 50% capacity. At that point a second clinician may be introduced, and the schedules modifie d to ensure appropriate coverage. The ACBH clinician shall also assess and identify youth who may during their stay require a more intensive level of care. In those instances , ACBH shall provide placement and service recommendation to ACPD. ACBH shall also collaborate with ACBH to ensure specialized services such as substance use, sex offender services, and individual therapy for transgender and intersex youth as necessary. 1-2 Credible Messengers (1-2 FTE equivalents) -will be contracted and trained , and will serve as mentors . They will act as advocates and provide program services and case planning. The Credible Messengers will assist youth in developing skills necessary to thrive Impact Justice: 61 in community and will complete an independent assessment of youth needs to b e considered during the comprehensive case planning process. The same or alternative Credible Messengers may be contracted to run culturally relevant (individualized or group ) programs in collaboration with other unit team members. The Credible Messenger team will collaborate with the other milieu providers in planning, administering, and facilitating its youth engagement functions , and will participate in relevant staff meetings to support the overall goals of youth healing, restoration, development , and p reparation for reintegration into the community. Specifically, Credible Messengers will: Form trusting relationships and lines of communication with youth . Provide individual transformative mentoring sessions . Facilitate restorative -focused group activitie s (independently and in conjunction with designated staff) . Accompany Youth as they matriculate through their Day/Evening . Credible Messenger program implementation . Document interactions with youth in designated data base . Participate in relevant staff meetings . JIO will provide engaged supervision. Engaged supervision means that they shall participate in activities with youth, provide advice and consultation, and assist with homework assignments or other tasks to support the youth. They will also assist with developing and practicing skills and motivating youth to succeed. Once trained, JIOs shall be integrated into more of the core programmatic services as co -facilitators. JIOs will also be responsible for providing input to the weekly meetings to determine youth progress via a formalized feedback process with the Institutional supervisor. Training of Milieu Providers An effective milieu program will require that all staff and service providers collaborating to provide services engage in joint trai ning on the key elements of the milieu. ACPD shall assemble a comprehensive interdisciplinary training for ACPD, ACBH and contracted providers to include the credible messengers. ACPD and all partner organizations and departments recognize that a trauma -informed approach also applies to working with staff themselves. This work may expose them to secondary and vicarious trauma, and staff may also find themselves triggered in different circumstances. Ensuring staff are trained in recognizing and responding to their own trauma(s) will help them better respond to triggers and traumas among the youth they are serving. This training shall at a minimum include: Positive youth justice Restorative justice practices Think trauma: a training for staff in juvenile justice and residential settings84 84 Pickens, I., Marrow, M., & Benamati, J. (2020). Think trauma: A training for working with justice involved youth. Los Angeles, CA, and Durham, NC: National Center for Child Traumatic Stress. Impact Justice: 62 Credible Messenger theory and practice Effective strategi es for youth and family engagement Group facilitation Conflict resolution Behavior management principles Effective case planning and case management The level system Specific interventions that will be jointly provided Secondary and vicarious trauma Mindfulness and self -regulation Credible Messengers will go through their own training. Specifically, their training will consist of the following topics: Positive youth justice framework Adolescent brain development & the impact of trauma Healing centered engagement The art and science of hope Restorative justice practices Individual transformative mentoring Crisis intervention & conflict resolution Life path planning & fundamentals of care coordination "}
