A chiropractor is a licensed health care professional who focuses on your body's capability to heal itself. [Chiropractic](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/chiropractic-care-directory) is a health care profession that cares for your neuromusculoskeletal system\u2014the bones, nerves, muscles, tendons, and ligaments. A chiropractor helps manage [back and neck pain](https://www.webmd.com/back-pain/default.htm) through the use of spinal adjustments to maintain good alignment. Chiropractic is focused on the body's ability to self-heal and includes other treatments like nutrition and exercise. By improving the neuromusculoskeletal system's ability to perform, chiropractors believe the benefits of spinal adjustment and realigning joints improve the functioning of other systems throughout the body. Chiropractor vs. osteopath Both areas are very similar. Chiropractors and osteopaths both work with your bones, connective tissue, and muscles to help with your body's function and structure. Osteopaths usually take a 4-year course to earn their BSc degree (BOst). Chiropractors have 4-5 years of training including a BSc in human sciences and chiropractic, as well as a year of postgraduate training. Then, they'll earn their degree in chiropractic. Both experts use a common technique called the \"high velocity thrust.\" This is a short and sharp motion done on your spine. It can be done in many ways. Chiropractors usually push on your spine with their hands, while osteopaths tend to use your arms and legs to make the thrusts. Many other movements are shared between the two professions. Your chiropractor might use X-rays to help diagnose you, while an osteopath usually uses them to rule out other potential issues. Treatment with your chiropractor might include six sessions. The first ones might be more frequent, while the later sessions may be on a weekly basis. With an osteopath, you'll tend to go to them \"as needed\" instead. What Does a Chiropractor Do? Chiropractors conduct an examination of a patient, looking at their spine's position and muscle reflexes. They also perform tests to diagnose the patient's condition, then come up with a treatment plan and monitor progress. Chiropractors do not prescribe pain [medication](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/pain-medication-side-effects#1). Instead, they rely on and assist the body's ability to heal itself. A chiropractor's primary therapy is spinal manipulation where they use hands or instruments to apply force to a joint in the spine, moving the joint in a specific direction for better alignment. Your chiropractor may perform treatments such as: Adjustments. This can help realign your body, allow you to move better, and lower any pain you have. Exercise. Your chiropractor might have you stretch or do certain exercises to help with joint mobility and balance. Soft tissue therapy. This can help ease spasms, tension, and tight muscles in your body. Kinesio taping. Your chiropractor might perform joint bracing or tapping to help with sprained joints or muscles. Other treatments might include hot and cold treatment, diet and weight loss counseling, or relaxation methods. Sometimes to relieve pain, chiropractors will go further by using massage therapy, ultrasound, braces, and shoe inserts. They might also refer you to other specialists like integrative medicine experts. They can give you more information on how to lower inflammation and keep a healthy weight through nutrition. Where do chiropractors work? Many chiropractors work alone, many times in special rooms within their own homes. Some also work in group clinics, general practices, or multidisciplinary practices. Some chiropractors have contracts with health authorities, primary care groups, or other practices as well. Are Chiropractors Doctors? While chiropractors don't hold a medical doctor (MD) degree, they are doctors of chiropractic care. They're not medical doctors but are still considered doctors. Chiropractors study a lot of the same subjects that medical doctors do. This includes physiology, orthopedics, anatomy, microbiology, radiology, and more. They also have a very similar amount of patient experience time, hours spent in classes, and time spent in labs like medical school students. Chiropractor Schooling In the U.S., the Doctor of Chiropractic degree is usually a 4-year program on top of 3 years of undergraduate study. All states require a chiropractor to earn a Doctor of Chiropractic degree, pass the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners exam, and obtain a license to practice in that state. Doctoral programs provide studies in life sciences like anatomy and physiology. They also provide supervised experience in making assessments, hands-on spinal adjustment techniques, and business training. In order to start a Doctor of Chiropractic degree program in the U.S., you must have at least 3 years of undergraduate education. To give out this degree, an institution must be accredited by the Council on Chiropractic Education. This degree includes classes that cover anatomy, physiology, and other basic sciences. It also provides supervised clinical experience where you learn different hands-on skills. You may also choose to complete postgraduate education in more focused areas, like pediatrics or orthopedics. Some states require a background check and exams in that state's laws about chiropractic. And as a condition of ongoing licensing, all states require continuing education. Chiropractor salary Chiropractors made a median salary of $75,000 per year (or $36.06 per hour) as of 2021.
