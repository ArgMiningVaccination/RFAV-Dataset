Dr. Weyrich does not make a general recommendation pro or con, but advises parents to discuss the following information with their doctor prior to making informed consent. Most vaccines are not 100% effective - meaning that they are not guaranteed to confer immunity to your child even if administered per the standard protocol. They do benefit overall public health through what is called \"herd immunity\". That is to say, if most children are vaccinated and develop immunity, the disease will spread much slower through the portion of the community that lacks immunity than it would otherwise. Thus vaccinated children confer protection on the unvaccinated. While it is acknowledged that there is some risk of adverse reactions to vaccinations, public health officials believe that there is greater risk to children who contract the disease. This risk/benefit calculation is complex and subject to error in the model assumptions. For example, current medical technology, improved sanitation and nutrition may greatly reduce the current risk of some diseases when compared to their historical risks. At the same time, emerging risks due to vaccination may be slow to accumulate sufficient sample size to achieve statistical significance, thus giving vaccination advocates \"plausible deniability\". Given the current medical standard of care that advocates the use of vaccinations, it would be very difficult to get approval from a medical review board to allow double-blind placebo controlled studies of alternatives to childhood vaccination. Ultimately the parent must make an informed decision, keeping in mind that each disease and type of vaccination has its own risk/benefit profile, which may also be different for each child, based on the circumstances. Because of insufficient demand by his patients to warrant stocking vaccines, Dr. Weyrich does not perform vaccinations, but refers patients seeking vaccination to a doctor or pharmacist who does provide the procedure.
