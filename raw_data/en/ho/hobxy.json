Th is systematic review was cond ucted as part of the Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months (P/B-24) Pro ject by USDA's Nutrition Evidenc e Systematic Review (NESR) team. The purpose of the P/ B-24 Project was to conduct a series of sy stematic reviews o n diet and health for women who are pregnant and fo r infants and toddlers from bi rth to 24 months of age. This project was a joint initiative led by USDA and HHS, and NESR carried ou t all of the systematic reviews. A Federal Expert Group (FEG), a b roadly representative group of F ederal researchers and program leaders, also provided input th roughout the P/B-24 Project. Mor e information about the P/B-24 Project has been published 2 and is available on the NESR website: https://nesr.usda.gov/project-specific- overview-pb-24-0 . NESR, formerly known as the ion Evidence Library (NEL), s pecializes in conducting food- and nutrition-related systematic rev iews using a rigorous, protocol -driven methodology. To conduct each P/B-24 systematic review, NESR's s taff worked with a Technical Expert Collaborative (TEC), which is a group of 7-8 l eading subject matter experts. NESR's systematic review met hodology involves developing and pr ioritizing systematic review questions, searching for and sele cting studies, extracting and assessing the risk of bias of data from each included study, synthesizing the evidence, developing a co nclusion statement, grading the evidence underlying the conclusi on statement, and recommending future research. A detailed description of the methodology us ed in conducting systematic re views for the P/B-24 Project has been published3 and is available on the NESR website: https://nesr.usda.gov/pb-24-project- methodology-0 . In addition, starting on page 26, this document includes deta ils about the methodology as it was applied to the systematic review describe d herein. An analytic framework that illustrates the overall scope o f the question, including the po pulation, the interventions and/or exposures, comparators, and outco mes of interest, is found on p age 26. In addition, the literature search plan that was used to identify studies included in this systematic review is found on page 26. 2 Stoody EE, Spahn JM, Casavale KO .

PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY What is the question? The question is: What is the rela tionship between shorter vers us longer durations of exclusive human milk feeding and d iabetes outcomes in offspring ? What is the answer to the question? Limited evidence from observa tional studies suggests that shor ter versus longer durations of exclusive human milk feeding a re associated with higher risk of type 1 diabetes. Limited evidence, from a single study tha t used a strong design, also s uggests that the duration of exclusive human milk feeding is not associated with fasting glu cose or insulin resistance at 11.5 years of age. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether or not ther e is a relationship between shorter versus longer durations of exclusive human milk feeding and type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and HbA1C throughou t the lifespan, and fasting glu cose and insulin resistance at ages ot her than 11.5 years. Why was this question asked? This important public health question was identified and prior itized as part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and De partment of Health and Human Se rvices Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months Project. How was this question answered? A team of Nutrition Evidence Syst ematic Review staff conducted a systematic review in collaboration with a group of experts call ed a Technical Expert Collaborative. What is the population of interest? The population of interest was generally healthy infants and t oddlers (ages 0-24 months) who were in studies examining diabetes outcomes throughout the lifespan. What evidence was found? This review includes 18 articles. These articles compared infants fed human milk exclusively for shorter durations with infants fed human milk exclu sively for longer durations. These articles examined avail able evidence related to diabetes outcomes in offspring, including fasting glucose, HbA1C , glucose tolerance/insulin res istance, and the incidence and prevalence of prediabetes, ty pe 1 diabetes, and type 2 diab etes. Almost all of the evidence ex amined type 1 diabetes. One study that used a strong design examined fasting glucose and insu lin resistance at 11.5 years o f age. o Individuals who were fed human m ilk exclusively for shorter du rations may have higher type 1 diabetes risk than i ndividuals who were fed human milk exclusively for longer durations. 8 o Individuals who were fed human m ilk exclusively for shorter du rations and individuals who were fed human m ilk exclusively for longer dura tions do not seem to have differences in fasting glucos e or insulin resistance at 11 .5 years of age. There are limitations in the evidence as follows: o No studies examined type 2 diab etes and only one study examine d intermediate diabetes outcomes. o Some of the articles studied gr oups of people that may have be en too small to detect whether there is a relati onship between shorter versus l onger durations of exclusive human milk feeding and type 1 diabetes in offspring. o Most of the studies asked mother s to remember how long they ha d fed their offspring human milk exclusively when they were infants, and if mothers of individuals with type 1 diabetes remembered or reported differe ntly from mothers of individuals without type 1 diabet es, it could impact the findin gs. o It is possible for factors ot her than infant feeding to impact the outcomes, and these factors were addressed differ ently by different studies. o There was no evidence from the U.S. about fasting glucose or i nsulin resistance, and metabolic risk in the U.S. m ay be higher than it is in the population with available evidence. How up-to-date is this review? This review includes liter ature from 01/1980 to 03/2016. 9 TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background This systematic review was con ducted as part of the U.S. Depar tment of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months Project. The goal of this systematic review was to examine the followin g question: What is the relationship between shorter vers us longer durations of exclusi ve human milk feeding and diabetes outcomes in offspring? This systematic review examines comparisons of infants who wer e fed human milk exclusively for shorter durati ons with infants who were fed hum an milk exclusively for longer durations. Exclusive human milk feeding was defined as feedi ng human milk alone and not in combination with infa nt formula and/or complementary foods or beverages such as cow's milk. This definition is inclusive of the World Health Organization definitions of exclusive and predominant breastfeeding, which permit limited quan tities of (a) drops or syrups containing vitamins, mineral s, or medicines, (b) water a nd water-based drinks such as sweetened water and teas, (c) fr uit juice, (d) oral rehydrat ion salts solution, and (e) ritual fluids4. Human milk was defined as mother's own milk provided at the breast (i.e., nursing) or expressed and fed fres h or after refrigeration or f reezing. Donor milk (e.g., banked milk) was not examined in this review. This systematic review examines available evidence related to diabetes outcomes in offspring, including fasting gluc ose, HbA1C, glucose tolerance/ insulin resistance, and the incidence and prevalence of p rediabetes, type 1 diabetes, and t ype 2 diabetes. Conclusion statement and grade Limited evidence from observa tional studies suggests that shor ter versus longer durations of exclusive human milk feeding a re associated with higher risk of type 1 diabetes. Limited evidence, from a single study tha t used a strong design, also s uggests that the duration of exclusive human milk feeding is not associated with fasting glu cose or insulin resistance at 11.5 years of age. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether or not ther e is a relationship between shorter versus longer durations of exclusive human milk feeding and type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and HbA1c throughout t he lifespan, and fasting glu cose and insulin resistance at ages other than 11.5 years Grade: Limited -fasting gluc ose and insulin resi stance at age 11.5 yea rs, type 1 diabetes; Grade Not Assignable - fasting gl ucose and insulin resistance a t ages other than 11.5 years, type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, HbA1C Methods The systematic review was conduc ted by a team of staff from th e Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review in collaboratio n with a Technical Expert Coll aborative. A single literature search w as conducted to identify literatur e for several related systematic reviews that examined infant m ilk-feeding practices and differe nt outcomes. The search 4 World Health Organization. Indica tors for assess ing infant and young child feeding practices: conclusions of a consensus meeting held 6-8 Nove mber 2007 in Washington D.C. WHO . 2008. 10 was conducted in CINAHL, Cochr ane, Embase, and PubMed, and used a search date range of January 1980 to March 2 016. A manual search was done t o identify articles that may not have been included in the electronic databases searched . Articles were scr eened independently by 2 NESR analysts to det ermine which articles met predetermined criteria for inclusion. Data from each included articl e were extracted, risks of bias were assessed, and both were checked for accuracy. The body of evidence was qualitat ively synthesized, a conclusi on statement was developed, and the strength of th e evidence (grade) was assesse d using pre-established criteria including evaluation o f the internal validity/risk of bias, adequacy, consistency, impact, and generalizability o f available evidence. Summary of evidence Eighteen articles met the inclus ion criteria for this systemat ic review, including 17 with evidence about type 1 diabetes, and 1 with evidence about fasti ng glucose and insulin resistance. Evidence about the association between shorter versus longer d urations of exclusive human milk feeding and higher risk of type 1 diabetes was limit ed. Seven studies found significant associations, all of w hich were inverse association s between the duration of exclusive human milk feeding and type 1 diabetes risk. However, some of the studies most likely to have sufficient statist ical power found nonsignifican t associations. The ability to draw stronger conclusions was primarily limited by this inconsi stency, insufficient sample sizes for some of the studies, c oncerns about internal validity such as the potential for confounding, and the retrospective collection of exposure data, which increases the risk of misclassification of the exposure. Evidence about the lack of an association between the duration of exclusive human milk feeding and fasting glucose and in sulin resistance at 11.5 year s of age was al so limited. One cluster randomized controlle d trial provided strong evidenc e. The ability to draw stronger conclusions was limit ed by only havi ng 1 study and bec ause the study was not conducted in the United States w here metabolic risk may be high er. There was no evidence related to type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and HbA1C, or about fasting glucose and insulin res istance outside of age 11.5 year s. 11 FULL REVIEW Systematic review question What is the relationship between shorter versus longer duration s of any human milk feeding and diabetes outcomes in offspring?

Evidence about the lack of an association between the duration of exclusive human milk feeding and fasting glucose and in sulin resistance at 11.5 year s of age was al so limited. One cluster randomized controlle d trial provided strong evidenc e. The ability to draw stronger conclusions was limit ed by only havi ng 1 study and bec ause the study was not conducted in the United States w here metabolic risk may be high er. There was no evidence related to type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and HbA1C, or about fasting glucose and insulin res istance outside of age 11.5 year s. Description of the evidence Eighteen articles met the inclus ion criteria for this systemati c review question. Of these, 17 presented evidence about type 1 di abetes (1-17) and 1 presented evidence about fasting glucose and insulin resistance (18). Type 1 diabetes The 17 articles that examined sh orter versus longer durations o f exclusive human milk feeding and type 1 diabetes presented ev idence from 15 independent stud ies. There was 1 prospective cohort study (6), 1 nested case -control study (3), and 13 indep endent case-control studies (1, 2, 4, 5, 7-17) because Samuelsson et al. (12, 13) and Virtanen et al. (15, 16) each presented data for a single study across 2 arti cles. The samples were from the U.S. (3, 5), Brazil (1, 4), Chile (8, 9), the United Kingdom (17), Finland (15, 16), Austria (10), No rway (6), Sweden (12, 13), Sweden and Lithuania (11), the Czech R epublic (7), Iran (2), and Austr alia (14). The prospective cohor t and nested case-contro l studies enrolled participants at birth (3, 6) whereas the case-control studies enrolled partic ipants with a r ange of ages that most often corresponded to cases' ages diagnosis and which typically inclu ded childhood and adolescence. The studies that reported race and ethnicity were from the U.S. and Chile. The U.S. samples included some racial and ethnic diversity [70% Non-Hispanic whi te (3); 74% white and 26% black (5)], and the Chilean samples we re reported as being from Strat a III of the sociogenetic classification (described as 40% indigenous admixture with Euro pean genetic pools that are primarily Spanish in origin) (8 ) and as having participants wit h 2 Hispanic surnames and no Amerindian background (9). Some of the studies recruited sample s based on their risk for type 1 diabetes. All of the participants in the Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY) study [Frederiksen et al. (3)] had at-risk genotypes or first-degree family members with type 1 diabetes; all of the participants in the st udy by Lund-Blix et al. (6) ha d at-risk genotypes; in the study by Alves et al. (1) the sibling c ontrols had siblings with type 1 diabetes (i.e., the cases); and in the study by Esfarjani et al. (2) the controls had no family histor y of type 1 diabetes. The prospective cohor t and nested case-control studies collecte d infant-feeding data prospectively by parent report (3 , 6). All but 1 of the case-co ntrol studies colle cted infant-feeding data by parental recall; Samuelss on et al. (12, 13) retrieved p rospectively collected infant feeding data from medical records. The outcome was medically diagnosed. The prospective cohort and nest ed case-control studies controll ed for confounding variables, 13 including family history of ty pe 1 diabetes and a marker of soc io-economic status (maternal education), which were identified by TEC members as critical co nfounding variables for this systematic review (Figure 1). A ll of the case-control studies i ncluded matching variables such as age, sex, and geographic location , and some included additional adjustment variables such as measures of socioeconomic status (3, 4, 6, 11, 14-16) and famil y history of type 1 diabetes (3, 4, 6). The study by Alves et al. (1) used family as a matching var iable so that cases and their sibling controls shared genetic and environmental factors. Fasting glucose and insulin resistance A single study examined fasting glucose and insulin resistance. The Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial (PROBIT) was a cluster randomized controlled trial of an intervention to promote prolonged dura tion and exclusivity of breastfeeding con ducted in Belarus (18). The intervention randomized maternit y hospitals to follow practices of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative, which was developed by the World Health Organizatio n and the United Nations Children's Fund, to promote and support breastfeeding among mot hers who chose to breastfeed6. The study enrolled 17 ,046 infants at bir th and observed 13,61 6 children to 11.5 years of age. Study pediatrici ans collected data about human mi lk feeding prospectively at well- baby pediatric medical appoint ments, and an audit of a random s ubset of data showed close agreement with data obt ained by maternal interview. Fasting glu cose, listed as a secondary outcome of the study7, was measured after an 8-hour fa st. Insulin was also listed as a secondary outcome of the study, and the study team used a calculator avai lable at http://www.dtu.ox.ac.uk to determine the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resist ance (HOMA-IR). The primary, intention-to-treat, analysis co mpared the intervention group to the control group (the intervention group had higher rates of exclusi ve human milk feeding measured at 3 and 6 months). Prospective cohort analyses of PRO BIT study data compared child ren fed human milk exclusively 3 to <6 months and 6 months ver sus <3 months and examined the trend across the 3 categories of duration (<3, 3 t o <6, and 6 months). Evidence synthesis Type 1 diabetes Seven of the 15 independent studi es reported significant associ ations (1, 4, 8, 9, 11, 14-16). It is notable that the study by Alves e t al. (1), which is the only s tudy in the body of evidence that paired cases with sibling contro ls to minimize confounding from shared genetic and environmental factors, found a si gnificant association. On the other hand, the studies that were more likely to have sufficient s tatistical power (i.e., studies with the largest numbers of cases and studies that recruited high-risk samples) reported both signifi cant and non-significant associations. For example, 4 (4 , 11, 14, 16) of 8 studies with >200 cases (4, 5, 7, 11-14, 16, 17) found significant associations, and 1 (1) of 3 studies that exa mined high-risk samples (1, 3, 6) found significant associations. A ll of the significant associat ions in the body of evidence were consistent in direction, suggesti ng that shorter versus longer durations of any human milk feeding are associated with higher r isk of type 1 diabetes. 6 Protecting, promoting and sup porting breastfeeding: the specia l role of maternity servi ces. A joint WHO/UNICEF statement. Int J Gynaecol Obst et 1990;31 Suppl 1:171-83. 7 U.S. National Library Clinicaltrials.gov. Version 10 October 2013. Internet: https://clinicaltrials.gov/c t2/show/NCT 01561612#wrapper (accessed February 16, 2018). 14 Specifically, Alves et al. (1) compared 123 children with type 1 diabetes with 123 of their siblings as controls at a mean of 9 years of age. Cases were fed human m ilk exclusively for about a month less than controls, and this difference was significant. In the Diabetes and Environment a round the Baltic Sea study, Sa dauskaite-Kuehne et al. (11) examined type 1 diabetes risk 1 5 years of age in 517 cases fro m Sweden, 286 cases from Lithuania, and about twice as many controls. In the Swedish sub sample that was 5 to 9 years of age, being fed human milk exclusive ly 5 months versus <5 month s was associated with significantly lower odds of t ype 1 diabetes. In the Lithuanian subsample that was 5 to 9 years of age, being fed human milk exclusive ly 2 months versus <2 month s was also associated with a significantly lower odds of t ype 1 diabetes. Of note, the study only reported asso ciations that were significant so it is not possibl e to determine how many differe nt ranges of duration were examined. In the Childhood Diabete s in Finland (DiMe) study, Virtanen et al. (15, 16) assessed type 1 diabetes risk in 103 case-contro l pairs who were up to 7 years of age (15) and 426 case-control pairs who were 7 to 14 years of age (16). The aut hors examined multiple comparisons of longer versus shorter durations of exc lusive human milk feeding. In pa rticipants who were up to 7 years of age, being fed human milk exclu sively 3 months versus <3 mo nths and 4 months versus <4 months was associated with signifi cantly lower odds of type 1 d iabetes. Similar dichotomous comparisons around 1, 2, 5, and 6 months had non-significant as sociations. The associations around 1, 2, and 5 months were cons istent in direction with the significant associations, and there was a wide CI around the 5 month point estimate indicative of s uboptimal statistical power. In participants 7 to 14 years of age, there were significant assoc iations between being fed human milk exclusively 2 months versu s <2 months, 3 months versus < 3 months, and 5 months versus <5 months and lower od ds of type 1 diabetes. Correspondi ng dichotomous comparisons around 1, 4, and 6 months had non- significant associations that were consistent in direction with the significant associations. A cross both age groups (i.e., up to 7 and 7 to 14 years), the median duration of exclusive human milk feeding was significantly lowe r in cases than in controls. Gimeno et al. (4) compared <7 and 8 to 60 days of exclusive hum an milk feeding with >60 days in 346 case-control pairs and. Being fed human milk exclusively fo r <7 days was a ssociated with a significantly higher odds of ty pe 1 diabetes, but association b etween being fed human milk 8 to 60 days versus >60 days and type 1 diabetes risk was non-signif icant and closer to the null. In both studies from Chile, Per ez-Bravo et al. (8, 9) compared the mean duration of exclusive human milk feeding in c ases and controls. In both studies, case s were fed human milk exclusively for a significantly shorter dur ation than controls. In one stud y, which examined 80 cases and 85 controls, the difference was abou t 12.5 weeks (8). In the other study, which examined 143 cases and 107 controls, the differenc e was about 2 months (9). In the study by Verge et al. (14) , type 1 diabetes risk was ass essed in the full sample of 217 cases and 258 controls and in s ubsamples who were younger and o lder than the median age of 9.2 years. In the full sample and the subsample younger than 9. 2 years of age, being fed human milk exclusively 3 months ver sus <3 months was associated with significantly lower odds of type 1 diabetes. In the subsample 9.2 years of age and older, the as sociation was in the same direction but was non-significant. The remaining 8 studies found non- significant associations betw een the duration of exclusive human milk feeding and type 1 diabetes (2, 3, 5-7, 10, 12, 13, 17). As noted above, some of these studies included a large number of cases (5, 7, 12, 13, 1 7) or high-risk samples (3, 6). The non-significant associations were inconsistent in direction. 15 In summary, a large body of obs ervational studies examined the relationship between shorter versus longer durations of exclu sive human milk feeding and typ e 1 diabetes. The significant associations came from the one study in the body of evidence th at paired cases with sibling controls (i.e., the study that minimized confounding from impor tant variables, such as genetics and environmental factors, which are shared between siblings)(1 ), and from some of the studies that included large numbers of c ases (4, 11, 14 , 16) or high-ri sk samples (1) (i.e., studies that were more likely to have suffici ent statistical power). However , other studies with large numbers of cases (5, 7, 12, 13, 17) and high-risk samples (3, 6) did no t find significant associations. Nevertheless, all of the signifi cant associations in the body o f evidence were consistent in direction. The consistency in the directi on of the significant association s is noteworthy given that the independent variables were heter ogeneous, which was a feature o f not defining longer duration or shorter duration and instead considerin g all analyses which co mpared shorter wit h longer durations of exclusive human m ilk feeding in the synthesis of t he evidence. Other strengths of the evidence included its impact and generalizabil ity. Qualitative methods were not used to judge the impact of the evidence in terms o f the magnitude of the risk of being fed human milk exclusively for a shorter duration on type 1 diabetes. However, given the i ncreasing incidence of type 1 diabetes in the U.S. and the so cial and economic consequences o f this disease89, even small decreases in the risk for type 1 diabetes have the potential to be of public healt h importance. The generalizability of the evidenc e to U.S. populations was sound overall. There was evidence from the U.S. that included some rac ial and ethnic diversity (3, 5), and all of the evidence came from countries that met the inclusion criterion of being high or ver y high on the Hum an Development Index and therefore hav ing a level of human development likely generalizable to the U.S. Some of the studies recruited high-ri sk samples that may not be gene ralizable; yet, this had the effect of increasing the studies' statisti cal power, which is important g iven the low incidence of type 1 diabetes. The body of evidence had limitations related to internal validi ty. Most of the studies were case- control studies. TEC members rec ognized the importance of case- control studies in this area because they are useful for exam ining low-incident outcomes suc h as type 1 diabetes. However, because case-control studies rely on the retrospective collecti on of exposure data, differential or nondifferential misclassification of the exposure may have intr oduced bias. Differential misclassification from recall bi as (i.e., if mothers of childre n with type 1 diabetes recalled or reported infant milk-f eeding practices differently from mothers of children without type 1 diabetes) could have resulted in over- or u nderestimations of the associa tions, whereas nondifferential misclassification would have t ended to bias the reported associ ations towards the null. There was no such concern related to the ou tcome, which was medically dia gnosed and unlikely to misclassify cases or controls . Although all of the case-control studies included matching variables, and many included addi tional adjustment variables, r esidual confounding from other variables related to infant-f eeding and type 1 diabetes risk ma y have occurred. Residual confounding may have been less o f a concern from the study that compared individuals who had type 1 diabetes with their sibl ings, with whom they shared gene tic and environmen tal factors (1); this study found that children with type 1 diabetes were fed hu man milk exclusively for a 8 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Exposures, as defined by the aut hors of the studies included i n the body of evidence, which address shorter vs longer duratio ns of exclusive human milk feeding or vice versa 3 Authors call the study a prospective cohort, however the asses sment grouped participants by outcome status rather than infant feeding exposure. 4 The authors only reported signifi cant associations; informatio n about non-significant fi ndings were not reported 5 Although the medians are the same the authors describe this as significantly shorter EBF dur ation in cases than controls Fasting glucose and insulin resistance A cluster randomized controlled tr ial, PROBIT, was the only stu dy to provide evidence about the duration of exclusive human milk feeding and fasting glucose an d insulin resistance in childhood. In the intention-to-treat analysi s, Martin et al. (18) reported no significant differences in fasting glucose or HOMA-IR at 11.5 year s of age between the interventio n group (which had higher rates of exclusive human milk feeding m easured at 3 and 6 months) and the control group. Prospective cohort analyses of PROBIT study data found a slightly higher, b ut significant, fasting glucose level in children fed human milk exclusively 3 to <6 months ver sus <3 months, but no significant difference in HOMA-IR. There were no differences in fasting glu cose or HOMA-IR between children fed human milk exclusive ly 6 months in comparison to <3 months, and the trends across the 3 categories of durat ion (<3, 3 to <6, and 6 months ) were non-significant. A strength of the evidence was it s internal validity. The inten tion-to-treat analyses of the PROBIT study was likely to have good in ternal validity because randomi zation mitigates selection bias and confounding. In addition, detecti on bias may have been reduced by collecting infant-feeding data prospectively, and an audit by PROB IT researchers found that a random subset of infant-feeding data had close agreemen t with data obtained by maternal intervi ew. On the other hand, the body of evi dence had limitations with re gard to its adequacy, generalizability, and impact. Only 1 study examined shorter ver sus longer durati ons of exclusive human milk feeding and fasting gl ucose and insulin resistance. TEC members had some doubts about generalizability of the evi dence to generally healthy U.S . populations, because U.S. populations may have higher metabol ic risk than the Belarusian population from which the PROBIT study was sampled. Regar ding the impact of the evidence, TEC members concluded there was evidence of no associ ation between the duration of ex clusive human milk feeding and fasting glucose and insulin resis tance at age 11.5 years, which would mean there is no clinical significance. 22 Table 2.

T herefore, the pr imary research recommendation is for future research to examine the relation ship between the duration of ex clusive human milk feeding and type 2 diabetes and intermediate diabetes outcomes in represent ative and well-powered U.S. samples. Large prospective sam ples could perhaps be acquired by linking surveillance systems that collect data about infant-f eeding and diabetes outcomes, o r by using electronic medical record data. Infant-feeding research will cont inue to use observational desi gns, because of ethical issues related to randomizing infant to be fed less or no human milk; however, researchers should endeavor to minimize bias through sound research design and con duct. In general, infant-feeding researchers should: Move toward collecting data c onsistently using valid and relia ble methods Increase the precision with whic h they define infant-feeding v ariables Incorporate effect modificati on into their study design whenev er possible in case different biological or environm ental characteristics modify the impact o f infant feeding on the outcomes Assess baseline differences in critical confounding variables between comparison groups, and make statistical adjustment s as necessary; additional study designs that further minimize confounding including si b-pair analyses (e.g., compari sons of associations within sibling pairs versus associati ons irrespective of sibship), ana lyses of cohorts with different confounding structures, and use o f instrumental variables such as Mendelian randomization approaches will also be helpful in minimizing con founding 24 Included articles 1.

The results of the electronic database searches were screened i ndependently by two NESR analysts in a step-wise manner by reviewing titles and abstract s, and then full text articles to determine which articles met the criteria for inclusion. A manu al search was done to ascertain articles not identified through t he electronic database search. The systematic review on shorter versus longer durations of exclu sive human milk feeding and dia betes outcomes in offspring included 18 articles. 32 Table 4.
