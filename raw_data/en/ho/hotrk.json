Title: Strategic Social Interaction Modules (SSIM) Description: The Strategic Social Interaction Modules (SSIM) program will improve military training to include the social interaction skills and abilities warfighters need for successful engagement with local populations. In the current operational environment, it is imperative to develop rapport with local leaders and civilians as their cooperation and consent will be necessary for successful operations. SSIM will emphasize the foundational social skills necessary to achieve cultural understanding in any social setting and the skills necessary for successful interactions across different social groups. These core skills do not require soldiers to have knowledge of a specific culture prior to contact but emphasizes skills for orienting toward and discovering patterns of meaningful social behavior. SSIM will develop the requisite training technology including advanced gaming/simulation techniques that incorporate new methods for practicing social agility in social encounters, as well as how to discover and adapt to unfamiliar culturally-specific conduct, manners, and practices. SSIM will enhance military effectiveness by enabling close collaborative relationships with local peoples and leaders.

Such a theory would incorporate techniques from diverse mathematical disciplines such as Stochastic Process Theory, Harmonic Analysis, Formal Languages and Theoretical Computer Science to construct a common framework wherein the quantitative value of data acquisition may be assessed relative to dynamically-varying context. In addition, the structure will accommodate the notion that data acquisition and information processing are coupled, requiring some degree of feedback and control, while simultaneously admitting the possibility of different logics, such as those that allow for incomplete and time-varying states of knowledge. The result of this effort will produce advances in fundamental domains of mathematics with the potential to reshape current DoD approaches to managing the battlespace. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Mathematically formalized the notions of information processing, strategizing and decision determination to be modeled as a computational process. - Began investigation into methods for constructing relevant models of DoD-relevant environments, and developed effective strategies for updating these as new information becomes available.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 Description: *Formerly Math for Social Networks While the DoD has been extremely effective in deploying rigorous analytical and predictive methods for problems involving continuously valued variables (tracking, signals processing), analytical methods for discrete data such as graphs and networks have not kept pace. Recent evidence has shown that social network analysis can provide critical insight when used in DoD- relevant scenarios. In this paradigm, nodes represent people of interest and their relationships or interactions are edges; the result forms a network or graph. Current analysis of social networks, however, is just in its infancy: the composition of real- world networks is understood only at the most coarse and basic details (diameter, degree distribution). In order to implement social network techniques efficiently and usefully, a better understanding of the finer mathematical structure of social networks is needed. This includes the development of a comprehensive and minimal mathematical set which characterizes social networks of DoD interest, and includes a description of how these quantities vary in both space and time. This also necessitates creation of fundamental theory of how heterogeneous social networks of different media (Facebook, Twitter, Picasa) interact. FY 2012 Plans: - Create an enhanced network modeling theory that incorporates ability to perform spatiotemporal analysis. - Investigate impact of replacing generic network nodes with human agents whose behavior can be modeled statistically. - Perform small-scale analyses of dynamic networks and demonstrate ability to recognize event precursors. - Identify relevant graph classes for DoD applications and characterize complexity classes of networks that are amenable to approximate algorithm development. FY 2013 Plans: - Derive analytic models for commonly occurring social network configurations such as call graphs. - Characterize normalcy and anomaly in structural signal constituents and formulate a detection methodology that incorporates novel noise models. - Develop Efficient Polynomial Time Approximation Schemes (EPTAS) for relevant graph algorithms and classes and proofs delineating for which classes and algorithms EPTAs are constructible. - Test modeling and detection methods against existing corpi and evaluate effectiveness. - Develop prototype of a multi-node, customized system leveraging existing hardware that realizes 10x performance time improvement in the current state of the art.

The program will require cross-disciplinary collaboration to exploit and advance unique computational models and connectivity architectures which minimize power, processing time, and/ or instruction complexity in DoD-critical applications such as image/pattern detection, signal filtering/data reduction, and change detection. Some example approaches include, but are not limited to, co-opting neuro-biological material to implement a specific function or mapping biological functions to electronic circuitry. Bayesian inference engines, specialized processors, approximate computation, and DNA computing are explicitly of interest. The ultimate goal of the Unconventional Computing program is to develop devices, architectures, and systems capable of exploiting innovative computation models to enhance the computation capabilities of the DoD.

Deeply layered machine learning engines were created that use a single set of methods in multiple layers (at least three internally) to generate progressively more sophisticated representations of patterns, invariants, and correlations from data inputs. These will have far-reaching military implications with potential applications such as anomaly detection, object recognition, language understanding, information retrieval, pattern recognition, robotic task learning and automatic metadata extraction from video streams, sensor data, and multi-media objects. Foundational Machine Intelligence also examined the human aspects of computing, with interest in collaboration, interaction and information exchange; non-symbolic representation/reasoning paradigms based upon a universal \"cortical\" algorithm; and modeling of human language acquisition by associating words with the real-world entities perceived through multiple modes of sensory input. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Created parameter-free methods that learn appropriate representations starting from raw inputs with a single architecture and learning algorithm. - Enabled machines to incorporate sensory information in a robust way to improve situational awareness. - Extended sub-symbolic learning algorithms to work with richer, non-linguistic input and knowledge representations.5.000 - - Title: Information Theory for Wireless Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (ITMANET) 2.215 - - Volume 1 - 15UNCLASSIFIED PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 16 of 47 R-1 Line #2Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 1: Basic ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0601101E: DEFENSE RESEARCH SCIENCESPROJECT CCS-02: MATH AND COMPUTER SCIENCES B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Cyber Sciences project supports long term national security requirements through scientific research and experimentation in cyber-security. Networked computing systems control virtually everything, from power plants and energy distribution grids, transportation systems, food and water distribution systems, and financial networks to defense systems. Protecting the infrastructure on which these systems rely is a national security issue. Cyberspace is not only critical to our national security, it is fundamental to our way of life: over the past decade information technologies have driven the productivity gains essential to U.S. economic competitiveness. Unfortunately, during the same period, cyber-adversaries, which include nation-states, criminal/terrorist groups, transnational actors, and miscreants, have grown rapidly in sophistication and number. The Cyber Sciences project will ensure DoD cyber-capabilities survive adversary attempts to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems. Basic research in cyber security is required to provide a basis for continuing progress in this area. Promising research results will transition to both technology development and system-level projects. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 Title: Active Authentication* Description: * Formerly Risk-Managed Access Control The Active Authentication program will develop more effective user identification and authentication technologies. Current authentication approaches are typically based on long, complex passwords and incorporate no mechanism to verify the user originally authenticated is the user still in control of the session. The Active Authentication program will address these issues by focusing on the unique aspects of the individual (i.e., the cognitive fingerprint) through the use of software-based biometrics that continuously validate the identity of the user. Active Authentication will integrate multiple biometric modalities to create a system that is accurate, robust, and transparent to the user. FY 2012 Plans: - Conceptualize methods for determining user identity that minimize user interruption. - Implement software biometric approaches that integrate cognitive features such as use of the mouse and the use of written language in an e-mail or document. - Formulate new access control mechanisms that incorporate a probabilistic measure of user identity.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This project seeks to continue the phenomenal progress in microelectronics innovation that has characterized the last decades by exploring and demonstrating electronic and optoelectronic devices, circuits and processing concepts that will: 1) provide new technical options for meeting the information gathering, transmission and processing required to maintain near real-time knowledge of the enemy and the ability to communicate decisions based on that knowledge to all forces in near real- time; and 2) provide new means for achieving substantial increases in performance and cost reduction of military systems providing these capabilities. Research areas include new electronic and optoelectronic device and circuit concepts, operation of devices at higher frequency and lower power, extension of diode laser operation to new wavelength ranges relevant to military missions, development of uncooled and novel infrared detector materials for night vision and other sensor applications, development of innovative optical and electronic technologies for interconnecting modules in high performance systems, research to realize field portable electronics with reduced power requirements, and system and component level improvements to provide greater affordability and reliability. Additionally, electronically controlled microinstruments offer the possibility of nanometer-scale probing, sensing and manipulation for ultra-high density information storage \"on-a-chip,\" for nanometer-scale patterning, and for molecular level analysis and synthesis. These microinstruments may also offer new approaches to integration, testing, controlling, manipulating and manufacturing nanometer-scale structures, molecules and devices. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 Title: Optical Radiation Cooling and Heating in Integrated Devices (ORCHID) Description: Many Department of Defense (DoD) systems use micro- and nano-electromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS). These devices are used in compact accelerometers and gyroscopes for stability control in inertial navigation and in switches for optical communication and data routing. These devices operate many orders of magnitude away from their ultimate limits. Techniques to reduce or overcome thermal noise in MEMS/NEMS devices are critical for realizing their full potential. Opto-mechanical devices offer a novel, noncryogenic path toward sensing at the standard quantum limit (SQL). Ultimately, quantum (shot) noise limits the performance of many sensitive optical instruments including force sensors, trace gas detectors, and laser gyroscopes. However, opto-mechanical devices can also control the quantum fluctuations of optical probes to reduce readout sensitivity below SQL, via a technique known as squeezing. The ORCHID program will leverage recent successes within the field of cavity-opto-mechanics to broadly explore the application space while driving technological development toward smaller and more robust devices capable of deployment in the field. It is envisioned that such devices, once demonstrated, will find broad application across DoD, particularly in the areas of force sensing and optical communication.

Title: Living Foundries* Description: *Formerly part of Synthetic Biology The goal of Living Foundries is to create a revolutionary, biologically-based manufacturing platform to provide new materials, capabilities and manufacturing paradigms for the DoD and the Nation. The program seeks to develop the new tools, technologies and methodologies to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered. The goal is to enable the rapid development of previously unattainable technologies and products, leveraging biology to solve challenges associated with production of new materials, novel capabilities, fuels and medicines and providing novel solutions and enhancements to military needs and capabilities. For example, one motivating, widespread and currently intractable problem is that of corrosion/materials degradation - a challenge that costs the DoD nearly $23 billion per year and has no near term solution in sight. Living Foundries offers the potential to program and engineer biology, and enable the capability to design and engineer systems that rapidly and dynamically prevent, seek out, identify and repair corrosion/materials degradation. Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling distributed, adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value materials, devices and capabilities in the field or on base. Such a capability will decrease the DoD's dependence on tenuous material and energy supply chains that could be cut due to political change, targeted attack or environmental accident. Living Foundries aims to do for biology what very-large-scale integration (VLSI) did for the semiconductor device industry - i.e. enable the design and engineering of increasingly complex systems to address and enhance military needs and capabilities. Living Foundries will develop and apply an engineering framework to biology that decouples biological design from fabrication, yields design rules and tools, and manages biological complexity through simplification, abstraction and standardization. The result will be to enable the design and implementation of complex, higher-order genetic networks with programmable functionality and DoD applicability. Research thrusts include developing the fundamental tools, capabilities and methodologies to accelerate the biological design-build-test cycle, thereby reducing extensive cost and time it takes to engineer new systems and expanding the complexity and accuracy of designs that can be built. Specific tools and capabilities include: interoperable tools for design, modeling, and automated fabrication; modular regulatory elements devices and circuits for hierarchical and scalable engineering; standardized test platforms and chassis; and novel approaches to process measurement, validation and debugging.

Title: Tactical Biomedical Technologies* Description: *Previously funded in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-02 The Tactical Biomedical Technologies thrust will develop new approaches to deliver life-saving medical care on the battlefield. Uncontrolled blood loss is the leading cause of preventable death for soldiers on the battlefield. While immediate control of hemorrhage is the most effective strategy for treating combat casualties and saving lives, currently no method other than surgical intervention can effectively treat intracavitary bleeding. A focus in this thrust is the co-development of a materials-based agent(s) and delivery mechanism capable of damaged tissue-targeted hemostasis and wound control. This system will effectively treat compressible and non-compressible wounds regardless of geometry or location. Additionally, rapid response to emerging biological threats on the battlefield is impacted by logistical delays of delivering the necessary therapeutics. Creating a \"pharmacy on demand\" will enable far-forward medical providers to manufacture and produce small molecule drugs and biologics in order to ensure that the therapeutics are available when they need them. This project will also develop new algorithms, protocols, and methods to allow registration and comparison of disparate sources of data in biology (across species, experimental systems, hierarchies and populations).

This need is ever increasing as researchers and scientists seek to better understand anatomical, functional and cellular level interactions. This thrust will also address how to improve the delivery of medical care and medical personnel protection by building a simulated environment for rapid after-action review of field events generated from current military systems.

The goal of the Reliable Neural-Interface Technology (RE-NET) program is to develop the technology and systems needed to reliably extract information from the nervous system at the scale and rate necessary to control state-of-the-art high-performance prosthetic limbs. The program will increase the channel-count (amount information) of reliable peripheral-nervous-system interfaces and increase the operational lifetime (reliability) of central-nervous-system interfaces. In support of these efforts, the RE-NET program is developing methods to quantitatively assess, model, predict, and accelerate the leading causes of neural interface degradation and failure. Through this focus on reliability, the RE-NET program will enable clinically relevant technology transitions in support of wounded warriors. FY 2012 Plans: - Develop a tactor-array system for use in veterans with upper-limb amputations.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 Description: Sepsis, a bacterial infection of the blood stream, is a significant cause of injury and death among combat-injured soldiers. The goal of this program is to develop a portable device capable of controlling relevant components in the blood volume on clinically relevant time scales. Reaching this goal is expected to require significant advances in sensing in complex biologic fluids, complex fluid manipulation, separation of components from these fluids, and mathematical descriptions capable of providing predictive control over the closed loop process. The envisioned device would save the lives of thousands of military patients each year by effectively treating sepsis and associated complications. Applied research under this program further develops and applies existing component technologies and then integrates these to create a complete blood purification system for use in the treatment of sepsis. Included in this effort will be development, integration and demonstration of non-fouling, continuous sensors for complex biological fluids; implementation of high-flow microfluidic structures that do not require the use of anticoagulation; application of intrinsic separation technologies that do not require pathogen specific molecular labels or binding chemistries; and refinement of predictive modeling and control (mathematical formalism) with sufficient fidelity to enable agile adaptive closed-loop therapy.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 The goal of this thrust is to radically improve the state of the art for upper limb prosthetics, moving them from crude devices with minimal capabilities to fully integrated and functional limb replacements. Current prosthetic technology generally provides only gross motor functions, with very crude approaches to control. This makes it difficult for wounded soldiers to re-acquire full functionality and return to military service if so desired. The advances required to provide fully functional limb replacements will be achieved by an aggressive, milestone driven program combining the talents of scientists from diverse areas including: medicine, neuroscience, orthopedics, engineering, materials science, control and information theory, mathematics, power, manufacturing, rehabilitation, psychology and training. The results of this program will radically improve the ability of combat amputees to return to normal function. FY 2013 Plans: - Complete demonstration of neural control of arms with closed-loop feedback by spinal cord injured patients. - Demonstrate safety and stability of sensory feedback over multiple month periods. - Finalize and submit complete FDA package to obtain approval for commercial production of neural interface devices. - Support transition efforts of neural recording and stimulation devices. Title: Preventing Violent Explosive Neurologic Trauma (PREVENT) Description: The Preventing Violent Explosive Neurologic Trauma (PREVENT) program seeks to understand the causes of blast-induced traumatic brain injury (TBI), an injury that while previously described in the warfighter population, has been referred to as a potential \"hidden epidemic\" in the current conflict. PREVENT will use a variety of modeling techniques based on in-theater conditions to assess potential TBI caused by blast in the absence of penetrating injury or concussion. Research will create a model that can be directly correlated to the epidemiology and etiology of injury seen in returning warfighters, and attempt to determine the physical and physiological underpinnings and causes of the injury. The program will combine raw data collected from in-theater blast gauges with medical and event reports to conduct a complete analysis. As part of the mitigation and treatment strategy, candidate therapeutics are being tested in order to alleviate inflammation from both acute and chronic injury. This program continues efforts previously funded in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-02. FY 2012 Plans: - Continue longitudinal study on warfighters pre- and post-deployment in order to relate specific in-theater blast exposure to evidence and rates of blast TBI. - Further examine mechanisms of blast TBI by expanding porcine population and conducting analysis of imaging, proteomics and histopathology and showing relevancy to observed warfighter injuries. - Transition and support studies of therapeutic strategies to military medical community.- 3.766 - Accomplishments/Planned Programs - 64UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602115E: BIOMEDICAL TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 11 of 11 R-1 Line #8Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602115E: BIOMEDICAL TECHNOLOGY D.

Title: Integrity Reliability Integrated CircuitS (IRIS) Description: The U.S. military now consumes only approximately one percent of the total integrated circuit (IC) production in the world and increasingly relies on foreign foundry and supplier sources for ICs used within its systems. Given the relatively low consumption, the U.S. military IC requirements are not a factor that can influence IC production or the assurance that parts are delivered as specified. With the majority of ICs used in modern military systems fabricated offshore, this situation presents a potential future risk that the parts acquired will not operate only in the specified manner. The objective of the Integrity and Reliability of Integrated CircuitS (IRIS) program is to develop the technology to derive the functionality of an IC to determine unambiguously if malicious modifications have been made to that IC, and to accurately determine the IC's useful lifespan from a physical perspective. The IRIS program will develop nondestructive scientifically based techniques for full functionality identification and functionality modification detection for ICs utilized in military systems. In addition, the IRIS program will develop innovative test technologies and processes that can determine an IC's useful lifespan based on a significantly reduced number of samples. Once developed, the resulting technologies may be deployed to Government or appropriate organizations that can provide critical IC functionality and reliability inspection services to the DoD, thereby ensuring that a scientific means is available to determine functionality and reliability in the various ICs deployed in DoD systems. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Completed designs of digital IC test articles for functional derivation. - Completed designs of mixed-signal IC test articles for functional derivation. - Completed designs of digital and mixed-signal IC test articles for reliability studies.

Higher level organisms have two distinct immune systems: the innate system is fast and deadly but is only effective against a fixed set of pathogens; the adaptive system is slower, but can learn to recognize novel pathogens. Similarly, CRASH will develop mechanisms at the hardware and operating system level that eliminate known vulnerabilities exploited by attackers. However, because novel attacks will be developed, CRASH will also develop software techniques that allow a computer system to defend itself, to maintain its capabilities, and even heal itself. Finally, biological systems show that diversity is an effective population defense; CRASH will develop techniques that make each computer system appear unique to the attacker and allow each system to change over time.

Title: Resilient Clouds* Description: *Formerly Resilient Networks The Resilient Clouds program will create technologies to enable cloud computing systems to survive and operate through cyber attacks. Vulnerabilities found in current standalone and networked systems will be amplified in cloud computing environments. Resilient Clouds will address this by creating advanced network protocols and new approaches to computing in potentially compromised distributed environments.

Title: High Assurance Cyber Military Systems* Description: *Formerly Assured Mobile Platform The High Assurance Cyber Military Systems program will develop and demonstrate the technologies required to secure mission- critical embedded computing systems. The DoD is making increasing use of networked computing in systems such as military vehicles, weapon systems, ground sensors, smartphones, personal digital assistants, and other communication devices. This dependence makes it critically important that the embedded operating system provides high levels of inherent assurance. This operating system must also integrate the computational, physical, and networking elements of the system while running on a processor with very limited size, weight, and power. Consequently, it can only devote a limited share of its computational resources to security while satisfying hard real-time constraints. Recent advances in program synthesis, formal verification techniques, low-level and domain-specific programming languages, and operating systems mean that fully verified operating systems for embedded devices may be within reach at reasonable costs. Systems that admit static verification can provide both high assurance and high performance to avoid the many dynamic checks otherwise necessary to provide high assurance. The program will develop, mature, and integrate these technologies to produce an embedded computing platform that provides a high level of assurance for mission-critical military applications. FY 2012 Plans: - Perform detailed requirements and systems engineering analyses to identify embedded devices requiring high assurance levels and a corresponding concept of operations. - Produce a high-level design for identified embedded computing platforms that provides a high level of assurance for military users. - Develop approaches to reduce the time to produce high-assurance embedded systems by leveraging existing high assurance systems, either through a modular architecture or through tool reuse. FY 2013 Plans: - Build tools to assist in the rapid creation of high-assurance embedded computing systems on a variety of architectures. - Construct a high-assurance embedded operating system for two selected embedded devices using developed tools and techniques. - Formally verify full functional correctness for selected operating systems.- 8.250 17.000 Volume 1 - 81UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 16 of 28 R-1 Line #12Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYPROJECT IT-03: INFORMATION ASSURANCE AND SURVIVABILITY B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 - Demonstrate required security properties that follow from correctness. Title: Cyber Physical Assurance and Resiliency (CYPHAR) Description: Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are physical and engineered systems that integrate computing, communication, and storage capabilities with monitoring and/or control of entities in the physical world. CPSs are at the core of all modern weapons systems, critical infrastructure, transportation, and manufacturing environments. Due to the real-time and mission-critical nature of these systems, past and present CPS designs have focused on safety and performance with little-to-no emphasis given to resilience or assurance in the context of malicious intent. This leaves these systems vulnerable to exploitation and attack. The Cyber-Physical Assurance and Resiliency (CYPHAR) program will develop the scientific foundations that enable the design and implementation of fundamentally or highly secure systems that are capable of maintaining state awareness and an accepted level of operation in the presence of CPS threats. Scientific developments will include the definition of measures, metrics, and algorithms needed to optimize the security, safety, and performance of next generation CPS designs and will also allow for the holistic assessment of current systems in a quantitative manner. This program will develop technologies to provide provably secure protection mechanisms needed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of system resources to support the design, testing, and implementation of highly assured and resilient CPSs. FY 2013 Plans: - Define the characteristics, measures, metrics, and associated design principles needed to build highly resilient and assured cyber physical systems (such as optimal CPS sensor distribution/placement, resiliency and assurance metrics, and latency/ response requirements). - Initiate the development of lightweight, provably secure, and highly integrated CPS sensors and encryption devices for detection and protection of combat systems. - Develop algorithms needed to autonomously create detection rule sets based on holistic CPS sensor readings.- - 9.000 Title: Rapid Planning (RP) Description: The Rapid Planning (RP) program will develop rapid planning and replanning tools based on recent mathematical advances. The program will develop tools and techniques for rapid generation and adaptation of robust plans in the presence of uncertainty, imprecision, incomplete, and contradictory data and assumptions. RP will also provide a capability for monitoring plans, providing continuous replanning capability, and plain text explanations for recommended plans. RP will invest in mathematical methods to improve optimization including new branch and bound, mixed integer programming, and sub-modularity methods; techniques for accelerated simulation where accuracy can be traded for speed; design of experiments through manifold learning and identification techniques that build upon previous DARPA programs; and develop a process that is aware of interdependencies in plans and aids planners in resolving these interdependencies.5.000 9.169 - Volume 1 - 82UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 17 of 28 R-1 Line #12Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYPROJECT IT-03: INFORMATION ASSURANCE AND SURVIVABILITY B.

Title: Trusted Software Description: The Trusted Software program will meet DoD demands for reliable and robust software using technology to diagnose software for inefficiencies, design errors, redundant code, and overall software inconsistencies. Current software projects are massive, dynamic social efforts involving distributed teams of developers, marketers, and users. Without the proper tools, the software engineers create errors and redundancies providing unintended and exploitable security flaws. This program will develop specific techniques to extract information on software products, model the development environment, and integrate the models into low-level software analysis tools to provide a robust diagnostic tool for building and validating trustworthy software. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Developed techniques for analyzing inter-application communication paths, including unintended paths that represent security vulnerabilities, between applications installed on a particular device. - Demonstrated feasibility of scaling the inter-application communication analysis techniques up to an apps marketplace in tests on open source apps. - Coordinated inter-application communication analysis results with potential users at NIST.

These network-based functions support the real-time, fast-reaction operations of senior leadership, major commands and field units. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Continued the CORONET effort to develop the network control and management software, the CORONET network-emulation testbed and the plans for technical testing and demonstrations, and formulated the technology transition plan. - Continued to work with DISA on technical oversight and evaluation of the CORONET software development effort and associated test plan. - Identified opportunities for commercial transition as well as future integration into the DISN-Core and other DoD networks. Title: Intrinsically Assured Mobile Ad-Hoc (IAMANET) Description: The Intrinsically Assured Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (IAMANET) program completed a series of successful research programs to design a tactical wireless network that is secure and resilient to a broad range of threats which include cyber attacks, electronic warfare and malicious insiders (or captured/compromised radios). Previous programs included the Dynamic Quarantine of Computer-Based Worms (DQW) and Defense Against Cyber Attacks on Mobile Ad-hoc Network Systems (DCAMANET). IAMANET built upon the successes achieved in both the DQW and the DCMANET programs. IAMANET directly supports the integrity, availability, reliability, confidentiality, and safety of Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) communications and data. In contrast, the dominant Internet paradigm is intrinsically insecure. For example, the Internet does not deny unauthorized traffic by default and therefore violates the principle of least privilege. In addition, there are no provisions for non-repudiation or accountability and therefore adversaries can probe for vulnerabilities with impunity because the likelihood of attributing bad behavior to an adversary is limited. Current protocols are not robust to purposely induced failures and malicious behavior, leaving entire Internet-based systems vulnerable in the case of defensive failure. IAMANET, on the other hand, uses a deny-by-default networking paradigm, allowing only identifiable authorized users to communicate on the network. While the objective transition path for IAMANET technologies is to the Services to support mobile tactical operations, the IAMANET systems are interoperable with fixed networks and may also have potential applicability to the broader DoD network architecture.

Title: Trustworthy Systems Description: The Trustworthy Systems program provided new approaches to network-based monitoring that provide maximum coverage of the network (i.e. from the NIPRNET/Internet gateway to service enclaves) with performance independent of the network's size, and with computational costs that either remain constant or decrease as the network's speed or relative size increases. The deliverable of this program provided network defense technologies with: (1) high probability of detection (Pd) of malicious traffic per attack launched and, (2) a false alarm rate of not more than one false alarm per day. This technology provided gateway-and-below network traffic monitoring approaches that scale at rates that are linear (or less) to increases in network size and transmission speeds. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Developed and integrated test-case scenarios to be used in final product testing. - Completed final asymmetric routing pathway flow and traffic analysis algorithms and initiated integration into COTS high speed switching device to meet 40 Gbps speed thresholds. - Performed network testing of the 10 Gbps and 100 Gbps products.5.731 - - Title: Cyber Insider Threat Description: The Cyber Insider Threat program is developing technologies for identifying advanced cyber threat missions that may be currently ongoing within DoD and government interest systems and networks. The program focuses on identifying ongoing adversary missions rather than a person, program, or particular piece of malware. Current cyber defenses are primarily based on network and host intrusion detection and look for \"break-ins\" and abnormal behavior without context. The CINDER program is building tools and techniques that apply mission templates of advanced cyber espionage onto seemingly normal internal system and network activity. Through this, CINDER will uncover ongoing advanced persistent cyber threats and espionage that exist within our own cyber environments. This work is continuing in PE 0603760E, Project CCC-04 beginning in FY 2012. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Identified several areas of significant cyber insider threat currently not covered in existing technologies and capabilities. - Characterized templates for dimensions of activity, observables, and stages of existing compromises for cyber insider threat missions.10.500 - - Volume 1 - 85UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 20 of 28 R-1 Line #12Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYPROJECT IT-03: INFORMATION ASSURANCE AND SURVIVABILITY B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This project is developing powerful new technologies for processing foreign languages that will provide critical capabilities for a wide range of military and national security needs, both tactical and strategic. The technologies and systems developed in this project will enable our military to automatically translate and exploit large volumes of speech and text in multiple languages obtained through a variety of means. Current U.S. military operations involve close contact with a wide range of cultures and peoples. The warfighter on the ground needs hand-held, speech-to-speech translation systems that enable communication with the local population during tactical missions. Such tactical applications imply the need for two-way (foreign-language-to-English and English-to-foreign-language) translation. Because foreign-language news broadcasts, web-posted content, and captured foreign-language hard-copy documents can provide insights regarding local and regional events, attitudes, and activities, language translation systems also contribute to the development of good strategic intelligence. Such strategic applications require one-way (foreign-language-to-English) translation. Exploitation of the resulting translated content requires the capability to automatically collate, filter, synthesize, summarize, and present relevant information in near real-time. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 Title: Robust Automatic Translation of Speech (RATS) Description: The Robust Automatic Transcription of Speech (RATS) program addresses conditions in which speech signals are degraded by distortion, reverberation, and/or competing conversation. Robust speech processing technologies will enable soldiers to hear or read clear English versions of what is being said in their vicinity, despite a noisy or reverberant environment. RATS technology will isolate and deliver pertinent information to the warfighter by detecting periods of speech activity and discarding silent portions, determining the language spoken, identifying the speaker, and recognizing key words in challenging environments. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Adapted automatic speech recognition technologies to cope with highly degraded signals. - Optimized new processing techniques for speech activity detection, language identification, speaker identification, and keyword spotting. - Developed bio-inspired algorithms to enable RATS processing. - Developed methods for detecting relevant speech segments.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Cyber Technology project supports long term national security requirements through the development and demonstration of technology to increase the security of military information systems. Over the past decade the DoD has embraced net-centric warfare to enable geographically dispersed forces to attain a high level of shared battlespace awareness that is exploited to achieve strategic, operational, and tactical objectives. This involves networking people, platforms, weapons, sensors, and decision aids to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. Adversaries seek to limit this force multiplier effect through cyber attacks intended to degrade, disrupt, or deny military computing, communications, and networking systems. These cyber attacks often aim to exploit vulnerabilities and defects in military software systems. Technologies developed under the Cyber Technology project will ensure DoD cyber-capabilities survive adversary cyber attacks. Promising technologies will transition to system-level projects. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 Title: Cyber Situational Awareness (CSA)* Description: *Formerly Cyber Situational Awareness and Response (CSAR) The Cyber Situational Awareness (CSA) program will develop technologies to enable comprehensive awareness and understanding of the cyber environment as required for decision-making for cyber defensive actions. This includes intelligence preparation of the cyber battlespace, indications and warning of adversary actions, detection of attack onset, attacker identification, and cyber battle damage assessment. Cyber situational awareness is made difficult by the efforts of attackers to elude detection. Approaches to cyber situational awareness will include forensic techniques to exploit data derived from events on hosts and networks that might appear innocuous when examined in isolation but reveal patterns indicative of a threat when correlated in time and space across an enterprise. CSA will also create new graphical interfaces that enable intuitive visualization of events on hosts and networks to aid in the detection of cyber attacks. This is an area where metrics are difficult to obtain, and so CSA will extend operationally-meaningful measures such as mean-time-to-detect and false-alarm rate to estimate the efficacy of proposed schemes. FY 2012 Plans: - Identify events on hosts and networks having the greatest potential to provide indications and warning of cyber attack. - Conceptualize new graphical interfaces that enable intuitive visualization of anomalous events on hosts and networks suggestive of cyber attack.- 10.000 21.818 Volume 1 - 92UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 27 of 28 R-1 Line #12Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYPROJECT IT-05: CYBER TECHNOLOGY B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 - Develop canonical classes of cyber attacks and operationally-meaningful metrics to estimate the efficacy of cyber situational awareness schemes. FY 2013 Plans: - Develop and implement advanced analytic approaches and intuitive user interfaces that correlate and display events of interest in time and space across an enterprise to enable awareness of subtle intrusion attempts and persistent penetrations. - Assess the effectiveness of the cyber situational awareness techniques in detecting novel and established cyber-attacks. - Develop collaborative/interactive system concepts to enable warfighters to anticipate cyber effects and to develop cyber tactics, techniques, and procedures. - Develop and demonstrate automated algorithms/protocols that measure mission effectiveness and dynamically reconfigure network and computing resources to render attacks ineffective. Title: Cyber Camouflage, Concealment, and Deception (C3D) Description: The Cyber Camouflage, Concealment, and Deception (C3D) program will develop novel approaches for protecting cyber systems that mimic camouflage, concealment, and deception in the physical world. These will make attackers expend more resources to achieve their goals and provide an asymmetric advantage for the defender. C3D will enable the creation, deployment, management, and control of synthetic entities, objects, resources, and identities that produce uncertainties for attackers and make their task significantly more difficult, perhaps even intractable. With C3D, infrastructure and other enterprise resources such as switches, servers, and storage could be virtually replicated to confound enemy targeting. Decoy file systems could confuse attackers thereby greatly decreasing their odds for success. FY 2012 Plans: - Develop a framework for the creation, deployment, management, and control of synthetic entities, objects, resources, and identities on enterprise information systems. - Develop approaches for creating multiple plausible versions of file systems and data where provenance will be uncertain for the attacker. - Explore techniques capable of deceiving an attacker into believing they have executed a successful phishing attack when in fact they have been deceived by an intelligent synthetic user. FY 2013 Plans: - Demonstrate initial implementations of native and hosted synthetic object managers compatible with the most commonly used hypervisors and operating systems. - Develop techniques for protecting the synthetic object manager from detection or compromise by an attacker.- 7.596 15.000 Title: Crowd Sourced 1 - 93UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 28 of 28 R-1 Line #12Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602303E: INFORMATION & COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGYPROJECT IT-05: CYBER TECHNOLOGY B.

These technologies will lead to systems with increased self-reliance, cooperative behavior, and the capacity to reconfigure themselves and survive with reduced programmer intervention. These capabilities will make the difference between mission success and mission degradation or failure, even in the event of cyber-attack or component attrition resulting from kinetic warfare or accidental faults and errors. Systems that learn and reason will reduce the requirement for skilled system administrators and dramatically reduce the overall cost of system maintenance. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 Title: Autonomous Robotic Manipulation (ARM) Description: The Autonomous Robotic Manipulation (ARM) program is developing advanced robotic technologies that will enable autonomous (unmanned) mobile platforms to manipulate objects without human control or intervention. A key objective is intelligent control of manipulators to independently perform subtasks over a broad range of domains of interest to the warfighter, thereby reducing operator workload, time on target, training time, bandwidth, and hardware complexity. Current manipulation systems have many limitations. For example, while they perform well in certain mission environments, they have yet to demonstrate proficiency and flexibility across multiple mission environments; they require burdensome human interaction and the full attention of the operator; and the time required to complete tasks generally exceeds military users' desires. ARM will create manipulators with a high degree of autonomy capable of serving multiple military purposes across a wide variety of application domains including, but not limited to, counter-improvised explosive device, countermine, search and rescue, weapons support, checkpoint and access control, explosive ordnance disposal, and combat casualty care (including battlefield extraction). ARM will enable autonomous manipulation systems to surpass the performance level of remote manipulation systems that are controlled directly by a human operator. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Developed manipulation primitives for handling a variety of objects, such as opening a door lock or a satchel. - Developed kinesthetic search techniques based on tactile and haptic sensing.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Collective Cognitive Systems and Interfaces project will dramatically improve warfighter and commander effectiveness and productivity using advanced cognitive approaches that enable faster, better informed, and more highly coordinated actions than those of our enemies. This will be accomplished by developing revolutionary methods that increase our information processing capabilities, enhance our situational awareness, and enable more cohesive group action by our forces. Critical technical areas addressed in this project include automated decision support, information sharing, ensured communications, and advanced informatics. Cognitive decision support tools reason about tasks, timings, and interactions so that when plans change or the enemy does not respond as anticipated, U.S. forces can quickly adapt. The quality of such decisions and the effectiveness of our actions depend critically on our ability to take full advantage of all available information in a rapid and flexible manner. This requires the capability to share information and to automatically integrate distributed information bases for broad tactical battlespace awareness. Finally, the use of advanced informatics will help guide user's to information most relevant to them, assist caregivers with treatment, destigmatize the psychological health process, and help alert DoD to emerging psychological health trends and crises. The suite of programs under this project will significantly advance the military's ability to successfully deal with complex situations in operational environments. B.

FY 2012 Plans: - Develop improved visual intelligence capabilities based on initial assessments and evaluate on additional relevant datasets. - Integrate visual intelligence into a prototype smart camera and perform concept demonstration. Title: Visual Media Reasoning (VMR)* Description: *Previously Web-Scale Information Integration The Visual Media Reasoning (VMR) program will create technologies to automate the analysis of enemy-recorded photos and videos and identify, within minutes, key information related to the content. Such identification will include the names of individuals within the image (who), the enumeration of the objects within the image and their attributes (what), and the image's geospatial location and time frame (where and when). Large data stores of enemy photos and video are available but cannot be easily leveraged by a warfighter or analyst attempting to understand a specific new image. The VMR program will enable users to gain insights rapidly through application of highly parallelized image analysis techniques that can process the imagery in massive federated image stores. VMR technology will serve as a force-multiplier by rapidly and automatically extracting tactically relevant information for the human analyst and alerting the analyst to scenes that warrant the analyst's expert attention. This effort will be funded in PE 0602702E, Project TT-13 beginning in FY 2013. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Identified operational imagery analysis scenarios (use cases), needs, and constraints. - Conceptualized approaches for automatically analyzing enemy-recorded photos and videos. - Explored potential partnerships with DoD/IC agencies. FY 2012 Plans: - Create application programming interfaces (APIs) as the basis for an open architecture that facilitates integrating new computer vision algorithms. - Demonstrate and integrate algorithms into a single system. - Identify and quantify the desired levels of operational accuracy and performance for each of the areas: Who, What, Where and When, using feedback from the warfighter/analyst user group.4.289 11.917 - Accomplishments/Planned Programs Subtotals 34.773 52.276 - D.

B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 Title: Anti-Submarine Vessel (ACTUV) Description: The Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) program has three primary goals: (1) to build and demonstrate an experimental unmanned vessel with beyond state-of-the-art platform performance based on clean sheet design for unmanned operation, (2) demonstrate the technical viability of operating autonomous unmanned ships at theater or global ranges under a sparse remote supervisory control model, and (3) leverage unique ACTUV characteristics to transition a game changing ASW capability to the Navy. By establishing the premise that a human is never intended to step on board at any point in the operational cycle, ACTUV concepts can take advantage of an unexplored design space that eliminates or modifies conventional ship design constraints such as internal arrangement, reserve buoyancy, and dynamic stability in order to achieve disproportionate speed, endurance, and payload fraction. The resulting unmanned naval vessels must possess sufficient situational awareness and autonomous behavior capability to operate in full compliance with the rules of the road and maritime law to support safe navigation for operational deployments spanning thousands of miles and months of time. When coupled with innovative sensor technologies, the ACTUV system provides a low cost unmanned system with a fundamentally different operational risk calculus that enables game changing capability to detect and track even the quietest diesel electric submarine threats.

By defending airborne platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles against proliferated, deployed, and next-generation man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), Excalibur will enable these reconnaissance platforms to fly at lower altitude and obtain truly persistent, all-weather ground reconnaissance despite low-lying cloud cover. Proliferated and emerging threats will be evaluated for the potential of developing a near-term capability utilizing a single high-power fiber laser amplifier.

Title: Aero-Adaptive/Aero-Optic Beam Control (ABC) Description: The goal of the Aero-Adaptive/Aero-Optic Beam Control (ABC) program is to improve the performance of high- energy lasers on tactical aircraft, against targets in the aft field-of-regard. In order to achieve a large field-of-regard, current optical turret designs protrude into the flow. This causes severe optical distortions in the aft field-of-regard due to turbulence in the wake and the unsteady shock movement over the aperture. These distortions decrease the power flux on target (the measure of lethality for a directed energy system) and consequently limit the utility of directed energy systems to targets in the forward field-of-regard. This program will optimize flow control strategies for pointing angles in the aft field-of-regard. The program will also explore the ability to synchronize the flow control system with adaptive optics. This effort will initially focus on wind tunnel testing to prove the feasibility of steady and periodic flow control techniques to reduce or regularize the large scale turbulent structures surrounding an optical turret. These tests will culminate in a hardware-in-the-loop demonstration utilizing flow control with an adaptive optics system in a full-scale wind tunnel test for the turret. Following successful wind tunnel demonstrations, a preliminary design of a flight test turret incorporating flow control will be undertaken. Completion of detailed design and fabrication will be carried on under the HELLADS program budgeted in PE 0603766E, Project NET-01. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Performed initial testing of full-scale flow control in open-loop wind tunnel testing of ABC turret. - Demonstrated and validated ABC concept with closed-loop adaptive optic system and flow control in a full-scale wind tunnel test.5.100 4.227 - Volume 1 - 130UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 17 of 30 R-1 Line #20Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGYPROJECT TT-06: ADVANCED TACTICAL TECHNOLOGY B.

Title: RealWorld Description: The RealWorld program exploited technical innovation and integration to provide any U.S. warfighter with the ability to open a laptop computer and rehearse a specific mission in the relevant geo-specific terrain, with realistic physics. Because the system is scalable and distributed, a warfighter can practice by himself, in a small group, or with as many other warfighters as needed for the mission over a local or distributed network, and across all relevant platforms (dismounts, vehicles, helicopters, and fast movers). Most important is the understanding that RealWorld is not a static simulation; it is a simulation builder with applications across the spectrum of modern kinetic and non-kinetic warfare. The program created tools that allow warfighters to rapidly and easily build their own missions through the introduction of new methodology for building simulation software. This methodology and adherence to a highly modular approach has resulted in a fundamental paradigm shift in the acquisition, as well as the construction, of DoD modeling and simulation products.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 Title: Nexus 7 Description: The Nexus 7 program applies forecasting, data extraction, and analysis methodologies to develop tools, techniques, and frameworks for the automated interpretation, quantitative analysis, and visualization of social networks. Social network theory has emerged in recent years as a promising approach for understanding groups of individuals connected through a variety of shared interests and collaborative activities. For the military, social networks provide a promising model for understanding terrorist cells, insurgent groups, and other stateless actors whose connectedness is established not on the basis of shared geography but rather through the correlation of their participation in coordinated activities such as planning meetings, training/mission rehearsal sessions, sharing of materiel/funds transfers, etc. The Nexus 7 program will develop and apply emerging methods for edge finding and cluster analysis to detect, characterize, and predict the dynamics of social networks. The resulting capabilities have important application in tactical contexts to aid analysts and operators in connecting the dots amid complex, conflicting, and incomplete data sets. They also establish a foundation for cultural intelligence - understanding the stability, governance, and economic indicators of a region - and the capability to better focus stability, security, transition, and reconstruction operations on high-payoff initiatives. The Nexus 7 program is an outgrowth of the data analysis tools explored in the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) program and previous information integration work in the cognitive computing and transformative sciences areas.

Title: Network Flow Analytics (NFA) Description: The Network Flow Analytics (NFA) program develops quantitative approaches for detecting illicit activities such as terrorist financing by monitoring flows in international financial networks. Such terrorist financing often supports drug trafficking or other criminal activities. NFA will address some of the most challenging aspects of detecting illicit money flows including correlating individual transactions that have been intentionally structured by the adversary to defy easy detection and correctly identifying the small number of illicit flows within the large background of legitimate flows. In addition, to detecting illicit activities the program will focus on the development of systems to combat corruption and ensure the integrity of networked financial systems. FY 2013 Plans: - Develop techniques for obtaining timely, relevant information from financial transaction data streams that may be incomplete and/or inaccurate. - Develop automatic data conditioning and regularization tools on terabyte scale. - Create advanced visualizations to enable humans to uncover illicit activities in large-scale datasets.- - 15.275 Volume 1 - 139UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 26 of 30 R-1 Line #20Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGYPROJECT TT-13: NETWORK CENTRIC ENABLING TECHNOLOGY B.

Title: Visual Media Reasoning (VMR)* Description: *Formerly Web-Scale Information Integration. Previously funded in PE 0602305E, Project MCN-01. The Visual Media Reasoning (VMR) program will create technologies to automate the analysis of enemy-recorded photos and videos and identify, within minutes, key information related to the content. Such identification will include the names of individuals within the image (who), the enumeration of the objects within the image and their attributes (what), and the image's geospatial location and time frame (where and when). Large data stores of enemy photos and video are available but cannot be easily leveraged by a warfighter or analyst attempting to understand a specific new image. The VMR program will enable users to gain insights rapidly through application of highly parallelized image analysis techniques that can process the imagery in massive federated image stores. VMR technology will serve as a force-multiplier by rapidly and automatically extracting tactically relevant information for the human analyst and alerting the analyst to scenes that warrant the analyst's expert attention. FY 2013 Plans: - Refine the user interface as well as the accuracy and performance of the system based on warfighter/analyst user group input. - Identify requirements and prototype a cloud-based hardware system for VMR image processing and storage of image indices. - Support the formation of expert user groups by automatically identifying individuals with related capabilities and interests.- - 17.102 Title: Cyber Auditable Systems (CAS) Description: The Cyber Auditable Systems (CAS) program will create the technologies necessary for the military to elicit public response and perform sentiment analysis in a secure and auditable manner over the internet. Stability, security, transition, and reconstruction operations are enhanced by the creation of democratic institutions and the elimination of systematic corruption within newly formed governments. These goals depend on the ability of users to speak freely without fear of reprisal and to participate in public referendums with privacy protections. CAS will create technology to enable safe discourse and trustworthy elections over the internet. This will require addressing all three elements of the traditional security triad - confidentiality, integrity, and availability - while also providing for new auditing mechanisms such as the capability for individuals to confirm their vote was correctly recorded and for stakeholder organizations to confirm only legitimate votes were counted. The program will expand traditional encryption algorithms and protocols to encompass auditability in systems requiring public trust. FY 2013 Plans: - Design and develop the underlying technology for an internet voting system that protects voter confidentiality, assures the integrity of the vote, and provides auditing features adequate to confirm that the results of an election are correct in relation to the votes cast.- - 13.300 Volume 1 - 140UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 27 of 30 R-1 Line #20Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602702E: TACTICAL TECHNOLOGYPROJECT TT-13: NETWORK CENTRIC ENABLING TECHNOLOGY B.

Title: Video and Image Retrieval and Analysis Tool (VIRAT) Description: The Video and Image Retrieval and Analysis Tool (VIRAT) program will develop and demonstrate a system for video data exploitation that enables an analyst to rapidly find video content of interest from archives and provides alerts to the analyst of events of interest during live operations. The ability to quickly search large volumes of existing video data and monitor real-time video data for specific activities or events will provide a new capability to the U.S. military and intelligence agencies. Currently, video analysis is very labor intensive, limited to metadata queries, manual annotations, and \"fast-forward\" examination of clips. The software tools developed under VIRAT will radically improve the analysis of huge volumes of video data by: 1) alerting operators when specific events or activities occur at specific locations or over a range of locations and; 2) enabling fast, content-based searches of existing video archives. The final product of the VIRAT program is a system that can be transitioned to an integrated, operational military system, such as the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS). FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Developed an approach to deal with burned-in metadata in Predator video data. - Developed efficient indexing and interactive retrieval against a larger set of activities. - Built a prototype system. - Satisfied a preliminary evaluation by Air Force Electronic Systems Center (ESC) for potential transition into the Air Force DCGS.

The program seeks to develop the new tools, technologies and methodologies to transform biology into an engineering practice, speeding the biological design-build-test cycle and expanding the complexity of systems that can be engineered. The goal is to enable the rapid development of previously unattainable technologies and products, leveraging biology to solve challenges associated with production of new materials, novel capabilities, fuels and medicines and providing novel solutions and enhancements to military needs and capabilities. For example, one motivating, widespread and currently intractable problem is that of corrosion/materials degradation challenge that costs the DoD nearly $23 billion per year and has no near term solution in sight. Living Foundries, with its ability to truly program and engineer biology, will enable the capability to design and engineer systems to rapidly and dynamically prevent, seek out, identify and repair corrosion/materials degradation. Ultimately, Living Foundries aims to provide game-changing manufacturing paradigms for the DoD, enabling distributed, adaptable, on-demand production of critical and high-value materials, devices and- - 10.000 Volume 1 - 166UNCLASSIFIED PE 0602715E: MATERIALS AND BIOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 23 of 32 R-1 Line #21Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 2: Applied ResearchR-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0602715E: MATERIALS AND BIOLOGICAL TECHNOLOGYPROJECT MBT-02: BIOLOGICALLY BASED MATERIALS AND DEVICES B.

Such a capability will decrease the DoD's dependence on tenuous material and energy supply chains that could be cut due to political change, targeted attack or environmental accident. Research thrusts will focus on the development and demonstration of open technology platforms, or bio-foundries, that integrate the tools and capabilities developed in PE 0601101E/TRS-01 to prove out capabilities for rapid (months vs. service-oriented architecture years) design and construction of new biological production systems. The ultimate vision is to develop point-of- use, on-demand, distributed and customized production of strategic materials and systems that exploit the capabilities and programmability (through DNA) of biology. Activities in this area will accelerate the development of DoD-focused applications and shift the field from simple, isolated genetic circuits to whole genome engineering. Such a platform spans from the ability to design, optimize and simulate (in silico) a synthetic genetic regulatory network to the automated fabrication and validation of the synthetic design in a biological system. Demonstration platforms will be challenged to build a variety of military-relevant and complex functionalities, such as the ability to withstand harsh environments, to synthesize complex mixtures of chemicals, or to rapidly and dynamically prevent, seek out, identify and repair corrosion/materials degradation. FY 2013 Plans: - Initiate integration of fundamental tools and capabilities developed in PE 0601101E/TRS-01 to speed the design, build, and test loop of biological manufacturing and start bio-foundries development. - Begin development and refinement of tools and capabilities to translate designs across multiple platforms and biological systems. Title: Revolutionizing Prosthetics Description: The goal of this thrust is to radically improve the state of the art for upper limb prosthetics, moving them from crude devices with minimal capabilities to fully integrated and functional limb replacements. Current prosthetic technology generally provides only gross motor functions, with very crude approaches to control. This makes it difficult for wounded soldiers to re-acquire full functionality and return to military service if so desired. The advances required to provide fully functional limb replacements will be achieved by an aggressive, milestone driven program combining the talents of scientists from diverse areas including: medicine, neuroscience, orthopedics, engineering, materials science, control and information theory, mathematics, power, manufacturing, rehabilitation, psychology and training. The results of this program will radically improve the ability of combat amputees to return to normal function. This effort will be funded in PE 0602115E, Biomedical Technology beginning in FY 2013.

This program will lead to the development of prototype soldier-portable digital imaging threat cueing systems capable of effective detection ranges of 1-10 km against dismounts and vehicles. Simultaneously, the system will survey a 120-degree or greater field of view, enabling the warfighter to detect, decide and act on the most advantageous timeline in complex operational environments.

Title: Neovision2 Description: Biological vision systems have the exquisite ability to recognize, categorize, and learn new objects in fractions of a second. While animals and humans accomplish this seemingly effortlessly and constantly, computational vision systems have, to date, been unable to replicate this feat of biology. The Neovision2 program is pursuing an integrated approach to developing an advanced object recognition capability based on the visual pathways in the mammalian brain. Specifically, this program will develop a cognitive sensor technology with limited size, weight, and power that transforms data from an imaging sensor suite into communicable knowledge for mobile, autonomous surveillance systems.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 Description: The Tactical Biomedical Technologies thrust will develop new approaches to deliver life-saving medical care on the battlefield, as well as novel technologies for reconstruction and rehabilitation of severely injured warfighters. Implicit in this thrust is the fact that there are unique, warfighter-specific challenges in acute and chronic treatment that are not addressed by civilian research and development. Today, more than half of American battlefield fatalities are due to hemorrhage, particularly due to improvised explosive devices (IEDs). To prevent these deaths, there is an urgent need for technologies that enable relatively unskilled personnel (battlefield medics) to diagnose and treat injuries, including the ability to locate and coagulate non- compressible sites of bleeding in the thorax or abdomen. This effort continues in FY 2012 in PE 0602115E, Project BT-01.

Title: Reliable Neural-Interface Technology (RE-NET) Description: Wounded warriors with amputated limbs cannot fully exploit recent advances in prosthetic-limb technology because the neural interfaces used to extract limb-control information are low-performance and unreliable. The goal of the Reliable Neural- Interface Technology (RE-NET) program is to develop the technology and systems needed to reliably extract information from the nervous system at the scale and rate necessary to control state-of-the-art high-performance prosthetic limbs. In support of this goal, the RE-NET program is developing methods to quantitatively assess, model, predict, and accelerate the leading causes of neural interface degradation and failure. The program will also increase the channel-count (amount information) of reliable peripheral-nervous-system interfaces and increase the operational lifetime (reliability) of central-nervous-system interfaces. Through this focus on reliability and high-level performance, the RE-NET program will enable clinically relevant technology transitions in support of wounded warriors. This effort continues in FY 2012 in PE 0602115E, Project BT-01.

Title: Preventing Violent Explosive Neurologic Trauma (PREVENT) Description: The Preventing Violent Explosive Neurologic Trauma (PREVENT) program seeks to understand the causes of blast- induced traumatic brain injury (TBI), an injury that while previously described in the warfighter population, has been referred to as a potential \"hidden epidemic\" in the current conflict. PREVENT will use a variety of modeling techniques based on in-theater conditions to assess potential TBI caused by blast in the absence of penetrating injury or concussion. Research will create a model that can be directly correlated to the epidemiology and etiology of injury seen in returning warfighters, and attempt to determine the physical and physiological underpinnings and causes of the injury. Mitigation and treatment strategies will be formulated based on our new knowledge of blast-induced brain injury with the eventual goal of reducing injury severity across the forces by over fifty percent, improving recovery time, and preventing future injuries. This program continues in FY 2012 in PE 0602115E, Project BT-01.

Approaches include nanotechnology, nanoelectronics, molecular electronics, spin-based electronics, quantum-computing, new circuit architectures optimizing these new devices, and new computer and electronic systems architectures. Projects will investigate the feasibility, design, and development of powerful information technology devices and systems using approaches for electronic device designs that extend beyond traditional Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) scaling, including non silicon-based materials technologies to achieve low cost, reliable, fast and secure computing, communication, and storage systems.

Research in this area has the ultimate goal of demonstrating the potentially significant advantages of quantum mechanical effects in communication and computing. Expected applications include: new improved forms of highly secure communication; faster algorithms for optimization in logistics and wargaming; highly precise measurements of time and position on the earth and in space; and new image and signal processing methods for target tracking. Technical challenges include: loss of information due to quantum decoherence; limited communication distance due to signal attenuation; limited selection of algorithms and protocols; and larger numbers of bits. Error correction codes, fault tolerant schemes, and longer decoherence times will address the loss of information. Signal attenuation will be overcome by exploiting quantum repeaters.

Title: Diverse & Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) Description: Prior DARPA efforts have demonstrated the ability to monolithically integrate inherently different semiconductor types to achieve near-ideal \"mix-and-match\" capability for DoD circuit designers. Specifically, the Compound Semiconductor Materials On Silicon (COSMOS) program, in which transistors of Indium Phosphide (InP) can be freely mixed with silicon complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuits to obtain the benefits of both technologies (very high speed and very high circuit complexity/density, respectively). The Diverse & Accessible Heterogeneous Integration (DAHI) effort will take this capability to the next level, ultimately offering the seamless co-integration of a variety of semiconductor devices (for example, Gallium actuators, photonic devices (e.g., lasers, photo-detectors) and thermal management structures. This capability will revolutionize our ability to build true \"systems on a chip\" (SoCs) and allow dramatic size, weight and volume reductions for a wide array of system applications. FY 2011 and FY 2012 incorporates the COSMOS program into DAHI. In the Applied Research part of this effort, high performance RF/optoelectronic/mixed-signal SoCs for specific DoD transition applications will be developed as a demonstration of the DAHI technology. In addition, in order to provide maximum benefit to the DoD, as these processes are developed, they will be transferred to a manufacturing flow and made available (with appropriate computer aided design support) to a wide variety of DoD laboratory, FFRDC, academic and industrial designers.

Title: Micro-Technology for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (Micro PN&T) Description: The Micro-Technology for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (Micro PN&T) program is developing technology for self-contained chip-scale inertial navigation and precision guidance. This technology promises to effectively mitigate dependence on Global Positioning System (GPS) or any other external signals, and enable uncompromised navigation and guidance capabilities. The program will enable positioning, navigation and timing functions without the need for external information updates by employing on-chip calibration, thereby overcoming vulnerabilities which arise in environments where external updates are not available such as caves, tunnels, or dense urban locations. The technologies developed will enable small, low-power, micro-gyroscopes capable of operating in both moderate and challenging dynamic environments; chip-scale primary atomic clock standards; and on-chip calibration systems for error correction. Advanced micro-fabrication techniques allow a single package containing all the necessary devices (clocks, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and calibration mechanisms) to be incorporated into a volume the size of a sugar cube. The small size, weight and power of these technologies and their integration into a single package responds to the needs of guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and individual soldiers. The successful realization of a Micro PN&T device is dependent on developing fundamentally new batch microfabrication processes, gaining an understanding of the sources and effects of error at the micro-scale, and exploring new combinatorial physics. Innovative 3-D microfabrication techniques will allow co-fabrication of different materials and devices on a single chip. Clocks, gyroscopes, accelerometers, calibration stages, and 3D structures could be integrated into a small, low power architecture. This co-location of different inertial and timing devices opens the possibility for utilization of combinatorial physics in a single micro-system, enabling fast start-up time, increased bandwidth and long-term stability, thus effectively providing very accurate navigation devices. Advanced research for the program is budgeted in PE 0603739E, Project MT-12.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Space Programs and Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to dramatically reduce costs associated with advanced space systems and provides revolutionary new system capabilities for satisfying current and projected military missions. A space force structure that is robust against attack represents a stabilizing deterrent against adversary attacks on space assets. The keys to a secure space environment are situational awareness to detect and characterize potential attacks, a proliferation of assets to provide robustness against attack, ready access to space, the ability to neutralize man-made space environments, and a flexible infrastructure for maintaining the capabilities of on-orbit assets. Ready access to space allows the delivery of defensive systems and replenishment supplies to orbit. An infrastructure to service the mission spacecraft allows defensive actions to be taken without limiting mission lifetime. In addition, developing space access and spacecraft servicing technologies will lead to reduced ownership costs of space systems and new opportunities for introducing technologies for the exploitation of space. Systems development is also required to increase the interactivity of space systems, space-derived information and services with terrestrial users. Studies under this project include technologies and systems that will enable satellites and microsatellites to operate more effectively by increasing maneuverability, survivability, and situational awareness; enabling concepts include novel propulsion/propellants, unique manufacturing processes; precision control of multi-payload systems, and payload isolation and pointing systems.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 Title: System F6 Description: The objective of the System F6 program is to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of a satellite architecture wherein the functionality of a traditional \"monolithic\" spacecraft is replaced by a cluster of wirelessly-interconnected spacecraft modules. Each such \"fractionated\" module would contribute a unique capability, for example, computation and data handling, communications relay, guidance and navigation, payload sensing, or it can replicate the capability of another module. The fractionated modules would fly in a loose, proximate cluster orbit capable of semi-autonomous reconfiguration or a rapid defensive scatter/re-gather maneuver. Critical to this architecture is a robust, system-level approach to ensuring security, integrity, and availability, while implementing authentication and non-repudiation. While delivering a comparable mission capability to a monolithic spacecraft, System F6 significantly enhances architectural and programmatic adaptability and robustness-reducing risk through the mission life and spacecraft development cycle, enabling incremental deployment of the system, and enhancing survivability. The System F6 architecture provides valuable options to decision makers throughout the life cycle development of future space systems that are absent in present-day monolithic architectures. The System F6 program will culminate in an on-orbit demonstration of a multi-module space system incorporating the F6 Technology Package (F6TP) - a suite of technologies, components, and algorithms that enables semi-autonomous multi-body cluster flight and secure, distributed, real-time sharing of various spacecraft resources at the cluster level.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 of the F6 Technology Package will be developed on the basis of open-source interface standards, software, and reference designs termed the F6 Developer's Kit. The on-orbit demonstration will be capable of accommodating one or more spacecraft payload modules supplied by a third-party mission partner. Residual capability to support future payloads with the existing on- orbit infrastructure will also remain following the demonstration, and the infrastructure can be upgraded for a perpetual on-orbit resource capability. The utility of the F6 architecture in low earth orbit (LEO) is significantly enabled by persistent broadband connectivity to the ground which allows resource sharing between space-based modules and terrestrial network nodes. A solution to enable high-availability, low-latency, persistent, high-bandwidth communications with LEO spacecraft will be developed in the course of the F6 program. The anticipated transition partner is the Air Force, though the architecture will have the ability to simultaneously accommodate payloads from multiple other partners including the Army and Navy. The resultant architecture is expected to significantly lower the barrier to entry and enhance competiveness of the national security space industrial base.

Title: Airborne Launch Assist Space Access (ALASA)* Description: *Formerly Horizontal Launch The goal of the Airborne Launch Assist Space Access (ALASA) program is to mature and demonstrate technologies for cost effective, routine, reliable, horizontal access to low earth orbit (LEO). ALASA seeks improvements in cost, responsiveness, flexibility, and resilience with a single approach. ALASA will enable small satellites to be deployed to orbit from an airborne platform, allowing performance improvement, reducing range costs, and flying more frequently, which drives cost per pound down. The ability to relocate and launch from virtually any major runway around the globe reduces the time needed to deploy a satellite system. Launch point offset permits essentially any possible orbit direction to be achieved without concerns for launch direction imposed by geography. Finally, launch point offset allows the entire operation to be moved should a particular fixed airfield become unavailable due to natural phenomena or other issues. Challenges include, but are not limited to: in-air separation of aircraft and orbit-insertion launch stages, development of alternatives to current range processes, control of weight and margin under a hard gross weight limit, and achieving a cost of $1 million, including range support costs, to deploy satellites on the order of 100 lb. The anticipated transition partner is the U.S. Air Force. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Conducted market/business case analysis for horizontal launch concepts. - Analyzed alternative infrastructure options including cost considerations. - Determined preliminary mission architecture and technology trade space to enable horizontal launch. FY 2012 Plans: - Perform conceptual design of selected architecture focusing on key technology gaps. - Initiate preliminary design. - Develop and mature related enabling and enhancing technologies. FY 2013 Plans: - Complete initial test plans for flight demonstrator. - Complete risk management plan. - Conduct preliminary design review and select enabling and enhancing technologies for incorporation into system concepts. - Conduct critical design review and initiate detailed design.5.000 12.000 29.000 Volume 1 - 218UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603287E: SPACE PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 5 of 11 R-1 Line #35Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603287E: SPACE PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGY C. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 - Integrate selected enabling and enhancing technologies on launch assist aircraft. Title: Space Domain Awareness (SDA) Description: The goal of the Space Domain Awareness (SDA) program is to develop and demonstrate an operational framework and responsive defense application to enhance the availability of vulnerable space-based communications resources. SDA will investigate revolutionary technologies in two areas: 1) advanced space surveillance sensors to better detect, track, and characterize space objects, with an emphasis on deep space objects, and 2) space surveillance data processing/data fusion to provide automated data synergy, to increase space domain awareness, overall space safety of flight, and ultimately to allow space operators to make informed, timely decisions. Current space surveillance sensors cannot detect, track, or determine the future location and threat potential of small advanced technology spacecraft in deep space orbits, where a majority of DoD spacecraft are located. Additionally, servicing missions to geosynchronous (GEO) orbits will require exquisite situational awareness, from ultra high-accuracy debris tracking for mission assurance at GEO orbits to high resolution imaging of GEO spacecraft for service mission planning. The SDA program will leverage data fusion and advanced algorithms developed under the Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) program, as well as seek to exploit new ground-breaking technologies across the electromagnetic spectrum and utilize already existing sensor technology in non-traditional or exotic ways, to bring advanced capabilities to the space domain. SDA will correlate a wide range of operational support and space system user data to rapidly identify threat activities, propose mitigating countermeasures, and verify the effectiveness of selected responses. Critical technologies include accessing disparate sources of relevant data, model-based situational awareness, and candidate response generation and evaluation. Particular emphasis will be placed on the ability to continuously adapt to changes in defended system components and usage patterns as well as validation of system integrity. The potential transition customer is the Air Force. Efficient collection of data for SDA is crucial to controlling costs. SDA will demonstrate new approaches to collection of data utilizing a variety of collection modalities, ranging from fusion of observations from amateur astronomers, to evaluation of sparse aperture imaging techniques. The first sparse aperture demonstration is Galileo. This effort will develop technology to image a Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) satellite from the ground. Galileo will utilize fixed mobile telescopes, each with adaptive optics and a guide star, to create multiple baselines that can be used to reconstruct the image through an inverse Fourier transform. The concept is similar to existing astronomic interferometers, except Galileo will extend the basic interferometric technology to utilize fiber optic transport of light between each telescope to match the optical path length instead of the traditional evacuated light tubes. Technical challenges include: controlling thermal effects and disperation within the fiber to properly interfere the light from the two telescopes, and precisely measuring the distance between the fixed and mobile telescope systems. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Surveyed existing systems and identified critical technology gaps. - Initiated data fusion modeling effort to determine limitations of currently developed algorithms.9.000 18.000 29.000 Volume 1 - 219UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603287E: SPACE PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 6 of 11 R-1 Line #35Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603287E: SPACE PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGY C.

Title: Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) Description: The Space Surveillance Telescope (SST) program will develop and demonstrate an advanced ground-based optical system to enable detection and tracking of faint objects in space, while providing rapid, wide-area search capability. A major goal of the SST program is to develop the technology for large curved focal surface array sensors to enable an innovative telescope design combining high detection sensitivity, short focal length, wide field of view, and rapid step-and-settle to provide orders of magnitude improvements in space surveillance. This capability will enable ground-based detection of un-cued objects in deep space for purposes such as asteroid detection and space defense missions. The Air Force will participate in the DARPA funded developmental testing of SST and then take over operation of SST as a sensor in the Air Force Space Surveillance Network. A memorandum of agreement has been established with Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) for transition.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 investigating expanding the demonstration of the telescope to explore detection and tracking of broader classes of space objects under different orbital regimes, and the impact of observations from different environments. In addition, the program will investigate data fusion and advanced algorithms for correlation of unknown objects. SST is expected to generate a large number of uncorrelated targets (UCTs), and new methods will need to be employed to rapidly characterize and attribute the new objects. Furthermore, the program will investigate methods which combine observations from disparate sensors (such as optical and radar installations) to more rapidly, accurately, and completely provide knowledge about UCTs, as compared to the existing system where no data fusion is employed. Where appropriate, SST will investigate new concepts which would provide complementary or further advances in ground-based deep space object detection and characterization. This data fusion effort is called Ibex. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Finished optics integration on site. - Completed integration of sensor subsystem into telescope. - Integrated camera and data processing subsystems at site. - Completed initial alignment of full SST system (\"First Light\"). - Completed site acceptance testing of telescope. - Integrated facilities control software for fine focus and alignment. - Investigated data processing algorithms to enhance contribution of SST data to space situational awareness (SSA). - Investigated data fusion capabilities to enhance SSA through use of multiple optical sensors for multi-static observations and track handoffs. - Commenced packaging of available imagers to construct backup wide field camera for the system. - Developed UCT handling procedure with AFSPC to convey SST search results to the Space Surveillance Network in timely and useable manner.

Title: Phoenix* Description: *Formerly Manned Geostationary Earth Orbit Servicing (MGS) To date, servicing operations have not been conducted on spacecraft beyond low earth orbit (LEO). A large number of national security and commercial space systems operate at GEO altitudes, furthermore, many end-of-life or failed spacecraft drift without control through portions of the GEO belt, creating a growing hazard to operational spacecraft. Technologies for servicing of spacecraft with the expectation such servicing would involve a mix of highly autonomous and remotely (i.e., ground-based) teleoperated robotic systems have been previously pursued. The Phoenix servicing program will build upon these legacy technologies, tackling the more complex GEO environment. The program seeks to repurpose high value long life components on existing satellites in GEO, in full collaboration and cooperation with existing satellite owners, utilizing commercial ridealong capability to send small packaged systems into GEO for use in upgrading, fixing, repairing, and enhancing the repurposed components. Key challenges include transportation and orbital maneuvering, robotic systems and integration, and extravehicular tool requirements. The anticipated transition partner is the U.S. Air Force. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Identified and evaluated flight/ground servicing experience, satellite failures, and candidate servicing missions. - Defined preliminary mission architecture and technology trade space to enable robotic GEO servicing missions. FY 2012 Plans: - Perform conceptual mission design and feasibility studies. - Perform conceptual design of selected demonstration mission, focusing on system architecture and key technology gaps.

Title: SeeMe* Description: *Formerly Single Wafer Integrated Femto Satellites (SWIFT) The U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, intelligence community, and other potential users require affordable support to the tactical warfighter via space. The goal of the \"SeeMe\" program is to demonstrate the ability to get near-real-time, i.e., no older than ~90 minutes, images directly to individual users' handheld devices from space. This will be accomplished via a very low cost constellation of inexpensive, disposable small satellites routinely and inexpensively put in orbit through low cost horizontal (airborne) launches. The current methodology for satisfying imagery needs from space is to build multipurpose systems with very high reliability and long life, at very high costs, and launch them on expensive vertical launch boosters. In most cases, commercial or military, the time to deliver an already built space Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) system suitable to meet tactically desired ground sample distance is on the order of 20+ months, and the data delivery mechanism is typically more than several days (and up to weeks) to the end user. SeeMe intends to radically shorten the entire cycle: ground development time, launch cadence, and on-orbit request-to-image-delivery time. The anticipated transition partner is the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Army. FY 2012 Plans: - Conduct trade study of available technologies and investment opportunities. - Initiate concept design. - Perform detailed system trade between a low cost launch alternative and metrics associated with constellation size and altitude. - Evaluate technologies for direct satellite to handheld device capabilities. - Perform evaluation of a multitude of manufacturing processes and technologies from non-aerospace disciplines to achieve 10x cost reduction. - Select specific satellite architecture for hardware instantiation as prototypes. FY 2013 Plans: - Execute technical integration options for hardware level development. - Demonstrate applicability to commercial production environment. - Begin to show prototype functionality in actual hardware. - Validate a high quantity low cost production run for a representative constellation that would support ISR capability directly to the warfighter.- Imager Volume 1 - 223UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603287E: SPACE PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 10 of 11 R-1 Line #35Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603287E: SPACE PROGRAMS AND TECHNOLOGY C.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Advanced Electronics Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it seeks to design and demonstrate state-of-the-art manufacturing and processing technologies for the production of various electronics and microelectronic devices, sensor systems, actuators and gear drives that have military applications and potential commercial utility. Introduction of advanced product design capability and flexible, scalable manufacturing techniques will enable the commercial sector to rapidly and cost-effectively satisfy military requirements. The MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) and Integrated Microsystems Technology project is a broad, cross-disciplinary initiative to merge computation and power generation with sensing and actuation to realize a new technology for both perceiving and controlling weapons systems and battlefield environments. MEMS applies the advantages of miniaturization, multiple components and integrated microelectronics to the design and construction of integrated electromechanical and electro-chemical-mechanical systems to address issues ranging from the scaling of devices and physical forces to new organization and control strategies for distributed, high-density arrays of sensor and actuator elements. The project will also address thermal management, navigation and positioning technology challenges. The goal of the Mixed Technology Integration project is to leverage advanced microelectronics manufacturing infrastructure and DARPA component technologies developed in other projects to produce mixed-technology microsystems. These 'wristwatch size', low-cost, lightweight and low power microsystems will improve the battlefield awareness and security of the warfighter and the operational performance of military platforms. The chip assembly and packaging processes currently in use produce a high cost, high power, large volume and lower performance system. This program is focused on the monolithic integration of mixed technologies to form batch-fabricated, mixed technology microsystems 'on-a-single-chip' or an integrated and interconnected 'stack-of-chips'. The ability to integrate mixed technologies onto a single substrate will increase performance and reliability, while driving down size, weight, volume and cost.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) and Integrated Microsystems Technology program is a broad, cross-disciplinary initiative to merge computation and power generation with sensing and actuation to realize a new technology for both perceiving and controlling weapons systems and battlefield environments. Using fabrication processes and materials similar to those used to make microelectronic devices, MEMS applies the advantages of miniaturization, multiple components and integrated microelectronics to the design and construction of integrated electromechanical and electro-chemical-mechanical systems. The MEMS program addresses issues ranging from the scaling of devices and physical forces to new organization and control strategies for distributed, high-density arrays of sensor and actuator elements. These issues include microscale power and actuation systems as well as microscale components that survive harsh environments. The microfluidic molecular systems effort will develop automated microsystems that integrate biochemical fluid handling capability along with electronics, optoelectronics and chip-based reaction and detection modules for tailored sequence analysis to monitor environmental conditions, health hazards and physiological states. Thermal management technologies will develop heat resistant thermal layers to provide efficient operation for cooling electronic devices. Another focus in micro technologies is to improve navigation, position and timing capabilities for uncompromised navigation and positioning in today's dynamic military field of operations. The major technical focus areas of the MEMS and Integrated Microsystems programs contained in this project are: 1) inertial measurement; 2) fluid sensing and control; 3) electromagnetic and optical beam steering; 4) chemical reactions on chip; 5) electromechanical signal processing; 6) analytical instruments; 7) thermal management; and 8) navigation and positioning technologies.

The overall goal of the program is to insert breakthrough materials and structures at all layers of DoD systems, and enable higher power densities, increased performance, and improved efficiency. Innovative research is underway to go beyond evolutionary thermal management systems. Modern, high-performance heat spreaders, which use two-phase cooling, are being developed to replace the copper alloy spreaders in conventional systems. Enhancing air-cooled exchangers by reducing the thermal resistance through the heat sink to the ambient, increasing convection through the system, improving heat sink fin thermal conductivity, optimizing and/or redesigning the complimentary heat sink blower, and increasing the overall system (heat sink and blower) coefficient of performance is another thrust of this program. Another element of this effort is focused on novel materials and structures that can provide significant reductions in the thermal resistance of the thermal interface layer between the backside of an electronic device and the next layer of the package, which might be a spreader or a heat sink.

Title: Micro-Technology for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (Micro PN&T) Description: The Micro-Technology for Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (Micro PN&T) program is developing technology for self-contained chip-scale inertial navigation and precision guidance. This technology promises to effectively mitigate dependence on Global Positioning System (GPS) or any other external signals, and enable uncompromised navigation and guidance capabilities. The program will enable positioning, navigation and timing functions without the need for external information updates by employing on-chip calibration, thereby overcoming vulnerabilities which arise in environments where external updates are not available such as caves, tunnels, or dense urban locations. The technologies developed will enable small, low-power, micro-gyroscopes capable of operating in both moderate and challenging dynamic environments; chip-scale primary atomic clock standards; and on-chip calibration systems for error correction. Advanced micro-fabrication techniques allow a single package containing all the necessary devices (clocks, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and calibration mechanisms) to be incorporated into a volume the size of a sugar cube. The small size, weight and power (SWaP) of these technologies and their integration into a single package responds to the needs of guided munitions, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and individual soldiers. The Micro PN&T program is an aggregation of Integrated Primary Atomic Clock, Navigate Grade Integrated Micromachined Gyroscopes, Micro Inertial Navigation Technology, Information Tethered Microscale Autonomous Rotary Stages, Micromachined Rate Integrating Gyroscopes, Single-Chip Timing and Inertial Measurement Unit, Primary and Secondary Active33.698 42.117 36.466 Volume 1 - 230UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603739E: ADVANCED ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGIES UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 5 of 15 R-1 Line #52Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603739E: ADVANCED ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGIESPROJECT MT-12: MEMS AND INTEGRATED MICROSYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY B.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The goal of the Mixed Technology Integration project is to leverage advanced microelectronics manufacturing infrastructure and DARPA component technologies developed in other projects to produce mixed-technology microsystems. These 'wristwatch size', low-cost, lightweight and low power microsystems will improve the battlefield awareness, security of the warfighter and the operational performance of military platforms. At the present time, systems are fabricated by assembling a number of mixed-technology components: microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microphotonics, microfluidics and millimeterwave/microwave. Each technology usually requires a different level of integration, occupies a separate silicon chip and requires off-chip wiring, and requires fastening and packaging to form a module. The chip assembly and packaging processes produce a high cost, high power, large volume and lower performance system. This program is focused on the monolithic integration of mixed technologies to form batch-fabricated, mixed technology microsystems 'on-a-single-chip' or an integrated and interconnected 'stack-of-chips'. The field of microelectronics incorporates micrometer/nanometer scale integration and is the most highly integrated, low-cost and high-impact technology to date. Microelectronics technology has produced the microcomputer-chip that enabled or supported the revolutions in computers, networking and communication. This program extends the microelectronics paradigm to include the integration of heterogeneous or mixed technologies. This new paradigm will create a new class of 'matchbook-size', highly integrated device and microsystem architectures. Examples of component-microsystems include low-power, small-volume, lightweight, microsensors, microrobots and microcommunication systems that will improve and expand the performance of the warfighter, military platforms, munitions and Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs). The program includes the integration of mixed materials on generic substrates including glass, polymers and silicon. The program is design and process intensive, using 'standard' processes and developing new semiconductor-like processes and technologies that support the integration of mixed-technologies at the micrometer/ nanometer scale. The program includes the development of micrometer/nanometer scale isolation, contacts, interconnects and 'multiple-chip-scale' packaging for electronic, mechanical, fluidic, photonic and rf/mmwave/microwave technologies. example, a mixed-technology microsystem using integrated microfluidics, MEMS, microphotonics, microelectronics and microwave components could provide a highly integrated, portable analytical instrument to monitor the battlefield environment, the physical condition of a warfighter, the identity of warfighters (friend or foe) or the combat readiness of equipment. The ability to integrate mixed technologies onto a single substrate will drive down the size, weight, volume, and cost of weapon systems while increasing their performance and reliability. B.

Title: Gratings of Regular Arrays and Trim Exposures (GRATE) Description: The Gratings of Regular Arrays and Trim Exposures (GRATE) program will develop revolutionary circuit design methodologies combined with hybrid lithography tools to enable cost-effective low volume nanofabrication for DoD applications. Moore's law has driven the silicon industry for several decades with the minimum feature size on an integrated circuit (IC) reduced to 22 nm for today's commercial products. Due to challenging patterning requirements and complex circuitry, the costs of circuit design and verification, lithography tools and masks, and testing costs have increased exponentially and are unaffordable for low- volume manufacture of application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for military electronics. Consequently, military electronics capabilities are currently limited by the high cost of nanofabrication. To solve this important problem, DARPA has invested in a variety of maskless patterning technologies including parallel e-beam arrays, parallel scanning probe arrays, and an innovative e- beam lithography tool. This program will develop revolutionary circuit design methodologies coupled with innovative fabrication techniques and hybrid maskless patterning tools to realize cost-effective nanofabrication for low-volume defense or commercial ASICs. Such an approach can also address the nanofabrication requirements of other low-volume DoD technologies such as photonics and micro-electro-mechanical systems.

Each array element will possess an adaptive-optic capability to minimize beam divergence in the presence of atmospheric turbulence, together with wide- field-of-view beam steering for target tracking. With each Excalibur array element powered by high power fiber laser amplifiers (at up to 3 kilowatts per amplifier), high power air-to-air and air-to-ground engagements will be enabled that were previously infeasible because of laser system size and weight. In addition, this program will also develop kilowatt-class arrays of diode lasers which will provide an alternate route to efficiently reaching mission-relevant power levels, and they will test the ultimate scalability of the optical phased array architecture. Excalibur arrays will be conformal to aircraft surfaces and scalable in size and power by adding elements to the array. By defending airborne platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles against proliferated, deployed, and next-generation man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS), Excalibur will enable these reconnaissance platforms to fly at lower altitude and obtain truly persistent, all-weather ground reconnaissance despite low-lying cloud cover. Proliferated and emerging threats will be evaluated for the potential of developing a near-term capability utilizing a single high-power fiber laser amplifier. Further capabilities include multichannel laser communications, target identification, tracking, designation, precision defeat with minimal collateral effects as well as other applications. The Excalibur program will also develop efficient high-power laser amplifier arrays based on coherent or spectral beam- combining.

The key concept is that a detector array can be fabricated on a hemispherical substrate using materials such as organic/ inorganic semiconductors and that this array can be combined with a single simple lens to produce a wide field of view, small form factor camera that operates over a wide spectral range (400 nm to 1900 nm). Organic materials have been shown to have good electronic and optoelectronic properties including light emission and detection. Furthermore, in-plane organic/inorganic transistors can be incorporated for pre-processing of images. Patterning of these materials on the hemispherical surface has been demonstrated by utilizing maskless laser lithography. This program will transition to DoD systems through a demonstration of an array prototype developed by industrial contractors.

Title: Computational Leverage Against Surveillance Systems (CLASS)* Description: *Previously part of the CommEx program. Commercial Test and Measurement equipment has advanced greatly with the emergence of sophisticated cellular and wireless local area network technology and can be used to intercept, analyze and exploit our military communications signals. Building upon technologies investigated under the COMMEX Program, the Computational Leverage Against Surveillance Systems (CLASS) program seeks new ways to protect our signals from increasingly sophisticated adversaries and to do so in a way that can be maintained as technology advances. Three different techniques are being developed: 1) Waveform Complexity uses advanced communications waveforms that are difficult to recover without knowledge and understanding of the signals itself; 2) Spatial Diversity uses distributed communications devices and the communication environment to disguise and dynamically vary the apparent location of the signal; 3) Interference Exploitation makes use of the clutter in the signal environment to make it difficult for an adversary to isolate a particular signal. The objective of the program is to make modular communications technology that is inexpensive to incorporate in existing and emerging radio systems (<$100 incremental cost) but pushes adversaries to need more than 1,000x our processing power - \"supercomputer\" level processing power. Technologies from this program are planned to transfer to the U.S. Army's Communications - Electronics Command.

Title: Fixed Wireless at a Distance Description: Unlike commercial wireless communications, the military cannot count on a set of secure, fixed cell towers to establish wireless networks capable of receiving and distributing large amounts of data from distributed sources. Rather, such communication must rely on approaches such as balloons and temporary communication towers that have a high logistical burden and are extremely vulnerable. Building upon technologies investigated under other programs in this project, the Fixed Wireless at a Distance program will overcome these limitations by developing a re-locatable, long-range (10-100s of km) communication infrastructure that provides high-capacity (10s of Mbps) data links from within a protected space. The key innovation in this program is the use of a large number of rapidly deployable, distributed, ground-based antenna arrays that can form a coherent aperture for directional transmission and reception of information to/from tactical wireless networks. Program challenges include the fundamental limits (power and extent) of transmitter gain as well as the rapid and practical deployment of the ground-based arrays. When completed, the Fixed Wireless at a Distance program will extend the reach of tactical communication systems by 10X without the need for vulnerable and costly infrastructure. This technology is planned to transition to the Services. FY 2013 Plans: - Assess the fundamental limits of transmitter gain for a distributed ground-based wireless network.- - 10.100 Volume 1 - 254UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603760E: COMMAND, CONTROL AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 13 of 20 R-1 Line #54Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603760E: COMMAND, CONTROL AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMSPROJECT CCC-02: INFORMATION INTEGRATION SYSTEMS B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 - Initiate assessment of ground-based array to determine the required characteristics (number or antennas, spatial diversity, power) to enable 10X improvement in the range of tactical communication systems. - Develop concepts for rapidly deploying and re-deploying antenna arrays. Title: Advanced RF Mapping Description: One of the key advantages on the battlefield is the ability to actively sense and manipulate the RF environment, enabling secure communications as well as effectively mapping and manipulating the adversary's communications in ways that defy their awareness, understanding, or response. Current approaches for dealing with RF are emitter-based, with the signal processing techniques focused on array and time based processing for each emitter. As the RF environment becomes more complex and cluttered, the number of strategic assets and commensurate signal processing inhibits effectiveness and sustainability to sense and manipulate at the precision (time, frequency, and space) required for effective action. To address these shortfalls, the Advanced RF Mapping program will develop and demonstrate new concepts for sensing the RF environment based on distributed rather than emitter-based collection. These concepts take advantage of the proliferation of RF devices (radios, cell phones) on the battlefield. To use these devices effectively, the program will develop new algorithms that can map the RF environment with minimal communication load between sensors. It will also develop approaches for exploiting our precise knowledge of the RF environment and the distributed proximity of the RF devices to provide secure communications for our warfighter as well as to infiltrate or negate our adversaries' communications networks. For example, if synchronizing distributed elements to <10 picosecond is achievable, coherent RF power projection at UHF frequencies from distributed devices would be possible. Building upon technologies investigated under other programs in this project, the Advanced RF Mapping program will enable both offensive and defensive operations in complex RF environments. Advanced RF Mapping technology is planned to transition to the Services. FY 2013 Plans: - Establish baseline capabilities for RF collection from distributed devices in complex RF environments. - Initiate the development of algorithms for exploiting distributed RF collections into a full environmental map of frequency and space as a function of time. - Begin assessment of feasibility of synchronization of distributed elements to provide precision RF effects.- - 10.300 Title: Highly Networked Force Description: A highly networked and enabled force increases efficiency, effectiveness, and safety while reducing cost by making the right information available at the right time to every person and system that needs it.

Title: Optical & RF Combined Link Experiment (ORCLE) Description: The Optical & RF Combined Link Experiment (ORCLE) program seeks to develop combined radio frequency (RF) and free space optical (FSO) communications as well as networking technologies that exploit the benefits of complementary path diversity. This effort encompasses the extension of research into the FSO/RF Internet Protocol-based Network system, called Optical RF Communications Adjunct (ORCA). Using optical and RF communication techniques, ORCLE will demonstrate improved battlespace communications using a hybrid RF and FSO link in air-to-air-to-ground environments. The central challenge is to enable optical communications bandwidth without giving up RF reliability, regardless of the weather. ORCLE will develop RF and FSO propagation channel analysis, coding techniques, and modeling to include weather, atmospherics, and aero-optics to provide the joint force commander assured high-data rate communications. The technical objective is to prototype and flight demonstrate hybrid FSO/RF air-to-air-to-ground links that combine the best attributes of both technologies and simulate hybrid network performance. The ORCLE technology is planned for transition to the Air Force.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Computer, networking, and communication technologies have rapidly matured in the last decade and have had a profound effect on DoD weapons systems. In many instances the combination of those technologies has become either the integral piece of many of the emerging traditional land, air, and sea based weapon platforms or have become a stand alone, non-platform based virtual weapon system. In recognition of this fact, the Secure Information and Network Systems project will develop and test emerging computer, communications, and network systems where the impact of the systems and the vulnerabilities of the systems are not kinetically based. The project will develop, integrate, and test prototypes of promising network security technologies generated in projects such as, but not limited to, those developed in DARPA's Information & Communications Program Element (PE 0602303E) and Cognitive Computing Systems Program Element (PE 0602304E).

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Network-Centric Warfare Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development budget activity because it addresses high payoff opportunities to develop and rapidly mature advanced technologies and systems required for today's network-centric warfare concepts. It is imperative for the future of the U.S. forces to operate flawlessly with each other, regardless of which services and systems are involved in any particular mission. The overarching goal of this program element is to enable technologies at all levels, regardless of service component, to operate as one system. The objective of the Joint Warfare Systems project is to create enabling technologies for seamless joint operations, from strategic planning to tactical and urban operations. Joint Warfare Systems leverage current and emerging network, robotic, and information technology and provide next generation U.S. forces with greatly expanded capability, lethality, and rapid responsiveness. Critical issues facing this project are: (1) U.S. opponents utilizing systems that are flexible, robust, and difficult to neutralize; and (2) U.S. doctrine that limits the use of firepower to lessen the impact of operations on noncombatants. These problems are magnified in urban and semi-urban areas where combatants and civilians are often collocated, and in peacekeeping operations where combatants and civilians are often indistinguishable. Meeting these challenges places a heavy burden on joint war planning. Understanding opponent networks is essential so that creative options can be developed to counter their strategies. Synchronization of air and ground operations to apply force only where needed and with specific effects is required. The Maritime Systems project will identify, develop and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces role in today's network centric warfare concept. Naval forces play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project sustained force. The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces.

This project supports all levels of the force structure including: (1) the strategic/operational level by generating targeting options against opponents' centers of gravity that have complex networked relationships; (2) the tactical/operational level by managing highly automated forces with tight coupling between air and ground platforms; and (3) the focused tactical level by developing platforms and tools, which acquire targets of opportunity and cue network-based analysis of likely enemy operations thus maximizing the effectiveness of ground forces in stability and support operations.

The goal of the HELLADS program is to develop a high-energy laser weapon system that will provide an order of magnitude reduction in weight compared to existing laser systems. HELLADS will enable high-energy lasers (HELs) to be integrated onto tactical aircraft and will significantly increase engagement ranges compared to ground-based systems, in addition to enabling high precision/low collateral damage and rapid engagement of fleeting targets for both offensive and defensive missions. Advancements in beam control and other subsystems that are required for the practical integration of a laser weapon into existing tactical platforms will be explored. With the assistance of the Services, the HELLADS program will pursue the necessary analysis, coordination, and design activity for a prototype laser weapon system incorporating the HELLADS laser system and the ABC turret into air, ground, or sea-based tactical vehicles.

Title: Robotics Olympics* Description: *Formerly Robotic Activators and Physical Performance Improvements in Dynamic Environments (RAPPIDE) Advancements are being made in land-capable, high degree-of-freedom unmanned platforms to enable mobility over very complex terrain. Many current prototypes are inspired by biological systems and while proof-of-principle systems have or are demonstrating unprecedented mobility, limitations have emerged. Advanced capabilities in perception, control, and physical capability/coordination are needed to work autonomously in human environments. These are critical enablers for performing mission-relevant tasks in austere and remote regions, partially-destroyed roads, high-threat anti-access/area denied environments, rubble-filled areas, and providing greater range/endurance for soldiers, platforms, and personnel. The Robotics Olympics program will boost innovation in autonomous systems and expand platform utility through enhanced actuation, energy density, perception, locomotion, agile reconfiguration, and design efficiency. Program thrusts are centered on a progressive regimen of physical problem solving, real-time team oriented tasks, and dynamic adaptation designed to build \"machine trust\", especially when integrated with humans in a variety of operational environments. The Robotics Olympics program consists of a series of Olympic and military obstacle course style challenge events that will focus on technology solutions to demonstrate and test robot athleticism for human capabilities. Robotics Olympics events will drive advances in power systems, agility and speed, precision in perception tied to platform coordination, dexterity, and impulsive power. Program objectives focus on regenerative technologies to expand mobility and extend endurance of unmanned platforms, advanced tactile and manipulation capabilities, and tools for cost effective test, build, and validation of autonomous technology. The effort is also aimed at inspiring and promoting Science Technology and Mathematics (STEM) initiatives. Anticipated Service users include the Army, Marines, and Special Forces.

Title: Counter Laser Technologies Description: The goal of the Counter Laser Technologies program is to develop a suite of technologies to increase the survivability of United States weapons platforms when encountering a high energy laser attack. Laser countermeasures include systems and materials for detection and warning, material treatments to harden vulnerable surfaces, computer models to plan mission engagements to favor U.S. system survivability when under high energy laser attack, and techniques to degrade or destroy the offending laser weapon. The High Energy Laser (HEL) lethality of concern in this program is apart from on-going efforts within the Services for sensor or eye protection from laser illumination. Counter Laser Technologies addresses the HEL's ability to deposit energy on the weapon or platform to melt through, fracture, or weaken the body, thereby disabling or destroying it. This effort will initially focus on characterizing the vulnerability mechanisms of a candidate set of weapons and platforms, developing warning systems to rapidly determine the attributes of the inbound threat (vector of origin, wavelength, power, format), and developing material solutions (skin treatments, material hardening methods). Additional effort will focus on ways to proactively degrade or destroy offending laser performance by altering the laser's internal optics or by modifying the laser's line of sight to the target. Technologies from this program will transition to platform and weapon system developers in all Services. FY 2013 Plans: - Assess vulnerability mechanisms for a candidate set of U.S. weapons and platforms. - Initiate development of material treatments and sensor systems to enhance platform situational awareness of laser attack. - Initiate laser engagement modeling effort to advise development of material solutions and tactics to survive high energy laser attack.- - 4.100 Title: Battlefield Illusion Description: This program will develop methods and technologies to enable our forces to manage the adversary's sensory perception to confuse, delay, inhibit, or misdirect their actions in the highly dynamic, close-range, visual/acoustic-dominated environment.

GEO algorithm architectures were explored to achieve scalability through spatial, temporal and ontological partitioning. GEO technologies are planned for transition to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). Activities funded within the GEO research space include: The Urban Reasoning and Geospatial Exploitation Technology (URGENT) program developed a 3-D urban object recognition and exploitation system that enabled advanced mission planning and situation analysis capabilities for the warfighter operating in urban environments. URGENT created techniques for the rapid exploitation of EO and LIDAR sensor data at the city scale to recognize urban objects down to the soldier scale.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The objective of the Maritime Systems project is to identify, develop and rapidly mature critical advanced technologies and system concepts for the naval forces' role in today's network centric warfare concept. Improvements in communications between and among submarines, surface ships and naval aircraft have allowed these forces to operate seamlessly with each other and with other Service's network centric systems. Naval forces will play an ever-increasing role in network centric warfare because of their forward deployed nature, their unique capability to operate simultaneously in the air, on the sea and under the sea and their versatile ability to provide both rapid strike and project-sustained force. The technologies developed under this project will capitalize on these attributes, improve them and enable them to operate with other network centric forces. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 Title: Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH) Description: The diesel-electric submarine is an asymmetric threat in terms of its cost and consequential growth in numbers relative to our legacy maritime platforms. In addition, these submarines have trended toward lower acoustic signature levels, and have grown in lethality. The Distributed Agile Submarine Hunting (DASH) program intends to reverse the asymmetric advantage of this threat through the development of advanced standoff sensing from unmanned systems. Deep ocean sonar nodes will operate at significant depths in open ocean areas to achieve large fields of view to detect submarines overhead. Each deep node is the maritime equivalent of a satellite, and is referred to as a subullite. The significant field of view, along with the advantage of low-noise phenomena at extreme depths will permit a scalable number of collaborative sensor platforms to detect and track submarines over large areas. For the vast shallow continental shelf areas, the program similarly adopts distributed mobile sensors, but instead leverages insights in non-acoustic sensing from above. The effort is highly focused on achieving new detection modalities with sufficient low power, weight, and size, to enable UAV implementations. Initial efforts will focus on identifying the best detection methods leveraged from state-of-the-art sensors and new physical and operational insights. From this work, prototype systems will evolve through at-sea testing and sensor integration. The program will achieve breakthrough technology for long-range detection and classification, communications, energy management, sensor and platform integration, and robust semiautonomous processing and control for distributed sensing platforms. This program will transition to the Navy.

Title: Unmanned/Minimally-manned Underwater Vehicle (UMUV) Description: Increasing requirements for missions in shallow littoral waters have created a need for a survivable and cost- effective capability to perform intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance, antisubmarine warfare, special operations forces, and other missions in the littorals. Today we risk manned submarines in waters that are shallower than the length of our hulls and we pit these high value assets against diesel electric submarines that in some cases pose an overmatching threat against our systems in these shallow waters. The Unmanned/Minimally-manned Underwater Vehicle (UMUV) program will develop a vehicle specifically designed to operate in the littoral battlespace with the capability of performing littoral missions that span a wide range of complexity and can be performed with a small manned crew or autonomously (i.e., unmanned) depending upon mission requirements. The UMUV will have the autonomy, range and endurance to drive to the fight from a safe basing location, will be capable of carrying the full range of payloads that are needed to support operational needs in littoral waters, and will provide the capability to perform missions where risk to personnel limits our willingness to execute these missions. The program will explore low-cost derivatives of commercial underwater vehicles, the integration of advanced communication and sensor technologies, and the teaming of the UMUV with manned systems. The UMUV program will transition to the Navy.- 5.500 3.250 Volume 1 - 275UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603766E: NETWORK-CENTRIC WARFARE TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 12 of 16 R-1 Line #56Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603766E: NETWORK-CENTRIC WARFARE TECHNOLOGYPROJECT NET-02: MARITIME B. in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 FY 2012 Plans: - Perform technology trades to assess key vehicle capabilities. - Develop concept of operations.

Title: Structural Logic Description: The Structural Logic program is developing platform structures and frames that can adapt to varying loads and simultaneously exhibit both high stiffness and high damping. This program will demonstrate the utility of negative stiffness structural elements developed under the Multifunctional Materials and Structures program, budgeted in PE 0602715E, Project MBT-01, in the ridged support frames of real world DoD platforms. As the demands on military platforms increase, so does the need for structures to mitigate the shock and vibrations applied by dynamic environments. Today's structures exhibit limited adaptability and typically achieve either extreme stiffness or damping. In military platforms, extremely stiff structures provide high strength, but readily transfer loads to passengers often resulting in serious injury. Conversely, existing damping structures can reduce the load transferred to passengers, but only at the expense of structural strength and integrity. By demonstrating the ability to combine stiffness, damping, and dynamic range in a single structure, the Structural Logic program will enable the design of military platforms with the ability to continually adapt their properties to match the demands of a dynamic environment. The program will transition to the Services. FY 2013 Plans: - Initiate the design of a ridged support frame for a platform structure that incorporates arrays of adaptive structural sub- assemblies made up of mechanical programs of tiered negative stiffness structural elements. - Perform final demonstration of the technology in a realistic system.- - 8.000 Title: Blue Laser for Submarine Laser Communications (SLC) Description: The Blue Laser for Submarine Laser Communications (SLC) program will develop the critical laser technology necessary to support the requirements for Non-Acoustic Anti-Submarine Warfare (NAASW), mine detection, and SLC.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Sensors Technology program element is budgeted in the Advanced Technology Development Budget Activity because it funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability and battle damage assessment. The Surveillance and Countermeasures Technology project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high- performance computing and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems. Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with tactical information needed to succeed in future wars. Additionally, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats. The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor processing technologies and systems necessary for the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) mission. The project is primarily driven by four needs: 1) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; 2) countering camouflage, concealment and deception of mobile ground targets; 3) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near real-time; and 4) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control, tracking, timely engagement and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets. The Exploitation Systems project develops algorithms, software, and information processing systems to extract information from massive intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) datasets. In particular, it develops new technologies for detection and discrimination of targets from clutter, classification and fingerprinting of high value targets, localization and tracking over wide areas, and threat network identification and analysis.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification This project funds sensor efforts that will improve the accuracy and timeliness of our surveillance and targeting systems for improved battlefield awareness, strike capability, and battle damage assessment. Timely surveillance of enemy territory under all weather conditions is critical to providing our forces with the tactical information needed to succeed in future wars. This operational surveillance capability must continue to perform during enemy efforts to deny and deceive the sensor systems, and operate, at times, in a clandestine manner. This project will exploit recent advances in multispectral target phenomenology, signal processing, low-power high-performance computing, and low-cost microelectronics to develop advanced surveillance and targeting systems. In addition, this project encompasses several advanced technologies related to the development of techniques to counter advanced battlefield threats. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 Title: Adaptable Navigation Systems (ANS) Description: The Adaptable Navigation Systems (ANS) program will provide the U.S. warfighter with the ability to navigate effectively in all environments, including when Global Positioning System (GPS) is unavailable due to hostile action (jamming) or blockage by structures and foliage. The ANS approach relies on two major technology innovations. The first is the use of Signals of Opportunity (SoOp) from a variety of ground, air, and space-based sources. These will be received on the Services' forthcoming software-defined radios and use specially tailored algorithms to determine position. The second technology innovation allows SoOp-based position information to be combined with inertial and other sensors to enable flexible navigation systems that can be reconfigured in the field to support any platform or environment. While component technology for positioning, navigation, and timing is advancing rapidly (in the form of Micro Electro-Mechanical System devices, clocks, and new aiding sensors), real-time integration and reconfiguration of these components is not possible given today's navigation filters and centralized processing architectures, which are inherently fragile to change. Recent advances in mathematics, data abstraction, and network architectures could enable \"plug-and-play\" integration of both existing and future navigation components to allow real-time integration and reconfiguration of navigation systems. If successful, major improvements in navigation accuracy and system cost could also be realized. Early transition partners would include all Services, with emphasis on platforms and users that must operate in multiple environments. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Developed non-form-fit prototype ANS system. - Demonstrated ANS prototype system in urban canyons and inside buildings.14.497 14.471 16.802 Volume 1 - 283UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 4 of 27 R-1 Line #57Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT SEN-01: SURVEILLANCE AND COUNTERMEASURES TECHNOLOGY B.

Title: Adaptable, Low Cost Sensors Description: The objective of the Adaptable, Low Cost Sensor program is to leverage commercial technology and commercial manufacturing techniques to improve the development time and significantly reduce the cost of sensors and sensor systems. Military sensors are currently developed as unique designs that fully integrate mission specific hardware required for sensing, with all of the other non-mission specific capabilities, including sensors (GPS), processing, memory storage and communications into a single device. Not only does this approach significantly increase the cost of the device, it makes changing requirements and the upgrading of any specific component extremely difficult. Nevertheless, significant advances have been made in the capabilities of commercial equipment for almost all of those capabilities, mostly driven by the smart phone industry. This makes it possible to create a mission-independent, designed-to-cost \"commercial smart core\" that can be combined with an appliqu\u00e9 of mission-specific hardware to provide the overall sensing capability. Because the core can be upgraded independently of- 20.697 22.013 Volume 1 - 284UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 5 of 27 R-1 Line #57Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT SEN-01: SURVEILLANCE AND COUNTERMEASURES TECHNOLOGY B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 any particular sensor, sensors can make use of the advances and decreasing cost that is inherent in commercial technology. Because commercial technology can be used in the core, commercial development and manufacturing techniques can also be leveraged, further improving the cost and development time of sensor systems. In addition, this program will enable effective distributed sensor systems that were previously infeasible due to high cost of individual sensors. This program will transition to the Services. FY 2012 Plans: - Manufacture initial version of commercial smart core. - Identify candidate sensors for ground and airborne demonstrations and quantify the required performance, including adaptability. - Define objectives for distributed sensor systems (ground and UAV) and quantify performance against traditional, non-distributed systems. - Develop a distributed ground sensor system using smart core. - Develop smart core re-usable software and ground mission software. - Define objectives for ground system field test and plan field test activities. FY 2013 Plans: - Manufacture second version of commercial smart core. - Develop a cooperative sensor systems using smart core. - Refine smart core re-usable software and ground mission software. - Conduct field test of prototype sensor. Title: Visibuilding Description: The Visibuilding program developed technologies and systems for new building surveillance capabilities to detect personnel within buildings, determine building layouts, and locate weapons caches within buildings. This program developed techniques to inject and recover probing radar waveforms and unravel the complicated multipath in the return signals to enable the mapping and characterization of building interiors. Radar signals were used to image static structures directly. Doppler processing of radar signals was also being exploited to find, identify, and perform feature-aided tracking of moving personnel within a building and allow mapping of building pathways and stairways by monitoring traffic through buildings. Multipath and propagation effects were modeled and iteratively compared with hypotheses of building structures to provide 3-D building maps and large concentrations of metal materials like weapons. Technologies developed under this program will be made available to the Army and U.S. SOCOM for transition.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 - Completed demonstrations of low-latency, radar-based prototype system and quantified ability to determine building layout and track insurgents within furnished multi-story buildings. - Identified viable alternative sensing modalities for continued development. FY 2012 Plans: - Transition the radar-based prototype to Army and U.S. SOCOM. Title: Multi-Function Optical Sensor Description: The expanded use of passive electro-optic (EO) sensors for detection and tracking (Infrared Search & Track Systems and Forward Looking Infrared Radar Systems) has increased the threat to our airborne systems. These sensors negate the advantages of our radars and radio frequency (RF)-based countermeasures such as digital radio frequency memory (DRFM). When used in the presence of DRFM and other RF countermeasures by our adversaries, EO sensors could provide overmatching defensive capabilities. The Multi-Function Optical Sensing program will provide an alternative approach to detecting, tracking, and performing non-cooperative target identification, as well as providing fire control for fighter class and long-range strike aircraft. This approach leverages emerging high-sensitivity focal plane array (FPA) and compact, multiband laser systems technology in the near/mid/long-wave infrared bands to develop a multi-function optical system. Technical challenges include the demonstration of inexpensive, multiband, large-format, photon-counting, high-bandwidth receivers and their integration into a multi-optical sensor suite compatible with airborne assets. The Multi-Function Optical Sensor program will result in an airborne system that can detect, geolocate, and identify targets at standoff ranges. Technologies from this program will transition into the Services. FY 2013 Plans: - Initiate development of multiband, high-speed active focal plane arrays. - Develop preliminary system architecture for airborne multi-function optical sensors. - Initiate development of new algorithms and signal processing approaches for effective use of multi-function optical sensing in offense and defensive applications.- - 8.500 Title: Electro-Optical Warfare Description: The proliferation of optical communications and sensor systems has created a need for electronic warfare (EW) approaches that can be used in the electro-optical (EO) domain. Unfortunately, while there is a sophisticated suite of counter RF approaches, there is no such capability against EO signals, which are hard to find; and when found, even harder to suppress. The EO Warfare program will extend EW into the optical domain by developing the capacity to defeat EO systems including: laser communications systems, EO/IR sensors, and laser imagers and seekers. This program will exploit the significant advances that have been made in compact lasers, laser spectrum agility, and microelectronics to develop optical EW systems including an optical digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) equivalent. Key challenges include detection and processing of optical signals for sensors (photon gating, embedded signal processing) integrated with detector arrays, and adaptive and computational optics that- - 3.550 Volume 1 - 286UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 7 of 27 R-1 Line #57Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT SEN-01: SURVEILLANCE AND COUNTERMEASURES TECHNOLOGY B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 can be applied to finding EO-based communications and active sensors. The product of the EO Warfare program is to develop new techniques and systems that can defeat laser communications and active optical sensor systems at >50km range. Improved understanding of countermeasures to active sensors will also improve the robustness of our own developmental and fielded Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) and communications systems. Technologies from this program will transition to the Services. FY 2013 Plans: - Identify the capabilities and shortfalls of detector arrays and compact lasers for detecting and suppressing EO threats. - Initiate, based on identified shortfalls, the development of advanced detector arrays and improvements to compact lasers. - Initiate the development of novel signal processing techniques that take advantage of advances in adaptive and computational optics and embedded processing initiatives. - Investigate the use of high-powered EO techniques to saturate or degrade optical receiver performance. Title: Multi-Modal Tunnel Detection Description: In today's asymmetric warfare, adversaries' persistent and expanded use of underground tunnels for tactical advantage is largely unchallenged. Underground and subterranean tunnels are being increasingly employed to hide a variety of tactical and strategic functions, including command and control, missile and artillery protection, lines of communication and staging area for military operations. Today's tunnel detection systems are based on single mode commercial sensor technology (Ground Penetrating Radar, seismic, resistivity, gravity, cone penetrator, and electromagnetic gradiometer). Despite significant technical efforts, these approaches still fail to identify tunnels in the presence of variable geology and urban complexity and clutter. Moreover, there is currently no technical basis for combining these modes into a more powerful detection schema. The Multi-Modal Tunnel Detection program will overcome these limitations by going back to basics to exploit the underlying physics of a tunnel's response to a variety of energy sources (acoustic, seismic, electromagnetic, chemical, resistivity, conductivity, lidar, multi/hyperspectral, and gravity/gravity gradient). This multi-sensor approach will be used in conjunction with advanced mathematics, new algorithms and processing techniques to develop and demonstrate approaches that optimally combine sensor modalities to characterize tunnels and reject clutter. Upon completion the Multi-Modal Tunnel Detection program will deny the use of underground facilities that currently thwart our existing ISR systems. This capability is expected to transition to the U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Special Operations Command upon completion of a system demonstration phase. FY 2013 Plans: - Begin investigation of the fundamental interactions of various sensor modalities and geological structures indicative of tunnels and underground facilities. - Begin exploration of algorithms to combine sensor information.- - 3.550 Title: Low-Altitude Airborne Sensor System - Volume 1 - 287UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 8 of 27 R-1 Line #57Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT SEN-01: SURVEILLANCE AND COUNTERMEASURES TECHNOLOGY B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 Description: The Low-Altitude Airborne Sensor System (LAASS) program developed airborne sensing capabilities to find and characterize underground facilities (UGFs) used to shield and protect strategic and tactical activities. This includes command and control, weapons storage, manufacture of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and tunnel networks that breach secure borders and perimeters. By passively capturing emissions associated with underground facility presence and operations, and doing so using airborne sensors (acoustic, electromagnetic, gravity gradiometry), LAASS significantly increased our ability to seek out underground facilities and map out their vulnerabilities and backbone structure. LAASS technologies have been made available to Northern Command, Southern Command, Strategic Command, and Defense Threat Reduction Agency for transition. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Identified, through modeling and laboratory tests, the critical development risks for the concept system design, component gravity gradiometry sensor technologies, and supporting subsystems. - Documented expected performance of system concept (sensor, installation, processing, CONOPS). - Conducted multi-modal fusion study to validate clutter rejection and tunnel detection improvement. Title: Rescue Transponder (RT) Description: Building upon technologies developed in other sensor programs, the Rescue Transponder (RT) program investigated the use of a unique localization and tracking technology to provide a very low probability of detection (LPD) call for help signal. The system used a wideband radio frequency signal with low power and extremely low duty cycle. The program developed a small, rugged transponder that provides a call for help to friendly forces. The RT system operates over ranges that enable rescue forces or surveillance systems to receive its signals. It supports accurate localization by rescue forces, and permits transmission of identifying, authenticating, and status information. The RT technology is transitioning to the Marine Corps. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Completed development and delivered miniaturized receivers and extended-life tags to Marine Corps. - Completed transition to Marine Corps.1.000 - - Title: Sferic-Based Underground Based (Sferic) Underground Geo-positioning (S-BUG) program addressed the challenges presented when navigating and tracking within underground structures, both manmade and natural, by exploiting the abundance and long propagation range of naturally occurring global lightning events. As conceived, surface receivers at known locations will compare time difference of arrival of very low frequency (VLF) sferic events and employ super-resolution correlation techniques to accurately determine the VLF source locations. Any subsurface receiver could also detect the sferics, and real time or post- mission correlation with the surface data will enable geo-location of the subsurface receiver.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates the advanced sensor and processing technologies and systems necessary for the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Future battlefields will continue to be populated with targets that use mobility and concealment as key survival tactics, and high-value targets will range from specific individual insurgents and vehicles to groups of individuals and large platforms such as mobile missile launchers and artillery. The Sensors and Processing Systems project is primarily driven by four needs: (a) providing day-night ISR capabilities against the entire range of potential targets; (b) countering camouflage, concealment and deception of mobile ground targets; (c) detecting and identifying objects of interest/targets across wide geographic areas in near-real-time; and (d) enabling reliable identification, precision fire control tracking, timely engagement and accurate battle damage assessment of ground targets. The Sensors and Processing Systems project develops and demonstrates technologies and system concepts that combine novel approaches to sensing with emerging sensor technologies and advanced sensor and image processing algorithms, software, and hardware to enable comprehensive knowledge of the battlespace and detection, identification, tracking, engagement and battle damage assessment for high-value targets in all weather conditions and combat environments. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 Title: Behavioral Learning for Adaptive Electronic Warfare (BLADE) Description: The Behavioral Learning for Adaptive Electronic Warfare (BLADE) program will develop the capability to jam adaptive and rapidly evolving radio frequency (RF) threats in tactical environments and at tactically-relevant timescales. This will change the paradigm for responding to evolving threats from lab-based manual development to an adaptive in-the-field systems approach. When an unknown or advanced RF threat appears, BLADE networked nodes will dynamically characterize the emitter, synthesize an effective countering technique, and evaluate jamming effectiveness by iteratively probing, learning, and adapting to the threat. An optimization process will tailor near-real-time responses to specific threats, producing a countermeasure waveform that maximizes jam effectiveness while minimizing the required jamming resources. Thus BLADE will enable the rapid defeat of new RF threats and provide the warfighter with real-time feedback on jam effectiveness. The program is planned for transition to the Services. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Developed and evaluated techniques for the detection and characterization of known and unknown communications threats using adaptive threshold detection and open-set signal classification. - Created techniques for jam waveform generation via learning and active probing techniques.14.000 19.700 16.000 Volume 1 - 290UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 11 of 27 R-1 Line #57Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT SEN-02: SENSORS AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS B.

Title: Military Imaging and Surveillance Technology (MIST) Description: The Military Imaging and Surveillance Technology (MIST) program will develop a fundamentally new optical ISR capability that can provide high-resolution 3-D images to locate and identify a target at much longer ranges than is possible with existing optical systems. Several prototype optical surveillance and observation systems will be developed that will: (1) demonstrate probabilities of recognition and identification at distances sufficient to allow stand-off engagement; (2) overcome atmospheric turbulence, which now limits the ability of high-resolution optics; and (3) increase target identification confidence to reduce fratricide and/or collateral damage. The program will develop and integrate the necessary component technologies including high-energy pulsed lasers, receiver telescopes that have a field of view and depth of field that obviates the need for steering or focusing the optical system, computational imaging algorithms to improve system resolution, and data exploitation and analysis tools. Advances in laser systems, digital imagers, and novel image processing algorithms will be leveraged to reduce the overall size, weight and power of imaging systems to allow for soldier portable and UAV platform integration. MIST will also continue to integrate technologies developed under the Crosswind Sensor System for Snipers (C-WINS) and the Dynamic Image Gunsight Optics (DInGO) efforts. MIST will develop an optical rifle scope that enables a soldier, with minimal training, to shoot a firearm with marksman accuracy at range while also enhancing the capability for close quarters combat.

Title: Multifunction RF Description: The Multifunction RF program initially developed a helicopter pilot performance enhancement system for landing in degraded visual environments (DVE) such as dust clouds. Beyond landing aids in DVE, RF-based sensors can also be used for additional situational awareness, such as near ground obstacle avoidance, air-to-air collision avoidance, targeting/fire control, as well as many other combat support activities. Building on advancements made with RF sensors under this program, the program will further seek to eliminate many redundant RF elements of current independently-developed systems for landing in DVEs, terrain avoidance, obstacle avoidance, and targeting/fire control. This will reduce the overall weight, power usage, cost, and profusion of exterior antennas on military aircraft, thus enabling greater mission capability with reduced vehicle system integration burden. Transition is planned to the Services.

Title: Advanced Airborne Optical Sensing Description: The Advanced Airborne Optical Sensing program is developing electro-optical and infrared sensors and processing technologies for aerial platforms. Significant challenges have arisen as the result of two warfighting trends. First, the ever- changing mix of airborne platforms now includes a greater number of smaller UAVs. Second, the target set is increasingly challenging and now includes vehicles and individual dismounts that operate under foliage and in urban canyons, using camouflage, obscurants, and other means of concealment. In response to these challenges, the Advanced Airborne Optical Sensing program has developed enhanced optical, electro-optical, photonic and other technologies for airborne optical sensing systems. Specific examples of these technologies include: embedded image processors tailored to real-time detection, identification, and tracking of military targets; advanced laser radar technologies; hyper-spectral sensing technologies; flash detection and underwater object detection; advanced digital signal processing to support onboard image reconstruction, atmospheric correction, and system calibration; and adaptive optics techniques, such as deformable mirrors and liquid crystal spatial light modulators. The program has extended these technologies and is making them practical for airborne surveillance systems. Efforts in this program include: - The Standoff Precision ID in 3-D (SPI 3-D) program developed an affordable sensor package capable of high-resolution 3-D imaging for confirmatory target ID at long ranges, as well as full field of view (FOV) ranging to support precise geolocation of targets. The program included a series of ground-based and airborne demonstrations of SPI 3-D capabilities including: (1) high range resolution 3-D imaging; (2) full FOV range to pixel determination; (3) multiple frame-to-frame registration of imagery; and (4) GPS-based cueing from search systems. The program will also produce high speed, ultra-sensitive photo detectors for systems requiring operation at very low photon counts. This supports long-range sensors that can detect highly obscured targets under canopy/camouflage as well as very wide-area searches for submerged targets, including sea mines and semi-submerged mobile vessels. - The HALOE (High Altitude Lidar Operations Experiment) program has demonstrated, in an operational environment, the full capability of a 3-D imaging system. The HALOE system provides support for current and emerging warfighter needs by delivering high-resolution, wide-area 3-D lidar imagery data in the OCONUS environment. This system provides the unprecedented capability to collect accurate, high resolution 3-D data over wide areas to support a wide range of high-value applications, including detailed mission planning, vertical obstruction detection, helicopter landing zone analysis, and imagery geolocation. The pathway to accomplish this goal includes improving the robustness and reliability of the sensor, conducting demonstrations, and training with CONUS flight tests leading to OCONUS operational experimentation in partnership with the Army.12.618 7.700 6.000 Volume 1 - 294UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 15 of 27 R-1 Line #57Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT SEN-02: SENSORS AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS B.

The completed HALOE system will transition to the U.S. Army. - The Tactical Aircraft to Increase Long Wave Infrared Nighttime Detection (TAILWIND) program developed a system for collecting and processing IR data operating as a framing sensor. The system accepts long wave infrared and color camera images permitting day/night reconnaissance for real-time target detection and tracking. The resulting sensor and processing system will decrease the time required to focus the sensor operator's attention on relevant targets. The TAILWIND system is planned for transition to the U.S. Army. FY 2011 Accomplishments: Standoff Precision ID in 3-D (SPI 3-D) - Completed integration of miniaturized components into the demonstration system. - Conducted ground and airborne demonstrations of the metric sensing and 3-D imaging on a manned aircraft, supporting transition to U.S. Air Force. - Designed and implemented target detection, identification, and tracking algorithms in high-performance signal processing hardware architectures. - Developed promising technologies identified for use for air platform to air target identification and location.

Title: Video-rate Synthetic Aperture Radar (ViSAR) Description: Recent conflicts have demonstrated the need for close air support by precision attack platforms such as the AC-130J or the MH-60 class helicopters in support of ground forces. Under clear conditions, targets are easily-identified and engaged quite effectively, but in degraded environments the atmosphere is not always clear, and inhibits traditional optical sensors. The AC-130J must fly above cloud decks in order to avoid anti-aircraft fire, and this negates optical targeting sensors. Similarly, rotary/wing blades in urban operations generate copious amounts of dust that block circling assets from supplying cover fire for ground forces. The Video-rate Synthetic Aperture Radar (ViSAR) program will develop a real-time spotlight synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging sensor that will provide imagery of a region to allow high-resolution fire direction in conditions where optical sensors do not function. Technology from this program is planned to transition to AFSOC.

The ARGUS Infrared System (ARGUS- IR) uses an advanced infrared (IR) composite focal plane array (CFPA) sensor. The nighttime persistent capability provided by ARGUS-IR combined with the daytime capability provided by the ARGUS Imaging System (ARGUS-IS) enables 24-hour day/ night surveillance. ARGUS-IR's wide-area, high-update-rate, high-resolution imaging capability will enable detection and tracking of dismounts as well as vehicles. ARGUS-IR will utilize the signal/image processor developed as part of ARGUS-IS, enabling ARGUS-IS and ARGUS-IR to be combined on a common platform. ARGUS-IR must overcome a number of demanding technical challenges related to the IR Focal Plane Array and size, weight, and power constraints for the IR sensor. A transition plan is being developed with the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Completed the initial design of the IR CFPAs. - Completed the initial development and build of the optics for the IR sensor.16.000 10.650 - Volume 1 - 296UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 17 of 27 R-1 Line #57Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT SEN-02: SENSORS AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS B.

Title: Advanced Electronic Warfare Description: The Advanced Electronic Warfare program developed a system that enabled highly precise communications jamming. This program developed and demonstrated robust, low cost, small size, weight, and power (SWaP) distributed electronic warfare (EW) platforms that allow the warfighter to disrupt and impede an adversary's communication network. The program used an array of nodes that have synchronized clocks to enable the signal from each node to be aligned so that the carrier and phase jamming are focused on the specific target area and do not affect the non-target area. Each node contains localization, network, synchronization, and jamming processing and communication in a low-cost, easily deployable package. Technologies developed under this program have been made available to the Services for transition. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Conducted initial field experiments using multiple pole-mounted payloads to validate the ability to synchronize and direct energy to an area of interest and extract measurements of performance. - Conducted advanced experiments with improvements in distributed precision clock synchronization and initial multi-node over the air demonstrations with fixed nodes.7.128 - - Title: Large Area Coverage Search-while-Track and Engage (LACOSTE) Description: The Large Area Coverage Search-while-Track and Engage (LACOSTE) program explored persistent, tactical- grade ground-moving target indicator (GMTI) capability in dense urban areas. Wide-area continuous tracking of moving vehicles requires very small coverage gaps, small resolution cells, and target separation and identification features. The ideal sensor has the area coverage rates of GMTI radar and the resolution/identification capabilities of an electro-optical infrared system. The LACOSTE program provided wide area surveillance, simultaneous tracking, and target engagement with electro-optical and infrared sensors for tactical GMTI operations. The program developed a sensor with a very wide field of regard, and a wide instantaneous field of view (FOV) that is rapidly scanned in a search-while-track mode, tracking up to thousands of targets in an2.110 - - Volume 1 - 297UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 18 of 27 R-1 Line #57Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT SEN-02: SENSORS AND PROCESSING SYSTEMS B.

Additionally, the LACOSTE sensor provides next-generation precision tracking to enable engagement on a large number of targets in dense urban areas within that same field of regard with minimal penalty on the search-mode area coverage rate. The program also developed a rapid \"zoom\" capability for target identification that enables feature-aided tracking through dense target environments, plus sufficient target identification for separating like-targets when back-tracking a particular target via the historical track data. The LACOSTE technology was transitioned to the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Army at the conclusion of the program. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Conducted demonstration of sensitivity, resolution, and tracking. Title: NetTrack Description: The NetTrack Program developed feature-aided tracking technologies to enable airborne surveillance radars to maintain track on moving high value targets (HVTs) in traffic and cluttered environments. Ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radars provide excellent potential for tracking HVTs because they operate in all weather and at long ranges. However, maintaining target tracks is very challenging because obscuration and close target spacing make it difficult to associate radar kinematic measurements over time. To address this challenge, NetTrack developed feature aided tracking technology that automatically collects and exploits target high range resolution (HRR) radar measurements. Specific NetTrack technologies include signal processing to generate HRR measurements from raw radar returns, feature extraction and matching to exploit HRR measurements, multiple hypothesis tracking to associate measurements to tracks and estimate target location and velocity, and sensor resource management to automatically select optimum radar mode parameters and timing sequences. A Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) has been established for transition of NetTrack to the Navy Advanced Airborne Sensor which is a follow-on to the Navy Littoral Surveillance Radar System. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Demonstrated feature aided tracking in traffic and cluttered environments. - Collected maritime data and investigated extensions of the NetTrack capabilities to the maritime environment. - Planned and initiated an extension to facilitate an Operational Utility Assessment (OUA) with the Navy. - Developed plans to conduct and carry out several Integration & Test (I&T) flights prior to the OUA demonstration.2.000 - - Title: Precision Inertial Navigation Systems High Dynamic Range Atom Sensors and Systems (PINS HiDRA) Description: Precision Inertial Navigation Systems High Dynamic Range Atom Sensors and Systems (PINS HiDRA) developed an integrated cold atom-based inertial measurement unit (IMU) suitable for use on a wide range of military platforms.

Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Exploitation Systems project develops algorithms, software, and information processing systems to extract information from massive intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) datasets. In particular, it develops new technologies for detection and discrimination of targets from clutter, classification and fingerprinting of high value targets, localization and tracking over wide areas, and threat network identification and analysis. Efforts will focus on difficult ISR environments, for example (a) urban environments with extensive building obscuration, large volumes of civilian traffic, and feature-rich terrain, (b) mountain environments with highly variable terrain elevation, complex local and regional threat networks, and predominantly dismounted adversaries, (c) jungle environments with targets under heavy canopy, animals, and other sources of clutter masking human activity, and (d) maritime and littoral environments where threats now include terrorists, pirates, smugglers, drug traffickers, and other non-traditional adversaries. The resulting technology will enable operators to more effectively use ISR data in the execution of wide area search, border and road monitoring, high value target tracking, overwatch, and other missions.

Title: Multi-Sensor Exploitation Description: The Multi-Sensor Exploitation program provides multi-sensor exploitation capabilities enabling missions such as overwatch, border surveillance, high value target tracking, and threat network detection using mixes of imaging, radar, signals, human intelligence, and other sources. The program integrates novel cyber-human-physical sensing and man-machine processing to better take advantage of the strengths of each. New processing techniques for hyperspectral imaging sensors will enable long duration tracking of vehicles and dismounts. Scalable stochastic modeling and inference techniques will yield improved situation awareness and assessment for wide-area electro-optical/IR motion imaging, radar, and multi-sensor exploitation applications in settings where large numbers of interacting entities engaged in complex activities are observed over long periods of time. Techniques intended for use in riverine and maritime environments, where extremist and criminal groups threaten political stability, trade routes, and free commerce, will map navigable tributary systems, detect and identify threats, and monitor their activity. Potential transition partners include USAFRICOM, USSOUTHCOM, USSOCOM and intelligence agencies. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Evaluated and optimized techniques and software for tracking targets in dense target environments. - Performed preliminary data collects to establish the viability of novel hyperspectral processing and detection techniques. - Collaborated with several potential transition partners to develop operational concepts utilizing the hyperspectral capability. - Hyperspectral experiments successfully demonstrated proof of concept capability.6.900 7.720 - Volume 1 - 304UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 25 of 27 R-1 Line #57Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT SEN-03: EXPLOITATION SYSTEMS B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 - Tested and refined previously developed detection algorithms to extract thermal spectral signatures of chemical solids and vehicle paints. FY 2012 Plans: - Demonstrate flow-based tracker improvements using instrumented data and in-theater data. - Develop techniques for dealing with riverine and maritime challenges such as turbidity, multi-path reflection, sea clutter, and high clutter density. - Transition the atmospheric downwelling correction algorithms and the sub-pixel detection algorithms into NGA's operational exploitation configuration. Title: Foliage Penetrating Radar Planning and Exploitation Description: The Foliage Penetrating Radar Planning and Exploitation program will complete final FORESTER foliage penetrating radar demonstrations and provide further exploitation capabilities to find dismounted targets in densely forested terrain. Current foliage penetrating radar systems provide an important capability for detecting dismount targets under foliage, but the systems also detect animals, moving water, blowing trees, and other scene clutter moving under or in the foliage that makes situation assessment, manpower and radar resource intensive. Further, Doppler signature data that may enable improved automated discrimination of dismount targets from other detections is not currently exploited. Finally, no planning tools are available for optimizing and dynamically replanning collection assets to improve imaging geometries and detectability. This program will provide capabilities to address these issues by exploiting Doppler signature data, automating temporal processing approaches currently used, and automating terrain, weather, and on-line exploitation data to enable planning and dynamic replanning. The result will be significantly improved capability for finding and localizing targets under foliage. The program will transition to USSOUTHCOM and USSOCOM. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Formulated, evaluated, and optimized algorithms for mitigating detections in radar systems due to non-living objects in motion and for mitigating confusion between humans and animals. - Formulated, evaluated, and optimized multiple algorithms for assessment of group-state activity level sufficient to assist an operator in assessment of the group's intent. FY 2012 Plans: - Refine algorithms for performing Doppler discrimination and assessing group state and activity. - Optimize and implement algorithms for the FORESTER processing architecture. - Develop pre-mission planning module to optimize flight path for maximum observeability of target named areas of interest. - Transition system into operational exploitation cells.7.500 5.200 - Title: Persistent Operations Surface Surveillance and Engagement (POSSE) 1.400 - - Volume 1 - 305UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGY UNCLASSIFIED Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Page 26 of 27 R-1 Line #57Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2013 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DATE: February 2012 APPROPRIATION/BUDGET ACTIVITY 0400: Research, Development, Test & Evaluation, Defense-Wide BA 3: Advanced Technology Development (ATD)R-1 ITEM NOMENCLATURE PE 0603767E: SENSOR TECHNOLOGYPROJECT SEN-03: EXPLOITATION SYSTEMS B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs in Millions) FY 2011 FY 2012 FY 2013 Description: The Persistent Operations Surface Surveillance and Engagement (POSSE) program developed the capability to integrate sensor input from multiple modalities to find indications of insurgent activities. Combined with dynamically updated information from soldiers on the ground, POSSE has enabled near-real-time generation of the evidence necessary for further investigation or interdiction. POSSE experiments were conducted at the National Training Center (NTC) with realistic role players emulating typical residential, commercial, and light industrial activity. Within this environment, insurgent activity was simulated by qualified experts using the latest and most complete intelligence available. Measurements included precision collections of insurgent activities, as well as the realistic surrounding background clutter of typical civilian activity. Results informed future experiments, led to specifications for future sensor design, and provided insights into how to integrate other narrow and wide area sensors into an integrated approach to countering insurgencies. Transition is in process with the U.S. Army Intelligence and Security Command. FY 2011 Accomplishments: - Refined sensors specific to close-in insurgent activity detection. - Demonstrated new insurgent activity detection techniques in field exercises at the National Training Center.
