Jackson and C.J. Wood Professor of Chemistry, Emeritus 227 Total Publications close Axel Brunger Professor of Molecular and Cellular Physiology, of Neurology, of Photon Science and, by courtesy, of Structural Biology Research Interests One of Axel Brunger's major goals is to decipher the molecular mechanisms of synaptic neurotransmitter release by conducting imaging and single-molecule/particle reconstitution experiments, combined with near-atomic resolution structural studies of the synaptic vesicle fusion machinery. 202 Total Publications close Ron Dror Associate Professor of Computer Science and, by courtesy, of Molecular and Cellular Physiology and of Structural Biology 130 Total Publications close Michael Fayer David Mulvane Ehrsam and Edward Curtis Franklin Professor of Chemistry 658 Total Publications close Kelly Gaffney Associate Professor of Photon Science and, by courtesy, of Chemistry Research Interests The research team Professor Gaffney leads focuses on time resolved studies of chemical reactions. Recent advances in ultrafast x-ray lasers, like the LCLS at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, enable chemical reactions to be observed on the natural time and length scales of the chemical bond - femtoseconds and \u00c5ngstr\u00f6ms. The knowledge gained from x-ray and optical laser studies will be used to spark new approaches to photo-catalysis and chemical synthesis. 90 Total Publications close Chris Garcia Younger Family Professor and Professor of Structural Biology Research Interests Structural and functional studies of transmembrane receptor interactions with their ligands in systems relevant to human health and disease - primarily in immunity, infection, and neurobiology. We study these problems using protein engineering, structural, biochemical, and combinatorial biology approaches. 338 Total Publications close Daniel Herschlag Professor of Biochemistry and, by courtesy, of Chemical Engineering Research Interests Our research is aimed at understanding the chemical and physical behavior underlying biological macromolecules and systems, as these behaviors define the capabilities and limitations of biology. Toward this end we study folding and catalysis by RNA, as well as catalysis by protein enzymes. 333 Total Publications close Matthias C.
