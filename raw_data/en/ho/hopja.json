Its first use in an epidemic of Scarlet Fever was documented in 1801. It has been used throughout the world since then for both short-term and long-term preventative purposes. The effectiveness and safety of Go lden's long-term HP program using homoeopathically prepared substances to prevent targeted infectious diseases in recipients was tested through two research projects. The effectiveness of the program could not be established with statistical certainty given the limited sample size and the low probability of acquiring an infectious disease. However, a possible level of effectiveness of 90.3% was identified subject to specified limitations. Further research to confirm the effectiveness of the program is justified. Statistically significant results were obtai ned that confirmed the safety of the program both in absolute terms as well as compared to all other methods of disease prevention studied. It also appeared possible that a nationa l immunisation system where both vaccination and HP were available to parents would increase the national coverage against targeted infectious diseases, and reduce the incide nce of some chronic health conditions, especially asthma.

references in brackets show where the term was first used. The Effectiveness of a homoeopathic preventative program is the proportion of those using the program who did not acquire the ta rgeted disease, to the total number of persons using the program. Where possible, the figure for effectiveness is refined by identifying those users of the program who we re exposed to the targeted disease, and using that total in the pr oportion. (Chapter 2.5.1) The Genus Epidemicus is the remedy chosen during an outbreak of an infectious disease that best matches the common symptom picture of the disease. The remedy is selected after analysing the symptoms of a number of patients with the disease. (Chapter 2.3) Homoeoprophylaxis (HP) is the use of homoeopathically prepared potentised substances in a systematic manner to prev ent the development of the characteristic symptoms of infectious diseases. (Introduction) An Isode is a remedy prepared from the pati ent's OWN diseased material, e.g., a remedy prepared from a whooping-cough pa tient's own sputum. (Chapter 3.2.4) Immunisation is taken to mean any method that reduces the likelihood of the recipient acquiring a targeted in fectious disease if exposed to the disease. (Introduction) The Law of Similars states that a substance that is capable of causing a group of symptoms in a healthy person is capable of removing a group of similar symptoms in a sick person. (Chapter 2.2.2) A Nosode is a homoeopathic preparation (poten cy) of diseased ti ssue, e.g., a remedy prepared from the sputum of a number of patients with whooping cough. (Chapter 3.2.4) Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden xiiPotentisation is the method used in homoeopathy to prepare remedies. The original material is subjected to a series of dilu tions and succussions (violent shaking of the diluting medium against a firm surface), or triturations (grinding of insoluble substances). (Chapter 2.2.2) Provings are controlled experiments where dos es of the substance being tested (usually in potentised form) are given to healthy volunteers, who record new symptoms produced by taking the substa nce. The Master Prover (the person supervising the proving) then extracts those symptoms that are common to a number of provers, and this information is entered into th e Materia Medica. (Chapter 2.2.2) Recipients are those persons using the HP programs being studied. (Title) Succussion is the process used in the preparati on of homoeopathic remedies in liquid form where the container holding the medicina l solution is repeatedly shaken firmly with vertical movements against a firm su rface thus violently agitating the medicinal solution. (Chapter 2.2.2) Trituration is the process used in the preparatio n of homoeopathic remedies in solid form where the active substance and a medicinally neutral powder, often sugar crystals prepared from maize or milk, are ground toge ther using a mortar and pestle. Usually trituration is used only until the mi xture is soluble. (Chapter 2.2.2) Vaccination is defined as the administration, usually orally or by injection, of attenuated antigenic material together with preservatives and adjuvants to stimulate the production of antibodies in the recipient. (Introduction) The Vital Force is defined as a person's self-b alancing (healing) energy that is present from birth, and which acts to main tain homoeostasis on the mental, emotional and physical levels of the person's being. (Chapter 2.2.2) Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 1PART 1: INTRODUCTION Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 2 1 Introduction to the Thesis In most developed countries the preventi on of specified infectious diseases is generally undertaken through the use of comprehensive vaccination programs from birth. Mass vaccination has been accepted public health policy for over 100 years. Whilst published research in orthodox me dical journals has strongly supported community-wide vaccination programs, the procedure has been shown in the same journals to be neither totally safe, nor totally effective (Golden 1998, pp. 3-29). There are a number of ways to boost a pe rson's level of immunity to specified infectious diseases. One way is to boos t overall immunity to all diseases by raising general health through good diet and nut rition, through a balan ced lifestyle, and possibly through \"constitutional\" treatment pr ograms such as homoeopathic or herbal treatment to improve the overall vitality of the person. Common sense suggests that healthy people tend to recover better from any illness, and are more resistant to specified diseases . However clinical expe rience shows us that even very healthy people c ontract infectious diseases. The second way to boost a person's level of di sease-specific immunity is to target the specified disease with disease-specific preventative methods. Such methods have demonstrated levels of protection that are significant, although less than 100%. There are two known methods of disease-specific immunisation - one is vaccination, and the second is the use of homoeopathically selected and prepared substances, a procedure known as homoeoprophylaxis [HP]. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 3HP was first described in 1801, and has b een used throughout the world since then. Its supporters claim that it is comparably effective to vaccinat ion but completely non- toxic and therefore sa fe (Golden 1986, p.70). However, the orthodox medical community re gards HP with grea t suspicion because it is not consistent with th e orthodox paradigm which relie s on a modified antigenic stimulation of antibody levels in vaccinat ed persons. There has been practically no orthodox research into HP for that reason, and its community-wide use is generally opposed by orthodox medicine. In practice, although the method of i mmunisation supported by orthodox medical authorities (vaccination) is neither perfectly effective nor perfectly safe, the use of an alternative method of immunisa tion (HP) that claims to be comparably effective and completely non-toxic is rejected without objective testing. The aim of this thesis is to determine whether HP can safely prevent targeted infectious diseases. The consequent implications for national health policy will be considered. Chapter 2 provides a general introduction to homoeopathic medicine and its use for both treatment and prevention. The historical development of HP and its current use and support within the homoeopathic profession are also examined. The conceptual basis of HP and its mechan ism of action are examined in Chapter 3. A minority of homoeopaths believe that it is best for the long-term health of an individual to acquire an inf ectious disease and then treat homoeopathically, rather than prevent the disease using HP (Golden 2002a, p.29). Some of these pr actitioners believe that HP may cause a long-term weakening of an individual's overall wellbeing. These and other aspects of the us e of HP that are questioned within the homoeopathic community are also examined in Chapter 3. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 4For the purpose of this thesis, two research studies have been undertaken to analyse the effectiveness and safety of HP, and a third study has been conducted to examine the use of HP by Australian homoeopaths. Th e relationship between these three research projects and the chapters of the thesis is show n in Table 1.1-1 below. The research methods used in both projects are described in Chapter 4. The results of the research are presented in Chapter 5. The first project described in this thesis examined the long-term effectiveness and safety of a HP program established by the au thor in the context of his homoeopathic practice. The research component of this program involved a 15- year collection of 2,342 questionnaires, each one covering one year of the life of a child using HP. It represents the largest long-term trial of HP ever published, and provides the reference point for the second project undertak en as part of this thesis. The second project researching the safety and effectivene ss of HP involved a general health survey of 781 children aged between 4 and 12 years. Genera l health was assessed using the incidence of asthma, eczema, ear and hearing problems, allergies and behavioural problems; the incidence data were then compared with, among other factors, the type of disease prevention used. In addition to examining the absolute effectiveness and safety of HP, the data a llowed a comparison of HP to other methods of disease prevention to assess its relative strengths and weaknesses. In Chapter 6 the effectiveness and safety of HP are discussed using all available material. Final conclusions are presented in Chapter 7 regarding the ability of HP to safely prevent infectious diseases. Some recomme ndations for national health policy are made based on the evidence and arguments presented in earlier chapters.

In Chapter 3 the conceptual basis of HP is out lined, aspects of HP that are contested by some homoeopaths are discussed, and a mechanism of action suggested. This chapter begins with a brief explana tion of homoeopathy. The origin of HP is then explained, and an outline of its historical use is given. References to the effectiveness and the safety of HP in the homoeopathic literature are reviewed. The current use of HP by Australia n homoeopaths is examined, as well as the use of HP by overseas practitioners. 2.2 An Explanation of Homoeopathy 2.2.1 Introduction Homoeopathy is a therapeutic system f ounded by German physician Dr Samuel Hahnemann in the late 1700's and the early 1800's. Homoeopathy has been used for 200 years in most countries around the world with the main exceptions of China and Japan. It is used extensively by medical docto rs, as well as by practitioners who are not medical doctors. In Australia, as in many other countries, the use of homoeopathy was much greater in the late 1800's and early 1900' s, with homoeopathic hospitals in some states, such as the old Prince Henry's Hospital in Melbourne. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 8The widespread use of homoeopathic medicine declined in the early 1900's with the advent of antibiotics, anae sthetics, and other advances in orthodox medicine. These developments brought with them massive grow th in the financial strength of the major pharmaceutical houses around the world. Exceptions were in India and some European countries where use of homoeopathy remain ed strong. The trend in use changed again over the last 20 years in many countries, incl uding Australia, as growing numbers of people choose to rely more on non-pharmaceutical methods to treat themselves and their families. As evidence of this trend, there are homoeopathic medical associations in 41 countries (Diamantidis 1990, pp. 286,7). Over 40 % of French medical practitioners use homoeopathic medicine, in England there ar e five homoeopathic hospitals registered under the National Health Service, and 42% of British medical practitioners who responded to a British Medical Journal survey referred patients to homoeopaths (Wharton and Lewith 1986, p. 1498). In Germany, homoeopathy is taught in medical schools and 20% of German doctors use homoeopathic medicines at times in their practice (Ullman 1991a, p. 118). In India, the majority of medical practitioners use homoeopathic remedies, and since 1973 homoeopathy has been regulated under an Act of Parliament (Dutta 1979, pp. 18,19). Homoeopathy is used in a number of South American countries, in South Africa and in the United States (Ullman 1995, p. 15). Although figures are not readily available, there has been widespread use of homoeopat hy in the old Eastern bloc countries since the early 1800's (Kotoc 2000, p. 27). 2.2.2 Homoeopathic Treatment - A General Explanation Hahnemann was both a physician and pharm acist. Because of his fluency in languages, including Greek, Latin, German, Fren ch, English, Hebrew and Aramaic, he Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 9was able to read and study both ancient and contemporary healing texts from many developed countries. Hahnemann was the first physician to make full practical use of a Law of Nature known to ancient healers such as Hippocrates. This was the Law of Similars, which states that a substance that is capable of causing a group of symptoms in a healthy person is capable of removing a group of similar symptoms in a sick person. In fact Hahnemann coined the word \"homoeopathy\" from two Greek words meaning \"similar suffering\". Hahnemann realised the value of this La w when he was translating Dr Cullen's Materia Medica of medicines from English into German. He disagreed with the author's description of the effects of overdoses of Peruvian bark, an herb that was used in the treatment of malarial fevers. Hahnemann, being a true scientist, expe rimented by taking small doses of the Peruvian bark and found that he developed a fever that was very similar to a malarial fever. The fever ceased when he stopped taki ng the Bark. He took some more, and the fever started again. It again ceased soon af ter he stopped taking the Peruvian bark. This was a practical example of the Law of Similars, i.e., Peruvian Bark was capable of producing in a healthy person a fever similar to a condition it could relieve (cure) in a person unwell with Malaria. In orthodox medi cine, Peruvian bark, or Cinchona, is the material from which Quinine is produced, and which continues to be used in the treatment of malarial fevers. Another example of the Law of Similars is the homoeopathic use of Ipecac. The syrup is often used in orthodox medicine to induce vomiting in cases where a patient may have swallowed a poisonous substance. When used in homoeopathic potency (see explanation below) it may be used to tr eat nausea and vomiting in patients whose symptoms are similar to the ch aracteristic symptoms of Ipecac. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 10In order to find the potentia lly curative properties of many substances, homoeopaths from Hahnemann onwards have conducted homoeopathic provings of nearly 3,000 substances. This has built a substantial Ma teria Medica from whic h medicines can be selected to apply the Law of Similars. Unlike most drugs testing, properly conducted homoeopathic provings use healthy volunteers called provers who take the substance being tested, usually in potentised form, using a strictly defined protocol. The provers report their resulting symptoms on the mental, emotional and physical levels. Those symptoms that are experienced by a number of provers are very carefully and systematically compiled into a summary of symptoms that the substance can cause in healthy provers. Symptoms in sick patients can be rem oved by the use of the remedy, given in homoeopathic potency, which has produced the \"most similar\" symptoms in provings to the symptoms of the patient. A properly conducted proving exhibits all the characteristics of a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Provers do not know what substance is being tested. Neither does the master prover , the person directing the experi ment. A placebo is given to a randomly selected part of the proving group. The provers are directed not to communicate the symptoms they develop with other provers until the trial is completed. At the end of the trial the master prover collects the symptoms recorded by all participants, and extracts those that are e xperienced by most provers, excluding any that may have been experienced by many in the placebo group. Only then is the name of the remedy being tested revealed to th e master prover and the proving group. The fact that a significant proportion of provers of a potentised substance in a properly conducted proving i ndependently produce very simi lar symptoms suggests that potentised substances are indeed medicinally active, are different from a placebo, and their effects are observable, measurable and repeatable. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 11The homoeopathic Materia Medica is a systematic collection of remedy information constructed primarily using data coll ected from homoeopathic provings from Hahnemann's time to today. Relevant inform ation from records of poisonings and repeated examples of cured symptoms are also included in the remedy information in the homoeopathic Materia Medica. Over the last 200 years many of the remedies first tested in the early 1800's have been re-proved. Whilst some new symptoms are usually uncovered as the numbers of provers completing the collective proving increases, the accuracy of the information collected by the early homoeopaths has been repeatedly confirmed. This long history of consistency revealed in records of provings must be weighed against recently expressed concerns with any form of clinical trial in homoeopathy (Walach, 2003, p.10). In the end, the weight of consistent results is considerable. Thus when treating a patient who presents with a particular co llection of symptoms, homoeopaths consult the Materia Medica and choose that remedy whose proving symptoms are the most similar to the symptoms of the patient. It is then prescribed in the minimum dose necessary to produce a healing response. Using the example of Ipecac given above, a homoeopath would consider giving a homoeopathic preparation of Ipecac to a pati ent who presented with continued nausea and vomiting. However, hundreds of other s ubstances also can cause nausea and vomiting. So Ipecac would be chosen only if the patient presented with other symptoms that are characteristic of Ipecac. Confirming symptoms would include the state of the patient's tongue (clean or uncoated) and mouth (increased salivation), because in provings, Ipecac not only caused continued nausea and vomiting but also produced a clean tongue with increased sa livation in most provers. Hahnemann determined that most disease init ially occurred on a deeper, inner level with physical symptoms arising as a result of the subsequent disturbance to the person's vital force or essential inner self -healing energy. He saw the vital force as the God-Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 12given subtle energy that maintained homoeo stasis in each person's mental, emotional and physical system. He concluded that since disease arose on th is subtle energetic level, prevention or cure would need to take place on the same level. He also was concerned with the toxic effects of the strong material doses of the medicines used at that time. Hahnemann did not state how he arrived at his method of preparing remedies by potentising substances until all that remained of the particular substance was the dynamic (healing) energy that is latent in every substance. Potentisation is achieved by repeated dilutions and succussions (vigorous striking of the bottle containing the diluted material against a firm support). When preparing insoluble solids, trituration or grinding is used instead of succussion. Most homoeopaths use the \"centesimal scale\" of potentisation, where one drop of the mother tincture of the medicinal material is a dded to 99 drops of a neutral medium and succussed vigorously. This is the first, or \"1 c\", potency. One drop of this solution is added to 99 drops of neutral medium and succu ssed to create the s econd, or 2c potency. These steps are repeated to create potencies as high as 100,000c, referred to as \"100M\". One drop of 6c potency, for example, contains only 1/1,000,000,000,000th part of the original material. However, clinical use has shown that the potentisation process releases a healing energy latent within the chosen substance. Avogadro's Law indicates that once medicines have been prepared to the 12c potency they will contain no molecules of the original substance. The use of substances prepared in this manner has caused homo eopathy to be scorned by many in orthodox medicine, who cannot believe that a substan ce containing no molecule s of the original material can have any medicinal effect. In fact, homoeopaths generally accept, in agreement with orthodox theor y, that simple dilution withou t succussion or trituration does not produce an active medicinal substance. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 13Homoeopathy cannot presently be explained in terms of current orthodox science. This will no doubt change as further orthodox re search is conducted into subjects such as the memory of water, sub-atomic particle s, and measurements of the energy latent in substances. The history of or thodox medicine itself is full of examples of the use of medicines and methods that have not been fully understood or proven, such as the action of Asprin that was used for decades without its action being fully understood. However, its use was justified because it produced results that were consistent, predictable, repeatable and obs ervable. The same test can reasonably be applied to HP. The purpose of the research described in th is thesis is to test whether the use of HP can be justified on the basis of practica l results that are consistent, predictable, repeatable and observable. Returning to the development of homoe opathy, the homoeopathic historian Ullman (1991b, p. 2) has stated that 'probably the most important reason that homeopathy developed such immense popularity was its su ccess in treating the various infectious epidemic diseases that raged throughout America a nd Europe during the 1800s' . Some early examples are: In 1813, Hahnemann achieved a success rate of 100% in treating 183 Typhus patients; at that time Typhus was considered incurable (Hahnemann 1830, p. 401). Scarlet Fever was effectively treated and prevented by Hahnemann using the remedy Belladonna (Hahnemann 1801, p. 377). During the European cholera epidemic s of the mid 1800's, the death rate among all patients was between 40% a nd 60%, while the rate amongst persons who received homoeopathic treatment was between 5% and 16%. (Shepherd 1967, p. 15). During the 1849 cholera epidemic onl y 3% of 1,116 homeopathic patients treated by Cincinnati ho moeopaths died, while between 48-60% of those under orthodox medical treatm ent died (Coulter 1975, p. 268). Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 14Such experience continued throughout the world into the 1900's. For example, during the 1918-1920 Influenza (Spanish Flu) epidemics in the United States, the mortality rate was around 30%; the general mortality rate among individuals treated homoeopathically was less than 1% (Shepherd 1967, p. 51). Homoeopathy can also be used to treat deep -seated chronic illness as well as acute disease. It is a primary care treatment in so me countries, as noted above, and is used as either complementary or alternative medicine in many other countries. Some orthodox scientific rese arch into homoeopathic trea tment has been undertaken with varying results. Three major reviews of published research have been conducted, all of which found some positive results fo r homoeopathy, despite the authors' finding its mechanism of action to be implausible (Kleijnen et al., 1991, pp. 316-323 ; Linde et al., pp. 834-843 ; Cucherat et al., 2000, pp. 27-33). The greatest difficulty with orthodox research into homoeopathy is that methods used to test molecular reactions and responses ar e not necessarily appr opriate to test non- molecular reactions (Bellav ite and Signorini 1995, pp 78-83). Thus there remains considerable scepticism within the orthodox medical community concerning the use of homoeopathic treatm ent. Possibly the main reason for this scepticism is that the method of action of potentised substances does not fit the orthodox model of how material substances interact. While the current orthodox research pa radigm does not (yet) have access to a methods with which to assess the effectiv eness of homoeopathy, homoeopaths claim that 200 years of clinical e xperience shows that homoeopathy does offer an effective method of treating most conditions. Clinical experience reported in following sections also shows that it also offers a consiste ntly effective method of infectious disease prevention. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 152.2.3 Homoeopathic Prevention of Infectious Diseases - A Brief Introduction The scepticism by orthodox practitioners re garding homoeopathic treatment is even more pronounced when considering homoeopath ic prevention of in fectious diseases. There is, in fact, great ho stility by many orthodox authorities to anyone who suggests that homoeopathic disease prevention is even possible. Hahnemann believed that prevention of potentia lly serious diseases was far superior to treatment. He wrote; 'Who can deny that the perfect prevention of infection from this devastating scourge, and the discovery of a means whereby this divine aim may be surely attained, would offer infinite advantages over any mode of treatment, be it of the most incomparable kind soever?' (Hahnemann 1801, p. 377). As mentioned earlier, a practical example of both the treatment and prevention aspects of the Law of Similars may be f ound in Hahnemann's experience when treating patients with scarlet fever. 'The remedy capable of maintaining the healthy uninfectable by the miasm of scarlatina, I was so fortuna te as to discover.', Hahnemann wrote. He continued, 'I shall now relate the mode in wh ich I made the discovery of this specific preventative remedy'. He then described his successful use of potencies of the remedy Belladonna, chosen on the basis of the Law of Similars, to treat pa tients with Scarlet Fever, and how he also found that potencies of Belladonna would prev ent scarlet fever, once again chosen on the basis of the Law of Similars (Hahnemann 1801, pp. 374-383). Hahnemann again refers to HP in the 6 th edition of his Organon of the Healing Art in note 73b to aphorism 73, which discusses acute miasmic disease. Here he discusses his use of Belladonna for the prevention of scar let fever and Aconite for prevention of roodvonk (purpura miliaris) (Hahnemann 1843, p. 161). In The Chronic Diseases he identifies Bryonia and Rhus Tox as two specific remedies used in 1813 for the treatment of t yphus. These acute spec ifics represent early Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 16genus epidemicus preventative remedies chosen by examining the characteristic symptoms of a number of people suffer ing the same condition (Hahnemann 1828, p. 8). The use of HP by other homoeopaths follo wed Hahnemann's lead, and is described below. 2.3 The Historical Use of Homoeoprophylaxis Traub (1994, pp. 50-61) and Hoover (2001, pp. 168-175) presented reviews covering the use of HP over the la st 200 years by homoeopaths from every continent. In Homoeoprophylaxis - A Practic al and Philosophical Review, Golden listed a few of the many thousands of references that have appeared in the homo eopathic literature worldwide describing the use of HP by diffe rent practitioners (Golden 2001, p. 28-34). Some references from this list are provi ded in chronological or der to indicate the historical development of HP. Boenninghausen (1848, p. 3) found that 'The decidedly favourable results caused me not only to use the same remedy with all th e following small-pox patients, but to also use the same remedy in several houses where small-pox had broken out, as a prophylactic, and lo! also here the result was favourable, and no case came to my knowledge where, after using Thuja, any other me mber of the family had been infected.' Boenninghausen (1849, p. 303) noted that '... we homoeopa ths are convinced that we possess prophylactics which have the power of preventing th e outbreak of cholera. Of course, these are and can be only such remedies as are able to cure the disease after it has broken out .... Although the circumstance that thousands of men have through the use of these homoeopathic prophylactics escaped cholera, as has been actually proved, does not incontestably prove that these afford an absolute protection, since it might have been that these very persons might have b een the ones who would in any case not have been touched by the disease, nevertheless thes e facts speak at least very much for the probability of such a salutary action.' Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 17 Burnett ( 1884 ) wrote 'It seems to me that the requ irement of the age is to systematise the prevention of disease according to the Law of Similars, and in dynamic dose.'(p. 115). 'Strewn about in literature there are examples of small-dose homoeoprophylaxis'. 'The vaccine 'lymph' - pus - has been dyna mised more homoeopathico and given as a prophylactic against small-pox in epidemic tim es, and apparently with effect. Thuja Occidentalis has been used in like manner by more than one homoeopathic practitioner, and they claim that it is effective. ... Speaki ng for myself, I have for the last nine years been in the habit of using vaccine matter, in the thirtieth homoeopathic centesimal potency, whenever small-pox was about, and I have thus far not seen any one so far treated get variola.'(p. 114). Kent ( 1900, p. 229) stated 'We must look to hom oeopathy for our protection as well as for our cure'. 'Now you will find that for prophylaxis there is required a less degree of similitude than is necessary for curing. A remedy will not have to be so similar to prevent disease as to cure it, and these reme dies in daily use will enable you to prevent a large number of people from becoming sick.' Eaton ( 1907 ) that 'We must not do Homoeopathy the injus tice of giving this, one of its most successful and us eful outgrowths, a partial a nd equivocal recognition, just because it happens to be strange to us. This splendid piece of practice is not new; it has its roots in the past, though we may not have known it. And we must not injure the cause by refusing to recognise its value just because we happen not to have been conversant with it.' Close (1920, p. 20 ) wrote that 'Homoeopathy is opposed to the methods of vaccine and serum therapy, although it is claimed by many that these methods are based upon the homoeopathic principle. It has been proven experimentally and c linically that such methods are unnecessary, and that the results claimed by their advocates can be attained more safely, more rapidly and more thoroughly by the administration of the homoeopathically indicated medicines in s ub-physiological doses, through the natural Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 18channels of the body, than by introducing it forcibly by means of the hypodermic needle or in any other way.' Sankaran ( 1961, pp. 11-24) produced a very thor ough literature review, sourcing 92 practitioners and hundreds of examples of HP. He explained, 'Though the effectiveness of the Homoeopathic prophylactic remedies for various conditions has not been proved by controlled studies and statistical records, yet generati ons of homoeopaths have used these remedies to prevent these conditions a nd they claim to have done it successfully. So their effectiveness may be accepted on the ba sis of this experience even if it is not proved.' Shepherd ( 1967, p. 15) stated that 'In oculation with any type of serum in any of these infectious diseases is harmful and can easily and safely be replaced by a remedy or remedies, proved according to our Law of Si milars that \"likes cures like\" on healthy individuals. Nosodes or dis ease products of the actual disease are often most active preventatives.' Shepherd gave many practical examples of how HP reduced attacks of infectious diseases in English boarding sc hools that she attended, and other examples from her long and distinguished career. Again in England, Blackie ( 1976, p. 184) wrote, while disc ussing HP, 'The same is true of the homoeopathic oral flu vaccine. Clinical experience prove s that protection is given in individuals, yet there is no increase in antibodies to the influenza virus. ... One cannot ignore clinical observ ation but we have no way of measuring true reasons - it just works. The results, therefore, of Homoeopathy in preventative medicine are justifiably based on experience rather pp. 50,53) remedies can act as prophylactic medicines, when the homoeopath ic remedy in its provings brings out symptoms similar to a particular disease. It was experienced that the genus epidemicus when given to the members of the family who were not suffering from the epidemic disease were protected from developing the di sease.' Mathur then quoted Dr Pierre Schmidt from an address given in Geneva on HP: 'The most noble role of medicine is Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 19unquestionably prophylaxy. There homoeopathy a sserts its superiority over the existing methods. It can prevent disease without endangering the organism, without incurring the disappointments of the prevailing school of medicine.' Speight ( 1982, p. 3) discussed HP, stating: 'In homoeopathy there is no immunisation as such, but there are remedies th at can build up immunity to infections. They can also act as curative agents where a disease has developed. These remedies carry no risk of detrimental effects, they are absolutely safe.' 'Dr A. Pulford wrote, \"No disease will arise without an existing predispositi on to that disease. It is the absence of the predisposition to any partic ular disease that makes us immune to it. Homoeopathy alone is capable of removing these predispos itions\"'. Speight then gives examples of HP in nine common diseases. Eizayaga (1991, pp. 283) wrote that 'An ideal socio- medical system should assist all individuals before they cont ract any disease, whether acute or chronic ... In acute diseases: with the remedy of the epidemic ge nius and with the aetiological Nosode of the disease.' 'In homoeopathy, with the Nosode of each of the acute diseases we could fulfil a job similar to the one achieved by th e vaccines which are known, without any of their inconveniences. While the non specific resistance of an individual to an infection is increased with the homoeopathic remedy, a higher specific imm unity against a given germ is obtained with the Nosode'. Dr Paul Chavanon, writing in Paris in 1932, mentions in his book, La Diptherie , about the immunisation of 45 children with Dipthe rotoxinum 4M and 8M, one dose by mouth, some needing a second dose of 4M: 'Chavanon demonstrated that as regards Schi ck's reaction, the Nosode negatives it or makes it inactive during a firs t period, as well as immunising without the presence of antitoxins or antibodies. After a short time, one to two months, antitoxins which can be measured in the blood appear and a real vaccination exists ... the respective immunisation lasts just the same as the one provoked by the antitoxin in substance, without any of its disadvantages'. ' Horacio Roux reported these same experiences in 1946 and obtained like results.' (p. 284). Dr Eizayaga then describes his own substantial and successful experience with HP. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 20 Sethi ( 1991, pp. 22, 47, 56, 78) reviewed the expe rience of homoeopaths around the world. Some of the examples he gives of the use for HP for specific diseases are: 'Diphtherinum. Allen says that he had used it for 25 years as a prophylactic and has never known a second case of diphther ia to occur in a family after it has been administered. He challenges th e profession to test it and publish the failures. ...Tyler writes that for nearly three years, Diphtherinum in high potency has been used in the London Homoeopa thic Hospital to protect nurses and patients exposed to the infection, with perfect success.' 'Morbillinum. As a prophylactic given to those who are, or may be, exposed to infection.' 'Lathyrus Sativa. Homoeopathic physicians are satisfied that they have a really safe and better polio preventative in Lathyrus Sativa when properly given'. Amongst the many examples of HP given by Sethi, he then quotes the experience of Drs Smith, Grimmer, Bond, and Foubister: 'Whooping Cough. Dr John H Clarke st rongly recommended Pertussin in whooping cough. In practice the results of Pertussin have been verified by Dr Dorothy Shepherd. Children who were given this medicine escaped the disease.' Lessell ( 1993 , p. 14) published a comprehensive travel manual giving advice as to both the treatment and prevention of dozens inf ectious diseases. He wrote that, 'Those Nosodes utilised for immunisation, correctly given, are immensely safe, virtually free from side effects, and may be given in pr egnancy and lactation. Alternatively, a remedy other than a Nosode may be given preventa tively which would be used to treat the disease in question (e.g., malaria). Such reme dies are also generally very safe. Safety and lack of side-effects thus characteri se the homoeopathic method. Homoeopathic remedies would seem to work by actively st imulating the immune system of the body in some way. The manner in which this occurs, however, has not been totally elucidated.' Lessell followed with numerous examples of the use of HP remedies against diseases that travellers may face. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 21The above review, citing practit ioners from different continents, shows that HP has been supported and used throughout the 200 year history of homoeopathy. However these references do not quantify the ex tent of support for HP among practicing homoeopaths. Research assessing the support for HP among Australian practitioners will be used to indicate the su pport for HP in general. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 222.4 Current Attitudes to and Use of Homoeoprophylaxis 2.4.1 Introduction The use of potentised substances for pr otection against infectious diseases (homoeoprophylaxis) is still a matter of deba te among some homoeopaths. Some believe that patients should be allowed to contract in fectious diseases and then be treated. They believe that the patient's long-term health will benefit most from this approach. Some express a concern that HP, whilst not being toxi c, may still have some suppressive effect on the immune system. These issues will be examined in Chapter 3 following. The following research described in the next section examines how common these opinions are among Australian practitioners, and quantifies the level of support for and use of HP by Australian homoeopaths. 2.4.2 Current Attitudes to and Use of Homoeoprophylaxis by Australian Homoeopathic Practitioners In order to ascertain how homoeopathic prac titioners view the use of HP, a survey of all Australian specialist homoeopathic associ ations was undertaken in 2001, and reported to the profession the following year (Golden 2002a, page 26). It was decided not to survey naturopathic associations, who ha ve relatively few members who specialise in homoeopathy, because results might have been significantly influenced by a great number of res ponses from non-specialist homoeopaths whose knowledge of HP would have been much less than those practitioners whose qualifications allowed them to join a specia list homoeopathic association. The specialist associations surveyed are shown in Table 2.4-1. They all require dedicated training in homoeopathy, typically leadi ng to a Diploma or Advanced Diploma qualification in homoeopathy. Batchelor Degrees in homoeopathy have only b een taught in Australia in the last few years, and a national compet ency standard only recently implemented. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 23 Practitioners were surveyed via their associations, as mailing lists are confidential, and the associations usually have up-to-date addre sses. In all, 532 questionnaires were sent out. Practitioners who belonged to more than one of the associations surveyed received multiple questionnaires. It was impossible to determine the exact number of multiple questionnaires sent to these pr actitioners, as Associations did not disclose membership lists. However, an allowance has been made for the 5 multiple responses found in the responses received. Further, associations tended to order ques tionnaires in rounded figures, and it is likely that some questionnaires would not have been used due to over- ordering. By 31.12.2001, 210 responses were received, repr esenting a response rate of 39.5% of questionnaires sent. The effective response rate would thus have been greater than 40% given multiple association membership and the over-ordering by associations. Nationally, the response rates were varied. NSW, Victoria and Tasmania recorded responses over 50%, whilst responses from WA and Queensland were below 30% and the response from SA was 8%. Responses from different associations were also very mixed. Response rates exceeding 40% were received from members of the Au stralian Medical Faculty of Homoeopathy and the Australian Homoeopathic Associ ation. Less than 20% of members of the Australian Association of Professional Homoeopaths Inc responded. A third of all members contacted who belonged to the Homoeopathic Education and Research Association [HERA] responded. The latter association was the only one whose executive did not assist the researcher, and members of HERA were identified in Yellow Pages listings and contacted directly. This may have affected the response rate. In order to analyse a \"majority\" view (i.e., States where more than 50% of eligible practitioners responded), the data were examined in three batches: (1) all 210 responses; (2) 156 responses from N.S.W., A.C.T., Vi ctorian and Tasmania (States where the Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 24response rate was above 50%); and (3) 54 re sponses from Queensland, W.A. and S.A. (States where the response rate was below 50%). In addition, two other profile s in the data were examin ed, (1) 100 responses from experienced homoeopaths who had been in practice for eight or more years; (2) 48 responses from practitioners who were not certai n about their use of HP, or who said they would not use HP. The questionnaire sent to practitioners is shown in Table 2.1-1, and the covering letter to professional associations in Table 2.1- 2 in Appendix 2. A schedule showing responses to the survey is shown in Table 2.4-1, and a summary of highlights is shown in Table 2.4- 2. The following conclusions may be drawn from these results: 1. Knowledge of HP . Whilst just 3% of respondents have never learned about HP, only one third had read Hahnemann's essay firs t describing his use of HP. Interestingly, of the 8 respondents who sa id they would never use HP, 6 had not read Hahnemann's essay. Further, of the 5 respondents who said it was not appropriate for a homoeopath to assist in the prevention of in fectious disease if requested by a patient, none had read Hahnemann's essay. 2. Use of HP . Half of all respondents currently use HP; three quart ers intend to use it in the future with 19% being unsure concerning future use. 3. HP and the Law of Similars . A majority of respondents believed that HP is based on the Law of Similars, 17% were unsure, and 24% believed it was not. Of the 51 respondents who believed HP was not based on the Law of Similars, 38 had not read Hahnemann's essay on HP. 4. Type of Prevention. Two thirds believed that HP should be used for both long- term and short-term prevention, 16% woul d use it only for short-term prevention, and 3% would never use it in any circumstance. 5. Opposed to any use of HP. 11 respondents (5.2% of the total respondents) answered \"yes\" to at least one of the following questions in the survey, thus Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 25indicating their opposit ion to the use of HP. They were respondents 13, 14, 72, 110, 123, 135, 142, 147, 151, 186, and 196. (i) Never use HP in any circumstances (Question 6) (ii) It is not appropriate for a homoe opath to assist in the prevention of infectious disease if reques ted by a patient (Question 7) (iii) A homoeopath should only treat infectious diseases once they have appeared, and should never assist in the prevention of infectious diseases (Question 8) Four of these eleven res pondents answered \"yes\" in tw o of the three questions, and one in all three. Of these eleven, one sa id he currently used HP, five said they would prevent diseases if requested, and four of these said they would prevent and not just treat. Thus only four practitioners were una mbiguously opposed to the use of HP under any circumstances. They were respondents 72, 110, 142 and 151. It is clear that HP enjoys considerable support among Australian homoeopaths, and is used by a majority of practitione rs who completed the survey. 2.4.3 Attitudes of Other Homoeopathic Practitioners to the Use of Homoeoprophylaxis As shown in section 2.3 above, homoeopath s from around the world have expressed positive opinions concerning HP. All of th e authors quoted in section 2.3 are well known to homoeopaths, and some are among the most highly regarded practitioners in the history of homoeopathy. The actual level of use of and support for HP in countries other than Australia has not been quantified. In countries where th e practice of homoeopathy is open to all persons who have undertaken professional trai ning, it is possible th at attitudes to HP would be similar to those in Au stralia. It is possible that in those countries that allow only orthodox doctors to practi ce homoeopathy some differen ces in the use of HP may Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 26exist. Only empirical research in other countries would be able to confirm actual levels of support. However it is clear that HP has been part of mainstream homoeopathy from its very beginning, that it has been used by the f ounder of homoeopathy as well as it's most distinguished practitioners. It has been shown in Australia that HP enjoys considerable support and a high level of use. It is pr obable that the experience in many other countries is similar. Despite two centuries of using HP, and cons iderable support and clinical experience reporting its value, there has been relativel y little research qua ntifying the level of effectiveness and safety of HP. The existing research (in English) will now be reviewed to provide a starting point fo r the original research desc ribed in Chapters 4 and 5.

However, most authors have not systematica lly collected data showing the effectiveness of HP. Some studies have examined the results of using HP for animals (MacLeod 1974, p. 30; Day 1987, p. 58; MacLeod, 1994). It was de cided, with one exception, to exclude these studies from this analysis as the research findings in Chapters 4 and 5 relate solely to humans, and animal studies may not directly relate to this experience. Further, the aim of this thesis is to determine not only the effectiveness of HP, but also its safety. The measures used for safety in the human experiments are not directly comparable to those made in animal studies. It is recomm ended that the study of HP in animals be made the subject of a separate analysis. The following material summarises nine refe rences published in English that have quantified a level of effectiveness for HP in humans. A summary of these nine studies is shown in Table 2.5-1. A tenth study is excl uded for the reasons explained below. [1] Ten doctors used Belladonna as a pr eventative against Scarlet Fever on 1,646 children, with only 123 cases of the di sease arising, an effectiveness of 92.5%. The disease had a reported attack ra te of around 90% (Dudgeon 1853, p, 541). [2] Eaton (1907, p. 5) collected the following figures from the Smallpox epidemic in the USA in the early 1900's (from which he deliberately excluded his experience with his own patients): Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 39 Persons given Variolinum 30 2806 Definite exposures after taking Variolinum 30 547 Smallpox cases after taking Variolinum 30 14 Effectiveness (proportion 14/547) 97.5%. [3] Taylor-Smith (1950, p. 65) investigated the use of the genus epidemicus remedy Lathyrus Sativus in the prevention of poliomyelitis. He followed two groups of patients comprising both children and adults. The fi rst group comprised 82 healthy individuals, the second 34 individuals who were already sick. Within the originally healt hy group, 12 children were definitely exposed to infection through direct contact with cases that had b een later proved to have had the disease. None of the 82 healthy individuals in the healthy group acquired th e disease indicating an effectiveness of 100%. [4] An investigation of systematic studies of the effectiveness of Influenzinum triple nosode by 21 homoeopathic physicians in three countries revealed a composite level of effectiveness of 86% (Gutman 1963, p. 185). A combined total of 385 persons were studied. [5] In August 1974 there was an epidemic of meningitis in Guarantingueta, Brazil. 18,640 children were given Meningococcinum 10CH, and 6,340 children were not covered. The following results were re ported (Castro and Nogeira 1975, p. 211): 18,640 protected homoeopathically 4 cases 6,340 not protected 32 cases Effectiveness 95.7%* * [(32 x 18640/6340)-4]/(32x18640/6340) [6] A pilot study of 61 children over five y ears on the effectiveness of Pertussin 30 showed a range of effectiveness from 95% based on confirmed cases of whooping cough down to 82.0% if unconfirmed cases were included (Fox 1987, p. 70). Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 40[7] Another pilot study of Pertussin 30 ex amined responses concerning 694 children who were given the remedy every three months during the first year of life, then at 18, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months of age. The study used whooping cough notifications in a local district health authority as a control. There were 59 definite cases (8.5%) and an additional 31 cases where diagnosis was uncertain, making 90 cases in total (13.0%). Thus effectiveness ranged between 87.0% and 91.5%. Additionally, doctor-diagnosed cases where children were given the w hooping cough vaccine or the vaccine plus Pertussin 30 were compared. However the author suggested that 4,000 subjects would have been needed to give a statistically acceptable result. (English 1987a, p. 65; 1987b, p. 68) [8] In another test of the remedy Meni ngococcinum, the remedy was given in a 30CH potency, to 65,826 people from 0 to 20 y ears of age in Blumenau, Brazil. Another 23,539 people in the area did not receive th e remedy. The rates of protection found in the group using HP were 95% in six months and 91% in 12 months. The authors noted that their use of Meningococcinum was not new and cited 12 references to its use from 1966 to 1996 (Mroninski et al., 1998, p. 234). [9] In 1997 Golden published the analysis of over 10 years of research into HP. During this period 1,305 questionnaires were collected from the parents of 593 children. Each questionnaire covered one year of a child's life, and some parents returned questionnaires for up to 8 years. Reports of disease were compared to the level of disease exposure reported by the parent s of the children studied. An average effectiveness of 88.9% was found in the study group. [10] The final study to be reviewed was repor ted as part of the Cochrane Review of randomised trials with placebo controls of the use of homoeopathic Oscillococcinum for preventing and treating influenza and influenza-like syndromes. The researchers examined three short-term studies undertaken during the flu season. The researchers concluded that 'Current evidence does not su pport a preventative effect of homoeopathy in infl uenza and influenza-like syndromes', and 'There is some Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 41evidence the prophylactic use of homoeopathy may lead to adverse events'. Because none of the studies they examined are availa ble in English, and because the actual levels of effectiveness were not recorded by the re searchers, no data from these trials can be recorded in Table 2.5-1 (Vickers and Smith 2001, p. 2). [11] In a different type of experiment , 142 laboratory mice were challenged with a potentially fatal dose of Francisella tularensis, a rapidly lethal organism. The experimental design was carefully cons tructed, and the results were rigorously analysed reporting a 22% effectiveness of HP comp ared to a control group. A vaccinated group showed a 100% effectiveness (Jonas 1999, p. 39). The Jonas study has been described as \"the best constructed study of homoeoprophylaxis\" (Hoover 2001, p. 173). This study, however, produced a result that demonstrated a level of effectiveness of HP significantly below that of vaccination, and significantly different to most other studies of HP. For this reason it is examined more closely. Despite his excellent study design, Jonas' e xperiment contained one major flaw that probably caused a reduction in the level of protection given to the HP group of mice-- the mice were given the HP remedy three times a week for 4 weeks before and 4 weeks after the challenge with Francisella tularensis . Administration of the Nosode 12 times in the month before exposure is higher than generally accepted homoeopathic practice. For example, Golden recommends no more than two doses a week for thre e weeks when there is definite exposure to pertussis, but less for other diseases (Golden 1998, p.139) . Twelve doses may have caused a \"proving\" effect in the mice (producing symp toms similar to the common symptoms of infection with Francisella tularensis ), something that could have lowered the susceptibility of the mice prior to challenge. Administration of the Nosode repeatedly after challenge is regarded as counter- indicated by experienced homoeopaths, since the Nosode generally is not the Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 42appropriate (or \"most similar\") remedy to be us ed in treatment of the acute phase of an illness. The \"similimum\" (the remedy produc ing symptoms most similar to the symptoms of each individual patient) is th e remedy that should be used in acute treatment. It is quite possibl e that these doses further weak ened the immune function of the mice. Possibly Jonas believed that \"more is better\" when it came to administering doses of the Nosode because \"nothing was in it\". Ho wever, experienced homoeopaths know that this is not the case with homoeopathic reme dies, and in fact \"more is worse\" is often found to be true. It would have been interest ing to see what the fate of the vaccinated mice would have been in Jonas' experiment if they had been given 24 doses of the conventional vaccine material be fore and after challenge. Jonas would need to re-run his experiment using one or maybe two doses of the Nosode in the month prior to challenge, and no doses following challenge, for the experiment to satisfy standard HP protocols. The human studies reported above show an average effectiveness of around 90%. This figure is consistent with the anec dotal evidence reporting a high level of effectiveness (Chapter 2.3 above). Despite the relevant criticisms of expe rimental design and statistical analysis reviewed in 2.5.3 below, and despite further weaknesses in some of the studies relating to the uncertainty of exposure to the diseas e, these results represent a considerable body of data that consistently suggests a str ong measurable prophylactic effect of HP. The figure of 90% effectiveness may be used as a benchmark against which to compare the results of the two pieces of new research conducted as part of this thesis, and reported in Chapters 4 and 5, where all of the flaws in the experiments reported in 2.5.3 below will be addressed, with varying degr ees of success. Whilst the 90% figure is not definitive, it is useful as a comparative figure against which to measure new results.

There are very few analyses of the safety of HP for a very simple reason - homoeopathically prepared remedies contai n no molecules of the original substance, and while some reactions may occur, there is no chance of toxic damage from using HP (unless there is some unexpected biological contamination of the remedy). This does not mean that reactions do not occur, but they cannot be reactions that result from toxic levels of exposure to th e prophylactic substance. This view certainly has support from well- known homoeopathic practitioners, as the following excerpts demonstrate: Shepherd (1967, p. 51): 'Inoculation with any type of serum in any of these infectious diseases is harmful and can eas ily and safely be replaced by a remedy or remedies, proved according to our Law of Similars.' Eizayaga (1991, pp. 283): 'In homoeopathy, with the Nosode of each of the acute diseases we could fulfil a job similar to the one achieved by the vaccines which are known, without any of their inconveniences.' Lockie (1989, p. 17): 'homoeopathic Nosodes utilis ed for immunisation, correctly given, are immensely safe, virtually free from side e ffects, and may be given in pregnancy and lactation.' The Cochrane Review study reported in 2.5.1 above, in contrast, noted some reactions to short-term HP remedies. It not ed 'The reported effects were mild (e.g., Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 45headache) and transient, and might be described by homoeopaths as a \"proving\" phenomenon.' (Vickers and Smith 2001, p. 7). The only published reference quantifying the level of reactions to a long-term HP program was by Golden (1997, p. 12), who repor ted reactions to HP of around 8.1% of people using his 1986 program, and 13.7% usin g the new program that was introduced in 1991. This would translate to a reaction rate of around 1.4% - 2.3% per individual dose (based on an assumed six doses per year). One finding of interest was the level of remedy reactions in children whose parents or grand-parents had been infected with th e disease that the remedy corresponded to. An example is the child who reacted to the remedy Diphtherinum, and whose father had had Diphtheria as a child (Golden 1998, p. 144). This may be viewed as a typical healing response experienced in normal homoeopathic treatment. Another significant finding relating to l ong-term safety was that the parents who used HP for their children frequently reported how healthy their children were over the term of the study, suggesting that HP in no way lessened the general health of their children (Golden 1997, p. 15). Part of the new research reported in Chap ters 4 and 5 also examined the level of reactions to Golden's HP program. The second part of this new re search analysed the link between the use of HP and the in cidence of certain chronic diseases. 2.5.3 Criticisms of the Research Methods of Quantitative Studies of HP The following criticisms of the quantitativ e HP studies will be used to test the methodological quality of the research reported in Chapters 4 and 5. Jonas stated that 'a crit ical assessment of nosode a nd literature reveals a va riety of major methodological flaws.' (Jonas 1999, p. 37). Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 461. low statistical power 2. uncertain methods of data collection 3. inadequate descri ption of the prepar ation being tested 4. lack of proper control groups 5. use of improper statistical methods 6. delivery of the SAD through routes that bypass normal immunosurveillance pathways of the organism. The sixth criticism relating to the route of delivery of SAD does not relate to the human trials reported above as it is appropria te to administer HP remedies orally, and this was the method used in all of the human trials as well as in the research reported in Chapters 4 and 5. Neustaedter (1990, p. 31) found: 1. lack of proper controls in most studies 2. incomplete, tentative or poorly reported results. Vickers and Smith (2000, pp. 5,7) reported: 1. incomplete information to allow full data extraction 2. inadequate details of exclusions and withdrawals 3. reporting bias for patient assessment 4. some methodological bias in reporting and data analysis 5. lack of statistical signif icance due to insufficient power. The authors suggested that tw o groups of 1,457 would be requ ired to give a minimal, clinically significant differen ce of 5% and a power of 90%. Finally, in a private communication with Golden concerning his 10 year study (Golden 1997), Kune identified 'some major pr oblems with interpretation of the data', including: 1. cohort far too small due to the risk of the disease or adverse reactions being very low. He recommended a case-cont rol design but acknowledged that it would be extremely difficult to obtain. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 472. possibly inadequate length of fo llow-up to ascertain effectiveness 3. responses by parents may be unreliable 4. no controls to compare data with (Kune 2002, p. 1). Most of the above procedural and reporting limitations are addresse d in the research reported in Chapters 4 and 5. An effective control group for assess ing effectiveness is found. However, the size of data collection is limited due to available resources, and the effect of this will be studied carefully to determine the impact on relevance of the data. 2.6 Concluding Comments on the Historical Use of Homoeoprophylaxis HP was first used by the founder of hom oeopathy, and in the 200 years following by many of homoeopathy's most esteemed practitioners. HP enjoys a high level of use and support among professional homoeopaths in Australia. Its support among practitioners in other countries has yet to be quantified. HP appears from the literature to offer a level of protection around 90%, and appears to be an extremely safe method of prevention against infectious dis eases, with a reaction rate of less than 2% per dose and no evidence of long-term adverse health consequences. In Chapter 3 the conceptual basis of HP will be reviewed, and in Chapters 4, 5 and 6, new research examining the effectiveness and safety of HP will be reported and discussed. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 483 The Conceptual Basis of Homoeoprophylaxis Chapter 2 reported the significant support for and use of HP over the last 200 years. It also showed that not all homoeopaths do support HP. In this chapter HP will be fully de fined and its methodology examined. Seven aspects of HP that have been questioned by some practitioners will be outlined and discussed. Finally, possible mechanisms of actions of HP will be reviewed. 3.1 The Concepts Supporting HP 3.1.1 The Definition of Homoeoprophylaxis Homoeoprophylaxis (HP) is the use of potentised substa nces in a systematic manner to prevent the development of the characteris tic symptoms of infectious diseases. The key words in this definition are: (i) potentised - the method of preparing substances that is specific to homoeopathic medicine was described in Chapter 2 above. If the substances are not potentised it is e xpected that the length of protection being offered by HP will be very brief, or zero. Clin ical experience in treatment with homoeopathically potentised remedies finds that the higher the potency the longer the duration of action of the dose . As may be expected, the same is apparently true for prevention (Eizayaga 1991, p. 284). (ii) systematic - the schedule of medici nes given in an HP program is not random. The medicines are chosen using the Law of Similars. The medicines are administered in a potency and frequency, designed by the homoeopath based on their own and historical expe rience with HP, to give a maximum protective effect with a minimum of doses. (iii) characteristic - the remedies used in a HP program are chosen because of their similarity to the common or char acteristic symptoms of the disease Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 49being targeted. If the patient does not experience these symptoms following disease exposure then the method has been successful. It is possible that the patient actually contracts the disease, but that the defence mechanism is so well prepared that the resulting symptoms are sub-clinical. This occurs in the real world every day as people are exposed to cold and flu viruses, glandular fever, and so forth, but devel op no symptoms of the disease. As stated above, medicines used in an HP program must be selected according to the Law of Similars. This Law can be re-written in term s of disease prevention in two ways [note that some material in this chapter is based on an earlier pres entation by the author (Golden 2001, p. 3)]: A. A substance that is capable of pr oducing in many healthy persons a group of symptoms similar to the characteristic sy mptoms of an infect ious disease, is capable of preventing those characteristic symptoms in most previously unprotected persons. For example, (1) Hahnemann's proving of Cinchona described in Chapter 2 above, which is a prophylactic for malaria; (2) Nosodes (homoeopathic potencies of diseased products) are furthe r examples of this application of the Law of Similars. For example, the remedy Morbillinum is made from measles virus. Obviously, the measles virus can cause the characteristic symptoms of measles. Thus, potencies of the virus (M orbillinum) can be us ed to prevent the characteristic symptoms of measles. The Law of Similars for preventi on may also be re-written as: B. A substance that is capable of remo ving the characteristic symptoms of an infectious disease in many infected patients is capable of preventing similar symptoms in most previ ously unprotected persons. For example, (1) Hahnemann's uses of Belladonna to both treat and prevent scarlet fever that was described in Ch apter 2 above; (2) the remedy Lathyrus Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 50Sativus that was used in potency in the 1950 polio epidemics by many homoeopaths to treat polio, can also be used for polio prevention. It has the advantage of covering the three main strains (Eisfelder, 1957a, page 147; 1957b, page 10; 1957c, page 167). Thus, the use of HP is entirely consistent with the fundamental principle or Law underlying homoeopathy - the Law of Similars. Some homoeopaths have never been taught that HP is consistent with the Law of Similars in terms of disease prevention. In the study of Australian practitioners described in Chapter 2 above it was show n that only 34.3% had read Hahnemann's original essay on HP, and less than 60% be lieved that HP is based on the Law of Similars. This is one reason why the use of HP is questioned by some homoeopaths today. 3.1.2 Methodology of Prophylaxis Homoeopaths have developed the thr ee methods of homoeoprophylaxis shown below. These methods have been thoroughly reviewed by Little (2000, pp. 1-12): (i) the constitutional remedy. (ii) the genus epidemicus. (iii) the similar Nosode. (i) The first method of homoeopr ophylaxis is the use of the constitutional remedy - a remedy chosen from those mental, emoti onal and physical symptoms that are unusual or peculiar to the individual patient. This remedy strengthens the vi tal force in a general manner by removing predispositions, increasing vitality and raising general immunity to stress and disease. This remedy offers some level of prevention against all diseases. Some homoeopaths believe that it forms the first line of defence against all forms of infectious disease, but clinical experience s hows that even very healthy people contract infectious diseases. The patient will always benefit from the constitutional remedy, but Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 51it alone will not always guar antee the highest level of im munity against a specified disease. (ii) The second method of homoe oprophylaxis is the use of the genus epidemicus remedy that is especially useful in offeri ng protection against acute epidemic diseases. This remedy is chosen by analysing the sy mptom patterns of a number of patients with the prevailing disease, and finding the remedy that best fits the majority of cases. For example, every \"flu season\" a different ge nus epidemicus appears, and is useful treatment for most patients dur ing that particular season, as well as being an effective preventative. It of course should be comb ined with sensible infection avoidance procedures. (iii) The third method of homoe oprophylaxis is the use of the similar Nosode. In this method a Nosode of the targeted disease is given as a preventative to that disease. Homoeopathic Nosodes have a wider band of action than orthodox va ccines since they only need to be able to produce similar symptoms, which differing strains of an infectious disease often do. For example, the remedy Meningococcinum has a protective effect against meningococcal disease because the symptom picture of the remedy is similar to the symptom pi cture of the disease (Mr oninski et al., 1998, p. 234). Mroninski et al., 1998, p. 234). HP may be used both for short-term prev ention and long-term prevention. These two possible uses, together with the three methods described above, make six possible types of use: 1. Short-term prevention using the constitutional remedy. 2. Long-term prevention using the constitutional remedy. 3. Short-term prevention using the genus epidemicus. 4. Long-term prevention using the genus epidemicus. 5. Short-term prevention using the similar Nosode. 6. Long-term prevention using the similar Nosode. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 52The research into a specific HP program re ported in Chapters 4 and 5 examines uses 4 and 6 above. The General Health Survey also reported in Chapters 4 and 5 examines all six possible uses, with particular emphasis being on uses 2, 4 and 6. Thus long-term prevention is the focus of the research undertaken in this Thesis. This is a necessary result of the need to examine th e possible relevance of HP to public health policy where vaccination is primarily used fo r long-term prevention. In acute outbreaks of, for example, Meningococcal disease, HP has established its value both historically and in recent large-s cale experiences (Castro and N ogeira 1975, p. 219 ; Mroninski et al., 1998, p. 234). 3.2 Some Conceptual Questions Concerning HP As stated above, not all homoeopaths agree with the use of potentised substances to prevent infectious diseases. It was shown in Chapter 2 a bove that in Australia these practitioners are in the minority. However, it is appropriate to address the questions and concerns they raise. If HP is a legitimate therapeutic option, then it should be able to withstand both conceptual and practical scrutiny. Seven different aspects of HP that are questioned by some homoeopaths are now examined. 3.2.1 Treatment, Not Prevention Some opponents of HP argue on conceptual grounds that we should not use HP to prevent infectious diseases. They argue that patients should be treated constitutionally to build up general vitality, and this will also provide an increased level of immunity. Further, if the patien t acquires an infectious disease th en his or her symptoms should be treated according to the Law of Similars, thus ensuring that the patient's Vital Force is given the most appropriate help to both remove the disease and develop a strong and active immune system (Neustaedter 1995, p. 30). Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 53There is some agreement that acquiring some infectious diseases may be beneficial to the normal maturation of a child's immune system. The so called \"hygiene hypothesis\" states that a lower level of exposur e to bacteria and fewer infectious diseases in childhood results in an increase in asthma, eczema and allergic diseases in later years. The hypothesis is controvers ial, with support from orthodox medicine (Matricardi et al, 2002; Bra un-Fahrlander et al, 2002), yet with questionable validity (Dahl et al, 2004). However there is little if any evidence th at demonstrates that every child needs to acquire every disease in order to be healthy. In fact, there is ample evidence that infectious diseases may create \"layers\" of distress in otherwis e apparently healthy persons, for example those patients \"never well since\" measles, glandular fever, pertussis, etc., who are commonly enc ountered in homoeopathic practice. Further, it can be argued that if the stimul ation caused by an infectious disease is beneficial, then the similar stimulation on the subtle level provided by the remedies will be similarly beneficial but without the risks sometimes a ssociated with the natural disease. Vaccines are manufactured to attempt a stim ulation of antibodies without the risk of the natural disease. HP does not work on the antibody level, and therefore the two methods should not be thought of as compar able. They are two distinctly different methods of disease prevention. Hahnemann spoke of his desire to prevent th e suffering arising from scarlet fever. Anyone who has treated a tiny in fant with pertussis would be aware of the potential for suffering there. And so on. So while we should not fear every disease, many would agree that some disease prevention is called for. In practice, many parents would insist on this. Because the correct use of HP also accords with the Law of Similars, it is not inferior conceptually to the \"treat-don't-prevent\" position. There is no evidence that HP Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 54adversely affects the patient, and in fact evidence is presented in Chapter 5 following that HP may be beneficial to the recipient's general health. In practice, not all patients have immedi ate access to an experienced homoeopath who can confidently treat pertussis, polio, etc. This opportunity will vary both between and within countries. It is a further and major reason why the \"treat-don't-prevent\" position is impractical at times. Further, in practice many parents (and practit ioners) simply do not accept that their children should be allowed to develop all inf ectious diseases. Whilst it is appropriate for a practitioner to suggest altern atives, the final choice of tr eatment or prevention should belong to the parents, not to the practitioner. A parent ca n do no more for his or her own children than carefully research available options and then do what he or she believes is best for their child. Many parents would plac e pertussis in a tiny infant, polio, tetanus and Hib meningitis in the categor y of diseases worth preventing. Some practitioners believe that parents shoul d not have the final say in the treatment of their children. They believe that practit ioners should not accomm odate the wishes of parents when they differ with the practitioner's own views. These practitioners exist both in orthodox and traditional medicine. There are situations where complying with patients' requests could be irresponsible or illegal, but in the present context it is more likely that differen ces are due to opinion. Thus some practitioners may cause parents to be left with no acceptable option, or to accept with great misgivings the practitione r's opinion. Neither result is satisfactory, and the practitioner's preparedness to refer to a colleague who can accommodate the patient's needs is essential at such times. In conclusion, if both practitioner and patient feel mo st comfortable with the \"treat- don't-prevent\" approach, it certainly is a legitimate one. However, it in no way invalidates the appropriate use of HP. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 553.2.2 Epidemics Only Some practitioners acknowledge the use of HP by Hahnemann and others, and point out that this use occurred mainly at times of epidemics. They conclude that the use of a preventative remedy during an outbreak of a disease is the only legitimate form of HP. They usually endorse the use of the genus epidemicus remedy, but that issue will be considered in the following section. Practitioners' use of HP in epidemic situations demonstrates agreement that some disease prevention is appropriate. However, in many communities measles and pertussis are constantly present. Hib is becoming incr easingly common. In countries where oral polio vaccine is used, exposure to this disease is constant due to the virus being excreted by recipients. In such situations, when should HP be used? The difficulty with the \"epidemics only\" position is that we can never know in advance when some patients will be exposed to diseases that are c onstantly circulating in the community, thus the level of protection offered will be signifi cantly lower than if there is routine coverage. If the \"epidemics only\" position is adopted, some children will have to fall ill before protection can be offered to others. This will not be acceptable to many parents. There is a logical inconsistency in the \"epidemics only\" approach. On the one hand, proponents believe that a diseas e should be prevented, but on the other hand, they must allow some children to be infected to remain true to this approach. Thus, the \"epidemics only\" position does not prove that long-term HP prevention is either impossible or inappropriate. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 563.2.3 The Genus Epidemicus Only A variant of the \"epidemic only\" ap proach is the argument that the genus epidemicus of a current outbreak is the only suitable remedy according to the Law of Similars. Its use certainly is consistent with position B noted in 3.1.1 above. However, position A noted in 3.1.1 above shows that the genus epidemicus is not the only remedy suitable to use for HP purposes. Th e use of the relevant Nosode as well as other \"similar\" remedies is also acceptab le in terms of the Law of Similars The advantage of the using the Nosode is that it does not rely on waiting until a number of patients have succumbed to the out break, which is what is required to allow the genus epidemicus remedy to be worked out. The Nosode may be given in advance of an outbreak, thus providing y ear-round protection. All that is needed to defend the long- term use of Nosodes is to show that they are safe and effective, and this will be demonstrated in Chapter 5. Further, a genus epidemicus from previous outbreaks of the disease may be used for long-term prevention if the characteristic symptoms of the current disease are similar to those of the previous outbreak. For example, the remedy Lathyrus Sativus was used successfully for both treatment and prevention in the polio epidemics in the 1950's (Eisfelder 1957a, p. 147; 1957b, p. 10; 1958, p. 167). The remedy appears to cover the characteristic symptoms of the current strains of polio, and therefore may be used as a long-term HP preventative against polio. Thus there is no reason either conc eptually or practically why the genus epidemicus of a current outbreak is th e only legitimate HP remedy. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 573.2.4 Nosodes and Isodes Some authors have - incorrectly, I belie ve - labelled HP as \"Isode therapy\". An Isode may be defined as a remedy prepared from the patient's OWN diseased material, e.g., a remedy prepared from a whooping-cough patient's own sputum. This definition is not uniformly accepted in the literature (Gaier 1991, pp. 290-309), but it the most useful definition for the purposes of this discussion. HP is clearly not Isode therapy as the patients' own diseased tissue is not used in any of the three types of HP outlined in 3.1.2 above. Some label HP as \"Nosode therapy\". It is only necessary to refer back to Hahnemann's use of Belladonna to prevent scarle t fever to see that the use of Nosodes is not an essential part of the use of HP. Howe ver, Nosodes are the remedies of choice in many situations for one simple reason - they most obviously satisfy the requirement of position A of the Law of Similars stated in 3.1.1. Some object that Nosodes are \"the same\" rather than \"the most similar\" remedy, and thus breach the Law of Similars. This obj ection would hold true only if Isodes were used, and they are not. Some practitioners fear using Nosodes, possibly because they are derived from material that is not benign (unlike most herbs and minerals from which many homoeopathic remedies are deri ved). Yet the original antigenic material used to prepare Nosodes is no more toxic than some venom, aci ds, or other materials that are frequently used in potency by all practitioners. Nosodes prepared in homoeopathic potenci es above 12c contain no molecules of the original diseased material, and are non toxic. If they are administered correctly, Nosodes are no more \"dangerous\" energeti cally than any other homoeopathically potentised remedy. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 58Finally, it must be remembered that the us e of Nosodes is not essential in an HP program, which may be designed using non-Nosode remedies selected according to the Law of Similars. 3.2.5 The Risks of Homoeoprophylaxis Some homoeopaths suggest that the long- term, non-epidemic use of HP exposes patients to unknown risks of disturbing thei r energetic health. They oppose the use of remedies when there may be no current expos ure to the related di sease, and when the patient is not unwell and thus not calling for the remedy based on presenting symptoms (Neustaedter 1990, pp. 31,32). The concern of such practitioners relates to potential damage to the subtle energy bodies (sometimes referred to the \"mental\" and \"emotional\" bodies) of patients taking HP remedies. They acknowledge that any poten tial risks that may exist do not relate to possible toxicological damage fr om antigenic material, adjuva nts or preservatives, all of which are used in orthodox vaccines When we examine current homoeopathic prac tice, we find that one situation where healthy people are given remedies when they are not indicated for treatment purposes is during homoeopathic provings. It is gene rally agreed that provided remedy administration is stopped once proving symptoms develop, no harm is done to the provers. In his footnote to Aphorism 141, Hahnemann stated that one way to improve general health is to undertake regular provings (Hahnemann 1843, p. 210). It may be argued that more remedies are given during the course of an HP program than would be taken in a series of provings over a year. However if HP doses are not given past the point of symptoms being developed, there appears to be no reason conceptually or practically why su ch dosing should cause problems. Further, the design of the HP program can address risk concerns, for example different remedies are given over a 12 month period in Golden's HP program, not Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 59repeated doses of the same remedy as in provings. HP doses are taken no more frequently than monthly. Indi vidual remedies are given no more frequently than every 10 months, and are given either as a singl e dose or as a triple dose over 24 hours. Parents are instructed to stop administration of remedies if reactions occur. Thus the chance of dynamic damage due to over-prescription is remote. It is shown in Chapter 5 that fewer th an 9.2% of children using Golden's HP program develop some reactions to the remedies. This translates to less than 1.6% of reactions per dose. Most immediate reactions are mild and temporary, and the long-term health of children is in no way weakened, according to the clinical evidence. This suggests that long-term energetic damage is not caused by Golden's HP program. Some opponents of HP argue that there may be very deep \"constitutional\" changes that are neither immediately obvious, nor apparent after a decade. However, objective evidence of systematic long-term damage arising from a properly administered HP program is yet to be presented. The practical evidence presented in Chapter 5 suggests that HP poses no risk to constitutional health. Some practitioners offer anecdotal evidence from their own personal experience with one or a few patients who have used long- term HP, where the patient was generally unwell. Such isolated experience must be compared to the systematic collection of evidence from thousands of patients over 15 ye ars that is analysed in Chapter 5. No such comparable evidence exists to show any long-term adverse health effects of an appropriate HP program. 3.2.6 Prevention or Palliation Some practitioners have suggest ed that HP does not preven t infectious disease, but rather reduces the severity of any infection often to the point where clinical symptoms are not obvious. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 60Thus, children may not develop any obvious symptoms when exposed to a disease. Or they may, for example, develop those primary-stage disease symptoms common to many infectious diseases (e.g., sore throat, mucus discharges, elevated temperatures, headaches, etc.,), but not the characteristic sy mptoms of the disease. This idea raises a number of interesting possibilities. If infection does occur but symptoms ar e rendered mild, then those who oppose HP on the basis that it stops the normal matura tion of the immune system by preventing individuals acquiring natural diseases presumably will be appeased. Some may try to argue that fewer sympto ms following exposure/infection means that the immune system is not working efficien tly, and conclude that HP suppresses the immune response. However the practical exampl es we have of the type of suppression that causes a feeble response to infectious challenges, typically occur in heavily medicated or deeply unwell people. There is no evidence that HP leads to a lower state of health; in fact, the reverse appears to be true. In practice we observe that ma ny people who use an appropriate HP program do not develop any characteristic symptoms of a di sease after a definite exposure to it. The question becomes - can a person who develops no characteristic symptoms after definite exposure be said to have b een infected by the disease? An examination of antibody levels in apparently uninfected patients both before and after definite exposure to a disease would help to answer this question. It appears likely that there would be an increase in an tibody levels in at least some cases. An attempt to make such an examination was considered when planning this thesis. It did not proceed due to the perceived diffi culty in obtaining subjects because of the possible trauma to infants from the blood te sts required to determine antibody levels, and the understandable reluctance of parents to put their infants through such trauma. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 613.2.7 The Length of Prevention One criticism that applies to HP, as it does to all types of immunisation, is that the level of and duration of protec tion is not known with complete certainty. With vaccination and with HP it is possible that protection may extend over some decades, but the recipient will be unprotected in adult years when some diseases may be more virulent than in the pre-teen years. It is also true that the exclusive use of constitutional remedies does not guarantee protection against specific infectious diseases at any age. Even the most certain form of protection - acquiring the disease itself - is not 100% effective over a long term as very occasionally some people acquire measles or whooping cough twice. However this factor does remain the most compelling argument supporting the 'treat don't prevent' position. However, if protection against a particular di sease is required in infancy, then parents are faced with a dilemma. Doing nothing now w ill leave their infant with a reduced level of protection against the disease, yet because there is no option, whether disease-specific or constitutional, that can guara ntee that the recipien t will not lose some level of immunity later in life, then protection now may render their infant less protected when they become an adult, compared to a person w ho acquired the disease as a child. If the long-term HP program allows an infant , if exposed to a disease, to acquire a sub- clinical case of disease, as discussed in 3.2.6 above, then th e perfect solution is obtained. Antibodies will be formed to give additional long-term prot ection, yet short-term distress will be minimised. If this is not the mechanism involved, then the only other option for those parents desiring protection for their ch ildren in infancy and beyond is to ensure that HP boosters are given regularly. For exampl e, Chauvanon's experience with the Schick test suggests that a booster every ten years should be sufficient to provi de ongoing protection for most people (Eizeyaga 1991, p. 284). Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 623.3 The Mechanism of Action of Homoeoprophylaxis In practice, many people decide to use hom oeopathy to treat disease firstly because they believe it is safe and relatively effec tive when administered correctly and secondly because it is conceptually consistent with unchanging Laws of Nature. The precise mechanism of action cannot be explained in terms consistent with current scientific knowledge (although this will almost certainly change in the future). Experience also shows that HP is safe and relatively effective when administered correctly, and is conceptually consistent w ith unchanging Laws of Nature. At present it cannot be explained using orthodox scientific terminology, and in fact works quite differently to the antibody-stimulation model used by allopaths. Some homoeopaths object to the use of HP because its mechanism of action cannot be explained in orthodox terms, but this can be s een to be illogical gi ven that their use of homoeopathic treatment that is also \"scientifically\" unproven (Neustaedter 1995, p. 30; Golden and Neustaedter 1996, p. 28). Previous attempts to suggest a model for the action of HP have been made (Golden 1987, pp. 3-10; Golden 1989a, pp. 69-76; Traub 1994, pp. 50-61). Two models of the mechanism of action of HP are discussed below - the idiosyncrasy model and the proving model. Both are speculat ive, but both provide further insight into why the results observed in practice do occur. 3.3.1 The Idiosyncrasy Model of Protection The idiosyncrasy model proposes that the m echanism of action of HP can be explained in terms of it ability to change the level of idiosyncrasy or sensitivity of recipients to the energetic stimulus of various infectious diseases. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 63To give a specific example, we find in practice that if a patient is sensitive to the physical and dynamic stimulus of the Rhus tree, then by taking appr opriate potencies of Rhus Tox the patient will be rendered less sensitive to this stimulus. More generally, the idiosyncrasy model argu es that a patient may be rendered less idiosyncratic, or sensitive, to the physical and dynamic stimul us of any other substance - including viral and bacterial ma terial - by taking either a pot ency of the material (the Nosode) or of a substance that is similar in its symptom picture (the genus epidemicus ). It is important to consider the order in which contagion occurs. Simply put, the antibody response is the third lin e of defence. The immune m echanisms in the respiratory and GIT tracts are the second line. Homoeopaths believe that the first line of defence is an energetic one, and that if the person is not susceptible to the dyna mic stimulus of the infecting agent then the physical symptoms that we call the disease will not appear. We know that simple exposure to, for example, a measles virus does not guarantee infection in all \"unprotected\" people. For example, European s brought what were to them simple diseases to the South Sea Islands. Many islanders died, many caught the disease, but there also was a significant minority who escaped infection. There were no vaccines at the time, and the diseases had never appear ed in their communiti es so there were no circulating antibodies. Because of their comm unal lifestyle we know there would have been widespread exposure. So what protected the minority? Homoeopaths believe that the first effect of, for example, the measles virus is the action of the energy of the virus upon the en ergy body of the exposed patient. If the virus- specific dynamic defences are strong at that poi nt, the effect of the physical viral material will be minimal (as with the influence of th e Rhus Tox material on non-allergic people). Every person is more or less susceptible to every substance on this planet. Most people are not highly susceptible to most things (oth erwise we would be in a constant state of \"allergic\" stress). HP renders patients less susceptible to specific influences; however HP will never be completely effective because the idiosyncrasy of some people is so strong that they remain hypersensitive to certain st imuli for most of their lives (e.g., people who Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 64are infected more than once by diseases wher e lifelong immunity usua lly results after the first infection). In some other cases exposure will be so intense and constant that initially strong defences will weaken and fail. Repeated doses of the HP remedy at such times are definitely indicated. Thus the appropriate use of HP does not appear to suppress diseases . Instead, the dynamic idiosyncrasy of the individual to speci fic substances (viral and bacterial antigens) is changed. If suppression did occur, then th e general health of the recipient would be expected to deteriorate due to the weakeni ng of the immune system. All the practical evidence we have, as well as th e results reported in Chapter 5, suggest that general health may even improve using HP, making the likelihood of suppression remote. In summary, according to the idiosyncratic model of HP, when a patient is exposed to an antigenic stimulus various reactions occur. The disease is effectively \"prevented\" when the antigen-specific part of the general vital force is stronger than the dynamic strength of the antigenic stimulus, i.e., the patient is not idiosyncratic (sensitive) to the antigenic stimulus. HP changes the antigen-specific part of th e vital force, rendering the recipient less idiosyncratic or sensitive to the antigen, thus effectively pr eventing the occurrence of the characteristic physical sy mptoms of the disease. 3.3.2 The Proving Model of Protection The philosophical model supporting the \"epide mics only\" approach discussed earlier is based on the assertion that the genus epidemicus or the Nosode given during an epidemic creates a proving, i.e., an artificial disease state whose characteristic symptoms are very similar to the characteristic symptoms of the natural disease. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 65Hahnemann observed and demonstrated that tw o similar diseases cannot exist in the system at the same time (Hahnemann, 1843). Th e stronger will either repel or replace the weaker, depending upon which disease comes first and which second. So the \"proving model\" of protection argues that if we cr eate a sufficiently st rong proving state, the natural disease will be repelled when the patient is exposed to it. Supporters of the \"epidemics only\" approach further argue that because it is not desirable to continue a provi ng state over a long period, the method should only be used when there is danger of exposure in an epidemic situation. So the \"proving model\" does offer a po ssible alternative e xplanation of the mechanism of action of HP. However, it is unlikely that a patient would continue proving a remedy for many years, especially if under long-term homoeopathic treatment or exposed to antidoting forces. Thus, the observed fact that the protective effect of HP can continue for many years makes it appear that the \"proving model\" is not sufficient to fully explain the mechanism of action of HP. 3.3.3 Concluding Comments on the Mec hanism of Action of HP At the present state of knowledge, it app ears that the mechanism of action of HP cannot be - or at least has not been - explained in terms of orthodox science. It is likely that science will continue to expand its know ledge base, as it has over centuries, and eventually will provide an explanation for the mechanism of action of HP in terms of its own paradigm, It must also be remembered that in or thodox medical science, methods of treatment have been used without a complete mech anism of action being understood. The case of Asprin is a relevant example. It was used for decades before its mechanism of action was understood. Orthodox practitioners accepted its effectiveness based on clinical observation, and thus its use continued. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 66 The mechanism of action of HP can only be discussed in conceptual terms which may seem inadequate to those who do not accept the concepts associated with the human energy field, from which homoeopathic science derives. However, as with Asprin, the safety and e ffectiveness of HP has been observed in the clinical setting over centuries of use. If those in ort hodox science who supported the use of Asprin and other such \"unproven\" medicine s are to be consistent they would accept the continued use of HP based on the eviden ce supporting its safety and effectiveness. 3.4 Concluding Comments on the Conceptual Basis of Homoeoprophylaxis Based on the review of the literature as well as Go lden's own experience and research, it appears that a pr operly constructed HP program is conceptually consistent with the fundamental Laws underpinning homoeopathy, in particular the Law of Similars and the Law of Minimum Dose. The concerns and criticisms voiced in the homoeopathic literature about HP can all be answered, with one exception. The length of protection of HP is unknown and this limitation of HP may lead to an individual be coming susceptible to an infectious disease later in life. This criticism, though, applies to every me thod of disease prevention. Some people even contract the same in fectious disease twice. Thus, no approach to disease prevention is ei ther conceptually or practically perfect in terms of effectiveness and safety. The conceptual basis of HP, however, is consistent with homoeopathic principles, and appears from the homoeopathic literatur e to offer a reasonably effective and non- toxic method of protection agai nst infectious diseases. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 67 In Chapters 4 and 5 research into the effectiveness and safety of HP will be presented, and the findings will be discussed in Chapter 6. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 68 PART 3: RESEARCH METHODS, RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 69Introduction to Part 3 Part 3 of the thesis is divide d into the following three parts: Chapter 4 Research Methods Chapter 5 Results Chapter 6 Discussion of Results The following flow chart shows the chronolog ical progression of data collection and analysis from 1986 when distribution of ques tionnaires to parents using Golden's HP program began, to 2003 when final data colle ctions for both the HP program and the General Health Survey were made, and analysis of data undertaken. Whilst the collection of data was undertaken to establish figures for the effectiveness and safety of HP, and was continuous from 1986 to 2003, the description of research methods and results will be made in three parts: 1. The Initial HP Data Collection 2. The Second HP Data Collection 3. The General Health Survey. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 70 1986 - Data collection began for people using Golden's HP Program. 1997 - 10 years HP data analysed showing 89% effectiveness, less than 2% reactions per dose, and high long-term safety. Weaknesses in analysis identified. 1998 - New 5-year HP data collection and analysis period begins, to expand data base and to rectify weaknesses identified in the analysis of 10 year data. 2001 - Follow-up questionnaires for HP non-respondents study begins. - Distribution of questionnaires for the General Health Survey begins to provide comparative data on the safety and effectiveness of HP. 2002 - Completion of survey of non-respondents to HP study. - Survey of homoeopathic practitioners' use of HP - Collection of General Health Survey questionnaires. 2003 - Final data collection for 5-year HP study, plus survey of selected parents to confirm exposure to disease, and diagnosis of disease. - Final data collection of General Health Survey - Analysis of all data. FLOWCHART OF CHRONOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF RESEARCH Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 714 Research Methods 4.1 Initial Research of a Specifi c Homoeoprophylaxis Program Golden first prepared a five-year HP progr am in 1986 after resear ching the topic in the homoeopathic literature. The original pr ogram was changed in 1991 due to clinical experience suggesting that \"t riple doses\" (three doses in 24 hours), usually using ascending potencies (200; 1,000; 10,000) would lessen the possibility of accidental antidoting of the remedies given (due to erro rs in the administrati on of a dose), and offer longer and more effective protection (Golden 1990). The program currently is delivered to pa tients in the form of a program of 20 different medicines with comprehensive instructions. The program recommends 28 doses (a \"triple dose\" being regarded as a one dose) of various medicines to be taken over 5 years, each dose being spaced at least one month apart. HP remedies are provided to offer pr otection against Whooping Cough, Diphtheria, Tetanus, Polio, Measles, Mumps and Hib Me ningitis. The suggested dates of remedy administration begin at one month of age, but instructions guide parents of children who are older than one month. The current program and the original progr am, both consisting of remedy schedules called a \"Main Program\" and a \"Supplementary Program\", are described in detail in Appendix 1 in the Tables 1.1-1 to 1.1-6. 4.1.1 Research Design of Initial Research The specific HP programs described above were researched using a prospective longitudinal trial of child ren using the programs. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 724.1.1.1 The Study Population Given that Epidemiology may be viewed as based on two fundamental assumptions, namely that human disease does not occur at random and that it has causal and preventive factors that can be identified through the systematic investigation of different populations or subgroups of individuals with in a population in different places or at different times, this survey was a populat ion-based study where all children whose parents received Golden's HP program from 1st March 1986 to 28th February 1996 were eligible for inclusion. The total number of eligib le children is unknown due to incomplete records of HP programs supplied. It is estimated that approximately 2,000 programs were directly distributed to parents by Golden with others being supplied to prac titioners for use with their own patients. 4.1.1.2 The Study Design Use of questionnaires is an essential ep idemiological tool. The study was a self administered, annually requested, questionnai re based study completed by parents of the participating children and returned by post. Each questionnaire covered the preceding year of the child's life and asked questions relating to the child's experience with th e program, including a ny reactions to the medicines in the program, the child's exposur e to infectious diseases, and his or her infectious disease history. A general ques tion inviting any other comments was also included (see Appendix 1, Tables 1.2-1 and 1.2-2). Only infectious diseases c overed by the remedies in the HP program were studied. The first questionnaire was given to parent s when they purchased a program, and is shown in Table 1.2-1 of Appendix 1. They were asked to complete and return a questionnaire for each child in the February that fell at least 12 months following the Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 73acquisition of the program. Th ese questionnaires were allo cated into 10 groups (Series 1-10). The first annual questionnaires were collected for ten years on 28th February 1988 through to 28th February 1997. A similar follow-up questionnaire was sent every subsequent February to those parents who returned a prior year's questionnaire, and is shown in Table 1.2-2 of Appendix 1. Subsequent annual quest ionnaires were collected on 28th February 1989 through to 28th February 1997. An analysis of the 10-year data collection to 28 th February 1997 comprising 1,305 responses was published (Golden 1997). 220 further returns were accepted as part of this study from 1 st March 1997 to 31st May 2003. Epidemiological findings are often based partly or completely on responses to questionnaires which are used extensively for collecting information on exposures, outcomes, modifiers and confounders. The ad equate preparation of the questionnaires in the study of this thesis wa s thus essential for the quality of the data expected. The attention given to the development of the questionnaire and its validation was paramount for its eventual implementation, noting specifically design, population selection and sampling biases. The research upon which this thesis is ba sed represents primarily and observational design with some prospective elements, but without a concomitant comparison group recruited similarly from the community. G ood observational data is often needed to provide the foundation for the design of randomized controlled trials. Among the major aims of epidemiology has be en to describe the health status of populations, to explain the aetiology of disease, to predict diseas e occurrence and hence to control the distri bution of disease (Rothman and Greenland, 1998). Associations between the causes and the occurrence of dis ease can be discovered from investigations into case studies, by experimental laborat ory studies and by fiel d studies that add a distinct descriptive profile to the data. These studies are based on direct personal investigator observations that ma y relate an outcome of interest to an anatomical part or Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 74physiological process which even though it can be systematically quantified remains at best qualitative in nature. Although these observations can be extremely intensive and of great detail, the inherent di sadvantage is that they are subjective in their very nature and therefore subject to some degree of va riation between cases studies (Susser 1973). Studies in which validity is less secure have been often referred to as hypothesis generating studies to distingui sh them from the so called analytic studies in which validity may be better. Approaches for connecting observations and theories have been studied by philosophers since the beginning of the last century (Kuhn, 1970; Pearson 1937; Popper 1960). In recent years, it has become incr easingly evident th at the science of epidemiology has inherent limits. Alt hough epidemiology is very effective in identifying strong links between an environmen tal factor and a disease (for example, the link between smoking and lung cancer), it is less effective in discerning weaker associations. Observational studies have several importa nt roles in medical research. They are often the first foray into a new disease or area of inquiry\u2014the first scientific step toward understanding a relationship between a factor an outcome of interest (Hulley SB, et al , 2001). They document the health of populat ions and often prompt more rigorous studies. Since observational studies are often reporte d, clinicians need to know their uses, strengths, and weaknesses. An observationa l study is very much concerned with and designed only to describe the existing distribut ion of variables, wit hout regard to causal or other hypotheses (Fletcher and Fletcher, 1979). Further, obse rvational studies are often the first, tentative approach to a ne w event or condition. These studies generally emphasise features of a new disease or assess the health status of communities. Health administrators use descriptive studies to monitor trends and plan for resources. By contrast, epidemiologists and clinicians gene rally use observational reports to search for clues of cause of disease\u2014i.e., generation of hypotheses. In this role, observational studies are often a springboard into more rigorous studies with comparison groups. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 75Common pitfalls of observational reports include an absence of a clear, specific, and reproducible case definition, and interpretations that overstep the data. Studies without a comparison group do not allow conclusions about cause of disease. However without them many hypotheses would never be generate d or subsequently tested for validity. This study allows for the generation of a hypothesis that the use of an appropriate long-term HP program can provide a level of protection against targeted infectious diseases without incurring long-term weakeni ng of the recipients overall wellbeing. 4.1.1.3 Selection Bias In epidemiological studies selection bias is a distortion in a m easure of association (rate ratio, risk ratio, or odds ratio). Selection bias usually occurs as a result of either using improper procedure for obtaining persons from the target population to become members of the study population or as a re sult of factors that influence continued participation of subjects in a study. Selecti on bias occurs when the association between exposure and disease is different for those who complete a study compared with those who are in the target population, the overall population for which the measure of effect is being calculated and from whic h study members are selected. There are different sources of bias and these include: Selective health outcomes and losses to fo llow-up - After enrolment of subjects and collection of baseline data there is usually some loss to follow-up with some individuals dropping out of the study. This biases the study when the association between risk factor and disease differs in dropouts compared with study participants . Volunteer and non-response bias - Indi viduals who volunteer for a study may possess different characteristics than the aver age individual in th e target population. Individuals who do not respond to requests to be studied genera lly have different baseline characteristics than responders. Bias will be introduced if the association between exposure and disease differs between study volunteers and non-responders. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 76 Further, selection bias will occur as a resu lt of the procedure used to select study participants when the selection probabili ties of exposed and unexposed cases and controls from the target popul ation are differential and not proportional. This can occur when exposure status influences selection. Recall bias may arise because individuals with a particular exposure or adverse health outcome are likely to remember their experiences from those who are not similarly affected. Although it is very difficult to determine prec isely the impact of a potential source of bias actually has on estimate of effect it remains crucial to attempt to identify the magnitude as the direction of the bias for any estimate. In the study of this thesis bias may have been present due to al l questionnaire returns being voluntary, and reflected each parent's in terest in participating in the research, as well as their intellectual ability to understand and be able to comple te a questionnaire. It also reflected each parent's ability to keep th e questionnaire for at least a year, or ability to receive forwarded mail when they changed address during that period. Bell and others have described the potent ial for bias due to participants in homoeopathic trials being also regular users of homo eopathy, and therefore more healthy in general (Bell et al, 2004, pp. 269-283). This bias appears not to be a significant factor in this study as it has been observed anecdotally that the clear majority of children using the HP program being st udied in this thesis had never used homoeopathic treatment prev iously (Golden, 2002a, p. 27). There is potential bias in figures for both di seases and exposure to diseases due to the information being based on parent's opini ons. The follow up questionnaires sent to parents in the Second HP Study were designed to minimise this bias (see Appendix 1, Tables 1.4-1 and 1.4-2). Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 77The potential bias due to non-responses was addressed through the survey of non- respondents in the Second HP St udy (see Appendix 1, Table 1.3-1). Epidemiological findings are often based partly or completely on responses to questionnaires, which are used extensivel y for collecting information on exposures, outcomes, modifiers and confounders. Obviously, the use of an invalid instrument is a waste of resources. The adequate preparati on of questionnaires was thus essential for the quality of data. Detailed attention was given to questionnaire development and validation in the study of this thesis. Most of the developmental work of releva nce to epidemiology has been carried out in the area of outcome measures, usually of non-observable outcomes such as depression, headache and intelligence. Relative ly little work has been undertaken to develop questionnaires related to exposures, with certain exceptions. Certainly the study of this thesis may be viewed as such an exception. Indeed, questionnaire development invol ved understanding the concerns of willingness to respond, discriminatory power, comparability, responsiveness/reliability and validity of data from previous experiences reported by Golden. No pilot study was undertaken in 1986 to validate the original questionnaire. The basic questionnaire was fine tuned over the fifteen years of the study to improve the layout of questions. There was no change over that time to the questions asked, as the resulting data was providing the info rmation needed by the researcher. Further, well constructed questionnaires ex ist, however they are not always used by other researchers and opportunities for im provement are thus missed. Frequently, questionnaires are designed with little if any consultation of past research experience with similar measurement tools. In the st udy of thesis improveme nt of the original questionnaire was undertaken w ith the new health survey. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 784.1.1.4 Sample Size Statistical studies (surveys, experiments, observational studies, et c.) are always better when they are carefully planned. A hypothesis test gives the probability of th e desired outcome result occurring, if the null hypothesis is false. If the probability is lower than a pre-specified value (alpha, usually 0.05), it is rejected. This can be lik ened to a search process where one searches for evidence to reject the null hypothesis, in the same way that one may search for the presence of a chemical in an environment. The ability to reject the null hypothesis depends upon: Alpha (a): Usually set to be 0.05, although this is somewhat arbitrary. This is the probability of a type I error, that is the pr obability of rejecting the null hypothesis given that that the null hypothesis is true. To use the search anal ogy, it is the probability of thinking we have found something wh en it is not really there. Sample size: A larger sample size leads to more accurate parameter estimates, which leads to a greater ability to find what we were looking for. The harder we look, the more likely we are to find it. Effect Size: The size of the effect in the populatio n. The bigger it is, the easier it will be to find. Power analysis allows us to make sure th at we have looked hard enough to find it. The size of the parameter we are looking for is known as the effect size. Several methods exist for deciding what effect size we would be of interest. Different statistical tests have different effect si zes developed for them however the general principle is the same. The total sample comprised 637 children whose parents received Golden's HP program and who returned at least on e questionnaire. Of the 1,525 completed questionnaires received by 31st May 2003, 637 were received afte r the first year of using the program, and a further 888 questionnaires were received during following years. These returns are shown in Table 4.1-1 following.

One aim of the Second HP data collection over 5 years was to calculate precise response rates for the return of the first year's questionnaire. 4.1.1.6 Analyses Responses to the questionnaires were checked and coded by one person. Another person entered data into a computer, and a data check was carried out. All responses indicating either exposure to disease or acqui sition of a disease were re-checked and inconsistencies corrected, e.g., responses that stated the child contracted a disease but did not report exposure to the disease were adjusted to show that exposure did occur. A ratio analysis was performed to show th e proportion of reactions to the program, the proportion of exposure to targeted diseas es, the proportion of diseases to the total population of the study, and the proportion of diseases to the group that reported exposure to the targeted diseases. Results were tabulated progressively, with a major analysis of the first 10 years data being undertaken and published in 1997 (Golde n 1997). A full analysis of an additional 5 years of data collection was undertaken as part of this thesis. This included data checking and inclusion of 220 late responses up to 1 st March 2003. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 81 The effectiveness of the program was examined by finding the proportion of The number of children who did not acquire an infectious disease covered by the program, whose parents reported exposure to the disease, and who received the preventative remedies associated with the particular disease, to The number of children whose parents report ed exposure to the particular disease covered by the program, and who received prev entative remedies associated with the disease. Even though the parental assessments of e xposure are subjective, the elimination of cases of non-exposure is designed to improve the validity of the reported figure for effectiveness. There are two potential errors (titled E1 and E2) in this figure for effectiveness that have opposite effects on the data: (E1) some parents would have reported exposure to a disease when in fact exposure did not occur. For example, they may have assumed exposure occurred because the disease appeared among other children in their child's sc hool, playgroup, family, etc., but in fact their ch ild was not exposed. (E2) some parents would not have reporte d exposure when in fact exposure did occur. For example, their child was exposed to a disease at their school, playgroup, etc., but because the child did not contract the disease the parents did not know that their child had been exposed. It should be noted th at over the entire length of the study only one possible exposure to polio was reported; yet it is known that if a child plays with a recently (orally) vaccinated child then exposure is possible. A third potential error (E3) related to the relia bility of the parents report of a disease. Two further potential weaknesses of the study were that (1) no control group was available against which to compare the result s of the research, and (2) no precise data on parental response rates were available. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 82An attempt to evaluate the extent of thes e three potential erro rs and two weaknesses was made in the Second HP study The safety of the program was assessed in two ways. The first method examined the number of reac tions to doses of remedies experienced by children using the program. The proportion of reactions per respondent child was initially calculated, and then adjusted to estimate the proportion of reactions per individual dose. This latter figure was calculated assuming that each child would have 6 doses of medicine per year. This is less than the numbe r of suggested doses in the first year of the program (10) but takes into account that many parents miss doses due to illness of the child when doses are suspended, or due to simple forgetfulness. It also takes into account the reduced number of doses suggested in the second and subsequent years of the program. Parents' comments on the intensity and durat ion of reactions were also collected. A second method to assess safety was employed where the general comments made by those respondents who chose to answer the question \"any other comments\" were examined. The comments were analysed to reveal positive and negative comments concerning the general health of children using the program. Safety and effectiveness figures were re ported in Chapter 5 for each individual disease covered by the program, as well as to tal figures for all diseases (Golden, 1997). 4.1.1.7 Composition of HP Remedies All remedies were purchased from Brauer Biotherapies in liqu id form. Unmedicated pilules made from maize starch were then medicated using the drops. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 83 4.1.1.8 The Choice of Remedies used in the HP Program The remedies used in the current HP progr am are described in detail in Appendix 1 in the Tables 1.1-1 to 1.1-6. The choice of remedies used was based on previous experience in homoeoprophylaxis as described in Secti on 2.3 above. The choice of potencies and doses were originally determined on this pr evious experience, and later modified on the basis of the researcher's own experiences . The conceptual and practical reasons supporting the remedies used in the HP program are discussed in detail elsewhere (Golden, 2001, pp. 7-32). Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 844.2 Second Study of a Specific Ho moeoprophylaxis Program The purpose of the Second HP Study (titled Research Project A1) was to test the validity of the figures for safety and effec tiveness reported in Table 5.1-1, and to deal with the potential errors and weakness in the Initial HP Study described in section 4.1.1.6 above. This was done in four ways: collect new figures for the safety and e ffectiveness of the program for 5 years from 1998 to 2002 (Series 11-15), and ensure that the first-year responses account for over 70% of parents who pur chased programs during that period (to provide a representative sample). survey non-respondents to see if their e xperience with the program is similar to or different from the experience of respondents. This will verify whether the responses received accu rately depict the experience of the entire group. make a comparative analysis of the new data and the existing data. This includes a comparison of the results usi ng HP with national attack rates for the diseases being studied, thus providing a limited but available control group against which to compare results. survey respondents who said their children were eith er exposed to targeted diseases, and/or contracted targeted dis eases to verify the resulting figures for effectiveness. This will also provide some indication of the extent of the biases E1, E2 and E3 mentioned in 4.1.1.6 above. 4.2.1 Research Design of Second HP Research The methodology of the basic questionnair e survey of the additional research population is identical to the prospective longitudinal method reported in 4.1.1 above. In addition, non-respondents were sent a sp ecial questionnaire in order to provide confirmation that the original responses we re representative of the total group. This questionnaire is shown in Table 1.3-1 in Appendix 1. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 85 As well, a special questionnaire was sent to those respondents who said that their child had contracted an infectious disease covered by the main program, and another to those who said their child had been exposed to a disease covered by the main program. The questionnaires are s hown in Appendix 1 in Ta ble 1.4-2 and Table 1.4-3 respectively. 4.2.1.1 The Study Population This survey was a population-based study wh ere all children whos e parents received Golden's HP program from 1 st March 1996 to 28th February 2001 were eligible for inclusion. 622 children were en tered into the study on the basis of questionnaires given to their parents. 4.2.1.2 The Study Design The study was identical to the study design reported in section 4.1. It was a self administered, annual, questionnaire base d, postal study completed by parents of the participating children. As with the previous study, each questionnaire covered the preceding year of the child's life and asked questions relating to the child's experience with the program including any reactions to th e kit, their exposure to infectious diseases, and their infectious disease history. The first questionnaire was given to pare nts when they received Golden's HP program, and is shown in Table 1.2-1 of Appe ndix 1. They were asked to complete and return the questionnaire in the February that fell at least 12 months following the acquisition of the program. Thes e parents were allocated in to 5 groups (Series 11-15). First annual questionnai res were collected on 1 st February 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 86 A similar follow-up questionnaire was sent every subsequent February to those parents who returned a prior year's questionnaire, and is shown in Table A1.2-2 of Appendix 1. Subsequent annual quest ionnaires were collected on 28th February 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002. Thus questionnaires were progressively collected from 28 th February 1998 to 2002, with late returns being accepted up to 31st May 2003. 4.2.1.3 Selection Bias As with the previous ten year study, bias is present due to all questionnaire returns being voluntary, and reflected each parent's in terest in participating in the research, as well as their intellectual ability to understand and be able to comple te a questionnaire. It also reflected each parent's ability to keep th e questionnaire for at least a year, or ability to receive forwarded mail when they changed address during that period. There is potential bias in figures for both di seases and exposure to diseases due to the uncertainty of the information, based as it is on parents' opinions. The follow up questionnaires sent to parents were designed to minimise this bias. The potential bias due to non-responses was addressed through the survey on non- respondents. 4.2.1.4 Sample Size The total sample comprised 424 children whose parents received Golden's HP program and who returned at least on e questionnaire. Of the 817 completed questionnaires received by 31 st May 2003, 424 were received afte r the first year of using the program, and a further 393 questionnaires were received during following years. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 87The responses are shown in Table 4.2-1 below.

The follow up of non-respondents (discussed in 5.2.9 below), excluding accounting for returned mail, caused the accountability rate to increase to 74.9%.

Thus, 42 responded without sending in questionnaires. The 14 responses for Series 11, 12 and 13 were collected at the same time and thus could not be allocated to each seri es with certainty due to the confidentiality of the follow-up ques tionnaire that had no identifying numbering. These 14 have been randomly a llocated over the three series. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 914.2.1.6 Analyses The data from the questionnaires respons es were checked and coded by one person. Another person entered data into a computer twice, and a data check was carried out. All responses indicating either exposure to di sease or acquisition of a disease were re- checked and inconsistencies corrected, e.g., responses that stated the child contracted a disease but did not report exposure to the di sease were adjusted to show that exposure did occur. A ratio analysis was performed to show the proportion of reacti ons to doses during the program, the proportion of e xposure to targeted diseases , the proportion of diseases contracted to the total popul ation, and the proportion of diseases to the group that reported exposure. The effectiveness of the program was examined by finding the proportion of The number of children who did not acquire an infectious disease covered by the program, whose parents reported exposure to the disease, and who received the preventative remedies associated with the particular disease, to The number of children whose parents report ed exposure to the particular disease covered by the program and who received prev entative remedies associated with the disease. The elimination of cases of non-exposure is designed to improve the statistical value of the reported figure for effectiveness. 95% confidence limits were calculated for the figure for effectiveness. The analysis of follow-up questionnaires that were sent to selected respondents reporting exposure and disease were designed to account for the three potential errors (described in 4.1.1.6 above as E1, E2 and E3) in the figure for effectiveness. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 92A further analysis involving calculation of the odds ratio and Chi Squared probability for different national disease attack rates wa s also completed to provide an effective control group against which to compare the figure for effectiveness. The safety of the program was assessed in two ways. The first method examined the number of reac tions to doses of re medies in the kit experienced by children using the kit. The proportion of reactions per respondent child was initially calculated, and then adjusted to estimate the proportion of reactions per individual dose. This latter figure was calculated assuming that each child would have 6 doses of medicine per year. This is less than the numbe r of suggested doses in the first year of the program (10) but takes into account that many parents miss doses due to illness of the child when doses are suspended, or due to simple forgetfulness. It also takes into account the reduced number of doses suggested in the second and subsequent years of the program. Parent's comments on the intensity and duration of reactions were also collected and analysed to further assess th e short-term safety of HP. A second method to assess long-term safety was employed where the general comments made by those respondents who c hose to answer the question \"any other comments\" were examined. The comments were analysed to reveal positive and negative comments concerning the general health of ch ildren using the program. Safety and effectiveness figures are reporte d for each individual disease covered by the program, as well as tota l figures for all diseases. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 934.3 General Health Survey A retrospective health survey of children aged between f our and twelve years of age was undertaken to further examine th e safety and effectiveness of HP. Children aged between 4 and 12 years of age were targeted for two reasons: (1) if children were too young (i.e., <4) there woul d not be sufficient health history to reasonably assess their le vel of health, and (2) if they we re too old (i.e., > 12) then too many other factors other than the ones under study could have influenced their health. A number of early childhood factors were examined in the questionnaire. The one that is relevant for the pur poses of this study was the imm unisation history of the child. Four different types of immunisation history were questioned. They were: Homoeoprophylactically protected. Vaccine protected. \"Constitutionally\" protected, (i.e., any general health measures intended to improve overall health, and thus improve overall immunity against all infectious diseases). No specific protection agai nst infectious diseases. Because of the possible combinations of alte rnatives, eight different categories were examined. They were: Homoeoprophylaxis only. Vaccination only. General/constitutional protection only. Homoeoprophylaxis and vaccination. Homoeoprophylaxis and general protection. Vaccination and general protection. Homoeoprophylaxis, vaccinati on and general protection. No method of protection. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 94 The earlier work of Dr M. Odent and colleagues is acknowledged. Although they were investigating the long-term health a dvantages of breastfee ding, they discovered a link between immunisation status and condi tions such as asthma and eczema through a questionnaire based study somewhat similar to that used in the General Health Survey (Odent et al., 1994a, p.140; Odent et.al, 1994b, pp.592-3). 4.3.1 Design of the General Health Survey A retrospective questionnaire-based survey was used. The questionnaire is shown in Table 1.5-1 in Appendix 1. 4.3.1.1 The Study Population This survey was a population-based study where all persons who expressed an interest in participating in the General Health Survey were sent a questionnaire for each of their eligible children. Practitioners who expressed an interest in distributing questionnaires to their patients were sent quantities of questionnaires. Qu estionnaires were also handed out in public lectures offered by Golden in Western Australia, Queensland and Victoria. Quantities of questionnaires were also sent to primar y schools that expressed an interest in distributing them. The total number of parent s receiving questionnaires is unknown. The total number of questionnaires distribu ted was approximately 5,000. 4.3.1.2 The Study Design The study was a self-administered, questi onnaire based, postal study completed by parents of eligible children. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 95 Each questionnaire asked general questions about th e child such as their age and sex (see Appendix 1, Table 1.5-1, for the Ge neral Health Survey questionnaire). Questions were asked examining early childhood factors such as birth weight, gestation, APGAR scores, length of breastfeeding and method of disease prevention. The child's health experience with asthma, eczema, ear and hearing problems, allergies and behavioural problems was exam ined, as was the parents' evaluation of their child's general health. Cases of whooping cough, measles and mumps were recorded, as was each child's hospitalisation experience. With both health conditions and infectious diseases, respondents were asked whether a diagnosis by a medical practitioner was made. The variables noted above were not used as screening data to eith er accept or reject participants in the study, with the exception of the variable for age. It was decided to accept into the study only children aged betw een 4 and 12 years of age in order to ensure that a child had sufficient health expe rience to make the results meaningful (was at least four years of age) but was not so old as to introduce too many other possibly confounding variables. The sele ction of these age limits wa s subjective, and based on what the researcher felt was reasonable. The choice of the other early childhood factors was subjec tive, but was intended to include factors that were commonly seen as possibly influencing later childhood development. The choice of the three infectio us diseases was based on the fact that they were covered in the orthodox vaccination schedule and the HP program, and that there was a positive incidence of the diseases in the Australian community (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2003d). The choice of the heal th conditions being studied was subjective, but was intended to include common health problems of childhood. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 96A small pilot study was undertaken to de termine whether prospective respondents could understand the meaning of the ques tions and respond appr opriately. The study was also used to test the value and relevan ce of questions. The pilot study revealed that asking questions regarding a ch ild's APGAR scores and receipt of Vitamin K injection would add to the potential value of the quest ionnaire in terms of relevant information being provided that may confound the final results. 4.3.1.3 Selection Bias Bias is likely due to all questionnaire returns being voluntary, and reflected each parent's interest in participating in the rese arch, as well as their intellectual ability to understand and be able to co mplete a questionnaire. Bias also existed due to the Education Departments in N.S.W. and the Northern Territory refusing to allow the questionnaire to be distributed in their State Primary Schools. Also, parents who did not use the na tural health media, or attend lectures offered by Golden, would have been unlikely to know of the survey. 4.3.1.4 Sample Size All children, whose parents answered a questionnaire from 1 st March 2002 to 31st October, 2003 were included. 850 questionnaires were received by 31st October 2003. Following data entry, 69 questionnaires were separated from the central analysis as the ages of the children were either below 4 years of age or above 12 years of age. Thus 781 questionnaires were accepted into the main GHS study. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 974.3.1.5 Compliance Two types of approaches were made to parents to attract participants. The first involved advertising the research in a variety of health journals, on the Internet, and at public lect ures conducted by Golden. The second involved sending questionnaires to a number of sc hools around Australia and requesting parents to participate in the survey. There were 495 responses obtained through general advertising, and 286 responses via the school system. The exact rate of responses, through each system is unknown. 2,401 questionnaires were sent to primary schools. It is not known how many were actually given to parents, as some schools said they would advertise the survey in their school newsletter and leave it up to interested parents to collect questionnaires if they wished. However an estimate of compliance (the ra te of response) through the participating primary schools is 15%. Questionnaires were posted to parents who contacted Golden. The rate of response from this source is estimated at greater than 90%. The number of questionnaires handed out at public lectures and by practitioners is unknown. However a response rate of less than 20% is probable. It is reasonable to assume th at the overall respons e rate of parents of eligible children who received questionnaires is below 50%. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 984.3.1.6 Analyses Data and respondent details were checked and coded by one person. Responses were entered into a computer by a second pers on. Another person then checked the data output, and any required co rrections were made. The effectiveness of HP used by participants in the General Health Survey was measured in the following ways. The following proportion measured the absolu te effectiveness of HP for each of the three diseases studied: Effectiveness (GHS) = children in the study who used HP but who did not contract the disease all children in the study who used HP Figures were calculated for all respondents, as well as for those where the disease was diagnosed by a GP. The relative effectiveness of HP was dete rmined by calculating the proportion shown above for each method of disease preven tion, together with 95% confidence limits. Also the Odds Ratio and Chi Squared proba bilities were calculat ed for the four non- combined methods of disease prevention. Once again, figures were also calc ulated for GP-diagnosed diseases. The safety of the HP programs used by particip ants in the General Health Survey was calculated using the following two ratios for the five conditions (asthma, eczema, ear/hearing, allergies and be havioural problems) and th e three diseases (whooping cough, measles, mumps) studied as part of the GHS. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 99 1. Proportion (SHP1) = Condition (using HP only) All Persons (HP only) 2. Odds Ratio (SHP2) = Condition (using HP only) / Condition (not using HP) No Condition (HP only) No Condition (not using HP) The Chi Squared probability for each Odds Ratio was calculated. The same figures were also calculated for GP-diagnosed conditions and diseases. The relative safety of HP was also as sessed by comparing Odds Ratios and Chi Squared probabilities for the four non-combined preventative options and the five health conditions studied. Measures that were statistically significan t were compared to determine the relative safety of HP only, vaccination only, gene ral protection only and no preventative method. A participant profile of res pondents to the General Health Survey was undertaken in Chapter 5.3 to determine if th e participants were typical of the Australian population. A comparison between responses collected in the general comm unity and responses collected through schools was made in Chapter 5.4 using simple proportions. Finally, a comparison of responses using a HP program that either was or was not supplied by Golden was undertaken in Chap ter 5.5 using simple proportions, Odds Ratios with Chi Squared probabilities as well as cumulative rankings of general wellbeing. No information was available on the different types of programs used by respondents, but variations from Golden's long-term program in remedies used, potencies and doses would all be expected. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 100Results Assessing the Safe ty and Effectiveness of Homoeoprophylaxis Introduction The results of the three stages of investigati on into the effectiveness and the safety of HP are reported below. Effectiveness and safe ty are examined separately showing the progressive development of results from the three groups of research data: 1. The Initial HP Data Collection (Golden's data Series 1-10) 2. The Second HP Data Collection (Golden's data Series 11-15) 3. The General Health Survey. The following flow chart shows the manner in which the measures of effectiveness progressed from the publication of the Series 1-10 effectiveness of 88.8% in 1997, through to the collection of additional data and surveys designed to ad dress weaknesses identified in the original data. The chart further shows how the measures of safety progressed from a simple proportion of the reactions to the remedies in the program and the analysis of general comments, to a detailed statistical analysis of the relationshi ps between the use of HP and the incidence of chronic conditions such as asthma and eczema, as well as a comparative analysis involving other methods of disease prevention. Three additional analyses are reported. The first presents a descriptive profile of respondents to the General Health Study in order to determine whether the respondents to the study are representa tive of the general community. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 101The second presents an analysis of the effectiveness and safety of general HP programs used by participants recru ited through the school system , and other participants. The third presents an analysis of the effec tiveness and safety of HP programs supplied by Golden, compared to HP programs not supplied by Golden.

Effectiveness (HP) = exposed childr en who did not contract the disease all definite reports of exposure The first full report describing the effec tiveness of Golden's HP program, based on 1,305 responses from participants in data Seri es 1-10, showed the following effectiveness (Golden 1997, p. 7): Effectiveness (1) = 88.8% A further 220 questionnaires from Series 1-10 respondents were collected to 31 st May 2003, making a total of 1,525 questionnaires to be analysed. The result was: Effectiveness (2) = 90.5% Note that this result is the average of the first five-year measure of effectiveness (Series 1-5) of 89.8% and the second five-year measur e of effectiveness (S eries 6-10) of 91.3%. Finally, the third 5-year data collection of 817 responses (Series 11-15) was made to further test the consistency and therefore reliability of these earlier measures of effectiveness. The result was: Effectiveness (3) = 89.5% These three measures are summarised in Table 5.1-1, demonstrating an average effectiveness of Golden's HP program over the 15-year data collection period of 90.2%: Effectiveness (4) = 90.2% Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 105Table 4.4-1 Effectiveness of Golden's HP Program Over All Data Collection Periods Series 1-5 Series 6-10 Series 11-15 Series 1 - 15 No. % No. % No. % No. % Responses 708 817 817 2,342 Diseases 18 11 12 41 Exposure to Diseases 177 127 114 418 Effectiveness of the of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 106A description of the limitations and potentia l errors in the firs t two measures of effectiveness was outlined in Chapter 4. The following seven additional tests were performed on Series 11-15 data in order to address the identified limitations of the earlier analysis (points 1-7 below), and two new measures of effectiveness were derived from the General Health Survey (points 8 and 9 below): 1. The accountability rate of the final 5-y ears' data was calculated to ensure a significant level of accountability (>70 %) and thus greater reliability of results. 2. Non-respondents were surveyed to ensu re that the questi onnaires received gave responses that were refl ective of the entire population. 3. Respondents who reported a disease were surveyed to verify the accuracy of their initial report. 4. Respondents who reported exposure to a di sease were surveyed to verify the accuracy of their initial report. 5. A more detailed statistical analysis of the data was undertaken to determine the 95% confidence limits for the fi gure for the effectiveness of HP. 6. The accuracy of the measurements of ef fectiveness based on notifications of and exposure to diseases wa s tested by calculating the sensitivity and specificity of the data. 7. A comparison with national disease atta ck rates was undertaken to provide an effective control group against which to compare results. 8. Data collected during the General Health Survey were analysed to determine if a stand-alone effectiven ess measure could be found. 9. Data collected during the General Health Survey were analysed to make a comparison between the effectiveness of HP and the effectiveness of the other methods of disease prevention exam ined in that Survey (vaccination and a general health approach), a nd also with no method of disease prevention. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 1074.4.1 Additional Research to Veri fy the Effectiveness of HP 4.4.1.1 Accountability Rate of Additional Data Collection Data collected for a further 5 years from Series 11-15 participants resulted in the collection of 817 new questionnaires. The accountability rate for the first responses to each of the five new annual data series was 74.9%, including replies by initial non-resp ondents. These figures are reported above in Table 4.2-1 (page 74 above). This is suffici ent to suggest that the responses received were likely to reliably portray the experien ce of the entire study population. Surveying non-respondents further te sted this possibility. 4.4.1.2 Follow-up of Non-Respondents A survey of non-respondents was undertak en to determine whether the survey population was representative of all persons using the HP program. Replies were received from 53 (31.2%) of 170 non-respondents surveyed. The survey questionnaire is shown in Appendix 1, Table 1.3-1. The full results are shown in the Tables of Results at th e end of this chapter in Table 5.6-1. In summary, those non-respondents who replied reported the following: 1. 43 (81.1%) of non-respondents had part ially or fully used the kit. 2. 31 (58.5%) of non-respondents said the kit wa s successful in preventing disease, and none said it was unsuccessful. 15 (28.3%) either did not know, or did not use the kit. 3. When asked to rank their level of satis faction with the k it, 14 (26.4%) did not respond to that question. 32 (60.4%) ranked their satisfaction between 8 and 10. Only 4 (7.6%) ranked their satisf action between 1 and 5. 4. 35 (66.0%) of non-respondents stated that they would be prepared to participate in a general health survey of Australian children. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 108 A clear majority of the non-respondents were satisfied with the HP program, and most felt it was successful in preventing disease. These views are consistent with the strong support for the HP program by those who responded to the annual questionnaires. This demonstrates that the replies received from participants in the 5-year study, and therefore by implication the full 15-year study, were representative of the entire population of children using the HP program. 4.4.1.3 Follow-up of Respondents Reporting a Disease In order to validate the accuracy of the actual responses made by parents who reported that their child contracted a disease covered by the HP pr ogram, after the relevant HP remedy had been administered, each of these parents were sent the questionnaire shown in Table 1.4-1 in Appendix 1. The responses were record ed in four columns: The entry showed if a new classifica tion was required, and what it was. If the initial classification was valid, th e level of certainty was recorded as either - 1 = high certain ty; 2 = medium certainty. The entry showed if the survey e nvelope was returned to sender. The entry showed if there was no res ponse to the questionn aire (excluding returned mail). These data are summarised below in Table 5.1-2, which shows the accountability and response rates to the survey of parents repo rting a disease, and in Table 5.1-3, which shows the level of reclassificati on of results that was necessary. Table 5.1-2 reports an accountab ility rate of 84.2%, with an actual response rate of 68.4%. This level is sufficient to suggest that the additional survey will give a reliable indication of the validi ty of all responses. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 109After reclassification, it was reported in Ta ble 5.1-3 that the number of cases of definite diseases needed to be reduced from 12 to 11. Whilst the level of accountability of responses was reasonable, the actual number of diseases was small. This makes an automatic extension of the result for Series 11-15 to the earlier data series problematic. However, what data are available suggests that the measures of effectiveness re ported above are conservative. 4.4.1.4 Follow-up of Respondents Reporting Exposure to a Disease In order to validate the accuracy of the actual responses made by parents who reported that their child was exposed to a disease covered by the HP program, after the relevant HP remedy had been administered, each of these parents were sent the questionnaire shown in Table 1.4-2 in Appe ndix 1. When a parent reported that their child had contracted a disease they we re not contacted to verify exposure. In order to validate the accuracy of their reports, each of these parents were sent the questionnaire shown in Table 1.4-5 in Appe ndix 1. When a parent reported that their child had contracted a disease they we re not contacted to verify exposure. The classification of responses is shown in Table 1.4-6 in Appendix 1. The responses were recorded in four columns: The entry showed if a new classifica tion was required, and what it was. If the initial classification was valid, th e level of certainty was recorded as either - 1 = high certainty; 2 = medium certainty. The entry showed if the survey e nvelope was returned to sender. The entry showed if there was no res ponse to the questionn aire (excluding returned mail). These data are summarised below in Table 5.1-2, which shows the accountability and response rates to the survey of parents report ing exposure to a diseas e, and in Table 5.1-3, which shows the level of reclassifica tion of results th at was necessary. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 110 Table 5.1-2 reports an accountab ility rate of 59.5%, with an actual response rate of 51.4%. This level is not high e nough to give a reliable indi cation of the validity of all responses. After reclassification, it was reported in Table 5.1-3 that there were six cases where the classification was downgraded to \"uncertain\" and five cases where the classification was upgraded to \"definite\". The net result was that th e number of cases of definite exposure to diseases needed to be reduced from 114 to 113. The level of accountability of responses was not adequate to make an automatic extension of the result for Series 11-15 to the earlier data series. However, what data are available once again suggests that the measures of effec tiveness reported above are conservative. After adjusting the figures for disease and e xposure, a recalculation of the measure for effectiveness for Series 11-15 (Effectiven ess (3)) shows an increase from 102/114 or 89.5% to 102/113 or 90.3%. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 111 Table 4.4-2 Accountability Rates to the Survey of Selected Respondents to Series 11-15 Questionnaires Reported a Disease Reported Exposure to a Disease * Total Reports 19 114 Questionnaires sent 19 111 Letters sent 19 84 Mail returned 3 6 Questionnaires returned 3 9 Responses 13 57 Response Rate 68.4% 51.4% Questionnaires unaccounted for 3 45 Accountability Rate 84.2% 59.5% * Note: There were 114 reports of exposure. 11 respondents reported exposure to 2 diseases, and 1 respondent reported 3 diseases . 10 different respondents reported exposure in 2 years, and 2 in three years. Thus, 87 envelopes, 24 of which would include multiple follow-up questionnaires could have been sent. In fact, 2 envelopes each containing 1 questionnaire were not sent due to the re spondents moving overseas. Another envelope containing 1 questionnaire was not sent due to the address being unclear.Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 112 Table 4.4-3 Verification of Exposure and Disease Classifications Series 11-15 Original Classification Amended Classification Total Responses 817 Parents Reporting Definite Exposure to the Disease 114 113 % to Total Responses 14.0% Parents Reporting Possible Exposure to the Disease 37 38 % to Total Responses 4.5% Parents Reporting Definite Disease 12 11 % to Total Responses 1.5% Parents Reporting Possible Disease 7 8 % to Total Responses 0.9% Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 1134.4.1.5 Additional Statistical Analysis of Data To further assess the effectiveness of Golden's HP program, a comparative analysis of results from the three series of data wa s made. The findings are shown in Table 5.1-4 below. These findings show the corrected fi gures for Series 11-15 data, following the corrections made as a result of the follo w-up surveys of respondents who reported a disease, or an exposure to a disease, reported in sections 5.1.1.3 and 5.1.1.4 above. The effectiveness of the HP program for the three series combined was 90.4%. The confidence limit for a 0.05 significance level was 2.83%. Thus we can say with 95% confidence, based on the data provided, that the effectiveness of Golden's long-term HP program ranges between 87.6% and 93.2%.

Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 1154.4.1.6 Indices of the Accuracy of th e Measurements of Exposure and Notifications The follow-up of parents reporting either exposure to a disease or notification of the disease enables the calculation of two indi ces of the accuracy of the measurements made as part of Golden's long-term HP study. Kelsey, et al., (1986, p. 286) stat ed, 'For a discrete variable that is binary, there are two separate aspects of the accu racy of measurement. One is sensitivity , which is defined as the proportion of those who truly have the characteristi c that are correctly classified as having it by the m easurement technique. The other is specificity , which is defined as the proportion of those who truly do not have the characteristic that are correctly classified as not having it by the measurement technique.' They further stated that the indices are used to assess accuracy in the following way - 'Measurement of a binary characteristic is perfect only when both sensitivity and specificity are 100%. When sensitivity is equal to one minus specificity, then the measurement method is no better than an entirely random means for classifying individuals.' (p. 287) Table 5.1-5 shows the calculation for sensit ivity and specificity based on corrected figures for exposure to a disease, and Table 5.1-6 shows these figures for notifications of the disease, after the corrections fo r exposure rates shown in Table 5.1-5. The four indices are between 90.9% and 99.0%. This indicates an extremely high level of accuracy of the measurements for exposure and a high level of accuracy for notifications based on the amended results obtained. The value of the results is limited du e to a follow-up response rate below 100%. However, it is clear that the re sults that were return ed were very supportive of the accuracy of the study.

However, an effective control group does exist in the form of national dise ase attack rates, i.e., the proportion of unimmunised people who are expected to contract a disease if exposed to it. Such a figure is exactly equivalent to the proportion of people using HP who contract a disease if exposed to it - i.e., 9.8% over the 15-year study. An analysis of the Odds Ratios and Chi S quared probabilities for a range of disease attack rates was undertaken to provide an effective \"control\" figure against which the effectiveness of HP could be compared. The results are summarised in Table 5.1-7 below. The Odds Ratio = Disease:No Disease / HP:No HP The actual average attack rates for the four di seases that were reported in the research varied. Some citations in the literature are: Whooping Cough: 70-100% in unvaccinated household members (NH&MRC, 2000) Measles: 90% of unvaccinated household members (Nemours Foundation, 2001) Mumps: 70% in unvaccinated household memb ers (estimate) (Schleqel et al, 1999) Hib: not available. The breakdown of the 41 diseases report ed in the 15-year survey was Whooping Cough 15/41; Measles 22/41; Mumps 3/41; Hi b 1/41. This yields a weighted average attack rate of 73.9% as shown in Table 5.1-8. Thus we are able to say with 99% confid ence that the use of HP is associated with a reduction in the incidence of diseas e, and that an effectiveness of around 90% is supported by the analysis. The claim is of course subject to the limitations and the potential biases in the data noted earlier.

Note that this figure differs from the fi gure used to measure the effectiveness of Golden's HP program, where the proportion was taken against children who were exposed to a disease. Probable exposure wa s not available from the General Health Survey figures, and thus the absolute measure of effectiveness is less accurate than the earlier measures. Effectiveness (GHS) = children who used HP but who did not contract the disease all children using HP The figure for the effectiveness of HP for all participants in the General Health Survey who used HP either alone or w ith other forms of disease prevention, is calculated based on the data in Table 5.1-9 be low. Figures are shown for total diseases as well as for only those diseases that were diagnosed by a GP: Effectiveness (5) = 75.0% (96/128); OR 87.5% (112/128) for GP diagnosed diseases. The figure for effectiveness for particip ants using HP as their only method of disease prevention is: Effectiveness (6) = 79.2% (57/ 72); OR 87.5% (63/72) fo r GP diagnosed diseases. As stated above, these figures are not dire ctly comparable with the HP figures for effectiveness (Effectiveness (1 ) - (4)) as no data on exposure rates were obtained in the General Health Survey. Further, only three individual diseases were examined - Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 121whooping cough, measles and mumps - although these were also the most common diseases found in the 15-year study. Also, no checks were possible on the accuracy of the statements made by participants in the Survey. On the other hand, comparative data between HP and other preventative methods is available from the General Health Survey, and these are studied below. 4.4.1.9 The Relative Effectiveness of HP Found in the General Health Survey Three types of analysis are made on the Genera l Health Survey data to test the earlier measures of effectiveness. (1) The incidence of the three diseases targeted in the General Health Survey questionnaire, calculated for each of the di fferent preventative methods, is shown in Tables 5.1-9 and 5.1-10. Diagnosis of each diseas e by a GP is also shown in both tables to give some indication of the possible reliability of the figures. (2) The effectiveness of each method, shown as the proportion of no disease to group total for each method, together with 95% confidence limits, is shown in Tables 5.1-11 and 5.1-12. (3) An Odds Ratio and Chi Squared probabi lity analysis is und ertaken on the four different non-combined methods, and the results shown in Tables 5.1-13 and 5.1-14.

The figures for total diseases diagnosed by a GP are also s hown, as are simple rankings for each method. A simple ranking of methods shows that vacc ination appears to give the highest level of protection, followed by HP, no method of pr otection, and finally general protection. This order is changed when examining tota l figures for diseases diagnosed by a GP, where general protection moves to the firs t place, the other three remaining in the previous order. It is possible that parents who use constitutional and specific general health measures to protect their child against infectious dis eases have made themselves more informed than other parents, are more self reliant in tim es of illness on their ow n ability to treat the illness, and thus are less likely to consult a GP than are other parents who rely more on advice from professionals. This is probably the cause of the latter result, where GP diag nosed diseases were proportionally lowest within this group of parents. The effectiveness for HP of 79.2%-87.5% is subject to errors such as incorrect diagnosis, and the likelihood of non-exposure in a number of cases where the disease was not reported. This is also true for the ot her methods of disease prevention examined.

The figures for the effectiveness of HP for the 15-year study are also shown for comparative purposes. The 15-year HP figures are the most reliable of the five groups because they take into account exposure to the disease, which makes the effectiveness of HP of 90.2% significant, as the highest reading. One reason for the difference between this fi gure and the effectiveness of HP from the General Health Survey of 79.2% is because the survey examines children who use Golden's program as well as child ren who use other HP programs. An analysis is made in Chapter 5.5 follo wing of the differences between programs supplied by Golden and other programs. This an alysis clearly shows that differences do exist between different HP programs, and th at the inclusion of programs other than those supplied by Golden is likely to re duce the total effectiveness recorded. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 127Table 4.4-11 95 % Confidence Limits for the Effectiveness of Different Methods of Disease Prevention Vaccination Only HP Only General Prevention Only No Disease Prevention 15 Year Study 299/332 Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 128 Table 4.4-12 95% Confidence Limits for the Effectiveness of Different Methods of Dise ase Prevention - GP Diagnosed Diseases Vaccination Only HP Only General Prevention Only No Disease Prevention 15 Year Study 304/332 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 129The Odds Ratios and Chi Squared probability figures are shown in Tables 5.1-13 and 5.1-14 below. The figures for HP are not statistically significant in either Table, and therefore no reliable conclusion can be drawn re garding the effec tiveness of HP. We are able to conclude with 99% conf idence, based on the figures shown, that vaccination is 8.3 times more effective than general protection only, and 5.7 times more effective than no method of disease prevention. The figures are suggestive of an effectiv eness of around 80%, and suggestive that the effectiveness of HP lies between that of vaccination only and general prevention and no method of prevention. However, the above analysis based on data obtained from the General Health Survey is unable to provide evidence at P 95% of either the absolute effectiveness of HP or its effectiveness relative to other methods of disease prevention.

Figures are presented for both Golden's long-term HP program, and for the other HP programs used by participants in the General Health Survey. 4.5.1 Short Term Safety of HP The reactions experienced by children using Golden's Series 11-15 HP program were recorded, and were classified according to intensity of reaction and duration of reaction. The reaction rate to the medicines in Golden 's HP program is shown for all Series (1- 15) in Table 5.2-1 below. Parents using Golden's HP program reporte d a reaction rate to medicines in the program of 9.2%, with a confidence limit of 1.2% for a 0.05 significance level. Thus, we can say with 95% confiden ce, based on the data provided and an assumption of six doses per year that the level of reactions per person to a HP program will range between 8.0% and 10.4%, or between 1.3% and 1.7% per dose. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 133 Table 4.5-1 Reactions to Remedies in Golden's Long-Term HP Program Reactions to HP - per person Reactions to HP - per dose (estimated) Series 1-5 50/708 7.1 1.2 Series 6-10 83/817 10.0 1.7 Series 1-15 215/2342 9.2 1.5 Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 134 The classification of the inte nsity and duration of these re actions for Series 11-15 of Golden's HP program is summarised in Table 5.2-2 below. Not all responses by parents showed the intensity or duration of reactio ns, and so the Table shows the figures both for all responses, as well as the figures that exclude responses where no details were given. Further, figures are shown for (a) all reactions that are classified as either \"possible\" or \"definite\", as well as (b) just for reactions classified as \"definite\". The \"definite\" figures are shown in brackets. Note that the classification of reactions in to \"definite\" and \"possible\" is subjective, but is a necessary attempt to weight the value of the information provided by parents according to certainty. The classifications have been published for review (Golden, 1997). Note also that the count in Table 5.2-2 is by respondent. The reason for this is that not all parents who reported a reaction to more than one remedy made clear which reaction was associated with which remedy. There were 82 definite repor ts of reactions to kit re medies. However, 14 parents reported definite reactions to two diseases. Th at means that there were 68 questionnaire responses covering the 82 definite remedy reactions. Table 5.2-1 reports that defin ite reactions were reported in less than 1.5% of doses. The analysis of responses in Table 5.2-2 s hows that most were m ild (56.7%), and very few were strong (1.5%). The fi gures showed that 41.8% were classified as moderate in intensity. The data shows that homoeopathic reme dies containing only the \"energy\" of substances can produce definite and obser vable changes in infants and young children where the likelihood of a pl acebo effect is small. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 135The clear majority of res pondents (85.7%) who described th e reactions stated that they were brief, lasting between 1-5 days . In fact only 2 respondents who reported a reaction classified as moderate or strong also reported that the reaction was more than brief. Another 11 did not indicate the duration of the reaction. The general comments of these 13 respondents were checked to see if there was any evidence of long-term health problems. One respondent (#11138) reported that her child had contracted whooping cough and was still un well 6 months later. Two others (#14221 and #15110) repeated comments on the reactions that they had already reported. The others either made no comments, or positive co mments about the health of their children. Thus it seems reasonable to conclude that whilst reactions to the remedies in the HP program are possible, and whilst very fe w do last more than a few days, the overwhelming experience of most children using the program is that short-term reactions are very unlikely, and those that do o ccur are usually mild and brief.

The analysis examines results from each body of data in turn. 4.5.2.1 The Long-Term Safety of Golden's HP Program A classification of general comments made by Series 11-15 respondents to Golden's HP program was made to assess the long-term wellbeing of children using the program. These comments are shown in Appendix 1 in Table 1.5-5. A summary of responses is shown in Tables 5.2-3 and 5.2-4 below. Table 5.2-3 shows the breakdown of all comm ents into \"positive\", \"neutral\" and \"negative\" for comments\", \"administration of the program\" and \"other comments\". However, the very large percentage of co mments in the \"neutr al\" categories means that a meaningful analysis of the figures is difficult. Therefore, \"neutral\" comments are removed in Table 5.2-4 and only positive and negative comments are recorded. They provide a more accurate indication of the relative strengths or weaknesses of the program. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 138Table 4.5-3 Classification of \"Other\" Comments Health Related Comments Administration of the Program Other Comments # % # % # % Positive 72 62.1 11 13.7 52 37.4 Neutral 38 32.8 40 50.0 81 58.3 Negative 6 5.1 29 36.3 6 4.3 Total 116 100.0 80 100.0 139 100.0 Table 4.5-4 A Re-Classification of \"Other\" Comments Health Related Comments Administration of the Program Other Comments # % # % # % Positive 72 92.3% 11 27.5% 52 89.7% Negative 6 7.7% 29 78 100.0% 40 100.0% 58 100.0% Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 139Three conclusions may be drawn from the data in Table 5.2-4. 1. Parents of children using the program w ho commented on the health of their child reported significantly more positive health experiences (92.3%) than negative ones (7.7%). This longer-term figure, combined with earlier findings of a less than 2% reaction rate per dose, suggests that the program is safe both in the short and long terms. 2. Parents of children using the program who commented on the administration of the program reported a significant level of problems (72.5%). These problems mainly related to difficulties in administering the pi lules, especially the need to dose between meals. There is little that can be done to change the method of administration since giving doses with meals would antidote most doses. Fortunately these administration difficulties were reported in only 3.55 % of total responses (29/817). They cease to be an issue when the child is older and does not require regular feeding. 3. Parents of children using the program who made general comments on their experience with the program were generally very happy (89.7%) with only a minority (10.3%) voicing discontent. The comments by Series 11-15 parents whose children used Golden's long-term HP program strongly suggest that these childre n experience very few long-term problems with their health, and in fact many pos itive comments are made about how well the children are. These data suggest that the long-term safety of the program is high. A more exact analysis of l ong-term health, investigating actual diseases experienced by children aged between 4 and 12 years of age, was made using data from the General Health Survey for children using HP and/ or other methods of disease prevention. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 1404.5.2.2 The Long-Term Safety of HP Programs Used in the General Health Survey The safety of HP is now examined in absolute terms, as well as being compared to three other methods of infectious disease prevention used by parents who responded to the General Health Survey - vaccination, general pr evention, and no prevention. 4.5.2.2.1 The Absolute Safety of HP The first task of the analysis to define a useful measure of the safety of HP. The data from the General Health Survey link five health conditions - asthma, eczema, ear/hearing problems, allergies, behavioural problems - with different methods of immunisation, including HP. The incidence of each condition in children who used HP is used to provide a measure of the safety of HP. Two statistical measures of this incidence may be calculated. 1. Proportion (SHP1) = Persons with the Condition (using HP only) All Persons (HP only) The lower the value of SHP1, the more sa fe the method (HP). This proportion is compared to the national average for each condition, where available. The figure is also calculated for conditions where a diagnosis was made by a GP, and this was compared with the total figures for all conditions. Whilst a GP diagnosis may not always be correct, and other diagnoses may not always be incorrect, it does give another insight into the reli ability of the total figure. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 141 2. Odds Ratio (SHP2) = Condition (using HP only) / Condition (not using HP) No Condition (HP only) No Condition (not using HP) If the Odds Ratio was greater than 1 the me thod would be associated with an increase in the incidence of the conditi on, and therefore classified as unsafe. For a method to be regarded as very safe we would expect the Odds Ratio to be significantly below 1. For example, the following classification of the incidence of a condition, suggesting degrees of safety, is shown in Table 5.2-5. This classification provides a subjective guide only to the safety of a method. This then allows for some conclusions to be drawn as to whether HP is associated with a change in the incidence of a condition in a way that will allow the method to be classified a being safe or unsafe. Table 4.5-5 Estimation of Degrees of Safety Using the Incidence of Health Conditions 0.00 < Odds Ratio 0.25 - method estimated as being very safe 0.25 < Odds Ratio 0.50 - method estimated as being safe 0.50 < Odds Ratio 0.75 - method estimated as being moderately safe 0.75 < Odds Ratio 1.00 - method estimated as being not safe Odds Ratio > 1.00 - method estimated as being unsafe In addition to the Odds Ratio, the Chi Squared probability of the association between \"the use of HP\" and \"the observed cond ition\" being a coincidence is calculated. A measure will not be accepted unless its confidence limit is at least 95%. This requires a Chi Squared probability of 0.05 or less. The lower the figure the greater the likelihood that the association reflected in the Odds Ratio is not a co-incidence. These ratios and probability estimates are listed in Table 5.2-6 below. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 142Table 4.5-6 Ratio Analysis of the Es timates of the Safety of HP Only Condition Proportion (SHP1) Odds Ratio (SHP2) Chi Squared Probability Results No GP diagnosis With GP diagnosis National Average Safety Confidence Asthma 0.03 0.03 0.16** - 0.19* 0.117 0.0004 Very safe Very Nil Allergies 0.15 0.04 0.09 - 0.16** 0.550 0.07 Moderately safe Medium Behaviour 0.04 0.01 N/A 0.446 0.17 Safe Low References: * (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1999). ** (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2001b). Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 143 The figure for SHP1 shows that the inci dence of asthma among children who use only HP as a method of disease prevention (3%) is well below the national average of 19%. It further shows that the incidence of behavioural problems is extremely low, with very modest levels for the remaining conditions. However, the Odds Ratio is the more reliable of the two figures. It is less than unity for every condition studied, which shows that HP is not linked with an increase in the incidence of any of th e conditions examined. Further, we can say with a high probability (P>98%) that HP is associated with a lower than average chance of acquiring asthma and eczema, with a moderate probability (P=93%) of developing fewer allergies, a nd with a low probability of having fewer behavioural problems (P=83%) than children not using onl y HP. The result linking HP only with ear and hearing problems indicated that HP only was unsafe; however, the result was not statistically significant. Thus, in absolute terms HP is shown to be a safe method of disease prevention. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 1444.5.2.2.2 The Safety of HP Compared to Vaccination, General Protection and a Do-Nothing Option We shall now assess safety by comparing HP to the other methods of disease prevention being studied. One general measure of the relative safe ty of HP can be gauged by parent's assessments of the long-term general health of their child. The accumulated parental rankings of wellbeing are s hown in Figure 5.2-1 below. The graphs show that HP consistently ranks higher than other methods of immunisation when ranking the l ong-term health of children. For example, 54.5% of parents whose child ren used HP only ranked the health of their children at '10' (e xcellent health), whereas the percentage was 50.2% among vaccinated children, 45.8% for children using general protection, and 51.1% for children using no method of prevention. The relevant figures for the combined hea lth rakings of '9' and '10' were 84.8% for HP, 71.5% for vaccination, 77.1% for genera l protection and 78.8% for no method of protection. At every point of measure HP was associ ated with the highest accumulated ranking of general health.

This relationship is examined in Table 5.2-7 below. The measures for each condition that are st atistically significant are shown in bold print. The relationship between the five conditions and HP programs supplied by Golden is also shown. The difference between HP programs supplied by Golden and other HP programs is discussed fully in Ch apter 5.5 below. A significant difference is found. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 147Table 4.5-7 The Relative Safety of HP - All Conditions Method Condition Measurement HP only Vaccination only General only Nothing HP supplied by Golden Asthma Odds Ratio 0.117 1.75 0.464 Statistically significant figures are shown in bold typeHomoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 148 We may summarize the statistically si gnificant findings (P>= 95%) for each condition using the above data as follows: Asthma - we can say with P>99% confidence that HP is 15 times safer than vaccination and 6 times safer than no method of protection. Eczema - we can say with P>98% that HP is 1.8 times safer than no method of protection. Ears/Hearing Problems, Allergies, Behavioral Problems - we are not able to draw conclusions about the safety of HP w ith a greater than 95% probability that the conclusion is correct. Thus, for the two conditions where statis tically significant results were found, HP was the safest option in both conditions wh en compared with vaccination and the do- nothing option. This result also applied to HP programs supplied by Golden. The overall reliability of these measures can be tested by re-examining the above results, but only including those conditions that have been diagnosed by a medical practitioner. Of course not all such diagnoses may be correct. Further, diagnoses made by non-medical practitioners or by parents th emselves may be quite valid. These new figures are shown in Table 5.2-8 below. It seems reasonable to assume that if the overall rankings of safety in the Tables 5.2- 7 and 5.2-8 are consistent, then the results are reliable. We find that many more measures in Ta ble 5.2-8 have P>95% than in Table 5.2-7. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 149Table 4.5-8 The Relative Safety of HP - All Conditions - GP Diagnoses Only Condition Measurement HP only Vaccination only General only Nothing Asthma Odds Ratio 0.124 1.89 0.49 0.69 significant figures are shown in bold typeHomoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 150We may summarise the findings using the above data as follows for each condition, including only those readings with P>95%: Asthma - we can say with P>99% that HP is 15 times safer than vaccination and 5.6 times safer than no method of protection. Note is made of the similarity of this re sult to the finding by Od ent and others that asthma is 5.43 times more likely to occur in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated children (Odent, 1994, pp592-3). Eczema - we can say with P>99% that HP is 7.4 times safer than vaccination, with P>97% that HP is 0.06 times less safe than ge neral protection, and with P>99% that HP is 2.8 times safer than no method of protection. Ear/Hearing Problems - we are not able to draw conclusions about the safety of HP with a greater than 95% probability that the conclusion is corre ct. However, we can say with P>95% that Vaccination is 3.9 less safe than doing nothing Allergies - we can say with P>94% that HP is 5 times safer than vaccination, and with P>99% that HP is 2 times safer than no method of protection. Behavioral Problems - we are not able to draw c onclusions about the safety of HP with a greater than 95% probability that the conclusion is correct. However, we can say with P>95% confidence that do ing nothing is twice as safe as general protection. We can say with P=94.5% confidence th at HP is the safest option. Examining the statistically significant results from both tables, we find that only once was HP shown to be less safe than a nother method, and that was only 0.06 times less safe in that instance. Thus we may conclude that, with the excep tions of ear and hearing problems, we can say with a high level of probability (P>95%) th at HP is relatively a very safe method of disease prevention. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 151The profile of participants in the Genera l Health Survey will now be examined to determine whether the participants were a re presentative cross section of the Australian community. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 1524.6 Participant Profiles from the General Health Survey The results are presented in descriptive form to show the general characteristics of the children participating in the survey, and to highlight any appare nt anomalies in the data, or any signifi cant differences between the su rvey population and the national population that may produce bias in the results. 4.6.1 Descriptive Profile of the Respondents the General Health Survey The following respondent profile covers the three main areas of the survey questionnaire. Each area is examined separately in Chapters 5.3.1.1, 5.3.1.2 and 5.3.1.3 following. 4.6.1.1 Data relating to general information about the early childhood experiences of the participants The general information about the early ch ildhood experiences of the participants included birth weight, whether breast-fe d, APGAR scores, gestation term, and immunisation status, as well as age and sex. Where available, information from the 2001 Au stralian National Ce nsus Data is used to give an indication of how typical the survey population is compared to the national population. If not available, other informati on is used where available and relevant. Reference Note: where references in th is chapter to material provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) we re obtained from the ABS internet site, no page numbers are given as the material wa s provided as a conti nuous report without clear page differentiation. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 153(i) Age The age profile of respondents is show n in Figure 5.3-1 below, which reveals a reasonably even spread of ages over most targeted years. This is compared to the national averages (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2003a). Although the initial targ et range was 5-12 year old children, it was decided to include the group of 4 year olds (i) be cause they were in their 5 th year of life and were old enough to have experienced a range of heath issues and (ii) because the size of the response group at this age (42 children) was a valuable addition to the study. The relatively poor response rate from this group reflects the fact that many parents of 4 year old children would have believed that their child was not e ligible for this study (early information called for 5-12 year old particip ants) and thus would not have offered to complete a questionnaire. The two groups, 5<6 and 7<8, contained noticeably more respondents than the national average (14.7% compared to 10.8%, and 15.1% compared to 11.2% respectively), and the 12 year old group noticeably less (8.2% compared to 11.3%). No reason for this is known, but there is also no apparent reason why this may cause any bias in the results. (ii) Sex Respondents are fairly evenly distribu ted between males (52.0%) and females (48.0%), as shown in Figure 5.3-2, and this ve ry closely matched the national averages (51.1% and 48.9% respectively) (Austr alian Bureau of Statistics 2003a). (iii) Birthweight The range of respondents' birth weights was evenly distributed eith er side of the 3-4 kg group, which is typical and expect ed (0.7%, 2.1%, 16.7%, 65.5%, 15.0%). The Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 154distribution is shown in Figur e 5.3-3. The distribution among the target group is similar to the national distribution found in 1996 (0.7%, 1.8%, 18.9%, 67.0%, 11.6%) ((Lancaster et al. 1996).

Nearly half of all respondents (49.3%) reported breastfeeding their children for between 6-18 months. 16% of children breast fed for less than 3 months or not at all, whilst nearly a quarter (23.5%) were breastfed for over 18 months. When comparing these figures with the nationa l trends in Figure 5.2-5 it is clear that breastfeeding rates are consistently higher in the survey group. The rate of decline in breastfeeding as the child ages, is similar to the national rate (A ustralian Bureau of Statistics, 2003c). For example, 74% of the survey group breastfed for at least 6 months compared to 48% in the na tional population, and 23.5% of the survey group breastfed for 18 months compared to 5% in the na tional population. The mean length of time being breastfed for children in the survey was 13 months. The comparable figure was not available from the Austra lian Bureau of Statistics. (v) APGAR Scores The collection of the APGAR scores proved difficult for many parents, as evidenced by the high non-response rate of over one thir d of respondents shown in Figure 5.2-6. In some cases records were not kept, and in fact the parents of some of the children in the survey may not have received th e APGAR scores for their child. Those who did respond reported a higher second sc ore as is expected due to the nature of the test. For example, 256 reported a first APGAR score of 9 or 10, whilst the number rose to 413 for the 2 nd APGAR test. No national data was found showing APGAR scores. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 159Note that the actual data supporting Figure 5.3-6 to Figure 5.3-16 are shown in Table 5.6-2 following.Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 160Figure 4.6-4 Length of Breastfeeding 0510152025 % Not breastfed< 3 3 < 6 6 < 12 12 < 18 18 < 24 24 + No resp MonthsBreastfeeding Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 161Figure 4.6-5 Proportion of Children Breastfed by Age Proportion of Children Breastfed by Age 020406080100 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19- 21 Age in Months%Surv ey ABS Data Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 162Figure 4.6-6 APGAR Scores Apgar Scores 051015202530354045 0123456789 1 0 N .

Of the remaining 21.4%, Figure 5.2-7 show s the percentage of these respondents who reported that the birth of their child was either premature or late. As can be seen, even though the percentage s are small, some children were born very prematurely (4% over 6 weeks). The number s of children going over term were small (1%) compared to the premature group, but natio nal figures are not available to compare to a national average. (vii) Vitamin K Whilst a majority of respondents reported th at their child had re ceived a Vitamin K injection, 25.6% said they did not. This is s hown in Figure 5.2-8. It is thus probable that the Vitamin K injection is refused more ofte n by parents surveyed than by parents in the general community, and suggests that many re spondents chose to make their own health decisions, independent of orthodox medical advice that recommends a Vitamin K injection following birth.Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 164Figure 4.6-7 Term of Delivery 01234567 % <1 1 < 22 < 33 < 44 < 66 + WeeksPremature/Late Premature Late Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 165Figure 4.6-8 Incidence of Vitamin K Injections 0102030405060 % Yes No No Response InjectionVitamin K Injection Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 166 (viii) Method of Disease Prevention Three methods of disease prevention were considered in the survey - vaccination, HP, and general or constitutional preven tion. The experience of those who used no method of disease prevention at all was also examined. The method of disease prevention adopted by respondents is shown below. Actual numbers are shown in Figure 5.2-9 instead of percentages because there is a significant amount of multiple-use of methods, i.e. re spondents whose children were vaccinated and used HP and/or general or constitutional prevention. Whilst the majority of respondents vaccina ted their children (58.0%), as would be expected, a significant number also used HP (20.4%) and/or general or constitutional prevention (24.3%). 18% of respondents reported that they used no method of disease prevention at all. This is a surprisingly high figure, the implications of which shall be considered later in the analysis. National figures for vaccination are available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, but figures are variable. Table 3 - Immunised Children Aged 0 to 6 Years , gives a figure of 54% for fully vaccinated 0-6 year olds in 2001. However vaccination rates for individual vaccines was around 78%. In Table 4 - ACIR estimates of vaccination coverage for Australian children 2002 - the figure for fully vaccinated children aged 72-74 months was 82.2% (Aus tralian Bureau of Statistics, 2002). Whilst no exact national figures are ava ilable for the other categories being examined, it is expected that the national av erage would show much lower rates for the use of HP and/or general or constitutional prevention. Thus it is clear that the sample popula tion contains relatively fewer vaccinated children and relatively more using HP and general protection than found in the general Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 167community. This may create biases in the fo llowing analysis, and this factor will be carefully considered. A positive aspect of the data from the perspe ctive of this research is that sufficient numbers of respondents used all 3 methods of disease prevention considered to allow statistically significant compar ative results to be produced The use of more than one method of diseas e prevention has meant that eight different possibilities need to be examined. These are shown in Table 5.2-1 and Figure 5.2-10. The detailed statistical analysis above a nd following examined each of these options, with particular reference to the relative sa fety and effectiveness of HP to the other methods.

The parental ranking of the general health of their child is shown in Figure 5.3-11. This shows that over 79.5% of parents believed their child was healthy (ranking from 8-10). This belief was tested by two later que stions which asked whether their child had ongoing health problems (19.8% said yes), a nd the numbers of children who had been hospitalised (38.9% had). In addition, most children (69.5%) had consulted a health professional and a bare majority (50 .3%) received some form of special supplementation. Examining the incidence of specific conditions further tested the general health of children, and the results are s hown in Figure 5.3-12 below. An incidence rate of chronic illness of around 20% is noted. This is in line with the National Health Surv ey by the Australian Bureau of Statistics that showed that 27% of Australian children less than 5 years of age have at least one chronic health condition (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2001b), although the national figure is higher than the survey average.

The results clearly demonstrated that most parents were prepared to consult a medical practitioner when they were concerned for th e physical wellbeing of their children. This is shown in Figure 5.3-13 and is expecte d. The figures ranged from 84.5% diagnosed for asthma to 17.6% diagnosed for behavioural problems.

Figure 5.3-14 shows the percentage of respondents who experienced Measles (10.2%), Mumps (0.9%) and Whooping Cough (8.3%). These diseases were targeted in the Questionnaire because they usually are covered by an HP program, and therefore are relevant when measuring the effectiveness of HP. 52.8% of respondents reported other infec tious diseases. These would include diseases such as the common cold, chicken pox, and influenza, but as most HP programs do not cover them, they are not c onsidered in the comparative analysis. The percentage of children whose diseas e was diagnosed by a medical practitioner was also questioned. This is shown in Figure 5.3-15. When compared to Figure 5.3-13 it clearly shows that parents took the long-te rm conditions experienced by their children more seriously (in contacting medical practi tioners) than the infectious diseases the children experienced. It will surprise some to find that a doct or was consulted more often in cases of measles (44.3%) than in cases of whooping c ough (31.0%), which is a potentially more life-threateni ng condition. What is even more surprising is the very high level of diseases experienced by the children surveyed. Exact comparisons with national figures are not possible, however the data from the ABS Health and communicable diseases data gives some idea of the wide variance in the figures for Measles and Whooping Cough in particular (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2003d). Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 177 The ABS report stated that in 2001, notifica tions for the targeted diseases were: Measles 141 Whooping Cough 9,565 Mumps 114 Given that the notification figures are anec dotally based, it woul d appear likely that the ABS figures for the incidence of measles are understated. These figures show a 68 times greater chance of acquiring whooping co ugh than measles. Given that it is probable that some parents are still happy to treat measles in healthy children at home (as was widely done in previous decades), thus GP reports underestimate the true incidence of the disease. If, for the purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that all notifications were in the 4- 12 years age group (useful, even though clearly incorrect), then the expected figures for an \"average\" group of 781 children would become Measles 0.05 Whooping Cough 3.1 Mumps 0.04 This compares to the survey figures for diseases diagnosed by a GP of Measles 50 Whooping Cough 30 Mumps 1 This clearly shows that either the survey group were very different to the national population in terms of the incidence of the ta rgeted infectious diseases, or that the national notifications significan tly underestimate the true incidence of these diseases or, as is most likely, both are true.

These results are typical in the sense that they reflect a high preparedness (68.1%) to consult orthodox medical practitioners. They also reveal a high preparedness to consult naturopaths (26.6%) and especially homoeopaths (33.3%). This latter experience is expected, and reflects the fact that 20.4% of respondents used an HP program, as shown in Figure 5.3-9 above. However, it reveals a survey population that is not typical of the general community where consultations with naturopaths are much more common th an consultations with homoeopaths. An insight into national use of medical therapists was found in the ABS regional statistics for Tasmania which showed that in the 2 weeks prior to being interviewed for the 2001 National Health Survey, 23.5% of Tasm anians consulted a GP or a specialist and 12.3% consulted other health professiona ls which would have included natural therapists (Australian Bu reau of Statistics, 2001). No precise figures are available on consulta tions with naturopaths and homoeopaths, however, it is estimated that a figur e of at least 5:1 is realistic.

The by-State distribution of respondents was very different to the actual population distribution in Australia as shown in the June 2001 Nationa l Census (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2003b). The exceptions were A.C.T., Western Aust ralia and Victoria, where the survey and the census figures were similar. Some reasons for these differences are: New South Wales - 13.2% of respondents in th e survey compared to 33.9% of national population. One reason for the relative poor response from the most populated State was due to the refusal of the NSW Education Depart ment to allow the questionnaire to be distributed through the NSW Prim ary School system. This refusal was a direct result of the NSW Health Department advising the Education Department not to allow the research to be conducted. Queensland -13.2% of respondents in the survey compared to 18.7% of national population. This difference may have in part been due to the geographical distance from the researcher's home state (Victoria) and Qu eensland, making awareness of the research more difficult. South Australia - 18.7% of respondents in the survey compared to 7.8% of national population. In this case the larger relative numbers achieved by the survey are directly attributable to the kind support offered by th e S.A. Education Department, who allowed details of the research to be sent to primary schools in their State. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 183Tasmania - 18.7% of respondents in the surv ey compared to 2.4% of national population. A similar reason is found for the relatively large numbers from Tasmania. In this case some individual primary school principals were very supportive of the survey and circulated details to the parents of children at their school. Table 5.4-1 shows a brief comparison of res ponses to selected questions where the response was obtained from the general community and through primary schools.

State%Survey Census Data 2001 Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 1854.6.2 Major Differences Between the Survey and National Populations The following major differences exist between the survey and the national populations: 1. Children in the survey group were 15-25% more likely to be breastfed than children in the ge neral population. 2. It is probable that Vitamin K injections were refused more in the survey group than in the general population. 3. Many more children in the survey group used HP and general/constitutional prevention than in the general population, and vaccination rates were lower. 4. A much higher than expected inci dence of Measles, Whooping Cough and Mumps was found in the survey group, even when examining only diseases diagnosed by a GP. This may reflect a motivation for joining the survey group, or bring into question the accuracy of th e national figures for notifications of infectious diseases. Whatever the reason( s) the survey population is definitely not typical of the national population in this regard. This suggests that the validity of the General Health Survey data in regard to the effectiveness of the different methods of disease prevention must be questioned. 5. A higher than expected number of ch ildren in the survey group consulted homoeopaths. This relates directly to point 3 above. 6. The by-State distribution of participants was di fferent to the national distribution for the reasons shown above. Thus the profile of the children surveyed in the General Health Survey was noticeably different to the pr ofile of children in the gene ral population. In some ways this difference is fortunate; otherwise, sta tistically significant figur es relating to the use of HP would not have been av ailable due to the relatively infrequent use of HP believed to occur in the general population. However, this difference means that the va lidity of the figures for effectiveness of different disease prevention methods used by respondents to the Gene ral Health Survey must be examined with care to ensure that no biases are present to distort the figures. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 186Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 1874.7 A Comparison of School and Non-School Respondents As stated in Chapter 4, participants in the General Health Survey were attracted by advertising in the general community and through some primary schools in Tasmania and South Australia, and a few schools in Victoria. The general responses classified by source of data are shown in Table 5.6-2 at the end of this Chapter. The main result s are summarised in Table 5.4-1 below. Some of the major differences between the two groups of respondents (labelled GC for General Community and PS for Primary Schools) are: 1. The GC respondents are 15 months younge r on average than PS respondents. 2. Disease Prevention methods differ signifi cantly between the two groups. One third of GC respondents used HP, but only 2% in PS group. Half of the GC group vaccinated their children compared to over 70% of the PS group. One third of the GC group used general prevention compared to 14% of the PS group, although the numbers that used general prevention exclusively were very lo w (9% and 2% respectively). Thus the GC group used non-vaccination preventative me thods much more actively than the PS group. In this way the PS group reflected the broader community, and the GC group reflected those parents who more actively investigate use natural health options. However 25% of the PS group reported that they used no form of prevention, suggesting most adopted a \"vaccinate or nothing\" approach 3. The PS group reported fewer problems with allergies and ears and hearing, but more asthma, eczema and behavioural problems. This is probably directly linked to their greater use of vaccination rather than HP. 4. The GC group reported more infectious diseases than the PS group, once again probably reflecting their disease prevention preferences. The two groups are clearly different. If the General Health Survey is repeated in future research, a significan t collection of respondents thr ough the State Primary School Systems would produce a study group most closely resembling the national population. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 188The one disadvantage of relying on the primary school group is that it may not produce enough respondents who used HP and general/constitutio nal prevention to produce statistically significant comparative results. This would be remedied if a very large sample was collected. A sample of 5,000 responses should be sufficient.

It was possible, through matching respondents' names and addresses, to identify which respondents to the General Health Survey purchased their program from Golden. It is possible that some respondents w ho did not purchase an HP program from Golden still used a program purchased from another practitioner who copied Golden's program. However, it was not possible to id entify these respondents from the data collected. A comparison between respondents using programs purchased from Golden and programs not purchased from Golden revealed noticeable differences. The actual numbers of respondents is shown in Table 5.5- 1, and proportions are reported in Tables 5.5-2 and 5.5-3. The result in Table 5.5-2 shows that using HP alone gives a better result than using HP combined with other forms of disease prevention. This suggests that some users may have had a bad experience with other fo rms of prevention and then switched to HP, but this cannot be proved from the figures. A comparison was reported in Table 5.5-3 between conditions and diseases for all HP users, and those who used HP only. All but one comparison (allergies - HP only) showed a better result for the programs supplied by Golden. However, the size of data collected does not allow the statistical significance of these comparisons to be calculated. Chi Squared tests were performed to compare programs supplied by Golden and programs not supplied by Golden. An odds ratio >1 would show an unfavourable result Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 191for programs supplied by Golden, and a resu lt <1 would be favourable to Golden's program. The following results were statistically significant, and all showed that Asthma and the three diseases studied are all less likely to occur if a program supplied by Golden is used compared to one not supplied by Golden. Asthma: All HP: Odds Ratio = 0.28; P = 96% Measles: All HP: Odds Ratio = 0.33; P = 95%; HP Only: Odds Ratio = 0; P = 94% Whooping Cough: HP Only: Odds Ratio = 0; P = 97% Mumps: HP Only: Odds Ratio = 0; P = 100% Finally, Figure 5.5-1 showing the accumulate d parental rankings of their child's wellbeing indicates that HP programs supplied by Golden rank consistently with the other options, being top at the accu mulated '9' and '10' rankings. The results show that the type of HP pr ogram used does make a difference. They indicate, with some degree of significance, that children using HP programs supplied by Golden acquired fewer infectious diseases a nd reported fewer adverse long-term health conditions.

It must be stated at the outset of this di scussion that the study of this thesis may be biased because the long-ter m HP program studied here has been used, with minor amendments, since 1986, implying a satisfaction with the relative safety and efficacy of the program being studied. Every effort has been made to ensure that data collection and cl assification has been objective, and that conclusions are reasonably based on the data and the data alone, thus limiting the likelihood of this pot ential bias. The aim of allo wing the data to provide the final answer has been paramount, and unexpected results have been welcomed as growing the body of established knowledge in the field. The determination whether HP can safely prev ent targeted infectious diseases required a test to be developed. The test suggested in Chapter 2.2.2 was whether HP yields results that are consistent, predictable, repeatable and observable. It is clear that some results reported in this thesis pass this test, and some do not. The effectiveness of HP and the safety of HP are both important aspects of the topic. However, if the conclusions presented in Chapter 7 are in any way controversial it will inevitably relate to the issue of effec tiveness, for one very simple reason. Homoeopathic remedies are prepared using a series of dilutions and succussions (or triturations for solids). In the potencies used for HP, no molecules of any active Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 228ingredient are present in the final product. \"Nothing\" cannot be toxic. Therefore even orthodox critics of HP would ackno wledge that there is no toxic risk associated with their use. These critics may argue that HP involves an indirect risk because its use causes vaccines not to be used, and therefore they ma y argue that the risk of a child acquiring an infectious disease increases if HP is used (this argument is not releva nt if the parents of a child have already decided not to vaccinate ir respective of whether th ey use HP or not). So the level of effectivene ss of HP would, for such critics, determine its level of safety. If it could be shown that HP is as effective as vaccinati on, then their one issue relating to safety would be resolved. The fact that orthodox health authorities state in \"offici al\" documents that HP is ineffective, means that any finding to the cont rary will be viewed with suspicion. This is especially so because their statement is not based on research or evidence, but solely on the fact that the homoeopathic paradigm is di fferent and apparently incompatible to the orthodox \"scientific\" paradigm, i.e., it is \"impossible\" for HP to be effective. In fact the people who remain to be convin ced that HP is not di rectly unsafe come from that small section of the homoeopathic community itself who feel that the long-term use of high potency remedies for prevention may in some \"energetic\" way damage the recipient. So the discussion in this Chapter will be di vided into a discussion of effectiveness and a discussion of safety. The first part will be clearly aimed at the majority of the orthodox community who believe that HP is ineffectiv e. The second part will be especially aimed at those few homoeopaths who believe that a long-term HP program is unsafe. Of course, if objective evidence can be presented supporting effectiveness and/or safety then it should be acceptable to an objective analyst whatev er their professional background. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 229 5.2 The Effectiveness of Homoeoprophylaxis HP has been used for over 200 years. Those practitioners who have reported their use of HP describe a generally positive experience showing that recipients of HP were less likely to acquire an infectious disease to wh ich they were exposed, than others with no protection. It is reasonable to ask - should the accumulat ed weight of clinical evidence eventually become sufficient for the repeated experience of responsible and competent practitioners to be accepted as proof of effectiveness? If the answer was \"yes\", then HP would be generally accepted already. The fact that the answer by health authorit ies is \"no\" means that rigorous data collections are needed to provide generally accepted proof of effectiveness. The previous reports showing the effectiv eness of HP, reported in Table 2.5-1, and the new results reported in Chapter 5, are combin ed here into a complete list of research findings into the effectiveness of HP and are shown in Table 6.2-1. The types of reports are varied. For example, most reports examined the use of HP in specific epidemic situations with follow- up continuing for no more than one year. In some of these reports the genus epidemicus remedy was tested, and in others the related Nosode was used. Golden's research published in 1997 as well as the new re search undertaken as part of this thesis examined th e non-epidemic use of HP with follow-up continuing up to 10 years, with use of both the relevant Nos ode and the genus epidemicus remedy from previous outbreaks. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 230The effectiveness of short-term HP use re ported in the literature was consistently around 90% (varying between 82% and 97.5%). The effectiveness of long-term HP programs was also around 90%. In this study, the results of using Golden's long-term HP program are completely consistent with all the human studies of ef fectiveness that have been undertaken. So it can be concluded, subject to th e limitations of the data, that the effectiveness of HP of around 90% is supported on the basi s of practical results that are consistent, predictable, repeatable and observable. However the limitations of the data must be acknowledged as they mean that the findings are qualified. These limitations include the following: The sample size The low incidence of the targeted infectious diseases The reliance on parental assessments to evaluate exposure and incidence The difficulty in assessing disease incide nce even among experienced practitioners The presence of biases inherent in the study Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 231Table 5.2-1 Some Measures of Effe ctiveness of Homoeoprophylaxis Year Researcher Numbers of Participants Length of Survey Ages Type of Remedy Used Effectiveness % Evidence collected pr ior to this thesis 1907 Eaton 2,806 < 1 year Nosode 97.5 1950 Taylor-Smith 82 (12 definitely exposed) < 1 year all ages G.E. remedy 100.0 1963 Gutman 385 < 1 year adults Nosode 86.0 1975 Castro & Nogeira HP 18,640 Not HP 6,340 < 1 year Nosode 95.7 1987 English 694 2 years children Nosode 87.0 - 91.5 1987 Fox 61 5 years children Nosode 82.0 - 95.0 1998 Mroninski et al HP 65,826 Not HP 23,539 6 months 12 months 0 - 20 years Nosode 95.0 91.0 1997 Golden 593 children 1,305 questionnaires 10 years 1-5 years Nosode and GE 88.8 1999 Jonas 142 mice Nosode 22.0 Evidence collected/examined as part of this thesis 2003 Golden 2,342 15 years 1 - 5 years Nosode and GE 90.4 2003 Golden HP 159 Not HP 622 2 years 4 - 12 years Nosode and GE 79.2 Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 232The long-term use of Golden's HP program comprising mainly Nosodes has been the focus of the research reported in Chapte r 5. The potential biases and weaknesses of earlier research were identified to provide a checklist against which the new research reported in Chapter 5 could be tested. In order to validate the effectiveness Gold en's HP program, the eight additional tests listed in Chapter 5.1 were undertaken. They showed the following: 1. When a high level of accountability of responses (> 70%) was obtained during collection of an additional 5 years of data, the figure for effectiveness was practically unchanged. 2. When parents who did not originally re spond to the surveys were contacted to determine whether their expe rience with the HP program was similar to that of respondents, it was found that their experience was similar, and therefore it can assumed that the original figures were reliable. 3. When parents who reported that their child acquired an infectious disease covered by the HP program were contacted to verify the accuracy of their report, it was found that the resulting figure for eff ectiveness was practically unchanged. 4. When parents who reported that their ch ild was exposed to an infectious disease covered by the HP program were contacted to verify the accuracy of their report, it was found that the resulting figure for e ffectiveness was practically unchanged. 2. When the figures obtained for the long-term use of the author's HP program were compared to national attack rates for rele vant infectious diseas es (where available), it was found with P>95% that HP was efficacious. 3. When the reliability of the results were tested using indices of sensitivity and specificity , the results were found to be very reliable. 7. When the effectiveness HP was compared to other methods of disease prevention through the General Health St udy, it was found that the result s were not statistically significant. However the data appeared to i ndicate that the eff ectiveness of HP lay between that of vaccination and either general protection or no protection. 8. When the effectiveness of HP programs s upplied by Golden is compared to that of other HP programs it is found with P=95% that Golden's program is more effective. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 233Thus, the results reported in section 5.1 did not fail any of the above tests that were applied to them. However, one potential weakness in the l ong-term study that could not be corrected was the size of the data collection (2,342 responses). Given th at the risk of exposure to the infectious diseases studied is low, an extremely large number of responses would be needed to ensure that the figure for effec tiveness could not be challenged on any valid statistical basis. A further question relating to th e overall reliability of the data arose from the widely different disease incidence ra tes (per 781 children) between diseases reported in the General Health Survey and the ABS national averages respectively for measles (50 and 0.05), mumps (1 and 0.04) and whooping cough (30 and 3.1). It was concluded in Section 5.3.1.3 that the survey group were very different to the national population in terms of the incidence of the targeted in fectious diseases and that the national notifications probably un derestimated the true incidence of these diseases, especially for measles. This conclusion is reinforced by examini ng the comparable figures for 781 children from the long-term HP study, which show an expected average incidence for measles of 25, for mumps of 3 and for whooping cough of 18. These figures are largely based on parental diagnoses which would be expect ed to overestimate the incidence of the diseases. These long-term figures are certa inly still well above th e national average. However it would be interesting to see what national averages would be if every parent in Australia was asked whether their child ha d contracted one of th e targeted diseases. The resulting effect on the reliability of th e figures for HP effectiveness due to these differences is uncertain. The potential problem associated with c onfounding variables has b een considered. It is only a potential problem in the General Health Survey. In that study, respondents using the four immunisations options (v accination, HP, general protection, and no protection) appeared fairly evenly spread across variables such as the incidence of chronic illness, whether seen by a therapis t, and whether breastfed. The one exception Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 234related to question 5 in the General Health Su rvey ' Does your child receive any special treatments to strengthen their general h ealth, such as: naturopathic, homoeopathic, herbal, nutritional, special diet - yes / no'. The responses showed that many more children using HP (89.5%) and general protec tion (77.3%) used special treatments than did vaccinated children (45.8%) or children given no form of immunisation (42.2%). This might suggest that children in the fi rst two categories would be healthier than other children, and thus bias the results. However these two groups needed to consult a practitioner for health problems slightly more often (90.5% and 83.8% respectively), than did vaccinated children (82.9%). This w ould appear to suggest that they are not inherently healthier than the vaccinated group, and may in fact be using special treatments because of existing health probl ems. Thus the issue of confounding remains unresolved, and possibly wo rthy of further study. Finally, it must be noted that the findings of the General Health Survey showed that different HP programs produce different levels of effectiveness and safety. This means that the conclusions drawn regarding the HP program studied in this thesis cannot be automatically extended to every available HP program. This is a significant point when considering implications for public health policy as in Se ction 6.4 below. HP programs would need to satisfy certain fundament al requirements regarding remedy choice, potency and dose in order to ensure a similar result to that found with Golden's program. Thus we have a method of disease prevention that has been used for 200 years throughout the world by practitioners with both orthodox and complementary medicine training. Its effective use as a method of disease prevention has been documented clinically since 1801, and the prac tical results show an effec tiveness that is consistent, predictable, repeatable and observable. We can conclude with 95% confidence, based on the data provided, that the effectiveness of Golden's HP program bei ng studied ranges between 87.3% and 93.1%. However, the qualifying statement \"based on the data provided\" means that the conclusion will remain open to challenge until a larger data base is collected with a clearly defined control group agai nst which to make comparisons.Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 235 5.3 The Safety of Homoeoprophylaxis As stated at the beginning of this Chapte r, HP remedies are not physically toxic and therefore there is little ch ance of adverse reactions ba sed on molecular toxicity. However, it is still appropriate study any reactio ns to the remedies, as well as show that no other long-term adverse health events are related to the use of the method. The safety of HP is assessed in the following seven ways: (1) Clinical observations over the last 200 years, discussed in Chapter 2, have consistently reported on the safety of HP. (2) Conceptually it was shown in Chapter 3 that HP is consistent with the Law of Similars. So there is no apparent reason w hy an appropriately structured HP program should cause any long-term adverse health effects. (3) Immediate reactions to doses of HP reported in Chapter 5, were found in 9.2% of children using the kit, or an estimated 1.6% of doses. The reactions themselves were typically mild and brief. (4) The long-term health of children using the HP program was reported in Chapter 5 by their parents to be very good 92.3% of the time, with only 7.7% of negative reports. (5) The general health of children using HP was assessed by their parents, in Chapter 5, to be greater than the assessm ent given by parents of children who used vaccination, general protection and no protection at all. (6) The absolute safety of HP was measured in Chapter 5 by examining the likelihood that HP would increase the ch ance of a child acquiring asthma, eczema, Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 236ear/hearing, allergies and beha vioural problems. In no condition was HP likely to cause an increase in the incidence of a condition. (7) The relative safety of HP was measured in Chapter 5 by comparing the likelihood of HP causing the conditions mentioned above with the comparable likelihood that the conditions could be cause d by vaccination, general protection and no protection at all. HP was the safest opti on with 2 of the 5 conditions, and the second safest in another 2. In three of the four conditions the result s were statistically significant. The one measure s uggesting associating the use of HP with a decline in long-term health was that chil dren using HP were apparently more likely than children using general protection or no method of pr otection to have ear and hearing problems (see tables 5.2-7 and 5.2-8, pages 150 and 152). Even though the figures relating HP to ear/hearing problems were not st atistically significant, this apparent trend is worthy of further research, especially since a negative association would certainly be inconsistent with the findings relating to the other health conditions. Thus, every measure used to rank the safe ty of HP shows that HP presents no significant level of risk to those using the method. In fact, there is evidence that the long-term use of HP may in fact improve the long-term health of re cipients as indicated by parental comments as well as being meas ured by a statistically significant reduction in the likelihood of acquiring specified chronic health c onditions if HP is used. This finding would be unlikely if long-term HP in any way \"energetically\" damaged the recipient, as questioned by a few homoeopaths. The results showing a level of reactions to the HP remedies pose something of a dilemma for supporters of the orthodox medical paradigm who believe that molecules of active material are required to produce mol ecular reactions, as expressed in physical symptoms. A similar result is found with hom oeopathic treatment where reactions to potentised remedies are regularly experience d, as well as with homoeopathic provings where reactions form the ba sis of the proving result. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 237A homoeopath would reply that the \"energy\" contained within potentised remedies is very real and active, even though not readil y measurable using present day technology. Such a statement may be too vague for an orthodox scientist, but such reactions to potentised remedies are observable and, in the case of provings, measurable and repeatable and predictable. An unprejudiced observer would conclude th at we have here something needing a scientific explanati on, and not simply conclude that what has been observed over 200 years did not actually occur. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 2385.4 Implications for Public Health Policy State and Federal health authorities in Australia presently spend considerable resources promoting childhood vaccination progr ams. The desirability of preventing certain infectious diseases is an aim shared by these authorities as well as by homoeopaths who provide HP programs to parents who request them. It may be concluded that an appropriately structured long-term HP program offers an alternative to vaccination that is unquestionably safer, a nd very possibly of a similar level of effectiveness. In Chapter 5.4 it was found that many parent s make a choice between either (1) vaccination or (2) doing nothing to prevent infectious diseases. If parents who choose not to vaccinate because of their concerns as to the safety of vaccination were encouraged to use HP, then the national rates of protection against infectious diseases would increase because no such safety concerns would be held regarding HP by most of these parents. Nationa l levels of herd immunity would increase given that HP clearly has some protective effect. Based on the results reported above, if parent s were encouraged to either vaccinate or use HP, rates of asthma, eczema, allergies as well as other problems would fall as some decided to use HP instead of vaccination. It is not for one moment suggested that vaccination programs be replaced by the use of appropriate HP programs. However, the findings of this stu dy clearly support the possibility that an appropriately structured dual disease-prevention system, where parents were encouraged to either vaccinate or use HP, would increase national coverage against infectious diseases and reduce the national incidence of certain chronic health conditions. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 239If State and National health authorities were given objective a dvice concerning these options, the cost-benefit impli cations for public health po licy would be considerable. 5.5 Implications for Future Research The research reported in this thesis is not perfect, especially when estimating the effectiveness of HP. However, many of the identified weaknesses in the research could be corrected if a much larger data base of responses was obtained. This challenge is fundamentally a matter of resources, as the co llection of the data in this study has been time consuming and, on an individual level, expensive. However, the General Health Study in partic ular could readily be expanded to obtain many thousands of responses, especially if support was received from State Education departments to distribute the questionnaire in primary schools nationwide, and attempts to block the research were not made by St ate Health Departments, as occurred during this research. Secondly, it would be ideal if a long-t erm study was undertaken involving parents who (1) had decided not to v accinate their child and (2) w ho were unconcerned if their child contracted Measles. In such cases a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial could be undertaken to obtain statistically significant evidence as to the effectiveness and safety of HP against Measles. In fact a pilot of such a study was proposed as part of this thesis, but was rejected by the ethics committee. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent over the years researching vaccines. A mere fraction of these resources would easily cover the cost s of the above two research projects, and would enable a conclusi ve scientific finding as to whether HP can provide a safe and effective means of disease prevention. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 240 This study has shown that the case for such research is compelli ng, since the use of HP offers the potential to benefit childr en through both a grea ter level of national protection against targeted in fectious diseases, as well as through lower levels of chronic health conditions. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 241PART 4: CONCLUSIONS Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 242 6 Conclusions The following conclusions are made from the above analysis and discussion. 6.1 The Potential Value of Homoeopro phylaxis in the Safe Prevention of Infectious Disease An appropriately designed HP program is able to offer some level of protection against targeted infectious diseases. The precise level of eff ectiveness can only be estimated based on 200 years of recorded clinical experience, and a limited number of statistical trials covering both long and short term usage. On the balance of probabilities it appears as though HP potentially offers a level of protection exceeding 90%, although this figure requires further research to be more fully validated. It may be concluded that even though generally mild and brief reactions to an appropriate HP program do occur in less than 2% of doses, these do not pose any threat to the long-term health of users. Further there is statistically significant ev idence that an appropriate HP program is associated with an improvement in the long-term health of recipients. It is therefore concluded, subject to the limitations of the data already noted, that HP provides a safe and a relatively effective level protection against targeted infectious diseases. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 243 6.2 Suggestions for Public Health Policy State and Federal health aut horities in Australia should c onsider the introduction of an appropriately structured dual diseas e-prevention system where parents were encouraged to either vaccinate or use HP. This would increase national coverage against infectious diseases and reduce the nationa l incidence of certain chronic health conditions. If State and National health authorities were given objective a dvice concerning these options, the implications for public h ealth policy would be considerable. 6.3 Suggestions for Future Research The General Health Study should be repeated with the aim to collect at least five thousand responses. This figure is obtainable with a reasonable ou tlay of resources if support is received from State Education Depa rtments to distribute the questionnaire in primary schools nationwide. Secondly, a long-term study involving parent s who (1) had decided not to vaccinate their child and (2) who were unconcerned if their child contracted Measles, should be considered. This could allow a double-blind, place bo-controlled, randomised trial to be undertaken. Timely collection of data would be difficult to obtain due to the relatively small numbers of parents meeting the a bove entry criteria, but the provision of statistically significant evidence as to the eff ectiveness and safety of HP could make the effort worthwhile. Homoeoprophylaxis and the Prevention of Infectious Diseases Isaac Golden 244Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent over the years researching vaccines. A mere fraction of these resources would easily cover the cost s of the above two research projects, and would enable a scien tific finding as to whet her HP can provide a safe and effective means of disease prevention. Thirdly, a cost-benefit analysis of vacci nation and HP could be undertaken based on the results of this study. This would provide authorities with furt her reason to support the above two projects. 6.4 Final Conclusions This study has shown that the use of HP of fers the potential to benefit children through both a greater level of national protection ag ainst targeted infectious diseases, as well as through lower levels of chronic health conditions. The case for further research is compelling.

One dose consists of two tablets or pilule s of the medicine indicated. The pilules may be dissolved in a little water if preferred. Each dose must be administered at leas t 45 minutes before or after eating or drinking. . The order of remedies may be changed. Other remedies may be included in the program, or some existing medicines rem oved, depending on the requirements of the patient. . The 1991 program is a direct result of res earch that clearly suggested the need for triple doses, not because single doses are in effective, but to lessen the chance of a single dose being antidoted. The concept of ascending doses has been subj ect to discussion (both in literature and clinical practice) for many years, and is compatible with Hahnemann's idea of increasing potencies. It must be stressed th at the original Kit is effective if used properly; however, any program may be enhanced as new information becomes available. Dr Hahnemann offered the cleares t example of how inte llectual evolution can lead to practical change. . The Kit was generally available throughout Australia until 13 Janua ry 1993. Sale of the Kit was then restricted by the Govern ment under TGA regulations, and it cannot be posted interstate or overseas. . Instructions and a questionnaire are includ ed with each Kit. Information from questionnaires is kept completely confid ential and forms the basis of continuing research into the effectiveness of the program. The basic program for protection from bi rth is summarised in Table 1.1-2 below. Table 1.1-2 The Current Homoeoprophylactic Program (Summary) MEDICINE AGE ADMINISTERED (Months) A Pertussin 1 *2 *13 *32 B *28 Triple doses to be used; e.g., for Pertussin*, take 2 tabs each of Pertussin (200), Pertussin (M) and Pertussin (10M), evenly spaced over 24 hours (i.e. a dose every 8 hours). Appendices Isaac Golden 267 The Supplementary Program The current supplementary program is shown in Table 1.1-3 . Table 1.1-3 The Current Supplementary Program CODE MEDICINE DISEASE A1 M C1 D1 E1 F1 Measles Mumps Hib Meningitis Explanatory Notes: . If desired, boosters may be given every 10 years, or as required. . The 200th potencies of each remedy replace th e 30th potencies used in the original (1986) supplementary program. . Use of the remedies is optional; for ex ample, many parents decide not to use Parotidinum since Mumps is such a benign disease in childhood, and natural infection is the most certain form of immunity. Appendices Isaac Golden 2681.1.2 The Original (1986) Homoeopathic Prophylactic Kit The following Kit was assembled to cover both programs. The medicines were labelled with letters of th e alphabet for convenience. Note: For both programs, one dose consisted of two tablets or pilules of the medicine indicated.

I am currently undertaking PhD research at the Graduate School of Integrative Medicine, Swinburne University, Melbourne. My thesis topic is \"The Potential Valu e of Homoeoprophylaxis in the Prevention of Infectious Diseases, and the Maintenan ce of General health in Recipients\" I will be undertaking a number of pieces of research, hopefully including the world's first randomised, placebo controlled tria l of HP in humans. If successful, this will provide \"hard\" evidence which as a profession we are often accused of not having. However I am asking for your Association's help in circulating a questionnaire to practitioner members. One part of my overall research is a nationa l practitioner survey examining the attitudes to and use of HP. If you are willing, I would like to provi de you with a covering letter and questionnaire plus a reply paid envelope to be inserted in your Newsletter to Professional members. If you advise me of numbers I will send the required material to you. I will attach the draf t of the covering letter and que stionnaire, and also of the general advertisement concerning the other two pieces of research where I will be seeking public involvement. I am undertaking my research without priv ate funding, and need all the help I can get to cover costs, hence my request for a fa vour to include this material in your next newsletter. If you have any questions please do not hesita te to contact me, or if you are willing to help, please advise numbers of questi onnaires etc which I s hould send you, and the address. With sincere thanks in anticipation. Kind regards Isaac Golden "}
