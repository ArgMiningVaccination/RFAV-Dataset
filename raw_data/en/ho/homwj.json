Price information shared : restricted to subsidised medicines listing all of the medicines available to be dispensed to patients at a Government -subsidised price. (Karnon et al., 201 6[1]) estimates the effects of price disclosure on the ongoing value for money of 12 pharmaceuticals listed on the PBS between 2008 and 2011. Potential cost saving estimated around A$168 million, of which A$73 million (43%) could have been saved betwe en July 2014 and April 2015. Austria Non-legal instruments: Pharma Price Information (PPI)2 (1990s) Service of the Austrian National Public Health Institute Gesundheit \u00d6sterreich GmbH , is part of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement Policies . PPI offers, at request and for a charge, price data of medicines and molecules defined by the clients for all European Union Member States, as well as Norway, Switzerland and the UK. Information for different types of price: ex -factory prices, pharmacy purchasing prices (wholesale prices) and pharmacy retail prices (consumer prices) excluding and including value -added tax. Additional types of price can be provided at the request. Price information shared: only relates to officia l prices as commercial discounts cannot be provided due to their confidential character. (Vogler, Vitry and Babar, 2016 [1]) survey official list prices per unit at ex -factory price level of 31 originator cancer drugs in 16 European countries , Australia, and New Zealand as of June, 2013. Differences in drug prices between the highest priced country and the lowest priced country varied between 28% and 388%. Greek prices ranked at a low level, whereas Sweden, Switzerland, and Germany showed price data in similarly high ranges. (Moye -Holz and Vogler, 2022 [2]) survey public procurement and ex -factory prices for 19 cancer medicines, as of 2017, in five Latin American (LATAM) countries and 11 European countries. In European countries 8 DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(202 2)14 \u00a9 OECD 2022 with higher levels of income, PPP -adjusted prices tended to be lower than in Euro pean countries of lower income and LATAM countries. Except for one medicine, all surveyed medicines were considered unaffordable in most countries. Belgium Legal provisions : legislation to permit dossiers submitted by manufacturers to be written in Englis h3 pCPA is the federal, provincial, and territorial Canadian governments' organization that negotiates prices of new and existing medicines with pharmaceutical manufacturers. Objectives include to achieve consistent and lower drug costs for participating ju risdictions and improving consistency of coverage criteria among participating jurisdictions. (Rawson, 2020 [4]) examine s medicines for rare and ultra -rare disorders, respectively with a completed pC PA negotiation or no negotiation for the period between 2014 and 2018, together with their reimbursement recommendations and listings in public drug programs. A successful price negotiation led to listing in the majority of the public drug programs and a negative recommendation usually led to no listing. Less than half the recommendations before 2016 mentioned the need for a substantial price reduction, but this increased to 80% in those reported from 2016 onwards. Chile Non-legal instruments: ChileCompra public procurement portal5 (2010 ) ChileCompra is managed by the Ministry of Finance to centralise and digitalise the negotiation of multi -year agreements with suppliers. Objective: is to promote transparency in public procurement in general , including medicine procurement. Access to the information portal is public and does not require payment or registration.

N/A Colombia Non-legal instruments: Medicines Price Information System of Colombia (SISMED) 6 (2010) Managed by the regulatory authority, under the supervision of the Ministry of Health and social protection. Objective: to monitor medicines prices Access to the information portal is public and does not require payment or registration. Manufacturers, wholesalers and institutions providing health services have to report price information on a quarterly basis, including: average prices, minimum and maximum purchase price of medicines by commercial presentation of each drug marketed in the country. (Prada et al., 2018 [5]) show that, after direct price controls were enacted, price inflation decreased but real pharmaceutical expenditure almost doubled due mainly to an increase in units sold. Such disproportionate increase in un its sold may be attributable to better access to drugs due to lower prices, and/or to an increase in marketing efforts by DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(202 2)14 9 \u00a9 OECD 2022 Price Information shared : includes both in inpatient and outpatient setting, and relates to price indices that correspond to a quarterly weighted average price of all national reports made for each commercial brand. the pharmaceutical industry to maintain profits. Denmark Non-legal instrument : AMGROS7 (1990) Amgros is a public -sector organisation that undertakes procurement service for the five regional authorities in Denmark.

European Union Legal provision : Council Directive 89/105/EEC (1989) Member S tates must comply with (procedural) requirements to ensure the transparency of national decisions on medicine pricing and reimbursement, despite the decisions themselves being a national competence. N/A N/A France Legal provision : (article 79) LOI n\u00b0 2020 - 1576 du 14 d\u00e9cembre 2020 de financement de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale pour 2021/ Social Security Budget Bill8 (December 2020) Objective: pharmaceutical companies must disclose the amount of public funding that was received for R&D of a new drug when applying for approval to market the product in France. Price information shared : companies must disclose the amounts they received for R&D to the comit\u00e9 \u00e9conomique des produits de sant\u00e9 . This (OTMeds)9 (2019) OTMeds is an independent organisation operating on a voluntary basis under a broad national and international network. Objectives: to ensure the implementation in France of the \"Resolution on Transparency\", a resolution on transparency in pharmaceutical markets. OTMeds published a ' transparency checklist ' on a document that brings together some of the essential information that must be available to the public regulat or in order to assess the relevance of the price of a drug at the time of setting of its price. The implementation of this transparency check -list should lead to databases that are in open -access but it still remains to be implemented. N/A Non-legal instrument: Public database on medicine list prices by for Agence technique de l'information sur l'hospitalisation (ATIH)10 ATIH - France's Technical Agency for Information on Hospital Care is a public administrative body coming under the authori ty of the Health and Social Security Ministers. Its strategic policies are defined by a Board of Directors, a Steering Committee and a Scientific Committee. Price information shared : publicly discloses national yearly list price aggregates for medicines undergoing price regulation prices , namely very expensive drugs and products paid on top diagnosis - related groups (DRGs). N/A 10 DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(202 2)14 \u00a9 OECD 2022 Objectives: ATIH collects budget impact data to inform the design of reforms of payment models in F rance. Iceland Non-legal instrument : public database11 (2013) Managed by the Icelandic Medicines Agency.

Information shared is protected by confidentiality agreements. Price information shared: includes net purchase prices, volumes, order sizes per year and total spending by supplier. (Den Ambtman et al., 2020 [7]) show that n et prices for identical medical product s vary significantly across hospitals. They conclude that higher levels of spending on a specific product assortment delivered by a specific DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(202 2)14 11 \u00a9 OECD 2022 supplier do not necessarily lead t o lower prices. Purchasing a higher number of products resulted in lower unit prices for most products. Non-legal instrument : All-payer Claims Database15 (2006) Managed by the Vektis Heal th Care Information Center and e stablished by Dutch health insurers to combine and interpret reimbursement data and enable the main players in the Dutch healthcare market to base decisions and policy on reliable, essential, and timely information. Price information shared: contains information on all procedures co vered by Dutch statutory health insurance and a set of data on patients, providers, care products, and prices. Data are not publicly available, as formal consent from the Dutch health insurers is needed to gain access to these files. Data are, however, ava ilable from Vektis Health Care Information Center upon reasonable request and with formal consent of the Dutch health insurers. (Geurten et al., 2022 [8]) found that a large share of expenditures on ca re for the Dutch type 2 diabetes population was not directly related to diabetes treatment, suggesting whole -person care for patients with type 2 diabetes is costly. Legal provision: Wet Geneesmiddelenprijzen16 (1964) Law introducing the notion of setting maximum prices for medicines. The ministry will twice a year examine whether maximum prices need to be set or adjusted. It is prohibited to sell medicines over the maximum price. N/A N/A Norway Transparency/confidentiality legislation17 (2016) Law removing a ban on claw -backs, which are rebates that are paid if certain sales levels are achieved N/A N/A Spain Legal provision : Act 19/2013, of 9 December18 (2013) National legislation requiring transparency in Government decisions and effectuating citizens' right of access to public information. In 2019 the Consejo de Transparencia y Buen Gobierno (General Transparency Council), Spain's independent body responsible for ensuring the transparency of public activity, supported requests for the Spanish Government to publicly disclose the price of the cellular immunotherapy Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel), a nd the therapeutic and financial criteria used to justify its recent approval. This request was based on Spain's existing transparency legislation. Price information shared : net costs of medicines used in public hospitals, including discounts. Disclosure i s not automatic and relies on citizens ' request. N/A 12 DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(202 2)14 \u00a9 OECD 2022 Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency's (TLV)19 (2002) TVL publishes yearly report s analysing Sweden's pharmaceutical prices compared with 19 other European countries. Objectives: to monitor and analyse the pharmaceutical price development from an international perspective. Price information shared : list prices consisting of the wholesa le price determined by TLV. (TLV, 2021 [1]), shows that Sweden has relatively low prices on pharmaceuticals in relation to other countries and that these have decreased compared to other countries compared with previous years. Prices for medicines on on -patent markets have been stable in relation to the average prices in Europe. Switzerland Non-legal instrument: Bundesamt f\u00fcr Gesundheit BAG. Spezialit\u00e4tenliste (SL)20 (2003) Public database maintained by the Swiss Government. Price information shared : publicly accessible online list of highly priced medicines, including information on m aximum price and rebate amounts that are reimbursed by the compulsory health insurance, alon g with the list price, ex -factory price and rebates offered on these products. (Vokinger et al., 2022 [10]) compare patterns of price changes for cancer drugs within the same class in the USA and in Ger many and Switzerland with national mechanisms for drug price negotiation. Drug prices at market entry were, in general, higher in Germany than in Switzerland, but decreased substantially after the first price evaluation and often dropped below prices in Switzerland. United Kingdom Non-legal instrument : Pharmaceutical Pricing Regulation Scheme (PPRS)21 (2014) Agreement between the Department of Health and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) concerning the supply of licensed, branded medicines to the NHS to regulate pricing. Objectives: 1) to cap the growth of NHS spending on branded medicines at an agreed rate, with any overspend paid back to the NHS; 2) to provide stability of spend to the NHS and offer an incentive to use new medicines at no extra cost. Price information shared : all new medicines to be appraised by NICE. To date, the industry has paid back over \u00a33 billion to the Department of Health and Social Care for NHS spending above the cap (ABPI, 2022 [2]). (O'neill et al., 2012 [3]) show that prices for the leading branded medicines in primary care in 2011 were still in the bottom quartile of international price s. United States of America Legal provision : Consolidated Appropriations Act22 (CAA) (2021 ) Establishment of protections for consumers related to surprise billing and transparency in health care endorsing public disclosure of price information on US government website.

Price information shared: publicly post standard charge information, requires to inform beneficiaries of hospital billing quality and Hospital Compare would include whether the hospital provides p atients with an itemized receipt of hospital services and how often the hospital pursues legal action against patients for outstanding bills. N/A Legal provisions: 1) Know the Lowest Price Act (2018) 24 (2018) 2) Patients' Right to Know Drug Prices Act (2018) 25 (2018) Know the Lowest Price Act prohibits gag clauses in Medicare Advantage and Part D plans (contains physician -administered drugs such as infusions and most injectables, most prescription drugs). Patients' Right to Know Drug Prices Act prevents gag clauses in employer -sponsored and health care exchange plans. N/A N/A Legal provision: The Hospital Price Transparency Rule26 (effective January 1st 2021) Each hospital operating in the USA will be required to provide clear, accessible pricing information online about the items and services as a comprehensive machined - readable file with all items and services and in a display of shoppable services in a consumer -friendly format. Hospital price transpa rency helps Americans know the cost of a hospital item or service before receiving it.

Access to the information portal is public an d does not require payment or registration. Price information shared: restricted to medicines and health products purchased by public and private institutions registered in the system unit. It provides (weighted) average price by municipality, per concentr ation, pharmaceutical form, package, (Kohler et al., 2015 [14]) suggest the existence of the BPS tool has not led to consistent p urchase price decreases for medicines in Paraiba and S\u00e3o Paulo. DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(202 2)14 15 \u00a9 OECD 2022 dosage. The database enables search by drug and other characteristics.

N/A Malaysia Non-legal instrument: Recommended retail price database for public access 29 (2011) In 2011, the Ministry of Health encouraged pharmaceutical companies to voluntarily declare their wholesale and recommended retail price (RRP) to the Pharmaceutical Service Division (PSD). Price information shared : wholesale and recommended retail prices ( RRP) for medicine used for acute and chronic diseases, including generic and innovator brands. The medicine prices declared to the PSD does not disclose discount and bonus schemes. RRP database is published on the Pharmaceutical Service Division (PSD) webs ite. (Ahmad, Hatah and Makmor -Bakry, 2019 [15]) suggest that voluntary medicine price declaration by pharmaceutical companies had a strong and significant association with private healthcare sector re tail prices. Republic of Moldova Legal provision: Law on Medicines , Monitorul Oficial. 1998. No. 52 -3 .368, adopted 17 December 1997 30 (1998) National legislation requiring national competent authorities to report prices on the website. Price information shared : manufacturer prices.

Results of the Literature review First author, year Policy/Intervention studied Geography Outcomes Data and Methods Limitations 1 (Kohler et al., 2015 [14]) In 1998 , the Brazilian Federal Government implemented the Banco de Precos em Saude (BPS) . The BPS discloses purchasing prices of medicines that are paid for by public institutions at the federal, state and municipal levels of government, as well as of private and international institutions that have been registered in the system (e.g. some NGOs, private clinics/hospitals). Non-OECD: Brazil No significant price decreases during the five -year period suggesting BPS has not lead to consistent purchase price decreases for medicines in Paraiba and S\u00e3o Paulo. Included 19 therapeutic classes and types of medicines: a ntiviral, antibiotic, antidiabetic, diuretic, anticoagula nts, antidepressant s. Prices included in the analysis consist of purchasing prices of medicines that are paid by public institutio ns, namely procurement prices between federal public institutions and suppliers.

OECD countries: Latvia and Lithuania. Non-OECD : Bangladesh, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Dominican Republic, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Russian The price of most drugs was consistently higher when purchased from the private market. The price (per patient) per treatment course treatment of first -line drugs was lower for drugs supplied through the Global Drug Facility than through the private market. Similarly, the price (per patient) of a course of treatment for second line drugs was 82% lower through the Global Drug Facility than the private market.

OECD : France, Germany, Italy, Spain and UK Forecasts show that f uture growth in pharmaceutical expenditure in Europe is likely to be l ower than previously forecasted based on list prices. The growth in use of confidential discounts over the last decade s has led to increased divergence between list and net p rices, with the associated overstatement of historical expenditure levels. Net expenditure growth in EU5 is predicted to be approximately 1.5% CAGR over the next 5 years.

While the study calculates net prices by adjusting the established IQVIA analysis ('list forecast') for discounts that a re not currentl y incorporated ('net forecast'), data on confidential discounts or rebates overestimate real prices paid and can vary across countries . 5 (Gotham, Barber and Hill, 2018 [22]) Online database of exports data published by the Indian customs regulations supporting the initiative on Addressing the Challenge and Constraints of Insulin Sources and Supply , which aims to improve access to insulin.

Non-OECD: Malaysia Wholesale price s (and declared RRP ) in 2011 -2015 are significantly associated with the retail price (p < 0.05) . Generic medicines had a relatively higher percentage of median price mark -ups compared with the innovator brands medicines. The median retail price of generic medicines had a relatively higher percentage mark -up than innovator brand medicines. When comparing retail prices to IRP, however, the median price ratio for generic medicines was lower than that of IB. Medicine used for acute and chronic diseases (25 core and 32 supplementary medicines) either generic and innovator brands . Wholesale and recommended retail prices (RRP). The median price ratio was calculated by comparing the consumer retail medicine price to its international reference price. Analysis excludes medicine prices from clinics of dispensing doctors. Voluntary reporting of medicine prices by pharmaceutical companies is biased and inconsistent . Voluntary medicine price d isclosure is strongly associated with private healthcare sector retail prices. Medicine prices do not account for discount and bonus schemes. Since this type of procurement arrangement is usually confidential, 30 DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(202 2)14 \u00a9 OECD 2022 it would be difficult to obtain true wholesale prices. 8 (Den Ambtman et al., 2020 [7]) The Hospital Purchase Benchmark is a consumer -based, not -for-profit initiative designed by and for hospitals.

Prices negotiated between hospitals and suppliers . 12 (Lev\u00e4nen et al., 2020 [27]) The European Medicines Verification Organisation (EMVO) is a Belgian non -profit organisation representing stakeholders united in securing the legal supply chain from falsified medicines. The platform is the first end -to-end verification system initiated by industry stakeholders to ensure the safety of the pharmaceutical products throughout the supply chain. OECD By sharing data with the wholesalers, the logistics become more transparent, and with the end -customers, it helps pharmaceutical companies to deve lop more targeted services and products to the end -customers. Research data include 20 semi - structured in -depth interviews with 11 informants from the NPC and with 9 external industry expert informants. 13 (Rawson, 2020 [4]) The pa n-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance (pCPA) is the federal, provincial, and territorial governments' organis ation that negotiates prices of new and existing medicines with pharmaceutical manufacturers. OECD: Canada Post-2015 recommendations, there was an increase in the number of reports with a specified percenta ge reductio n in the drug's list price to achieve an incremental cost ratio of $50,000 for drugs for rare disorders (DRDs) and $100,000 for drugs for ultra -rare disorders (DURDs ). These percentages were frequently large, particularly for DURDs where they were 60% or higher. A successful price negotiation was comple ted for 45.5% of the DRDs and 78.6% of the DURDs with a positive Common Drug Review (CDR ) recommendation report specifying the need for a substantial price reduction. Restricted to medicines for indications with a prevalence of 20 per 100,000 population. List prices provided in the CDR reports Restricted sample of medicines A limits the transferability of the results to other products . 14 (Mattila, Babar and Suleman, 2021 [17]) Introduction of the single exit pricing (SEP) which is a price regulation equalising the price at which the manufacturer or importer of a medicine can sell to a wholesaler or distributor.\" The South Afr ican Medicines Price Registry discloses publicly data on SEP at fixed points in time. The database is an implementation of the transparent pricing policies for the private sector that is part of the South African legislation. Non-OECD : South Africa Results suggest that oncology medicine prices in South Africa continue to be high showing large price differences in the private sector between highest -priced and their lowest -priced equivalents, as well as between originator products and lowest priced generics . About 33% of the medicines have a ratio of almo st 1 between OBs and LPGs, which suggests that the SEP policy may be hindering competition of some products by setting a price ceiling or capping increases. Alternatively, companies may be using the OB price as a guide to their price setting. Median price unit of cancer medicines (both originator brand (OB) and lowest priced generic (LPG) products). Median price ratio s were not calculated not allowing data comparison with the international reference prices. Sample selection of products in the analysis rela tes to products used in the private sector database, therefore not representing the whole market of South Africa. 32 DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(202 2)14 \u00a9 OECD 2022 15 (Noh, Janousek and Park, 2021 [28]) Introduction of t he Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 extended state rebate programs to prescription drugs through Medicaid managed care, establishing the Managed Care Organization (MCO) rebate program. OECD : USA The results suggest that Medicaid prescription spending was influenced by the negotiated pricing strategy, specifically MCO rebates, but not by the price transparency strategy. The research did not provide evidence that state operation of All Payer Claims Databases (APCDs ) was effective in addressing Medicaid prescription spending. Two possible situations may account for the deviant results from the hypothesis: (1) the role of learning from experience; and (2) data analysis and reporting. Medicaid prescription spending per enrollee ($) for Medicaid prescription drugs . The number of states that adopt ing the MCO rebate program is limited during the period of analysis , while seventeen states have adopted the rebate program as of 2017. Limited granular data availability at state level which undermines understanding of differentials across state s. 16 (Naidoo and Suleman, 2021 [16]) Introduction of the 'Regulations relating to a transparent pricing system for medicines and scheduled substances' in 2004. Non-OECD : South Africa Results shows that, although the anticipated introduction of single exit pricing ( SEP) might have been the cause of product withdrawals, the limited annual price increases have not resulted in significantly increased withdrawals from the market, as predicted by manufacturers. Therefore, from this analysis it appears that the ongoing SEP reg ulations have not had a significant impact on access to medicines. The highest number of stock -keeping units (SKUs ) were withdrawn in the years shortly before the implementation of SEP (2002 - 2004), both for generics and innovator medicines. Study shows t hat anti -infective and cardiovascular drugs accounted for 22.97% and 9.97% of all SKU withdrawals, respectively. The majority of the withdrawn SKUs in the cardiovascular class was antihypertensives. Analysis covering the following medicines: a nti-infectiv es for systemic use, nervous system, respiratory system, cardiovascular system, alimentary tract and metabolism, musculoskeletal system, antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents, dermatologicals, genito - urinary system and sex hormones, sensory organs, systemic hormonal preparations, excluding sex hormones and insulins, blood and blood -forming organs, antiparasitic products, insecticides and repellents. The study could not determine if an SKU was withdrawn early on in the implementation phase and reintro duced later. Moreover, the study did not consider delayed entry into the market as a result of pricing policy interventions. 17 (Franzen et al., 2022 [29]) Empirical study to test the effects of price and R&D cost transparency on prices and R&D investments in a European setting using experimental design. OECD : the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, and Spain Differing effects under both regimes; while there were no clear effect s on prices under partial transparency there were reductions in R&D investment; under full transparency there was convergence toward reduced prices . Cancer medicines Laboratory experiment simulating the dynamics of a bargaining game of repeated negotiations between payers and companies over the price of an \"innovative and highly effective anti - cancer medicine\" under two regimes of transparency: (1) partial transparency i.e. of price information and (2) full transparency i.e. information on prices and R&D costs . Results from laboratory experiments are not necessarily generalizable and transfera ble to the real world . Variations in clinical effectiveness were not considered. Experiment limited to four buying countries (Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, P oland) with limitations to understand the potential effects of strategic launch sequences on other markets . 18 International price comparison 2021 , 2022 International price comparison led by the Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency (TLV) . OECD : Sweden and the rest of EU The results show that Sweden has relatively low prices on pharmaceuticals in relation to other countries, especially for pharmaceuticals with competition - where Prescription pharmaceuticals dispensed in pharmacies account ing Differences across health care systems in regards to pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceuticals , DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(202 2)14 33 \u00a9 OECD 2022 countries Swedish prices are among the absolute lowest. For pharmace uticals without competition, Sweden has the sixth lowest prices. The results also show that Swedish prices have fallen in relation to other countries compared with previous years. The development with falling prices is largely explained by the falling Swed ish krona. If the effect of the changed currency exchange rate is removed, Swedish prices are only marginally lower over time in relation to other countries. for about two thirds of sales in Sweden. Within the Swedish PV system pharmaceuticals with competition are those that the Swedish Medical Products Agency has classified as substitutable and where generic competition exists These are older pharmaceuticals no longer under patent protection, 15 years after market introduction roughly corresponds to the expiration of patents. However, far from all pharmaceuticals older than 15 years lack competition. The statistics analysed in the report are based on list prices. In Sweden, list prices consist of the wholesale price determined by TLV. as well as quality of the data reported are not fully accounted for. 19 (Vokinger et al., 2022 [10]) Price comparison across USA, Germany and Switzerland for cancer drug s to measure the impact of different price regulations. In the USA, manufacturers can freely set prices . In Switzerland, prices are negotiated on the basis of therapeutic cross -referencing with drugs for the same indication and external reference pricing. In Germany, manufacturers set the drug's price duri ng the first year after launch and early assessment of the added therapeutic benefit of the medicine supports the price negotiation. OECD : USA, Germany, Switzerland Results suggest that effective negotiation, as practised in Germany or Switzerland, could be a model for policy makers in the USA to help address the high price of cancer drugs in the USA, both at launch and after launch. Monthly treatment prices of cancer drugs within and across all drug classes increased in the USA regardless of whether or not competitors entered the market. By contrast, m onthly treatment prices for cancer drugs decreased in Germany and Switzerland over time, with gradual alignment for prices of cancer drugs within drug classes. In the USA and Europe, we found that monthly treatment prices were higher for drugs targeting re nal cell carcinoma (combined PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitors and therapies and BRAF -positive therapies), and were generally lower for drugs targeting breast cancer (CDK4/6 inhibitors). Cancer drugs approved for the treatment of solid cancers in adults in the USA and Europe between Jan 1, 2009, and Dec 31, 2020. Monthly treatment prices in this study were calculated at the lowest per -mg basis at the national level and did not account for confidential discounts or rebates. Data collected from the RedBook database for USA (IBM Micromedex, Armonk, NY, USA) for the USA, the Lauer -Taxe database for Germany, and the positive list (Spezialit\u00e4tenliste) published by the Federal Office of Public Health for Switzerland. Drug classes are defined broadly not accounting for the fact medicines can be used in a complementary manner . Monthly treatment prices were calculated at the lowest per -mg basis at the national level and did not account for confidential discounts or rebate s, and therefore might not reflect the costs paid by individual health insurers or by patients. Actual monthly treatment prices might differ, because of the impact of varying availability of drug strengths and package sizes. In general, rebates for cancer drugs are small on average in the USA, and few cancer drugs have been granted confidential rebates in Switzerland. 34 DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(202 2)14 \u00a9 OECD 2022 20 (Ahmad, Makmor - Bakry and Hatah, 2020 [4]) Study aimed to systematically review studies evaluating the impact of drug pricing transparency initiatives on prices . Global Scarcity of studies reporting drug pricing transparency initiatives. Due to sparse evidence, the effect of drug price transparency initiatives on price control is still inconclusive. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria for drug price transparency initiatives, of which only three reported the outcomes on the regulation of drug prices. Two studies in South Africa showed that price transparency initiatives did not necessarily reduce drug prices. Another study in the Philippines indicated a reduction in medicines' price based on the effects of government -mediated access prices. Limitations and barriers in price transparency initiatives include fragmentation of the healthcare system a nd nondisclosure of discounts and rebates by pharmaceutical companies.

OECD: European countries Some policy -makers are concerned that moves towards increased price transparency would have a negative impact on accessibility, because companies may then withdraw from markets or set prices at unaffordable levels The differing needs and negotiating capacities across countries and the complexities of the interactions between stakeholders hinder price transparency Increasing transparency will require greater European and international collaboration - strengthening and going beyond existing initiatives.

Content of semi -structured interviews Interview Questions In your view, what are the expectations and motives of stakeholders (e.g. payers, price regulators, HTA agencies, patients) in increasing price transparency? How do these motives differ in a given country? E.g. between OECD vs non -OECD member countries, countries with small vs large pharmaceutical markets. In your opinion, what do stakeholders see as the objectives and benefits of increasing price transparency? E.g. public accountability, access and affordability; financial sustainability. What are the likely impacts of greater price transparency on the functioning of markets? E.g. accountability of coverage and pricing decisions, anticompetitive firm behaviour (e.g. price collusion), firm strategic decisions (e.g. launching decisions), price convergence and higher prices and -or reduced patient access in countries with low ability to pay. What would you anticipate as the strategic responses of the industry? What would be, for instance, the anticipated impact on competitive behaviour, and on decisions regarding the location and timing of market launches, etc.? What would you anticipate as the strategic responses of the \" pricing authorities \" and payers ? In your view, how would transparent net prices affect differential pricing and parallel trade across countries? How would it affect the current international reference pricing policies? In your perspective, what conditions would be necessary to establish a mechanism to share pricing information at international level to contribute to greater price transparency? 38 DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(202 2)10 \u00a9 OECD 2022 Annex F.
