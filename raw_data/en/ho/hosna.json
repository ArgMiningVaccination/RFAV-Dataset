Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention iii Pacific Northwest EPC Structured Abstract Background: Effective prevention strategies for HIV infection are an i mportant public health priority. A 2019 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found oral pre - exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) associated with decreased risk of HIV infection compared with placebo or no PrEP in adults at increased risk of HIV infection, although effectiveness decreases with inadequate adherence. Newer PrEP regimens, including an extended release injectable formulation, are available. Purpose: To synthesize evidence for the USPSTF on effects of PrEP on risk of HIV acquisition, mortality, harms, and other clinical outcomes; and accuracy of methods for identifying potential candidates for PrEP. Data Sources: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, and E mbase from January 2019 to May 16, 2022 , carried forward relevant included studies from the prior re port, and manually reviewed reference lists; additional surveillance for new literature w ill be conducted on an ongoing basis . Study Selection: Randomized, controlled trials on the benefits and harms of PrEP versus placebo /no PrEP in adults and adolescents without HIV infection at high risk of becoming infected; trials on the benefits and harms of newer versus older PrEP regimens; and studies on the diagnostic accuracy of instruments for predicting incident HIV infection . Data Extraction: One investigator abstracted data and a second investigator checked data abstraction for accuracy. Two investigators independently assessed study quality using methods developed by the USPSTF. Data Synthesis (Results): In populations at higher risk of acquiring HIV infection, 11 trials (all in the prior USPSTF review) found oral PrEP was associated with decreased risk of HIV infection versus place bo or no PrEP (N=18,172; relative risk [RR], 0.46 [95% confidence [ARD], -2.0% [95% CI, -2.8% to - 1.2%] after 4 months to 4 years). Effects were consistent across HIV risk categories and for PrE P with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) plus emtricitabine (FTC) or TDF alone. There was a strong association between higher adherence and greater efficacy (adherence 70%: 6 trials; RR, 0.27 [95% CI, to p<0.00001 for interaction). All trials of oral PrEP versus placebo evaluated daily PrEP, except for one trial of event -driven PrEP (n=400; RR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.03 to 0.63]). There was no difference between PrEP versus placebo/no PrEP in risk of serious adverse events (12 trials, N=18,292; RR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.77 to 1.12]; I2=56%), diseases, or adverse pregnancy -related outcome s; PrEP was associated with a non -statistically significant increased risk of fracture (7 trials, N=15,241; RR, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.97 to 1.56]; I2=0%). PrEP was associated with increased risk of renal adverse events (12 trials, N=18,170; RR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.18 to 1.75]; [95% CI, to events N=18,300; [95% CI, 0.48% to 3.43%]); most adverse events were mild and reversible. Two trials not included in the Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention iv Pacific Northwest EPC 2019 USPSTF review found the dapivirine vaginal ring associated with decreased risk of HIV infection versus placebo ring in African wom en at higher risk of HIV infection (2 trials, N=4,564; RR, 0.71 [95% -3.75% to -0.74% at 1.4 to 1.6 years). One new trial found daily oral tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) -FTC to be non - inferior to TDF -FTC in men who have sex with men (MSM; n=5,335; RR, 0. 47 [95% CI, 0. 19 to 1.14]); TAF -FTC was associated with positive short -term effects on bone mineral density versus TDF -FTC and negative effects on lipid parameters and weight gain (mean difference 1.2 kg), without di fferences in clinical adverse events. Long -acting injectable cabotegravir was associated with decreased risk of HIV infection versus oral TDF -FTC in one new trial of cisgender MSM and transgender women (n=4, 490, RR, 0.3 3 [95% CI, 0.18 to 0.6 2]) and one new trial of women at higher risk of HIV infection (n=3,178, RR, 0.11 [95% CI, 0.04 to 0.31]). Cabotegravir was associated with increased risk of injection site reactions and weight gain (mean differences <1 kg). Instruments for predicting incident HIV infec tion had moderate discrimination in MSM (5 studies, N=25,488; area under the receiver operating characteristic [AUROC ] curve ranged from 0.60 to 0.73) and moderate to high discrimination general populations of HIV -uninfected persons (2 studies, N=5,477,291 ; 0.80 to 0.89]). Evidence on the accuracy of instruments for predicting incident HIV infection in specific populations other than MSM was very limited. Limitations: Restricted to English language ; some pooled analyses with statistical heterogeneity or imprecise estimates; most trials evaluating risk of sexually transmitted infections were blinded to receipt of PrEP; most randomized trials were conducted in low -income settings , potentially limiting appli cability to U.S. primary care; and evidence lacking in adolescents and pregnant women. Conclusions: In adults at increased risk of HIV infection, oral PrEP with TDF or TDF -FTC is associated with decreased risk of HIV infection compared with placebo or no PrEP, although effectiveness decreases with inadequate adherence . TAF -FTC was non -inferior to TDF-FTC in MSM and long -acting injectable cabotegravir was associated with decreased risk of HIV infection versus TDF -FTC in MSM or transgender women and women at higher risk for HIV infection. Instruments for predicting risk of incident HIV infection have modera te discrimination in MSM and moderate to high discrimination in general populations of HIV -uninfected persons.

Primary Care Interventions to Increase HIV PrEP Utilization Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 1 Pacific Northwest EPC Chapter 1. Introduction and Background Purpose Effective strategies to prevent HIV infection are an important public health priority. Pre - exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) involves use of antiretroviral medications on an ongoing basis (e.g., daily or bimonthly ) or before and after HIV exposure events (\"on -demand\" or \"event -driven\" PrEP) to decrease the risk of acquiring HIV infection. This report will be used by the U .S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) to update its 2019 recommendation on PrEP for the prevention of HIV infection; at the time, this was a new topic for the USPSTF. In 2019, t he USPSTF recommended that clinicians offer PrEP with effective antiretroviral medications to persons at high risk of HIV acquisition ( Grade A Recommendation ).1 The recommendation was based on convincing evidence that PrEP is of substantial benefit in reducing the risk of HIV infection in persons at high risk of HIV acquisition and adequate evidence of small harms, resulting in high certainty of substantial net b enefit. The USPSTF also found convincing evidence that the effectiveness of PrEP is highly correlated with adherence. In October 2019, following the release of the USPSTF recommendation, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tenofovir alafe namide fumarate (TAF) -emtricitabine (FTC) for PrEP. Subsequently, the USPSTF commissioned a brief, focused update on TAF -FTC for PrEP, which found it to be noninferior to standard PrEP regimen of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) -FTC in reducing December 2021 , extended -release cabotegravir was FDA -approved for PrEP in December 2021. This report will update the 2019 USPSTF review on PrEP.2 Like the prior review, it will synthesize evidence on benefits and harms of PrEP (including newer regimens), effects of adherence, and accuracy of methods for identifying potential candidates for PrEP. In addition, it will address utilization of PrEP, including potential disparities, as well as methods for reducing disparities. Note: Studies on PrEP vary in precision when describing the distribution of gender identity and sex assigned at birth of study populations. In the absence of specific and detailed information on gender and sex (e.g., cis gender man, trans gender man), we will use gender terminology (e.g., man, woman) rather than terminology commonly used to describe biological sex at birth (e.g., male, female, intersex). We recognize that information on gender reported in studies is often inferred or assumed based on anatomy or personal presentation and may not reflect some patients' self -identified gender. We also recognize that binary construction of gender fail s to account for individuals that do not identify as men or women. We aim to accurately describe the gender composition of the studies underlying the included evidence to the extent possible, and to use gender -inclusive language where reporting clarity can be retained without gender identifiers. In this document, the terms man and woman generally refers to c is man and cis woman, though it is not always certain that other genders are excluded. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 2 Pacific Northwest EPC Condition Background Condition Definition HIV is a ribonucleic acid retrovirus that infects immune cells in humans \u2014in particular, CD4+ T helper cells (referred to as CD4 count in this report). Untreated, HIV infection results in progressive immunodeficiency and AIDS in more than 90 percent of patients. AIDS is a potentially life -threatening condition that occurs when HIV becomes severe, as defined by a CD4 count of 200 cells/mm3 or less or one or more AIDS -defining neoplastic conditions or opportunistic infections.3 HIV-1 infection is the most common variant in the United States. HIV - 2 infection is rare in the United States, less clinically severe, and endemic in parts of West Africa.4 Prevalence and Burden of Disease/Illness Since the first cases of AIDS (Stage 3 HIV) were reported in 1981, more than 766,380 persons diagnosed with AIDS in the United States have died, and 1,307,283 persons have been diagnosed.5 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CD C) estimates that approximately 1.2 million persons in the United States were living with HIV infection in 2019,6 including 13 percent who were unaware of their infection. This represents a decrease since 2008, when approximately 20 percent of infected persons were estimated to be unaware of their HIV infection status.7-9 In 2019, 36,585 persons were newly diagnosed with HIV, a rate of 11.1 per 100,000 people ; whereas in 2016 there were 39,552 new infections.10 There were 16,232 deaths among adults and adolescents with HIV in the U nited States in 2019 from any cause ; there were 16,372 deaths in 2016.10 Although the CDC reported that the number of HIV diagnoses declined to 30,403 in 2020, it noted that data might be less reliable due to COVID -19 related disruptions to HIV testing, care -related services, and surveillance.10 Groups more affected by HIV infection in the United States include men who have sex with men (MSM ) and Black and Hispanic/ Latin x persons. Between 2006 and 2009, there was a 21 percent increase in HIV incidence among persons ages 13 to 29 years, driven larg ely by a 34 percent increase among MSM , the only risk group to experience a significant increase in incidence during this period (p<0.001).11 In 2019, of total HIV diagnoses, 29,589 (81%) were among adult and adolescent m en (age 13 years or older), 6,939 (19%) were among adult and adolescent women , and 57 (0.1%) were among children younger than age 13 years.10 Among adolescents, the incidence of HIV infection rose sharply from ages 13 to 14 years (0.2 cases per 100,000 persons) to ages 15 to 19 years ( 7.8 cases per 100,000 persons). In 2019, the highest rates (per 100,000 perso ns) by age group were 27.5 among persons 20 to 24 year s of age , 31.4 among those 25 to 29 year s of age , and 25.3 among those 30 to 34 year s of age . By race/ethnicity, 42 percent of new diagnoses occurred among Black persons, 25 percent among White persons, and 27 percent among Hispanic/ Latin x persons. Among men, having sex with men is the most common transmission method (81%), followed by heterosexual contact ( 9.1%), injection drug use (4.7%), and having sex with men and injection drug use together ( 5.1%). Among women , heterosexual contact is the most common transmission method ( 83%), followed by injection drug use ( 17%).10 Among transgender women, the prevalence of HIV is 62 percent in Black Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 3 Pacific Northwest EPC transgender women, 35 percent in H ispanic/ Latin x transgender women, and 17 percent in White transgender women.12 Etiology and Natural History HIV infection is acquired through mucosal or intravenous exposure to infected bodily fluids such as blood, semen, and genital tract secr etions. The presence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) increases risk, as do certain sexual behaviors (e.g., penile -anal or penile -vaginal intercourse without a condom, sex with multiple partners, sex with persons with HIV with a detectable viral load13 or at high risk of HIV infection), and high viral load in the infected partner.14,15 In persons who inject drugs (PWID) , factors associated with HIV infection include increased frequency or duration of injection behaviors and certain drug use behaviors (e.g., sharing needles or backloading [injecting drugs from one syr inge into the back of another opened syringe]).16 The primary HIV infection syndrome usually develops 2 to 4 weeks following initial exposure to HIV.17 Acute infection is often associated with a clinical syndrome resembling infectious mononucleosis.18,19 Very early after acute infection, there is rapid virus production that then declines to a set point ( the set point varies between individuals) as the host immune system responds, although continuous rapid virus production and clearance occurs at all stages of infection.20-25 Although a small proportion of untre ated persons with HIV remain asymptomatic and show little evidence of progressive immune suppression after 10 or more years of infection, more than 90 percent of untreated patients eventually develop AIDS.3 In the era before highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was available, the median time from seroconversion t o the develo pment of AIDS was 7.7 to 11.0 years, and median survival was 7.5 to 12 years.26,27 The primary mechanism through which chronic HIV infection causes immune deficiency is through a decrease in the level and functioning of CD4 cells. In untreated HIV infection , the CD4 count declines an average of 50 to 75 cells/mm3 per year.28 Most patients with CD4 counts over 200 cells/mm3 are either asymptomatic or have mild disease,29 although data indicate an increased risk of AIDS or death even in patients with CD4 counts over 500 cells/mm3.30 Patients with CD4 counts less than 200 cells/mm3 have advanced immunodeficiency and are at markedly increase d risk of AIDS -related opportunistic infections , other AIDS -related complications, and AIDS -associated mortality.31-33 A higher HIV viral load is a strong independent predictor of more rapid progression to AIDS.31-36 Other predictors of more rapid progression include older age at the time of infection,26,27,31,32,35,37,38 more severe symptoms at the time of primary HIV infection,39 and other clinical and genetic factors. A factor associated with slow er progression is the c ysteine -cysteine chemokine receptor 5 delta32 genotype.40-44 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 4 Pacific Northwest EPC Risk Factors Persons at increased risk of HIV infection include MSM ; men and women who have condomless vaginal or anal intercourse with more than one partner; men and women who exchange sex for drugs or money; persons with a history of or current injection drug use; persons with or seeking treatment for other STIs; persons with a history of blood transfusion between 1978 and 1985; persons whose past or current sexual partners are infected with HIV with a detectable viral load,13 bisexual, or PWID ; trans gender persons; and persons who do not report one of these risk factors but who request HIV testing.45-47 Settings in wh ich the prevalence of HIV infection is often more than 1 percent include STI clinics, correctional facilities, homeless shelters, tuberculosis clinics, clinics specialized in the care of sexual and gender minorities, and clinics caring for an adolescent co mmunity with a high prevalence of STIs.48 Rationale for Screening/Screening Strategies HIV infection remains incurable , requiring lifelong treatment, and can have important health consequences. Therefore, preventing HIV infection is an import ant public health and clinical priority. In the absence of an effective vaccine, HIV prevention strategies include screening, as recommended by the USPSTF49 and others, to identify infected persons ; treatment with antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) in persons with HIV to reduce risk of transmission50; and behavioral counseling to reduce high -risk sexual and drug use behaviors. For persons at increased risk of HIV infection who are not infected, PrEP with antiretroviral medications51-55 in combinatio n with risk behavior counseling is another prevention strategy to reduce risk of acquiring HIV infection.56 PrEP involves use of antiretroviral medications on an ongoing, regular (e.g., daily) basis or before and after HIV exposure events to lower the likelihoo d of acquiring HIV infection. PrEP differs from nonoccupational postexposure prophylaxis, which involves use of antiretroviral medications for 28 days after a single high -risk exposure.57 Expanded use of PrEP has been highlighted as a critical component in the national initiative to end the HIV epidemic in the United States.58 Interventions/Treatment The standard antiretroviral regimen for PrEP has been a daily or al fixed -dose combination of the nucleoside reverse transciptase inhibitors TDF ( a prodrug of te nofovir) and FTC . This combination was selected because of its effectiveness as part of antiretroviral treatment for HIV infection, favorable safety profile, re latively high genetic barrier to resistance, and achievement of high concentrations in rectal tissue (TDF) and female genital tissue (FTC).59 In 2012, the FDA approved daily oral TDF -FTC for PrEP in adults at risk of sexual acquisition of HIV -1 infection .60 In 2018, the FDA expanded the indication for PrEP to include adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb).61 Oral daily TDF without FTC has also been evaluated for PrEP, but is not FDA -approved for this i ndication. As described above, FDA approved TAF -FTC for PrEP in adolescents and adults weighing at least 35 kg in 2019 to reduce risk of sexually acquired HIV -1 infection , excluding those at risk of acquiring HIV through receptive vaginal sex, due to the l ack of clinical data in this population.62 Like TDF, TAF is a prodrug of tenofovir, a nucleo side Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 5 Pacific Northwest EPC reverse transcriptase inhibitor of HIV. However, TAF is transported into peripheral blood mononuclear cells (the target of HIV) more rapidly than TDF and achieves higher and more sustained intracellular drug levels at lower tenofovir serum levels.63 Higher intracellular levels of tenofovir could result in increased effectiveness and lower serum levels could result in increased safety, including reduction in known negative effects of tenofovir on kidney function and bone mineral density . Because effectiveness of PrEP depends on adherence,2,64 there has been interest in nondaily oral regimens that may enhance adherence while maintaining effectiveness of PrEP ,65 as well as other approaches to enhance adherence. Alternative regimens include event -driven66 (taken before and after an anticipated HIV exposure event ; also referred to as \"on -demand\" or \"2 -1-1\" PrEP .67,68 Studies have also evaluated alternative, nono ral modes of PrEP that require infrequent dosing (e.g., long -acting injectables69- 71 or an intravaginal ring72-74). As mentioned earlier, o n December 20, 2021, cabotegravir was FDA -approved in adults and adolescent s >35 kg75 for PrEP to reduce risk of sexually acquired HIV infection. In the trials conducted to obtain FDA approval, cabotegravir was initiated with a daily oral lead -in for up to five weeks, followed by monthly injections for two months, and then bimonthly injections . The oral lead -in was d esigned to assess tolerability; given the high tolerability observed in the trials, the FDA -approved label considers the oral lead -in to be optional. Factors that may affect the balance of benefits and harms in persons prescribed PrEP include adverse drug -related events, the potential for antiretroviral resistance in persons who acquire HIV while taking PrEP, and the potential for behavioral risk compensation. Behavioral risk compensation refers to an increase in behaviors associated with HIV transmission (e.g., sex without a condom or multiple sexual partners). Because PrEP does not protect against STIs such as syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea, behavioral risk compensation could increase the rate of STIs, a potential harm that could attenuat e benefits from preventing HIV acquisition , or result in unintended pregnancy . Another potential harm is that PrEP could induce antiretroviral resistance in persons with HIV who inadvertently receive PrEP or in HIV -uninfected persons who acquire infection while on PrEP . With long -acting injectables such as cabotegravir, an extended pharmacokinetic tail (persistence of the drug at slowly declining levels) following administration poses a risk for selection of resistance in persons who are not adherent.76 Adverse effects of TDF include negative effects o n bone density and kidney function.77-79 A potential advantage of TAF over TDF is that it achieves higher and more sustained intracellular drug levels at lower tenofovir serum levels, which could reduce negative impacts on kidney function and bone health.63 The dapivirine vaginal ring is inserted monthly, may enhance autonomy in use of PrEP, and results in little systemic absorption, potentially increasing safety during pregnancy. However, data indicate lower efficacy than standard oral PrEP regimens.80 Among transgender persons, potential issues related to use of PrEP include concerns that PrEP could negatively affect h ormone therapy, or that hormones might decrease the efficacy of PrEP.81 Current Clinical Practice /Recommendations of Other Groups In 2014, the United States Public Health Service issued a guideline82 recommending PrEP with TDF -FTC in adul ts at high risk of infection, including MSM with a high number of sexual Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 6 Pacific Northwest EPC partners or inconsistent condom use, MSM and heterosexual persons in HIV -serodiscordant relationships, other high -risk heterosexual persons, and PWID who have an HIV positive partner or share injection equipment; the guideline was updated in 201783 and in 2021.84 Required elements for PrEP include documentation of a negative HIV test prior to initiating PrEP, o ngoing adherence and behavioral risk reduction support, and periodic (every 6 months) screening for STIs. Criteria from the 2021 guideline for PrEP were revised and simplified in persons at risk due to sexual exposure to include those who have had anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and: 1) an HIV -positive sexual partner (particularly if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load); 2) bacterial sexually transmitted infection in the last 6 months; or 3) inconsistent or no condom use with sexual partners(s) of unknown HIV status ( Table 1 ). PrEP is also recommended in those who do not meet these criteria, but request it, due to potential undisclosed risk. Changes in the 2021 guideline84 include recommendations for PrEP in adolescents weighing at least 35 kg; TAF -FTC as an option for men and transgender women at sexual risk ; a recommendation and guidance for use of cabotegravir when FD A-approved (it was approved shortly after guideline publication75); and guidance on PrEP by telehealth, same -day PrEP initiation, and off -label use of TDF/FTC to MSM using an on -demand (\"2 -1-1\") regimen. Unlike the prior guidelines, TDF alone is no longer a recommended option for PrEP. The guideline recommends that providers offer PrEP with TDF -FTC to women seeking to conceive and pregnant or breastfeeding persons whose sexual partner has HIV, especially when their current partner's viral load is unknown or detectable. FDA labeling information and perinatal antiretroviral trea tment guidelines permit use of TDF -FTC (as well as TAF -FTC) during pregnancy, with data indicating no increased risk of adverse effects among fetuses exposed to these medications when used as PrEP or for HIV treatment. The guideline notes that evidence on safety of PrEP with TDF -FTC or TAF -FTC in breastfeeding infants is lacking, though data indicate limited exposure via breast milk. Data on safety of cabotegravir in pregnancy or while breastfeeding are lacking ;85 data sugge st a possible association between fetal exposure to dolutegravir (a medication in the same integrase strand inhibitor class as cabotegravir) and small increase in risk of neural tube defects.86 The International Antiviral Society -USA also recommends PrEP i n adults and adolescents at risk for HIV infection ( Table 1 ).87 Daily TDF -FTC is recommended for oral PrEP, with on -demand TDF -FTC an option for MSM and TAF -FTC for MSM at risk for kidney dysfunction, osteoporosis, or osteope nia. The society recommends injectable cabotegravir for cisgender men and transgender women who have sex with men contigent on FDA approv al.75 The guideline does not address cabotegravir for cisgender women, as the trial in which cabotegravir was evaluated in this population had not yet been published.88 The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends oral PrEP containing TDF for people at substantial risk of HIV infection.89 \"Substantial risk\" was provisionally defined as HIV incidence around 3 per 100 person -years or higher in the absence of PrEP, including some groups of MSM , transgender women in many settings, and heterosexual men and women who have sexual partners with un diagnosed or untreated HIV infection ( Table 1 ). WHO now also recommends the dapivirine vaginal ring as an option for women at substantial risk of HIV infection .80 However, the dapivirine ring is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for any indication and has been withdrawn by its manufacturer from FDA review, due to the Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 7 Pacific Northwest EPC manufacturer's assessment of a low likelihood of obtaining approval .90 The WHO has issued an implementation tool for PrEP.91 Recent data indicate that implementation of PrEP in the United States has increased,92 but remains limited.93 In 2019 , the CDC estimated that approximately 285,000 of 1.2 million eligible individuals for PrEP (or 23 %) received it, an increase from about 20 percent in 2015.94 A number of clinician and patient barriers to wider use of PrEP have been identified, including lack of knowledge/awareness of PrEP (particularly amo ng primary care providers),95-98 perception of HIV risk, stigma, distrust of healthcare providers and systems, access to PrE P and costs, and concerns about harms.99,100 Even among academic primary care providers with high awareness of PrEP, one 2015 survey found that only a minority (approximately one -third) had adopted it.101 An analysis of a large commercial insurance database found th at primary care physicians prescribed 79 percent of PrEP while infectious disease physicians prescribed 7 percent; however, the majority of prescribing physicians provided HIV care (primary care or infectious disease).92 Under the Affordabl e Care Act, U.S. health plans are required to cover USPSTF \"A\" and \"B\" recommendations without cost sharing starting one year from the issue date of the recommendation (June 30, 2020),102 potentially increasing utilization and uptake by removing a financial barrier. However, data on PrEP utiliz ation following the 201 9 USPSTF recommendation are not yet available. Disparities Significant disparities have been reported around use of PrEP. Although Black persons are estimated to account for approximately 40 percent of persons in the U.S. with indications for PrEP, data indicate that in 2019, the number of White persons prescribed PrEP was approximately five times higher than the number of Black persons.103 In 2019 , CDC estimated PrEP cover age (the proportion eligible that received PrEP) at 7.9 percent in Black persons and 13.8 percent in Hispanic/Latinx persons, compared with 60.5 percent among White persons. Other factors associated with decreas ed utilization of PrEP include younger age, being women , substance use disorder , and being uninsured .103,104 Similar patterns were observed in 2020 and 2021; however, 2020 data were considered less reliable due to COVID -19 related disruptions and 2021 data were considered preliminar y.103 Although the incidence of HIV infection is particularly high among Black and Hispanic /Latin o adolescent and young adult MSM , data indicate low awareness and uptake of PrEP in this population.105 Utilization of PrEP also appears low in transgender persons; one study based on a national probability sample found that 3 percent of transgender persons at risk for HIV infection reported currently taking PrEP, despite most (72%) reporting favorable attitudes towards PrEP.106 In populations with less utilization of PrEP, some evidence indicates that dispari ties may be related to both decreased likelihood of PrEP initiation as well as increased likelihood of discontinuation among those who initiate.107 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 8 Pacific Northwest EPC Chapter 2. Methods Key Questions and Analytic Framework Using the methods developed by the USPSTF,108 the USPSTF and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality determined the scope and Key Questions for this review. Investigators created an analytic framework with the Key Questions and the patient populations, interventions, and outcomes reviewed ( Figure 1 ). Key informants were engag ed for input, the draft research plan was posted for public comment , and comments were addressed before finalization. Key Questions 1. What are the benefits of PrEP in persons without pre -existing HIV infection vs. placebo or no PrEP (including deferred PrEP) on the prevention of HIV infection and quality of life? a. How do the benefits of PrEP differ by populations of interest (e.g., defined by age, sex, gender identity, race and ethnicity, and HIV risk category)? b. How do the benefits of PrEP differ by dosing strategy or regimen? 2. What are the benefits of newer PrEP regimens (oral TAF -FTC, injectable vaginal ring) vs. TDF -FTC? 3. What is the diagnostic accuracy of provider or patient risk assessment tools in identifying persons at increased risk of HIV acquisition who are candidates for PrEP? 4. What are the harms of PrEP vs. place bo or no PrEP when used for the prevention of HIV infection? 5. What are the harms of newer PrEP regimens (oral TAF -FTC, injectable vs. TDF -FTC? Contextual Questions Six Contextual Question s were also requested by the USPSTF to help inform the report. Contextual Questions are not reviewed using systematic review methodology. 1. What are rates of adherence to and persistence of PrEP and factors associated with increased or decreased adherence in U.S. primary care settings? 2. How does adherence to and persistence of PrEP vary according to mode of administration (e.g., oral, injectable, or vaginal ring)? 3. What is the risk of infection with antiretroviral drug -resistant HIV in persons using PrEP, and what is the eff ect of infection with PrEP -related, antiretroviral drug -resistant HIV on treatment outcomes? 4. What factors (e.g., race and ethnicity, age, sex , gender , sexual orientation, HIV risk category, socioeconomic status, cultural factors, educational attainment, or health literacy) are associated with disparities in utilization of PrEP? 5. What is the effectiveness of primary care interventions to increase utilization of PrEP and decrease disparities in utilization? Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 9 Pacific Northwest EPC 6. What is the effectiveness of PrEP delivered using tel ehealth vs. office -based PrEP? Search Strategies We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase starting in January 2018 (the prior report searches went through June 2018, with surveillance through January 2019) to May 16, 2022 , and carried forward the relevant included studies from the prior re port. We also reviewed reference lists of relevant articles. Search strategies are available in Appendix A1 . Additional surveillance for new literature will be conducted on an ongoing basis. Study Selection All titles and abstracts identified through searches were independently reviewed by two members of the research team for eligibility against predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, as specified using the PICOTS (population, intervention, comparator, outcome, timing, study design) framework ( Appendix A2 ). Studies marked for possible inclusion by any reviewer underwent full -text review. All results were tracked in a n EndNote\u00ae database (Thomson Reuters, New York, NY). We excluded non -English -language articles and studies published only as conference abstracts. In accordance with the USPSTF Procedure Manual,108 studies assessed as poor quality were excluded. Each full -text article was independently reviewed by two members of the research team for inclusion or exclusion on the basis of the eligibility criteria. If the reviewers disagreed, conflicts were resolved by discussion and consensus or by consulting another member of the review team. Results of the full -text review were also tracked in the EndNote database, including the reason for exclusion for full -text publications. The selection of literature is summarized in the literature flow diagram ( Appendix A3 ). Appendix A4 lists the included studies, and Appendix A5 lists the excluded studies with reasons for exclusion. Scope of Review The population of interest for PrEP was HIV-uninfected persons at higher risk of HIV acquisition. The review addresses evidence on PrEP in adults, including pregnant persons without HIV and persons without HIV seeking to become pregnant with a partner with HIV , as well as adolescents (defined as persons 13 to <18 years of age ). Patient populations of interest were based on demographic characteristics (age, sex, gender identity, race and ethnicity, and pregnancy status) and HIV risk category (MSM, PWID , or persons at risk due to heterosexual contact). For the Key Question on risk assessment, we included studies on the diagnostic accuracy of provider or patient assessment instruments to predict HIV acquisition, for identification of potential candidates for PrEP. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 10 Pacific Northwest EPC The PrEP interventions addressed in this report were oral daily TDF -FTC, the first FDA - approved PrEP regimen and the more recently FDA -approved regimen of oral daily TAF -FTC. Oral TDF monotherapy was also included, even though it is not approved by the FDA for PrEP, since it has been evaluated in several ra ndomized trials and a large trial found no clear difference between TDF and TDF -FTC in effects on risk of HIV acquisition.51 Although oral TDF monotherapy was noted as an option for PrEP in PWID and heterosexual men and women in the 2017 United States Public Health Service guideline82 and the 2019 USPSTF recommendation,1 it is no longer84 a recommended option. Therefore, sensitivity analyses will be conducted without TDF monotherapy. We also include d injectable cabotegravir for PrEP, given the publication of recent randomized trials and inclusion in recent guidelines;84,87,109 on 12/20/21, injectable cabotegravir was approved by the FDA for PrEP.75 We also evaluated alternative (non -daily) oral dosing schedules (e.g., event -driven [on -demand]66 or intermittent dosing67,68), which are not approved by the FDA but have been evaluated in randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and adopted in some settings and recommende d in the updated United States Public Health Service guideline as an option for MSM .84 We stratified analyses according to the regimen used as well as the dosing regimen (daily or event -driven/intermittent). We also included the dapivirine vaginal ring, even though it is not currently FDA -approved for any indication (and has been withdrawn from FDA review) , because it is recommended by the WHO as an option for PrEP in women at increased risk and is being studied in a randomized trial of PrEP during pregnancy.73,74,80,110 -112 We did not include other PrEP maraviroc,113-115 tenofovir vaginal gel,54,116,117 or injectable rilpivirine ) because they are not approved by the FDA, have limited evidence of effectiven ess or evidence of low effectiveness, and are not recommended in clinical practice guidelines. The main comparisons w ere PrEP versus placebo or delayed PrEP.118 Because newer PrEP regimens have only been compared against TDF -FTC, we added new Key Questions assessing benefits and harms with this comparison. To address effects of dosing method on effectiveness, we also included randomized trials of daily versus nondaily (intermittent or event -driven) PrEP. The primary outcome was the rate of HIV infection; other outcomes were mortality, quality of life, and harms, including rates of non or any STI), hepatitis B and C virus infection, renal insufficiency, fractures, gastrointestinal adverse events, and pregnancy -related outcomes. HSV infection was addressed as a potential harm because of possible eff ects of behavioral risk compensation, although tenofovir may have antiviral effects that decrease risk of HSV transmission.119,120 Although the report focuses on effects of PrEP on health outcomes, for comparing newer versus older PrEP regimens effects on weight gain and lipid profiles were also addressed, given some data suggesting potential differences.121 We included randomized trials of PrEP versus placebo or no PrEP and randomized trials of newer PrEP regimens versus TDF -FTC. For evaluation of risk assessment instruments, we included studies assessing predictive utility. Because the association between adherence and effectiveness of PrEP has been well established, we removed a Key Question from the 2019 review addressing this question. We included Contextual Questions on adherence to PrEP and factors associated with increased or decreased adherence in U.S. primary care practices in order to help assess current implementation of PrEP . Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 11 Pacific Northwest EPC Methods for measuring adherence include patient diaries and self -report, pill counts, adherence monitoring devices, drug levels (e.g., plasma , dried blood spots , or urine levels ), and prescription fill data. In addition to adherence (taking PrEP as instr ucted) we also evaluated factors associated with PrEP persistence (continuation). We retained a Contextual Question on the association between use of PrEP and presence of antiretroviral drug resistance, as well as effects of infection with antiretroviral d rug-resistant HIV infection on clinical outcomes, given that this was identified as an evidence gap in the prior review. Like the prior review, this was not addressed as a Key Question because antiretroviral resistance due to PrEP appears to be uncommon, e ffects of antiretroviral resistance on clinical outcomes depend on a variety of factors (e.g., type of resistance mutation, availability of alternative antiviral regimens, and adherence to alternative regimens), and evidence on effects of PrEP -selected resistance on clinical outcomes appears to be very limited.122 We added new Contextual Questions on disparities in utilization of PrEP and interventions to increase utilization (including same -day initiation) and reduce disparities. In the context of the COVID -19 era and to potentially facilitate implementation of PrEP, we also added a new Contextual Question on effectiveness of tele health -delivered PrEP versus standard office - based PrEP. Contextual Questions were addressed through targeted literature searches to identify key articles to inform the USPSTF. Contextual Questions on adherence and utilization focused on randomized trials of PrEP and large implementation studies, surveys, and ot her observational studies conducted in the United States. For antiretroviral resistance , we used randomized trials of PrEP and open -label extensions of the trials. For interventions to increase PrEP utilization and PrEP by telehealth, we used randomized tr ials and comparative observational studies relevant to U.S. primary care settings. Data Abstraction and Quality Rating For studies meeting inclusion criteria, we updated data abstraction forms from the prior USPSTF review to summarize characteristics of study populations, interventions, comparators, adherence, and method s for assessing adherence, outcomes, study designs, settings, and methods. One investigator conducted data abstraction, which was reviewed for completeness and accuracy by another team mem ber. Predefined criteria w ere used to assess the quality of individual controlled trials, systematic reviews, and observational studies by using criteria developed by the USPSTF; studies w ere rated as \"good,\" \"fair,\" or \"poor\" based on the seriousness of methodological shortcomings (Appendix A6 ). We evaluate d the credibility of subgroup analyses based on whether the subgroups were predefined, whether subgroup characteristics were measured at baseline, whether the analyses were across or within studies, wh ether within -study comparisons were randomized, whether statistical tests for interaction were significant, the precision of estimates, the consistency of subgroup effects across studies, and whether results were biologically plausible.123 For each study, quality assessment w as performed by two team members. Disagreements w ere resolved by consensus. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 12 Pacific Northwest EPC Data Synthesis and Analysis Meta -analyses w ere updated and new meta -analyses were conducted for outcomes and comparisons for which there were multiple studies homogeneous enough to provide a meaningful combined estimate. The appropriateness of meta -analyses was based on the quality and number of studies and similarity between studies in design, patient popula tion, interventions, and outcomes. Due to anticipated statistical heterogeneity, m eta-analyses to calculate risk ratios for effects of PrEP on HIV infection, mortality, and harms w ere conducted using the DerSimonian and Laird random -effects model. Statisti cal heterogeneity w as assessed using the I2 statistic.124 When the I2 was greater than 30 percent, sensitivity analysis w as performed with the profile likel ihood method, as the DerSimonian and Laird model can result in overly narrow confidence intervals (CIs) in this situation.125 We conduct ed sensitivity and stratified analyses based on study quality, PrEP drug regimen, HIV risk category ( MSM , PWID , and men and women at increased risk via heterosexual contact), dosing schedule (daily or event - driven/intermittent), study duration (<1 year, 1 to <2 years, or 2 years), and country (United States and other high -income countries or low -/middle -income countries and international studies). We also conduct ed sensitivit y analyses using data from the FDA medical review of PrEP on HIV incidence and fracture rates in place of data reported in journal articles for these outcomes.126 For analyses w ith at least 10 trials, we construct ed funnel plots and perform ed the Egger test to detect small sample effects (a marker for potential publication bias).127 Qualitative data w as summarized in summary tables providing estimate ranges , descriptive analysis , and interpretation of results . Assessments of applicability w ere based on the countries in which studies were performe d, the demographic characteristics of the patients enrolled, the PrEP interventions used, and rates of HIV acquisition, adherence, and use of postexposure prophylaxis. For all Key Questions, the overall quality of evidence was determined using the approa ch described in the USPSTF Procedure Manual.108 Evidence was rated \"good,\" \"fair,\" or \"poor\" based on the number, quality and size of studies, consistency of results between studies, and directness of evidence.108 USPSTF and AHRQ Involvement The authors worked with USPSTF liaisons at key points throughout the review process to develop and refine the analytic framework and key questions and to resolve issues around scope for the final evidence synthesis. AHRQ staff provided oversight for the project, coordinated the systematic review, reviewed the draft report, and assisted in an external review of the draft evidence synthesis. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 13 Pacific Northwest EPC Expert Review and Public Comment The draft Research Plan was posted for public comment on the USPSTF website from November 4, 2021 to December 8, 2021. The Research Plan underwent minor revisions to improve clarity. In addition, hepatitis B was added as an outcome, \"persistence\" was added to Contextual Questions 1 and 2, and Contextual Question 5 was expanded to address primary care interventions to increase utilization of PrEP in general, in addition to addressing interventions to decrease disparities in utilization. The draft report has under gone peer review by content experts and collaborative partners (Appendix A7 ), and will also be posted for public comment . The report will be revised in response to comments before finalization. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 14 Pacific Northwest EPC Chapter 3. Results A total of 2,561 new references fro m electronic database searches , manual searches of recently published studies , and prior report references were reviewed, and 230 full-text papers were evaluated for inclusion. We inclu ded a total of 30 studies (reported in 61 publications).51-55,66 - 68,70,73,74,88,118,120,121,128 -173 Six trials , five diagnostic accuracy studies, and three additional publications to studies included in the prior report (in 16 publications) were newly identified as part of this update ,70,73,74,88,121,129,132,143,1 44,151,162 -165,169,171 and twelve trials and seven diagnostic accuracy studies ( in 45 publications) were carried forward from the previous re port.51-55,66 - 68,118,120,128,130,131,133 -142,145 -150,152 -161,166 -168,170,172,173 Included studies and quality ratings are described in Appendix B . Key Question 1. What Are the Benefits of PrEP in Persons Without Pre -Existing HIV Infection vs. Placebo or No PrEP (Including Deferred PrEP) on the Prevention of HIV Infection and Quality of Life? Summary Oral PrEP vs. Placebo or No PrEP Oral PrEP with TDF -FTC or TDF was associated with decreased risk of HIV infection versus placebo or no PrEP in populations at higher risk of acquiring HIV (11 trials , N=18,172 ; relative risk [RR], 0.46 [95% -2.0% [95% CI, to -1.2%] after 4 months to 4 years).51- 55,66,67,118,137,170,172 There was a strong association between degree of adherence and oral PrEP effectiveness (p<0.00001 for interaction) o Adherence 70%: 6 trials; RR, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.19 -FTC or TDF alone was consistently associated with decreased risk of HIV infection versus placebo when trials were stratified according to HIV risk category, study duration, setting (high - or low -income), and study quality, and in subgroup analyses based on age51,53,137,172 and gender .51,53,170 Effects of oral PrEP versus placebo or no PrEP on risk of HIV infection were similar with TDF alone (RR, 0.49 [95% CI, I2=74%); all trials evaluated daily PrEP, with the exception of one trial66 of event -driven PrEP in MSM (RR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.03 to 0.63]). Oral PrEP with TDF -FTC or FTC was associated with a statistically nonsignificant reduc ed risk of mortality versus no PrEP or placebo (9 trials ; RR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.59 to 1.11]; I2=0%).51-55,118,137,170,172 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 15 Pacific Northwest EPC No trial reported the association between oral PrEP versus placebo or no PrEP and quality of life. Dapivirine Vaginal Ring vs. Placebo Ring The dapivirine vaginal ring was associated with decreased risk of HIV infection versus placebo ring in African women at increased risk of HIV infection (2 trials, N= 4,564; RR at 1.4 to 1.6 years).73,74 Evidence Oral PrEP vs. Placebo or No PrEP Twelve RCTs, all included in the prior USPSTF report, evaluated PrEP versus placebo or no PrEP ( Table 2; Appendix B Tabl es 1-3). The trials were reported in 32 publications ; 2951-55,66 - 68,118,128,133,134,137,139,146,148 -150,152,153,156 -159,161,168,170,172,173 were included in the prior report , and three publications were added129,132,169 for this update. The prior USPSTF review rep orted efficacy data for HIV infection from all trials ; both publications added for this update were secondary publications reporting an additional outcome or analysis from IPERGAY,66 a previously included trial. Of the 12 trials of oral PrEP, two67,68 enrolled 72 patients each; in the other 10 trials , the sample sizes ranged from 400 to 4,726 (total N=18,244). Duration of followup ranged from 4 months to 4 years. Eleven trials randomized patients to PrEP or placebo. The other open -label trial randomized pa tients to immediate versus delayed PrEP (no PrEP for 1 year, after which patients received PrEP).118 Six trials51,54,55,68,170,172 enrolled men and women at increased risk of HIV infection due to heterosexual contact, four trials52,66,118,137 enrolled MSM or transgender women, one trial67 enrolled both MSM and high -risk women, and one trial53 enrolled PWID . The mean age in all trials was you nger than age 40 years. No trial enrolled pregnant women or persons younger than age 18 years. Three trials52,53,55 evaluated TDF 300 mg, six trials66-68,137,170,172 evaluat ed TDF 300 mg -FTC 200 mg, one trial118 evaluated TDF 245 mg -FTC 200 mg, and two trials51,54 evaluated both TDF 300 mg alone and TDF 300 mg -FTC 200 mg. PrEP was prescribed daily in 11 trials51- 55,67,68,118,137,170,172 and dosing was intermittent or event -driven in three tr ials (two of which also included daily dosing arms).66-68 In one trial (the Intervention Pr\u00e9ventive de l'Exposition aux Risques Avec et Pour les GAYs [IPERGAY] trial), event -driven PrEP consisted of two ta blets of TDF -FTC 2 to 24 hours before intercourse, followed by one tablet 24 hours and 48 hours after the first dose; additional dosing parameters were provided for multiple consecutive sexual encounters and situations in which event -driven PrEP had been taken within 1 week.66 Two other trials evaluated intermittent/event -driven PrEP (consisting of PrEP twice weekly and within 2 hours of intercourse) but either reported no HIV infectio ns or combined results with patients randomized to daily PrEP.67,68 In all trials, HIV risk reduction and adher ence counseling wa s provided to all patients . Free condoms were provi ded in all trials except for one, in which condom provision was not specified .118 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 16 Pacific Northwest EPC Seven trials were conducted in Africa,51,54,55,67,68,170,172 one in Thailand,53 two in Europe or Canada,66,118 one in the United S tates,52 and one trial was international (~10% of patients from U.S. sites).137 The trial conducted in the United States (n=400) evaluated daily TDF versus placebo in MSM ;52 the two trials conducted in Europe and Canada66,118 and the international trial137 also focused on MSM . All trials of persons at higher risk of HIV infection via heterosexual contact were conducted in Africa, and the only trial of PWID was conducted in Thailand.53 In that trial, most patients received PrEP through directly observed therapy and patients were provided bleach with instructions on how to clean needles. Patients were not provided sterile syringes, although these were available at low cost without a prescription at pharmaci es. The adherence level in each trial and method for measuring adherence are shown in Table 2 . All trials reported funding from government agencies or nonprofit organizations. One trial also reported industry funding,118 three trials reported that study medications were donated by industry,67,68,172 and one trial noted that two investigators received royalties or funding from industry.170 One trial118 was rated fair quality because of unclear allocation concealment methods and open -label design ( Appendix B Table 4 ). The remaining trials were rated good quality. Results for incident HIV infection are summarized in Table 3 . Among 12 trials of PrEP versus placebo or no PrEP51-55,66 -68,118,137,170,172 one small (n=72) trial68 reported no cases of HIV infection with either PrEP or placebo. In the other 11 trials (N=18,172 ), the proportion of patients with new HIV infection ranged from 0 to 5.6 percent among those randomized to PrEP and from 1.4 to 7.0 percent among those randomized to placebo or no PrEP ( Appendix B Table 1). PrEP was associated with reduced risk of HIV infection versus placebo or no PrEP (RR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.33 to 0.66]) heterogeneity present I2=67%). The -2.0 percent (95% CI, -2.8% to -1.2%; I2=58%) after 4 months to 4 years. Funnel plot asymmetry was present and the test for small sample effects was statistically significant (Egger test p -value=0.03) ( Appendix C Figure 1 ). Excluding the single fair -quality st udy118 from the analysis had little effect on the pooled estimate (RR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.36 to 0.70]) and did not reduce statistical heterogeneity ( I2=65%). Results were similar using th e profile likelihood method (pooled RR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.26 to 0.65]) and when FDA data on HIV incidence was used instead of the data reported in the journal publication for the Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Initiative (iPrEx ) trial.126,137 Two African trials (the Pr e-Exposure P rophylaxis Trial for HIV Prevention Among African Women [FEM PrEP ] trial and the Vaginal and Oral Interventions to Control the Epidemic [VOICE] trial)54,172 of women at risk of HIV inf ection via heterosexual contact found PrEP to be substantially less effective (RR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.55 to 1.44] and RR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.70 to 1.28]) than the other 10 trials (RR estimates ranged from 0.07 to 0.53). In FEM PrEP and VOICE, adherence to PrEP w as low, with 30 to 40 percent of patients randomized to PrEP having detectable plasma levels of tenofovir. A stratified analysis found a strong interaction (p<0.00001) between level of adherence and effectiveness of PrEP (adherence 70%: 6 trials; RR, 0.27 [95% ).51- Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 17 Pacific Northwest EPC There was also a strong association between adherence and effectiveness when adherence was analyzed as a conti nuous variable in a meta -regression (p<0.0005) ( Figure 4 ). In the meta - regression, the level of adherence accounted for all of the between -study heterogeneity. For every 10 percent increase in adherence, there was a 21 percent relative reduction in the rel ative risk. Meta -regression findings were similar when analyses were restricted to trials that evaluated adherence based on plasma levels or when trials were stratified according to whether they used TDF or TDF -FTC. Adherence is further addressed in Contex tual Question s 1 and 2 . There was no clear difference in estimates of effectiveness of PrEP for preventing HIV infection when trials were stratified according to duration of followup ( Figure 5 ) (p=0.35 for interaction) by less than 1 year (3 trials; RR, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.07 to - 6.0% to -1.0%]; I2=69%),55,66,67 1 to less than 2 years (4 trials; RR, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.28 -5.0% to -1.0%]; or more years (4 trials; RR, [95% CI, 0.22 -3.0% to -1.0%; I2=54%),51-54 or whether trials reported receipt of industry support (3 trials; RR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.27 to 1.22]; I2=54%)67,170,172 versus only reporting governmental or nonprofit funding (8 trials; RR, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.23 to 0.64]; I2=77%)51-55,66,118,137 (Table 3 ). PrEP was more effective at preventing HIV infection in trials conducted in the United States, Europe, or Canada (3 trials; RR, 0.13 [95 % CI, 0.05 to 0.32]; I2=0%)52,66,118 than in trials conducted in Africa, Asia, or internationally (8 trials; RR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.37 to 0 .79]; I2=72%; p=0.004 for interaction) (Figure 6 ).51,53 -55,67,68,137,170,172 All three trials conducted in the United States, Europe, or Canada reported high adherence and enrolled MSM . Nine trials (N=17,744 )51-55,118,137,170,172 reported mortality; one other trial reported no deaths with or without PrEP,66 and two small, short -term trials (n=72 each; followup 4 months) did not report mortality.67,68 PrEP was associated with a modestly decreased risk of mortality that was not statis tically significant (9 trials; RR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.59 to 1.11]; I2=0%); however, due to small numbers of mortality events, risk estimates from individual trials and the pooled estimate were imprecise (Figure 7 ). There was no funnel plot asymmetry ( Appendix C Figure 2 ). Results for mortality were similar when trials were stratified according to geographic setting and when the profile likelihood method was used for pooling (RR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.54 to 1.14]). No trial reported effects of PrEP versus pla cebo on quality of life. Dapivirine Vaginal Ring vs. Placebo Ring Two RCTs ,73,74 (reported in three publications73,74,163) both added for this update, evaluated the dapivirine vaginal ring (25 mg monthly) versus a placebo ring (Table 3; Appendix B Table s 1- 3). Both trials (n =2,629 and 1,959; total N=4,588) enrolled sexually active (defined as vaginal intercourse at least once in the last 3 months73 or an average or at least once per month in the last 3 months74), HIV-negative women 18 to 45 years of age (mean 27 and 32 years) living in high HIV prevalence areas in sub-Saharan Africa. Pregnant and breastfeeding persons were excluded and participants were required to use stable contraception. T he duration of follow up wa s 1.6 years (median) in 1 trial73 and 1.4 y ears (mean) in the other trial.74 One trial was funded by government73 and one by a combination of gover nment, nonprofit, and industry.74 In both trials, HIV risk reduction and adherence counseling and condoms were provided to all patients. The trials were rated good quality ( Appendix B Table 4). Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 18 Pacific Northwest EPC Both trials (N=4 ,564) found the dapivirine ring associated with a similarly decreased risk of HIV infection versus placebo ( 5.4% vs. 7.4% , of 0.71 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.89, I2=0%; Figure was -2.23% (95% CI -3.75% to -0.74%) at 1.4 to 1.6 years. Adherence to the dapivirine ring was 82 and 84 percent in the trials, based on dapivirine plasma levels >95 pg/mL. The trials were not designed to assess effects of the dapivirine vaginal ring on mortality and reported very few events, with an imprecise estimate (N=4 ,587, 0.23% vs. 0.20%, RR 1.23, 95% 0. 35 to 4.38, I2=0%).73,74 Key Questi on 1a. How Do the Benefits of PrEP Differ by Population Subgroups? Oral PrEP vs. Placebo or No PrEP PrEP was effective across population subgroups defined by HIV risk category ( Table 4 ). There were no clear differences in estimates of effectiveness for PrEP versus placebo or no PrEP in risk of HIV infection when trials were stratified according to whether they enrolled men and women at increased risk of HIV infection via heterosexual co ntact (5 trials; RR, for ( Figure 9),53 although evidence of effectiveness in PWID was limited to one trial conducted in Asia. As noted above, the two trials (FEM -PrEP and VOICE) which found PrEP to be ineffective were conducted in African women at high risk of H IV infection in whom adherence was low.54,172 Five trials performed within -study stratified analyses of PrEP effectiveness ( Table 4).51,53,137,170,172 Four trials51,53,137,172 found no clear differences in PrEP effectiveness in populations defined according to age, and three trials51,53,170 found no clear differences between men and women . A post -hoc analysis of the iPrEx trial137 found that PrEP was effective in MSM (hazard ratio [HR], 0.50 [95% CI, 0.34 to 0.75]) but not in transgender women (HR, 1.1 [95% CI, 0.5 to 2.7]), although the interaction was not statistically significant (p=0.09).134 No other trial compared how results for transgender women differed from other risk groups. Evidence on how effects of PrEP vary by race/ ethnicity was limited to iPrEx, which found similar effectiveness in Hispanic and non -Hispanic persons.137 Among three trials conducted in the United States, Europe, or Canada, the proportion of participants who were White ranged from 73 to 91 percent.52,66,118 Data were limited regarding effects of risk behaviors on effectiveness of PrEP. One trial (iPrEx) found PrEP was effective in transgender women and MSM who reported receptive anal intercourse (HR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.26 to 0.68]) but not in those who did not report receptive anal intercourse (HR, 1.59 [95% CI, 0.66 to 3.84]; intera ction).137 One trial (Partners PrEP) found PrEP to be effective in men and women at risk of HIV infection through heterosexual contact regardless of whether they did or did not report sex without condoms.51 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 19 Pacific Northwest EPC This trial also found both TDF and TDF -FTC associated with similar eff ectiveness when analyzed according to sexual risk behaviors and partner's viral load ( Appendix B Table 1 ).161 A trial of PWID (the Bangkok Tenofovir Study) found no association between drug injection or needle sharing in the 12 weeks before enrollment and effectiveness of PrEP.53 A new post -hoc analysis of data from IPERGAY evaluated effects of event -driven PrEP among MSM stratified according to frequency of sexual intercourse and adheren ce in order to assess effects of more sporadic use of PrE P in persons engaging in less frequent sexual intercourse (compared to persons engaging in frequent sexual intercourse, in whom the frequency of event -driven PrEP more closely resembles daily PrEP).129 It found event -driven PrEP associated with decreased HIV incidence versus placebo among those who took 15 pills per month with high adherence (0 vs. 9.2 per 100 person -years, p=0.013) and those who took >15 pills per month (0 vs. 8.1 per 100 person -years, p=0.004), but not among those who took 15 pills per month with l ow or no adherence (10.2 vs. 0 per 100 person -years, p=0.19). When stratified according to patient population, pooled estimates for effects of PrEP versus placebo or no PrEP on mortality were similar (p=0.90 for interaction) in trials of women and men at increased risk of HIV infection via heterosexual contact (4 trials; RR, Figure 10).53 Dapivirine Vaginal Ring vs. Placebo Ring Both trials of the dapivirine va ginal ring conducted analyses stratified by age . Although the dapivirine ring was associated wi th reduced effectiveness in younger patients in both trials (likely related to lower adherence) , the trials differed in the age thresholds evaluated and there was either no statistically significant subgroup difference or a statistical test for a subgroup difference was not reported. In one trial, the dapivirine ring was associated with significant reduction in risk of HIV acquisition among patients older than 21 years (HR 0. 63, 95% CI 0.4 1 to 0.97) but not in those 21 years of age and younger (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.60 ; p for interaction=0.43).74 The other trial reported a more pronounced difference in effects of the dapivirine ring on reduced risk of incident HIV infection among persons 25 years or older (HR 0.39. 95% CI 0.23 to 0.68) than those younger than 25 years (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.41 ; p for interaction not reported ).73 One of the trials (Microbicide Trials Network 020 -A Study To Prevent Infection with a Ring for Extended Use, or ASPIRE)73 conducted additional stratified analyses based on STI status, number of sexual partners, and sexual behaviors . The dapivirine ring was associated with smaller reduction in risk of HIV acquisi tion among persons with an STI at baseline (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.34) than those without an STI at baseline (HR 0.53, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.83, p for interaction not reported).73 The dapivirine ring was associated with smaller reduction in risk of HIV acquisition among persons who engaged in anal intercourse compared with those who did not engage in anal intercourse (risk reduction 18%, 95% CI -57% to 57% d risk reduction 27%, 95% CI -5% to 49%, respectively), but the difference was not statistically signif icant (p for interaction=0.77).163 The reduction in HIV acquisition risk was very similar among persons with two or more sexual partners (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.23) and those with zero or one sexual partner (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.93.73 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 20 Pacific Northwest EPC Key Question 1b. How Do the Benefits of PrEP Differ by Dosing Strategy or Regimen? Estimates of effectiveness of oral PrEP versus placebo or no PrEP on risk of HIV infection were very similar when analyses were stratified according to use of TD F (5 trials; RR, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.28 interaction ) (Table 3 ; Figure 2 ).51,54,66,67,118,137,170,172 Among the trials that used intermittent or event -driven dosing, on e trial68 reported no HIV events and one trial67 combined results for intermittent/event -driven and daily dosing of PrEP arms. The third trial (IPERGAY)66 found event -driven PrEP associated with a lower risk of HIV infection than placebo in MSM (RR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.03 to 0.63]). Although the estimate was stronger than that among trial s that used daily dosing (9 trials; RR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.32 ( Table 3 Figure 11),51- 55,118,137,170,172 the interaction was not statis tically significant (p=0.13). The estimate from IPERGAY was similar to the pooled estimate for trials of daily dosing that reported high adherence (5 trials; RR, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.20 to 0.41]).51,52,67,118,170 In IPERGAY , men randomized to PrEP took an average of about four doses of PrEP per week (15 doses per month) and had an average of 10 episodes of sexual intercourse per month. The open -label HIV Prevention Trials Network 067/Alternative Dosing to Augment PrEP pill Taking (HPTN 067/ADAPT) trial , included in the prior USPSTF report, compared daily versus intermittent (twice a week, plus a dose after sex) or event -driven PrEP with TDF -FTC Appendix B Tabl es 1-3), but was not powered to evaluate effects on incident HIV infection (five total cases). One new, small (n=119), fair -quality crossover trial conducted in Hong Kong compared event -driven versus daily oral TDF -FTC among high -risk HIV -negative MSM, but also was not designed to assess effects on incident HIV infection and only reported one case (Tables 5 and 6; Appendix B Tabl es 1-3).144 Data on the effects of use of postexposure prophylaxis on efficacy of PrEP was limited. In the open -label Pre-Exposure Option for Reducing HIV in the U nited Kingdom : Immediate or Deferred (PROUD) trial, PrEP was more effective than no PrEP at reducing risk of HIV infection in MSM (RR, 0.14, 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.63 ), despite much less frequent use of postexposure prophylaxis (4.4% vs. 32%) and an increased rate of receptive anal sex without a condom with 10 or more partners (21% vs. 12%) among persons randomized to PrEP.118 No other trial reported the proportion of patients who used postexposure prophylaxis, although three trials described postexposure prophylaxis as an HIV prevention intervention offered to all patients;51,66,137 PrEP was effective in all three trials (RR, 0.14 to 0.53). For mortality, estimates for PrEP versus placebo or no PrEP were similar when trials were stratified according to whether they used TDF or TDF -FTC (p=0.65 for interaction) ( Figure 7 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 21 Pacific Northwest EPC Key Question 2. What Are the Benefits of Newer PrEP Regimens (TAF -FTC, Injectable Oral women ( 1.4%) who have sex with men for risk of incident HIV infection and associated with a non -statistically significant decreased risk (1 new trial, n=5,335; 0.3% vs. 0.6%, RR 0. 47 [95% CI, 0. 19 to 1.14]162). Long -Acting -acting injectable cabotegravir was associated with decreased risk of HIV infection versus oral TDF -FTC in 1 new trial of cisgender MSM (87%) and transgender women 4,490 0.6% 1.7%; RR 0.3 3 [95% CI, 0.18 to 0.62]70) and in 1 new trial of African women at high risk of HIV infection (n=3,178, 0.3% vs. 2.3%; RR 0.11 [95% CI, 0.04 to 0.31]88). No trials compar ed the dapivirine vaginal ring to TDF -FTC. Evidence Oral TAF -FTC vs. TDF -FTC One trial, published subsequent to the prior USPSTF report, compared PrEP with oral TAF -FTC versus TDF -FTC121,162 (Tables 5 and 6 , Appendix B Table s 1-3) The DISCOVER trial (n=5,335) is an ongoing trial (estimated completion September 2022) conducted in Europe and North America that enrolled HIV -negative cisgender adult men (98 .6%) and transgender women (1.4%) who have sex with men and are at high risk of HIV acquisition, based on having condomless anal intercourse with at least two partners in the previous 12 weeks or a STI (syphilis, rectal gonorrhea, or rectal chlamydia) in the previous 24 weeks ( Tables 1 to 3 ).121 Patient s were randomized to once -daily oral TAF -FTC (25 -200 mg) or TDF -FTC (300 -200 mg) and followed fo r 96 weeks . Mean age was 34 years. Nine percent of participants were Black and 4 percent were Asi an; 24 percent were Hispanic/ Latinx ethnicity. Sixteen percent of participants were receiving TDF -FTC PrEP at the time of enrollment. The trial was blinded and rated good quality ( Appendix B Table 4 ). At 96 weeks, TAF -FTC was associated with a non -statistically significant decreased risk of HIV infection versus TDF -FTC (0.3% vs. 0.6%, RR 0. 47, 95% CI 0. 19 to 1.14162); results were within the pre -specified non -inferiority margin. Adherence was high (98% based on pill count) and 84 to 96 percent based on dried blood spot samples consistent with 4 doses/week (Table s 5 and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 22 Pacific Northwest EPC 6). Findings were similar when five patients suspected of acquiring HIV infection before baseline (diagnosed at week 4) were excluded, or when patients suspected of acquiring HI V infection before baseline or with poor adherence were excluded. There were no statistically significant interactions between effects on HIV infection risk and age (<25 vs. 25 years), race (Black vs. other, ethnicity (Hispanic/Latinx vs. other), region ( United States vs. other), recreational drug use (yes vs . no), binge alcohol use (yes v s. no), or number of unprotected receptive anal intercourse partners (3 vs. >3121). However, stratified estimates were imprecise. No infections occurred in transgender women in either arm. DISCOVER was not designed to evaluate mortality; at 96 weeks, there were a total of five deaths (2 in the TAF -FTC arm and 3 in the TDF -FTC arm162). Long -Acting Injectable Cabotegravir vs. (600 mg intramuscular every 8 weeks, following a 5 week oral lead -in phase of 30 mg daily) versus daily oral TDF -FTC (300 mg TDF and 200 mg emtricitabine) ( Tables 5 and 6 Evidence HPTN 083 enrolled cisgender MSM or transgender women who have sex with men and HPTN 084 (also referred to as the Long -acting Injectable For the Epidemic [LIFE] trial) enrolled women at high risk for sexual acquisition of HIV infection. Both trials were discontinued early, based on cabotegravir meeting pre -defined thresholds for superiority over oral TDF -FTC in pre -planned interim analyses. The trials were rated good quality ( Appendix B Table 4 ). In HPTN 083 (n=4,566), 87 percent of participants were MSM and 12 percent were transgender women who have sex with men. The trial was conducted in the United States (37%), Latin America (43%), Asia (16%), and Africa (3.3%).70 Among U.S. participants, 50 percent were Black and 50 percent non-Black. High risk for HIV acquisition (required for enrollment) was defined as any of the following within the last six months: condomless receptive anal intercourse (except within a monogamous HIV seronegative concordant relationship), >5 sexual partn ers, stimulant drug use, or STI (rectal or urethral gonorrhea or chlamydia or incident syphilis). HPTN 083 was designed as a three -year trial but stopped after the first interim analysis. At median follow -up of 1.4 years, injectable cabotegravir was asso ciated with decreased risk of ( 0.6% vs. 1.7%; RR 0.6 2). Adherence was 91.5% for cabotegravir (based on injection s received with a delay of less than 2 weeks) and 74% with TDF -FTC (based on a tenofov ir plasma >40 ng/ml, consistent with receipt of daily TDF -FTC in the prior week). In stratified analysis, results were similar in MSM (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.68) and transgender women (HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.56) ; however, the estimate for transgender women was imprecise. Among U.S. patients, cabotegravir was associated with decreased risk of HIV acquisition among Black (HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.84) and non -Black persons (HR 0.09, 95% CI 0.00 to 2.05); however, no cases occurred in non-Black persons, resulting in an imprecise estimate. Findings were also similar when results were stratified by age ( 30 vs. >30 years) and geographic region. HPTN 084 (n=3,178) was conducted in seven countries in sub -Saharan Africa.88 Participants were aged 18 to 45 years (median 25 years), female sex assigned at birth, reported at least two Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 23 Pacific Northwest EPC episodes of vaginal intercourse in the prior 30 days, and were assessed as being at high risk for HIV acquisition using a risk predict ion instrument. The risk prediction instrument was developed and validated in African women and has items on : age, married/living with partner, partner providing financial or material support, partner having other partner, alcohol use, sexually transmitted infections, and herpes simplex virus 2 serostatus (score range 0 to 11, high risk defined as score 5).175 Pregnant and breastfeeding persons were not eligible for enrollment; persons who became pregnant during the trial were switched to open -label TDF -FTC through the end of pregnancy and breastfeeding. HPTN 084 was designed as a 3.5 -year trial but stopped after the second interim analysis. At median follow -up of 1.2 years, injectable cabotegravir was associated with decreased risk of HIV acquisition versus oral TDF -FTC ( 0.3% Adherence with cabotegr avir was 93.0 percent (based on injection received with a delay of less than 2 weeks) and for TDF -FTC it was 41.9 percent (based on a plasma concentration 40 ng/ml) or 18 percent (based on TFV -DP level consistent with taking 4 doses/week) . Results were similar in stratified analyses based on age (<25 vs. 25 years; for interaction=0.53), contraception method (p for interaction=0.87), and body mass index (30 vs. >30 kg/m2; p for interaction=0.47). Key Question 3. What Is the Diagnostic Accuracy of Provider or Patient Risk Assessment Tools in Identifying Persons at Increased Risk of HIV Acquisition Who Are Candidates for PrEP? Summary In MSM, f ive studies (three included in the prior USPSTF report and two new; N= 25,488 in validation cohorts ) of five different instruments (number of items ranged from 4 to 12) reported moderate discrimination for predicting incident HIV infection in validation cohorts (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC], 0.6 0 to 0.73).140,155,165,166,171 Evidence on how discrimination varied by race/ethnicity was inconsistent, with some studies showing lower discrimination and others showing similar discrimination. In PWID, o ne study (n=1,904 ) included in the prior USPSTF found a 10 -item instrument associated with AUROC of 0.72 for incident HIV infection , but had methodological limitations.167 In women evaluated in the emergency department, o ne new study found a 6-item risk prediction instrument on electronic medical record data associated with sensitivity of 95% for incident HIV infection (21 cases) ; specificity was not reported .164 In general populations of HIV -uninfected persons, t wo new studies (n=33,404 and 606,701 in validation cohorts ) found two different instruments (number of items 23 and 44) based on automated computerized algorithms on electronic medical record data associated with moderate to high discrimination for incident HIV infection (AUROC 0.77, 95% CI for HIV Prevention 24 Pacific Northwest EPC Evidence Twelve studies evaluated instruments developed and validated in U.S. cohorts for predicting incident HIV infection ( Appendix B Tables 5 and 6 ).131,140,142,143,145,151,155,164 -167,171 Seven studies131,140,142,145,155,166,167 were included in the prior USPSTF review and five studies143,151,164,165,171 were added for this update. Eight studies (two new)165,171 evaluated risk prediction instruments in MSM ,131,140,142,145,155,165,166,171 one study (included in the prior USPSTF report) in PWID ,167 one study (new) in cisgender women,164 and two studies (both new) in general populations of HIV -uninfected persons.143,151 No study evaluated instruments for predicting incident HIV infection risk in pregnant or postpartum U.S. persons . Sample sizes (including development and validation cohorts) ranged from 21 to 3,750,664 patients (total N=5,544,500 ). The duration of assessment for incident HIV infection ranged from 0.77 to 7.85 years in studies that reported this information. In the s tudies of general populations143,151 and the study of cisgender women,164 HIV risk assessment was based solely on data extracted from electronic health records; in the studies of MSM and persons who inject drug s, risk assessment was based on information obtained from patient interviews, questionnaires, and health records. One study evaluated patients attending a clinic for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons ,131 two studies evaluated patients attending STI clinic s,155,171 one study evaluated patients in the emergency department,164 and two studies143,151 evaluated patients in large health systems (in one of these studies,143 the external validation cohort was a health center focusing on sexual health care); the other studies evaluated person s enrolled in research studies. All studies had methodological shortcomings ( Appendix B Table 7 ). In all studies , risk assessment instruments were developed and validated using previously collected data, except for two s tudies143,151 that performed prospective validation. I n some cases, the criteria had to be slightly modified to match the data available. In eight studies, new HIV infections were identified in the study sample by repeat testing using a longitudinal (cohort) design. One study of MSM identified new HIV infections based on a single test for markers for acute or early HIV infection .140 Two studies143,151 of general populations excluded patients with HIV infection at baseline but did not perform HIV testing in all patients at baseline; the study of cisgender women164 focused on patients with a new positive HIV test in the emergency department and did not describe methods for ruling out prior HIV infection. Four studies used cohorts that in cluded persons who had HIV testing before the year 2000.155,165 -167 In nine studies, the predictive utility of risk assessment instruments was tested (validated) in cohorts independent from the one used to develop the instrument.140,142,143,145,151,155,165,166,171 In two studies, accuracy was only reported for the cohort used to develop the instrument131,167 and the study of cisgender women164 only reported sensitivity (only cases included in analysis) . Cutoffs to define a positive test were predefined in four studies .142,145,164,171 MSM Eight studies (N=65,284) including development and validation cohorts) evaluated risk prediction instruments in MSM .131,140,142,145,155,165,166,171 The studies evaluated six different risk assessment instruments or criteria ; four of these (Beymer , the San Diego Early Test [SDET ], the Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 25 Pacific Northwest EPC Assessing the Risk of Contracting HIV in Men Who Have Sex With Men [ARCH -MSM ], and Menza ) were in the prior USPSTF report and two instruments (Seattle PrEP Score and SexPro) were added for this update (Table 7). The number of criteria in the risk assessment instruments ranged from 4 to 12) . Items assessed in all of the risk instruments were presence of STIs, sex without a condom (particularly receptive anal sex), and number of sexual partners ( Appendix B Tables 5 and 6 ). Age, race/ethnicity, and illicit drug use were included in some instruments but not others. None of the instruments include an item on plasma HIV viral load or use of antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) in a sexual partner with HIV . Two of the studies com pared the performance of risk prediction instruments against the 2014 CDC indications for PrEP in MSM.131,171 In the cohorts used to develop the risk assessment instruments, four studies reported that the proportion of B lack parti cipants ranged from 6 to 15.2 percent of the population ;131,140,165,171 two studies reported that 5.0 and 7.4 percent of the population was Hispanic/ Latin x,165,171 one study reported that 5.6 percent of the populations was Asian and 1.2 percent was Native American or Alaskan Native.171 One study reported that 23 percent of the population was non-White, Asian, or Pacific Islander;155 and two studies reported a non-White proportion of 14 and 35 percent.166,171 Two studies evaluated the performance of previously developed risk assessment instruments in MSM cohorts in which 46 percent142 or all participants145 were Black. In one other study,165 all participants were Black in one of four cohorts used to develop and validate a new risk assessment instrument; in the othe r three cohorts the proportion of Black participants ranged from 3.4 to 18.3 percent.165 One study evaluated patients attending a clinic for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons ,131 two studies evaluated patients attending STI clinic s,155,171 one study evaluated patients in the emergency department,164The incidence of HIV infection in the validation cohorts ranged from 1.1 to 11 percent . For five instruments, discriminatio n was similar, with AUROCs in the original validation cohorts (N=25,488) ranging from 0.6 0 to 0.7 3.140,155,165,166,171 A sixth study (n=9,841)131 found that a 10 - item instrument developed using data from the Los Angeles Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Center was associated with better goodness of fit based on the Akaike Information Crit erion score than instruments developed in two other studies155,166 or criteria from the 2014 CDC guidelines for offering PrEP in MSM .82 However, the instrument was not validated using a separate (nondevelopment) sample. In addition, some of the items used in the other risk prediction instruments w ere not identical to variables available in the Los Angeles LGBT Center database, necessitating use of alternative variables for goodness of fit testing. Other studies reported similar discrimination of different risk assessment instruments in MSM .140,155,165,171 The six -item ARCH -MSM instrument is included in the CDC PrEP guideline176 as a potential tool to i dentify PrEP -eligible candidates.166 ARCH -MSM was developed using a cohort of patients enrolled in an (ineffective) HIV vaccine trial and validated in a cohort of patients enrolled in an (ineffective) behavioral intervention trial.166 Based on a suggested post -hoc cutoff of 10 or greater (range, 0 to 48), 62.4 percent of men in the validation cohort (n=3,368) met the threshold, with a sensitivity for future HIV infection of 81.2 percent and specificity of 37.7 percent, and an AUROC of 0.72. The data in the cohorts used to validate and develop the ARCH -MSM instrument were older ( collected in 1998-1999 and 1999 -2001, respectively) and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 26 Pacific Northwest EPC had a high prevalence of inhaled nitrite and amphetamine use, both of which are included as items in the instrument. A four -item instrument by Menza et al (score range, 0 to 19) was validated using data from the same validation cohort (n=2,081) as ARCH -MSM.155 A cutoff score of 3 or greater with this instrument provided comparable sensitivity (76%) and specificity (43%) to ARCH -MSM for incident HIV infe ction at a cutoff of 10 or greater, with 64 percent of the sample meeting this threshold. Discrimination was slightly lower with this instrument (0.66 [95% CI, 0.61 to not reported]). Methamphetamine and inhaled nitrite use were included as a single item in the Menza instrument. The four -item SDET (score range, 0 to 10 points) was developed using a more contemporary (2008 -2014) cohort.140 As noted earlier, HIV incidence was estimated based on markers for acute or early HIV infection on a single test. In the validation cohort (n=2,758) A cutoff score of 1 or greater resulted in a sensitivity (73%) and specificity (48%) for incident HIV infection most comparable to ARCH -MSM at a cutoff of 10 or greater. The proportion of the sample meeting this threshold was not reported. Discrimination of the SDET score was very similar to ARCH - MSM (0.70 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.78] vs. 0.72 [CI not reported]). The SDET does not include items on drug use. A 10 -item instrument by Beymer et al was also developed using a more contemporary cohort (Los Angeles LGBT Center 2009 -2014 ; n=9,481 ).131 The instrument includes items on race/ethnicity, partner age and race/ethnicity, and intimate partner violence, as well as illicit drug use. As noted above, a methodological limitation is that this instrument has only been evaluated in the cohort used to develop the instrument. In addition, methods for scoring the instrument (e.g., points assigned for indi vidual items) were unclear. Using a cutoff score of 5 or greater, 51 percent of the cohort met this threshold, with a sensitivity of 74.6 percent and specificity of 50.2 percent for incident HIV infection . The AUROC was not reported. Goodness of fit testin g based on the Akaike Information Criterion and Schwarz Bayesian Criteria was slightly better with this instrument than with the ARCH -MSM and similar to the Menza instrument, but this finding is difficult to interpret because goodness of fit was evaluated using data from the same cohort used to develop this instrument, and the other instruments included items that were not an exact match with data available in this database. The 2014 CDC guideline includes recommended indications for PrEP in MSM (any anal sex without condoms in past 6 months, any STI diagnosed or reported in past 6 months, or ongoing sexual relationship with a partner with HIV ).82 In the study by Beymer et al, goodness of fit was slightly better with the Los Angeles LGBT Center instrument than the CDC criteria.131 The twelve -item SexPro instrument (score range, 1 to 20 points) was developed using persons enrolled in an (ineffective) behavioral intervention trial (1999 -2001) and validated in three cohorts of participants enrolled in other clinical trials (2009 -2013).165 In addition to items on sexual risk behaviors, STIs, and illicit drug use, SexPro includes items on age, race/ethnicity, and alcohol use. In the validation cohorts (n=8,047) , a cutoff score of 16 or greater on SexPro was associ ated with sensitivities of 64.4, 100 , and 75.4 percent for incident HIV infection. Specificities were 67.4, 0, and 51.8 percent , respectively. The cohort with sensitivity of 100 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 27 Pacific Northwest EPC percent and specificity of 0 percent only included Black participants (the proportion of Black participants in the other cohorts was 3.4% and 18.3%), who had lower SexPro scores compared with other participants . Despite the differen ces in diagnostic accuracy at the selected cutoff, discrimination was similar across the three validation cohorts (AUROC 0.71 to 0.73). In these cohorts, sensitivity of ARCH -MSM at a cutoff score of 10 ranged from 80.0 to 86.2 percent and specificity rang ed from 43.2 to 61.2 percent ; discrimination of ARCH -MSM (AUROC 0.74 to 0.75) was similar to the SexPro score. The four -item Seattle PrEP Score (score range, 0 to 4 points) was developed using two large STI clinic cohorts (2001 -2015).171 In the validation cohort (n=9,234), a cutoff score of 2 or greater was associated with a sensitivity of 46.3 percent and specificity of 69.0 percent . In the combined development and validation cohorts (n=22,761), t he Seattle PrEP score performed similarly to the SDET at a cutoff score of 5 or greater (sensitivity for incident HIV infection 33.1% and specificity 67.1%) in this population; three other instruments (Menza [ cutoff 2], ARCH -MSM [cutoff 10], and CDC [meeting criteria for PrEP]) reported higher sensitivity (range 62.7% to 86.7%) but lower specificity (range 13.3% to 37.4%). For all five instruments, discrimination was similar ( based on combined development and validation cohorts, 0.66 for Seattle PrEP score and 0.61 to 0.66 for the others [AUROC for instruments other than Seattle PrEP score not reported separately for the validation cohort] ). Evidence on how the accuracy of risk prediction instruments in MSM varied according to race or ethnicity was inconsistent. Two studies found that risk prediction instruments performed more poorly in Black MSM . In one study of MSM , the AUROC for the ARCH -MSM, SDET, ranged from 0.51 to 0.62 , from 0.49 to 0.63 in Black MSM , and from 0.60 to 0.67 in White MSM .142 In the other study, the AUROC for the ARCH -MSM was 0.57 in Black MSM , and similar using criteria derived from the CDC recommendations (AUROC, 0.51) or the PrEP package insert (AUROC, 0.54).145 However, two other studies reported similar discrimination of risk prediction instruments in Black and White MSM . In one study, the AUROC of the Seattle PrEP Score was 0.64 in White MSM and 0.62 in Black MSM .171 In the other study, the AUROC of the SexPro instrument was 0.74 in two validation cohorts of primarily (>95 %) White MSM and 0.75 in a validation cohort of 100% Black MSM .165 One study reported that discrimination of the SexPro instrument was higher in Asian (0.91) than White (0.64) MSM , but the est imate for Asian MSM was based on only six incident HIV cases and imprecise.165 PWID The seven -item Assessing the Risk of Contracting HIV in Injection Drug Users (ARCH -IDUs) instrument (score range, 0 to 100 points) was developed using a cohort (1988 -2008) of current and former PWID in Baltimore .167 ARCH -IDUs is included as a tool for identifying persons who inject drugs at high risk for HIV acquisition in the 2021 CDC guideline.176 The instrument includes seven item s on age, enrollment in a methadone maintenance program, and drug use behaviors. The population in the cohort used to develop ARCH -IDUs was primarily non - Hispanic Black (93%) persons ; incident HIV infection occurred in 11 percent of the development cohort. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 28 Pacific Northwest EPC In the sample used to develop ARCH -IDUs (n=1,904) , sensitivity was 86 percent and specificity was 42 percent at a cutoff of 46 or greater, with 58 percent of the cohort meeting this threshold. The AUROC was 0.72 (CI not reported). ARCH -IDUs has not been evaluated i n a separate validation cohort. Women One new study by Ridgeway et al evaluated a previously developed 6 -item risk pred iction instrument (range, 0 to 76) based on data extracted from the electronic medical record.164 Even though the instrument included items on male sex and MSM (in addition to STI history or symptoms and age), it was evaluated in a cohort (2011 -2018) of women evaluated in the emergency department. Among 21 women newly diagnosed with HIV infection in the emergency department, sensitivity of the instrument was 95 percent (20/21) . Because the study only evaluated incident HIV cases, s pecificity was not available . In this study, all incident HIV infections except for one occurred in Black wom en. General Populations of HIV -Negative Persons Two new studies (N=5,477,291, based on derivation and validation cohorts) evaluated instruments for predicting risk of HIV Infection in general populations of HIV -negative persons.143,151 Both instruments were developed using large health systems cohorts (2007 to 2015 and 2007 to 2014) and utilized a computerized algorithm developed with machine learning on items extracted from the electronic medical record. The proportion of Bla ck participants in the cohorts used to develop these instruments ranged from 5.2 to 8.1 percent, the proportion of Hispanic /Latinx participants ranged from 2.9 to 5.6 percent, and the proportion of Asian participants ranged from 5.8 to 23 percent . In the cohorts used to validate the instruments, incident HIV infection occurred in 0.01 and 1.3 percent of participants. One study evaluated a 23 -item instrument (score range, 0 to 100,000) that included items on STI history or use of penicillin G, prio r HIV testing, use of medications for opioid use disorder, race, gender, and primary language.143 In the external validation cohort (n=33,404) , at a cutoff of 2 or greater (indicating the top 2% of HIV risk scores) , sensitivity for incident HIV infect ion was 98.1 percent and specificity was 26.8 percent . At a cutoff of 8 o r greater, sensitivity was 91.3 percent and specificity was 44.2 percent . The AUROC was 0.77 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.79). In the other study, which evaluated a 44 -item instrument, sensitivi ty for incident HIV infection based on classification as high or very high risk (0.20%) was 59.1 percent and specificity was 97.8 percent in the validation cohort (n=606,701) , of 0.84 (95% CI 0.80 to 0.89).151 In this study, sensitivity for incident HIV infection was similar in Black and White patients. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 29 Pacific Northwest EPC Key Question 4. What Are the Harms of PrEP vs. Placebo or No PrEP When Used for the Prevention of HIV Infection? Summary Oral PrEP vs. Placebo or No PrEP There was no difference between oral PrEP with TDF -FTC or TDF versus placebo or no PrEP in risk of serious adverse events (12 trials, N=18,292; RR, 0.93 [95% -FTC or TDF was associated with a trend toward increased risk of withdrawals due to adverse events versus no PrEP or place bo that was not statistically significant (4 trials, N=10,563; RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 0.99 to 1.59]; I2=0%).51,55,66,137,172 Oral PrEP with TDF -FTC or TDF was associated with increased risk of renal a dverse events (primarily grade 1 creatinine elevation) (12 trials, N=18,170; RR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.18 to 1.75]; I2=0%; difference PrEP with TDF -FTC or TDF was associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse events (12 trials, N=18,300; RR, 1.63 [95% no PrEP ;51-55,66 -68,118,137,170,172 gastrointestinal events were generally not serious and diminished over time. Oral PrEP with TDF -FTC or TDF was associated with a small, non -statistically significant increased risk of fracture versu s placebo (7 trials, N=15,241; RR, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.97 to 1.56]; I2=0%).51-54,66,137,170 There were no differences between oral PrEP with TDF -FTC or TDF versus placebo in risk of syphilis (4 trials, N=10,775; RR, 1.08 [95% CI, or combined bacterial STIs trials; RR, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.97 to 1.34], I2=16%).51,118,137,170,172 There no between oral PrEP with TDF -FTC or TDF versus placebo in risk HSV N=4,088; RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.67 to 1.07]; I2=19%) or C virus infection (2 trials, N=896; RR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.25 to 2.10]; I2=0%).66,118,120,150,170 Among persons who became pregnant in PrEP trials, PrEP was not associated with increased risk of spontaneous abortion (3 trials, N=415; RR, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.79 to 1.50]; I2=0%).68,157,172 One trial found no differences between PrEP versus placebo in pregnancy rate, risk of preterm birth, birth anomalies, or postpartum infant mortality.157 Dapivirine Vaginal Ring vs. Placebo Ring Results for the dapivirine vaginal ring versus placebo and risk of serious adverse events were very imprecise and inconsistent (2 trials, N=4,587, RR , 1.73 [95% CI 0.60 to 4.94 ]; I2=80%).73,74 There w ere no differences between the dapivirine vaginal ring versus placebo ring in risk of STIs or incidence of pregnancy (2 trials, N= 4,587).73,74 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 30 Pacific Northwest EPC Evidence Oral PrEP vs. Placebo or No PrEP Serious Adverse Events There was no difference between oral PrEP with TDF or TDF -FTC versus placebo in risk of serious a dverse events (12 trials , N=18,292 od were similar (RR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.78 to 1.23]) and there was no funnel plot asymmetry (Egger test p -value=0.53) (Appendix C Figure 3 ). Nine trials evaluated daily PrEP and two trials combined data for daily and intermittent/event -driven PrEP;67,68 one trial of event -driven PrEP (IPERGAY) reported a risk of serious adverse events (RR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.58 to 1.98]) that was similar to the pooled estimate from trials of daily PrEP (11 trials; RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.76 to 1.12]; There were also no differences between oral PrEP vers us placebo in risk of serious adverse events when trials were stratified according to whether they used TDF (5 trials; RR, 0.79 [95% One trial (PROUD) found TDF -FTC associated with a greater risk of serious adverse events than placebo (7.6% [21/375] vs. 2.2% [6/269]; RR, 3.42 [95% CI, 1.40 to 8.35]).118 It differed from other trials in that i t used an open -label design. Serious adverse events reported by more than one patient on TDF -FTC in PROUD included gastrointestinal events, fractures, and psychiatric events. Withdrawals Due to Adverse Events Withdrawals due to adverse events were repor ted in five trials ( Table 8).51,55,66,137,172 One trial (n=936)55 reported no withdrawals with either PrEP or placebo. In the other trials, oral PrEP was associated with a small, non -statistically significan t trend toward increased risk of withdrawal due to adverse events versus placebo (4 trials , N=10,563 ; RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 0.99 to 1.59]; One trial evaluated TDF (RR, 1.00 2.92]) 1.27 CI, 1.00 to 1 .62]; p=0.67 for interaction) ( Figure 13). The only trial to report a statistically significant increase in risk of withdrawals (either temporary or permanent) due to adverse events was the FEM -PrEP trial, which evaluated TDF -FTC (RR, 1.68 [95% 1.10 to 2.56]).172 The majority (~90%) of withd rawals in this trial were the result of laboratory abnormalities (grade 2 or higher). In FEM -PrEP, there was no difference in risk of withdrawal due to clinical adverse events, although the estimate was imprecise (R R, 3.53 [95% CI, 0.73 to 17]). Fracture Tenofovir exposure is associated with bone loss,148,159,170,177 which could result in increased fracture risk. Oral PrEP with TDF or TDF -FTC was associated with a small, non -statistically significant increased risk of fracture versus placebo (7 trials , N=15,241 ; RR, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.97 was (64%) by the Bangkok Tenofovir Study of PWID , which reported a relatively high fracture ra te (7.8% vs. 6.0%; RR, 1.29 [95% CI, 0.96 to 1.74]).53 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 31 Pacific Northwest EPC There was no statistically significant interaction betw een the PrEP regimen and fracture risk (p=0.50) ( Figure 14). One trial of event -driven dosing (IPERGAY) did not find PrEP associated with an increased risk of fracture, but the estimate was imprecise (RR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.13 to 1.99]).66 Patients averaged 15 doses per month in IPERGAY; effects of intermittent/event -driven dosing with less frequent exposure to PrEP on fracture risk are not available. In trials for which details we re available regarding the mechanism of fracture, all or almost all fractures were traumatic.126 Results were similar when the profile likelihood method was used for pooling (R R, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.92 to 1.58]). There were discrepancies between the number of fractures reported in journal reports of three trials (the CDC Safety Study,52 iPrEx,137 and Partners PrEP51) and the FDA review126 of these trials ( Appendix B Tables 1 -3). However, the pooled estimate was similar when the FDA data were used in the meta -analysis in place of data reported in the journal articles (RR, 1.20 [95% CI, 0.96 to 1.52]) ( Figure 15). Renal Adverse Events Oral PrEP with TDF or TDF -FTC was associated with increased risk of renal adverse events (primarily grade 1 serum creatinine elevation) versus placebo (12 trials , N=18,170 ; RR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.18 -68,118,137,170,172 Results were similar with the profil e likelihood method (RR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.12 to 1.79]) and no funnel plot asymmetry was present (Egger test p -value=0.29) ( Appendix C Figure 4 ). A trial of event -driven PrEP (IPERGAY) reported an increased risk of renal adverse events (RR, 1.77 [95% CI, 1.0 6 to 2.95]) consistent with the pooled estimate from trials of daily PrEP (11 trials; RR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.11 to 1.72]; I2=0%).66 There was no clear difference in risk of renal adverse events when trials were stratified according to use of TDF or TDF -FTC (p=0.31 for interaction). Serious renal events were rare and no trial reported a difference between PrEP and place bo in risk of serious renal events or withdrawals due to renal events ( Appendix B Tables 1 -3). Six trials51,67,68,149,152,168 evaluated whether renal adverse events while on PrEP were persistent (Appendix B Tables 1 -3). Three studies51,149,168 reported a return to normal serum creatinine levels after cessation of PrEP and two others67,68 reported normalization of creatinine level without PrEP cessation.158 In one other trial of PWID ( the Bangkok Tenofovir Study ), six of seven cases of grade 2 or worse creatinine elevation resolved following PrEP cessation.152 Gast rointest TDF or TDF -FTC was associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal adverse events (primarily nausea) versus placebo (12 trials , N=18,300 ; RR, 1.63 [95% 8; Figure 17).51-55,66 -68,118,137,170,172 Results were similar using the pro file likelihood method (RR, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.26 to 2.25]) and there was no funnel plot asymmetry (Egger test p -value=0.81) ( Appendix C Figure 5 ). The risk of gastrointestinal adverse events was highest in one trial of event -driven PrEP, but the estimate was imprecise (8.0% vs. 1.0%; RR, 8.08 [95% CI, 1.88 to The HPTN 067/ADAPT trial, which compared different PrEP dosing strategies (daily, time -based, or event -driven), found Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 32 Pacific Northwest EPC no difference in risk of gastrointestinal events between daily and non-daily PrEP ( Appendix B Tables 1 -3).130 When stratified according to the PrEP regimen used, the risk of gastrointestinal adverse events was increased for both TDF (5 trials; RR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.13 signif icant interaction by regimen (p=0.30) ( Figure 17). Among studies that reported rates of diarrhea51,52,54,66,118,170,172 or vomiting54,172 separately, none reported a significant difference between PrEP and placebo ( Appendix B Tables 1 -3). Three trials reported that the risk of gastrointestinal events diminished over time.53,137,170 Serious gastrointestinal events were rare in the trials that reported this outcome, with no differences between PrEP and placebo (Appendix B Tables 1 -3).54,55,118,137,170,172 STIs There were no differences between PrEP versus placebo or no PrEP in risk of syphilis (4 trials , N=10,775 1.08 Figure Figure [95% CI, 0.80 to 1.18]; I2=59%) ( Figure 20), or combined bacterial STIs (2 tri als, N=5,291 ; RR, 1.14 [95% CI, 0.97 to 1.34]; I2=16%) ( Figure 21; in trial51 and gonorrhea, chlamydia, or syphilis in the other.118 When trials were stratified according to the PrEP regimen, TDF was associated with lower risk of chlamydia or gonorrhea versus placeb o than TDF -FTC, but neither regimen was associated with increased risk, and only one trial evaluated TDF. All of the trials except for on e were blinded. This could affect risk of STIs if participants who do not know whether they are taking PrEP or placebo behave differently than those who know whether or not they are taking PrEP. The open -label PROUD trial,118 which enrolled MSM , found no statistically significant association s between PrEP versus no PrEP and risk of (RR, 1.32 [95% CI, 0.98 to 1.79]), although estimates were imprecise and indicated increased risk. Although the unadjusted estimate for risk of combined STIs in PROUD was statistically significant (RR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.42]), the difference was no longer statistically significant after adjustment for the number of screenings (adjusted OR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.78 to 1.46]). This is consistent with a higher rat e in PROUD of condomless receptive anal intercourse with 10 or more partners among men randomized to PrEP (20%) versus deferred a PrEP demonstration project in MSM ), 26 percent of participants had an STI at baseline and approximately 50 percent had an STI while on PrEP.178 PrEP was not associated with increased risk of bacterial STIs when trials (open -label or blinded) were stratified according to whether they evaluated MSM or persons at risk of HIV infection via heterosexual contact ( Table 9; Figures 22-25). The only trial conducted in PWID did not report risk of STI.53 Results for bacterial STIs were similar when data were pooled using the pro file likelihood method. Based on three trials from the prior USPSTF report that could be pooled, t here was no difference between PrEP versus placebo in risk of HSV infection (3 trials , N=4,088 Figure 26).120,150,170 Two trials evaluated the risk of HSV infection based on serology in participants who were seronegative for HSV at baseline;120,150 the other trial did Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 33 Pacific Northwest EPC not report the method for diagnosing HSV infection.170 When stratified according to HIV risk category, PrEP was associated with decreased risk of HSV infection versus placebo in two trials of persons at risk via heterosexual contact (RR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.56 to 0.96]; I2=0%)51 but not in one trial of MSM (RR, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.80 to 1.56])150 (Table 9). However, this analysis was based on few trials, and the test for a subgroup difference was not statistically significant (p=0.06). In the trial included in the prior USPSTF report of MSM , PrEP was not associated with decreased risk of a serological di agnosis of HSV infection, but was associated with lower risk of incident HSV infection with an ulcer (5.9% vs. 2.9%; p<0.05).150 One new publication of data from IPERGAY reported risk of HSV seroconversion among MSM who were seronegative at baseline, but did not provide data to calculate RR and could not be pooled with the prior trials.132 It found no association between on -demand PrEP versus placebo and risk of HSV -1 (n=108, HR 2.08, 95% CI 0.63 to 7.92) or HSV -2 (n=218, HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.43 to 3.33) seroconversion. Hepatitis C Virus Infection There was no dif ference between PrEP versus placebo or no PrEP in risk of hepatitis C virus infection, but only two trials (N=896) reported this outcome, and the estimate was imprecise (RR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.25 to 2.10]; I2=0%)66,118 (Figure 27). Both trials (PROUD and IPERGAY) evaluated PrEP with TDF -FTC in MSM . There were 6 cases of hepa titis C virus infection in one trial118 and 8 cases in the other.66 Hepatit is B Virus Infection One trial (VOICE) reported one case of incident hepatitis B virus infection among 1,009 patients randomized to placebo and no cases among 1,007 patients randomized to TDF.54 Incident hepatitis B virus infecti on was otherwise not reported. All trials except for two excluded patients with active hepatitis B virus infection. In one trial (Study of TDF), of 56 patients w ith active hepatitis B infection at baseline (based on hepatitis B surface antigen p ositive sta tus), the risk of grade 1 asparate or alanine transaminase elevations (42 U/L) following discontinuation of study drug was 4.3% (1/23) for those randomized to TDF and 9.1% (3/33) randomized to placebo.55 In the other trial (iPrEx) , no cases of hepatitis flare occurred following discontinuation of TDF -FTC in five patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection .169 Pregnancy -Related Outcomes No trial of PrEP enrolled pregnant persons , and persons who became pregnant during the course of the trial were withdrawn from participation. Three trials reported on pregnancy outcomes in persons who were withdrawn from PrEP because of pregnancy.68,157,172 In one trial, only one pregnancy occurred among persons randomiz ed to PrEP;68 in the other two trials, 74 and 192 pregnancies occurred.51,172 All of the trials were conducted in Africa and evaluated women at increased risk of HIV infection via heterosexual activity. Among persons who became pregnant in the trials, PrEP was not associated with increased risk of sponta neous abortion ( Appendix B Tables 1 -3; Figure 28). When stratified according to the PrEP regimen used, TDF was not associated with increased risk, but it was only evaluated in one trial (RR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.50 to 1.37]).157 TDF -FTC was associated with a trend toward increased risk of spontaneous abortion that was not statistically sign ificant (RR, 1.32 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 34 Pacific Northwest EPC [95% CI, 0.86 to 2.01]; I2=0%).68,157,172 There was no statistically significant interaction between the PrEP regimen and risk of spontaneous abortion (p=0.17). The Partners PrEP trial found no differences between PrEP versus placebo in pregnancy rate, risk of preterm birth, birth anomalies, or postpartum infant mortality, and the FEM -PrEP trial found no difference in risk of any adverse pregnancy outcome ( Appendix B Tables 1 -3).157 Dapiv irine Vaginal Ring vs. Placebo Ring Two trials of the dapivirine vaginal ring versus placebo ring reported adverse events. Results for serious adverse events were very imprecise (2 trials, N=4,587; RR 1.73, 95% CI 0. 60 to 4.94, I2=80% ; Figure 29).73,74 In addition , marked statistical heterogeneity was present , with one trial finding no increase in risk of serious adverse events (4.0% vs. 3.6%, RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.60) and the other finding an increased risk (2.9% vs. 0.9%, RR 3.16, 95% CI 1.34 to 7.44). In the trial reporting increased risk, the most common serious adverse events were various infections (1.1%) and injuries (0.6%) that did not appear related to use of PrEP . One trial (n=1,959 ) found no differences between the dapivirine ring versus placebo in risk of any STI (RR 1.06 , 95% CI 0.96 to 1.16) .74 Pooled analyses of the two RCTs found no differences between the dapivirine vaginal ring versus placebo and risk of chlamydia (N=4,587; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.8 ), gonorrhea (N=4,587; RR 1.01, 95% CI or trichomoniasis infection (N=4 ,587; RR 1. 06, 95% CI 0. 92 to 1.2 3, I2=0%) ( Figures 30 -32).73,74 One trial reported no difference in risk of syphilis (1.3% vs. 0.8% ).74 In both trials, p regnancy incidence was similar for the dapivirine ring and placebo (3.9 vs. 4.0 per 100 person -years and 1.6 vs. 2.0 per 100 person -years). Neither trial reported congenital abnormalities. Event -Driven vs. Daily Oral PrEP One small, new, crossover trial (n=119) found event -driven oral PrEP associated with decreased risk of any adverse event versus daily oral PrEP (8% [10/119] vs. 0.14 to 0.52).144. All adverse events were grade 1 except for in one patient, who reported grade 2 symptoms. The most common adverse events were diarrhea, headache, lethargy, dizziness, dyspepsia, and nausea. There was no difference between regi mens in change in creatinine clearance (data not provided). Due to the crossover design of the trial, it was not able to compare effects of event -driven versus daily oral PrEP on risk of STIs. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 35 Pacific Northwest EPC Key Question 5. What Are the Harms of Newer PrEP Regimens ( Oral TAF Summary Daily Oral TAF -FTC vs. TDF -FTC Based on one trial (n=5,387)162: No differences between TAF -FTC versus TDF -FTC in risk of serious adverse events ( 7% vs. 7%), discontinuation due to adverse events (1% vs. 2%) , or any adverse event (9 4% vs. 9 4%). No differences between TAF -FTC versus TDF -FTC in rates of any rena l adverse event (1% vs. 1%) or renal adverse event s leading to discontinuation (0.07% vs. 0.3%). No difference between TAF -FTC versus TDF -FTC in the risk of fracture (2% vs. 2%) ; however, among persons 25 years of age or older, TAF -FTC was associated with greater percent change from baseline than TDF -FTC in hip bone mineral density (+0.6% vs. - 1.0%, p<0.001) and spine bone mineral density (+0.9% vs. -1.4%, p<0.001). TAF -FTC was associated with smaller reduction from baseline versus TDF -FTC in low density li poprotein cholesterol (median -0.05 vs. -0.18 mmol/L, p<0.0001) and greater Long -Acting Injectable Cabotegravir Oral TDF -FTC Based on trials (N=7,786)70,88: No differences between long -acting injectable cabotegravir versus daily oral TDF -FTC in risk of serious adverse events (5.3% vs. 5.3% and 2.0% vs. 2.0%) or grade 3 or higher adverse events (31.9% vs. 33.6% and 17.1% vs. 17.4). No differences between cabotegravir versus TDF -FTC in risk of grade 2 or 3 renal (decreased creatinine cle arance) or liver (increased alanine or aspartate transaminase) events, risk of discontinuation due to liver -related adverse events, or risk of STIs. Cabotegravir was associated with increased weight gain versus TDF -FTC (mean differences 0.86 and 0.4 kg). Cabotegravir was associated with increased risk of injection site reactions (most commonly, pain) versus TDF -FTC (81.4% vs. 31.3% and 38.0% vs. 10.8%) that were usually mild and diminishing following the initial injection. In one trial that enrolled women, pregnancy incidence was low with cabotegravir and TDF -FTC (1.5 [95% CI, 1.0 to 2.2] vs. 1.0 [95% CI, 0.6 to 1.6] per person -years), with no congenital abnormalities observed .88 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 36 Pacific Northwest EPC Evidence Daily Oral TAF -FTC vs. TDF -FTC The DISCOVER trial (n=5,387)121 found no difference between TAF -FTC versus TDF -FTC in risk of serious adverse events ( 7% vs. 7%) or discontinuation of study drug due to adverse events, which was uncommon (1% vs. 2%).162 The types of s erious adverse events varied and most did not appear related to PrEP (e.g., appendicitis, suicidal ideation or attempt, hepatitis A, pneumonia, depression, cellulitis , acute kidney injury, or atrial fibrillation ). Rates of any adverse event (9 4% vs. 9 4%) were very similar; the most common non-STI adverse event was diarrhea (18% vs. 1 7%). There were also no differences in rates of sexually transmitted infection s (rectal or urethral chlamydia , rectal or B Table s 1-3). There were also no differences between TAF -FTC versus TDF -FTC in rates of any renal adverse event (1% vs. 1%) or renal adverse event s leading to discontinuation (0.07% vs. 0. 3%). Regarding bone adverse events, there was no difference in the risk of fractu re (2% vs. 2%) or nontraumatic fracture ( 1 vs. 2 cases; <1% in each arm). However, among persons 25 years of age or older, TAF -FTC was associated with greater percent change from baseline than TDF -FTC in hip bone mineral density (+0. 6% vs. -1.0%, p<0.001) and spine 9% vs. -1.4%, p<0.001). TAF -FTC was associated with smaller reduction from baseline versus TDF -FTC in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (median -0.05 vs. -0.18 mmol/L, p<0.0001) and greater weight gain from versus +1.7 vs. +0.5 (N=7,786), differences between -acting injectabl e cabotegravir versus daily oral TDF -FTC in of serious events [121/2282] and 2.0% [33/1614] vs. B Tables 1 -3).70,88 There were also no differences in risk of grade 2 or 3 renal (decreased creatinine clearance) or liver (increased alanine or aspartate transaminase) events, risk of discontinuation due to liver -related adverse events, or risk of incident rectal or ureth ral gonorrhea, rectal or urethral chlamydia, or syphilis in fections. In both trials, cabotegravir was associated with increased weight gain versus TDF -FTC, which occurred early during treatment (mean differences 0.86 and 0.4 kg). Injection site reactions ( most commonly, pain) were more frequent with cabotegravir than TDF -FTC (81.4% vs. 31.3% and 38.0% vs. 10.8%). Injection site reactions were usually mild and occurred most commonly with the first injection, with diminishing frequency over time. In one trial that enrolled women (HPTN 084), pregnancy incidence was similar and low with cabotegravir and TDF -FTC (1.5 [95% CI 1.0 to 2.2] vs. 1.0 [95% CI 0.6 to 1.6] per 100 person -years), with no congenital abnormalities observed.88 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 37 Pacific Northwest EPC Contextual Question 1. What Are Rates of Adherence to and Persistence of PrEP and Factors Associated With Increased or Decreased Adherence in U.S. Primary Care Settings ? Adherence, or medication compliance, refers to the degree to which patients take medications as directed (e.g., every day for oral daily PrEP). The prior USPSTF report2 found a strong association between increased adherence and greater PrEP effectiveness. In six placebo - controlled trials in which a dherence was 70 percent or greater, the pooled RR of PrEP for preventing HIV infection was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.39; I2=0%).51,52,66,67,118,170 Additional subgroup and modeling analyses also support the association between increased adherence and greater PrEP effectiveness. One analysis based on trial data estimated a 96 percent reduction in HIV infect ion risk among MSM taking at least four oral PrEP doses a week,179 suggesting important benefits eve n when adherence is incomplete. Methods for measuring adherence include dru g levels (plasma , dried blood spot levels , or urine ), self-report, pill count, and others. Some studies have shown lower levels of adherence based on drug levels than by self -report or pill counts,54,128,141,180,181 although other evidence indicates more concordance.118 Some discrepancie s between drug levels and self -reported adherence or pill counts could be related to use of financial incentives or other benefits for trial participation (patients in such a trial might have concerns about trial dismissal and loss of financial compensatio n or access to care as a result of low adherence) or social desirability bias (patients might overreport adherence to avoid disappointing study personnel with whom they have developed relationships).182 Dried blood spot samples measuring intracellular drug concentrations of TFV -DP (the active moiety of tenofovir) reflect longer -term cumulative drug exposure c ompared with tenofovir plasma levels, correlating with the number of doses taken in the last several weeks (plasma levels indicat e dosing within the last week). Persistence refers to continuation of treatment for the prescribed length of time.183 Persistence and adherence are distinct concepts; among patients with PrEP persistence, adherence may be incomplete or fluctuate. Pers istence is a necessary condition for PrEP effectiveness, though patients may re -start PrEP following periods of non -persistence. Definitions and methods for measuring persistence vary and include temporary or permanent discontinuation of PrEP, lapses in prescription coverage that exceed specified thresholds, or non -retention in PrEP care. In the United States, evidence on adherence is primarily available for daily oral PrEP in populations of MSM ( Appendix D Table 1 ). In five observational studies of primar ily MSM, adherence rates ranged from 22 to more than 90 percent , based on TFV -DP dried blood spot levels of 700 fmol/punch or greater (consistent with an average of 4 pills/week over the last 1 to 2 months).178,184 -187 One study (n=557) found that the proportion of patients meeting the adherence threshold ranged from 80 to 86 percent from week 4 to 48 (proportion meeting the adherence threshold on all samples, 62 percent),178 and another study (n=301) found that adherence was 83 percent at week 4 and 66 percent at week 48.187 A smaller study (n=50) found that 90 percent (19/21) of patients met the adherence threshold at a mean PrEP durat ion of 4.4 months.186 Two other studies (n=200 and 72) using dried blood spot samples reported lower adherence rates.184,185 Both focused on younger MSM (mean ages 20 and 16 years) than the Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 38 Pacific Northwest EPC studies described above (mean age >30 years). The proportion of patients meeting the 4 or more doses/week threshold was approximately 50 per cent at week 12, decreasing to 34 and 22 percent at week 48. The proportion of patients with dried blood spot levels levels of 350 fmol/punch or greater (consistent with 2 doses/week) was 72 and 59 percent at week 12, decreasing to 49 and 26 percent at we ek 48. Several U.S. studies reported adherence in MSM using methods other than dried blood spot samples. Two studies described above found adherence rates based on self -report were similar to rates based on dried blood spot testing.178,186 Another observational study (n=267)188 found that 92 percent of patients reported taking four or more pills in the last week at 3 and 6 months. An RCT of a group -based be havioral HIV prevention intervention in young MSM (n=20 randomized to PrEP) found tenofovir detected in 63 percent of plasma samples among those randomized to PrEP at week 4, decreased to 20 percent at week 24.141 Another RCT of MSM (n=373) utilized medication event monitoring system data.52 Adherence was 79 percent based on doses taken and 93 percent based on pill count. An RCT (n=179) of MSM (97%) and transgender women (2%) enrolled at a U.S. site compared adherence with daily, int ermittent, and event -driven oral PrEP, based on TFV -DP dried blood spot levels of 326 fmol/punch or greater (consistent with 2 doses/week; 2 doses per week associated with an estimated reduction in risk of HIV acquisition of 76%179).174 During weeks in which sex was reported, adherence was higher for daily (49%) than intermittent (31%) or event - driven (17%) PrEP. Adherence was also higher for daily PrEP than intermittent or event -driven PrEP based on event monitoring system data (65% vs. 46% vs. 41% of tablets used/recommended, respectively). Among U.S. MSM, evidence on factors associated with higher or lower adherence suggests differences in adherence based on race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status or other social determinants, and prese nce of higher -risk behaviors. One study (n=557; mean age 34 to 35 years) of MSM (98%) and transgender women (1.4%) found Black race associated with lower adherence compared with White race (adjusted OR, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.12 to 0.64]).178 Latino, Asian, and \"other\" race/ethnicity were also associated with decreased likelihood of adherence, but estimates were imprecise and differences were not statistically significant. The study also found having stable housing (renting or owning) associated w ith higher adherence versus less stable housing (living with friends or family, public housing, or homeless) (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.02 [95% CI, 1.14 to 3.55]) and having condomless receptive anal sex with two or more partners (vs. 0 or 1 partner) in the past 3 months associated with higher adherence (adjusted OR, 1.82 [95% CI, 1.14 to 2.89]). There were no clear associations between age, educational level, PrEP awareness, income level, health insurance status, depression, and alcohol or drug use and adherence to PrEP. A study of younger (ages 18 to 22 years) MSM (n=200) found that those who reported engaging in recent sex without condoms had higher TFV -DP levels than those who did not report this behavior (p=0.01).185 There was a similar but statistically nonsignificant trend toward higher TFV -DP levels among participants who reported condomless receptive anal sex with their last sexual partner. Patients who did not like taking pills were more likely to be nonadherent (p=0.02). Evidence on differences in adherence among MSM by mode of PrEP administration is addr essed in Contextual Question 2. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 39 Pacific Northwest EPC Evidence on adherence with PrEP in U.S. populations other than MSM is limited. A large observational study (n=1,086, indication for PrEP not reported), which assessed adherence based on prescription refill data, found the median proportion of days covered in the first year was 0.74 (interquartile range, 0.40 to 0.92).189 In this study, older age (ages 50 to 64 vs. <35 years; adjusted OR, 2 .00 [95% CI, 1.37 to 2.92]), being men (vs. women ; adjusted OR, 3.39 [95% CI, 1.37 to 8.42]) and White race (vs. Black race; adjusted OR, 2.02 [95% CI, 1.43 to 2.87]) were associated with increased adherence.189 Other factors, including comorbid substance use disorder or depression, low socioeconomic status, rural living, and region of the United States, were not significantly associated with adherence. A small (n=29) study evaluated PrEP adherence among people (72% m en, 93% heterosexual) with opioid use disorder and r eceiving HCV treatment. It found that the proportion of patients with dried blood spot levels consistent with 4 doses/week was 68% at week 24, declining to 25% at week 36. Estimates based on dried blood spot levels were substantially lower than adherence based on self -report, which was 71% a t 12 weeks and 88% at 48 weeks. Evidence on PrEP persistence in U.S. populations indicates that discontinuations are frequent (Appendix D Table 1 ). However, interpretation is complicated by differences in the methods used to measure persistence and the populations assessed. A large (n=13,906; 95% men) observational study of persons in an integrated health system found that among those who initiated PrEP, 52.5% (95% CI 48.9% to 55.7%) discontinued PrEP at least once, de fined as >120 days with out PrEP based on pharmacy refill data.107 At 2 years, the proportion who had discontinued PrEP was 38.4% (95% CI 37.2% to 39.6%). Among those who discontinued at least once, the proportion who reinitiated PrEP wa s 60.2% (95% CI 52.2 to 68.3%). The highest rates of discontinuation occurred in the first two years after initiating PrEP. In unadjusted analyses, factors associated with increased likelihood of discontinuation were younger age (<45 years, HR 2.17, 95% CI 1.92 to 2.38), Black race (vs. White race, HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.57), Latin o ethnicity (vs. White non -Latin o, HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.46), being a woman (HR 1.99, 95% CI 1.67 to 2.38), greater neighborhood deprivation (vs. highest quintile, HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.57 for lowest quintile), and having a substance use disorder (HR 1.23, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.39). Another large study (n=7,148; 97% m en) of PrEP users in a national pharmacy database found rates of persistence (defined as at least 16 days of P rEP filled per 30 -day period for at least three - quarters of a 12 or 24 month period) were 56 percent in year 1 and 41 percent in year 2.190 Factors associated with increased likelihood of persistence were older age (for 50+ years vs. 18 to 24 years, adjusted OR 2. 77, 95% CI 2.25 to 3.41), being a man (adjusted OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.77 to 3.41), having commercial insurance (vs. government, adjusted OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.69 to 2.27; and having a lower copay ($20 vs. >$20, adjusted OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.45 to 1.85). Another large study (n=11,807; 98% m en) reported persistence (defined as no gap in refills >30 days) of 54.0 percent in a commercially insured cohort and 29.9 percent in a Medicaid -insured cohort.191 As in the prior two studi es, being a man and older age were associated with increased likelihood of persistence; among Medicaid -insured patients, Black race was associated with decreased likelihood of persistence versus White race (4.7% vs. 7.3%, p=0.003). A study of Veterans Affa irs patients (n=1,086; 96% men) found that 44 percent discontinued PrEP in the first year (defined as a >120 day gap).189 Discontinuation was more common among younger persons (<35 vs. 50 -64 years, 51.5% vs. 39.2%, p=0.008), Black compared with White persons (52.4% vs. 41.6%, p=0.05), and women versus men (80.0% vs. 42.8%, p<0.001). The above studies were based on analyses of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 40 Pacific Northwest EPC administrative or pharmacy databases; information regarding indication for PrEP was not available. A smaller study (n=271, 86% m en, 81% MSM) of persons using PrEP in two health centers found that 47.2 percent discontinued PrEP (defined as missing more than 2 quarterly visits with no additional visits by the end of follow -up) and 11.4 percent had intermittent care (missing at least 2 quarterly visits but then reinitiating care).192 Factors associated with decreased risk of disconti nuation included older age (adjusted OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.00) and being an MSM (vs. non -MSM, adjusted OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.64); estimates for race/ethnicity and having a partner with HIV were imprecise. In six U.S. studies (n=50 to 693) of primarily or exclusively MSM, discontinuation rates (variably defined) ranged from 15% to 69% ( Appendix D Table 1 ).178,186,188,193 -195 In the largest (n=663) study, factors associated with decreased time to discontinuation were younger age (vs. 30 to 39 ye ars, adjusted HR for 18 to 24 years 2.0, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.9; adjusted HR for 25 to 29 years 2.2, 95% CI 1.6 to 3.1), being a transgender woman (vs. cisgender m an, adjusted HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.4), and having more mental health disorders (per additional d isorder, adjusted HR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.4). Another study (n=267) found no clear association between age, race/ethnicity, educational level, being a man who has sex with men, income, or insurance status and likelihood of retention in care, though s ome es timates were imprecise.188 Evidence on rates of and factors associated with PrEP persistence in populations other than MSM was very limited. A study (n=51) of transgender men (80%) or women (20%) found that among those who ever received PrEP, 49 percent (25/51) had discontinued.196 A small (n=21) study of heterosexual women initiated on PrEP found that 61 percent (13/21) were retained in care (defined as a clinic visit within 1 month) at 3 months and 37.5 percent (8/21) were retained at 6 months.197 A small study (n=29) of people using PrEP with opioid use disorder receiving HCV treatment found that retention decreased from 86.2 percent (25/29) at wee k 4 to 31.0 percent (9/29) at week 36. Contextual Question 2. How Does Adherence to and Persistence of PrEP Vary According to Mode of Administration (e.g., Oral, Injectable, or Vaginal Ring )? Two head -to-head trials compared injectable cabotegravir versus daily oral TDF -FTC.70,88 The method used to assess adherence differed for the two modalities. For cabotegravir, adherence was based on \"coverage ,\" defined as no delay of longer than two weeks between scheduled injections. For TDF -FTC, adherence was measured using dried blood spot levels consistent with 4 doses/week. In HPTN 083 (n=4,570; U.S. 37%), which enrolled 87 percent MSM and 12 percent transgender wo men, coverage with injectable cabotegravir was 91.5 percent of person - years , compared with adherence with oral TDF -FTC of 72.3 percent based on dried blood spot samples .70 In HPTN 084 (n=3,898), which was conducted in women in Africa, coverage with injectable cabotegravir was 93 .0 percent of person -years, compared with adherence with oral TDF -FTC of 42 percent based on dried blood spot samples.88 In both trials, discontinuation rates with cabotegravir and TDF -FTC were similar vs. 6.8% in HPTN 084). Because participants in these trials were blinded to receipt of cabotegravir or TDF -FTC (via a placebo injection or tablet), generalizability to clinical practice is uncertain. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 41 Pacific Northwest EPC Evidence comparing adherence and persi stence using the dapivirine ring versus oral PrEP is very limited. Published trials of the dapivirine ring used a placebo comparator. Interim results from one crossover trial, which compared the dapivirine ring versus daily oral PrEP in young (16 to 21 years) women in Africa, have been reported as a conference abstract.198 \"High\" adherence (defined as dapivirine levels indicating release of 3.0 mg/28 d) was observed in 50.2 percent (687/1368 timepoints) of ring users (based on residual drug levels) and 22.4 percent (294/1310 timepoint) of oral PrEP users (based on dried blood spot levels). Contextual Question 3. What Is the Risk of Infection With Antiretroviral Drug -Resistant HIV in Persons Using PrEP, and What Is the Effect of Infection With PrEP -Related, Antiretroviral Drug -Resistant HIV on Treatment Outcomes ? Ten placebo -controlled RCTs, all included in the prior USPSTF review, reported rates of antiretroviral drug resistance in persons randomized to oral PrEP with TDF or Appendix D ble 2 ).51-55,66,118,137,170,172 One trial evaluated event -driven PrEP66 and the oth er nine trials evaluated daily PrEP. Five trials evaluated PrEP with TDF alone51-55 and seven trials evaluated TDF -FTC;51,66,137,172 two trials51,54 evaluated both regimens. The most commonly reported mutations were the tenofovir resistance mutations K65R and K70E nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors). Resistance rates were low with oral PrEP. Among all patients randomized to PrEP, 0.06 percent (2/3,149) of patients on TDF (4 trials)51-54 and 0.3 percent (14/5,085) of patients on TDF -FTC (7 trials)51,54,66,118,137,170,172 were identified as having incident HIV infection with a drug resistance mutation. Among patients with incident HIV infection, 1.1 percent (3/282) had a tenofovir resistance mutation.51,53 -55,66,118,137,170,172 Seven of the trials reported no cases of tenofovir resistance mutations (N=198),53,54,66,118,137,172 and two trials reported one or two cases (n=10170 and n=3551). All three cases were attributed to undiagnosed baseline HIV infection and involved M184V and K65R mutations (including one case of multiple resi stance mutations to K65R, M184V, and A62V).51,170 No other case of multidrug resistance was identified in patients randomized to PrEP. In six trials of PrEP with TDF -FTC, 8 percent (14/174) of patients diagnosed with HIV infection after initiating PrEP were diagnosed with emtricitabine resistance mutat ions (M184I or M184V).51,54,66,118,137,170,172 The number of cases of emtricitabine resistance in each trial ranged from 0 to 4. Nine of the 14 cases of emtricitabine resistance occurred in persons who were infected with HIV upon trial enrollment, including 1 c ase of multiple resista nce mutations described above. Data on drug resistance mutations in patients using oral PrEP were also available from the iPrEX -OLE observational study,136 which enrolled patients (n=1,225) from the United States, South Africa, South America, and Thailand, and four U.S. -based observational studies (total N=696) ( Appendix D Table 2 ).178,184 -186 All of these studies evaluated PrE P with daily TDF - Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 42 Pacific Northwest EPC FTC. Among a total of 1,936 patients receiving PrEP across the observational studies, two were diagnosed with an antiretroviral drug resistance mutation (0.1%). In iPrEx -OLE, one of 28 patients (3.6%) diagnosed with HIV infection had the M 184V mutation.136 Among the four U.S. - based studies, one of 10 patients diagnosed with HIV infection while on PrEP was found to have M184V and multi ple thymidine analog mut ations.186 Data to compare risk of antiretroviral resistance associated with different oral PrEP regimens are limited. For event -driven PrEP, one placebo -controlled trial (n=4 00) reported two cases of HIV infection among patients randomized to PrEP, with no resistance mutations identified;66 a head - to-head trial (n=119) of daily versus event -driven PrEP wa s not designed to evaluate HIV incidence or antiretroviral resistance.144 The DISCOVER Trial (n=5,335) compared oral TAF - FTC versus TDF -FTC.121 Among 19 patients who were infected with HIV infection and had resistance testing results, an M184V or M184I resistance mut ation was detected in four patients. All of the infections occurred in patients randomized to TDF -FTC who were suspected of ha ving an infection at baseline. Two placebo -controlled trials (ASPIRE and the Ring Study ) not included in the prior USPSTF report provided data on resistance mutations with the dapivirine vaginal ring.73,74 Dapivirine is a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). Across both trials, the proportion of patients randomized to dapivirine with an NNRTI resistance mutation was 0.8 percent (22/2 ,620). In ASPIRE, the rate of NNRTI resistance mutations among patients with incident HIV infection was similar in patients rando mized to the dapivirine ring versus [10/96], p=0.80).73 Amo ng dapivirine ring patients, there were two cases of the K103N mutation, two cases of the V90I mutation, three cases of the E138A mutation, and one case each of the K101E, K103S, V106M, V108I, E138G, V179D, and H221Y Ring Study , the rate of NNRTI resistance mutations was also similar between the dapivirine ring and placebo arms (18.2% [14/77] vs. 16.1% [9/56], p=0.75). Dapivirine was associated with a nonstatistically significant increased risk of E138A resistance mutations versus placebo (11.7% [9/77] vs. (occurring in 1 to 5 patients across both arms).74 In open label extensions of these trials with incident HIV infection.111,112 Two new trials (HTPN 083 and 084) provided data on resistance mutations among persons randomized to injectable cabotegravir versus daily strand transfer inhibitor both trials, among all patients randomized to cabotegravir, the proportion with an INSTI resistance mutation wa s 0.1 percent (4/3874). In HPTN 083, INSTI resistance mutations were observed in 4 of 9 (44.4 %) incident HIV cases in whom resistance testing was available ( resistance testing unavailable for 4 incident HIV infections); one such mutation was identified in a patient with baseline infection.70 In HPTN 08 4, there were no cases of INSTI resistance mutations in four individual s with incident HIV infecti ons.88 Neither trial reported any cases of HIV infection acquired following cessation of cabotegravir, during the pharmacological tail period. Among individuals randomized to TDF - FTC across both trials , the proportion with antiretroviral resistance mutations was 0.1 percent Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 43 Pacific Northwest EPC (5/3870). 083, or without a nonnucleoside reverse transcripta se inhibitor infection mutation were identified in four of 39 (10.3%) incident cases.70 In HPTN 084, one of 36 (2.8%) patients randomized TDF incident infection had M184V (nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) resistance mutation and \"several\" participants (specific data not pro vided) had a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance mutation (primarily K103N).88 Evidence on effects of acquiring antiretroviral resistant HIV infection while receiving PrEP on clinical outcomes is very limited, but suggests that virological suppression with antiretroviral therapy remains achievable. One study reported that among five patients previously exposed to PrEP and diagnosed with HIV infection with an M184V or M184I mutation, four had an undetect able viral load 3 months after starting antiretroviral therapy, with one patient lost to follow up.199 All patients recei ved TDF and FTC with either darunavir and cobicistat or dolutegravir. Another study found that among patients diagnosed with HIV infection, 52 reported recent PrEP exposure.200 Of these, 30 percent (13/52) had an M184V or M184I infection, 3.8 percent (2/52) had another nucleoside transcriptase resistance mutation (L74V M41L and/or and/or 9.6 percent (5/52) had a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance mutation (3 K103N/S, 1 V108V/I, and 1 G190A/S/E); there were no protease inhibitor resistance mutations. All 39 individuals with a viral load >200 copies/mL at baseline who received antiretroviral therapy achieved an undetectable viral load at 24 weeks. All patients were started on tenofovir -based antiretroviral therapy, with the third agent boosted darunavir, bictegravir, dolutegravir, or raltegravir; 43 percent of patients were switched off boosted darunavir to an integrase inhibitor combination within 3 months from antiretroviral therapy initiation based on clinic protocol. Results we re not reported separately for patients with antiretroviral resistance mutations. No study was designed to evaluate effects of infection with antiretroviral resistant HIV infection while on PrEP on long -term clinical outcomes. When PrEP - selected mutations occur, some data indicates the mutations will become undetectable in the absence of antiretroviral therapy but \"archived\" mutations (those that reemerge following exposure to antiretroviral therapy) are possible.201 Contextual Question 4. What Factors (e.g., Race and Ethnicity, Age, Sex , Gender , Sexual Orientation, HIV Risk Category, Socioeconomic Status, Cultural Factors, Educational Attainment, or Health Literacy) Are Associated With Disparities in Utilization of PrEP? National CDC surveillance data indicate that in 2019 (the last year with reliable data); PrEP coverage (the proportion of persons with PrEP indications who were prescribed PrEP) was higher among men (25.5%) than women (9.3%); higher among White pers ons (60.5%) than Black (7.9%) or Hispanic/Latin x (13.8%) persons ; and lower among persons 16 to 24 years of age (15.0%) compared with adults 25 years of age (19.6% to 26.6%).103 The surveillance data did not report utilization by HIV risk category and did not control for other factors that could impact utilization. Additional d ata on disparities in utilization of PrEP in the United States were Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 44 Pacific Northwest EPC available from a recent (searc hes through 2019) meta -analysis of 95 surveys93 (N=95,854) , six large recent ( three nationwide surveys [n=4,475,202 n=10,504 ,203 n= 4,056204], and three retrospective cohorts [n=13,906,107 n=23,312,205 n=25,886206]. Two smaller studies focused on specific factors associated with PrEP utilization in MSM207,208 and one study focused on the association between insurance status and PrEP utilization.104 Evidence prima rily focused on disparities in utilization among MSM; data on HIV risk categories other than MSM were limited. Although evidence indicates disparities in PrEP utilization related to age, sexual orientation , socioeconomic status, and educational attainment, evidence on disparities related to race and ethnicity were somewhat inconsistent. Data on disparities related to gender were limited, and data on disparities related to health literacy were lacking. A challenge in interpreting data on PrEP utilization is the intersectionality between multiple factors potentially associated with disparities. The meta -analysis included 95 surveys of self -reported PrEP use in U.S. populations at higher risk for HIV infection; 46 surveys collected data from 2015 -2017, subsequent to the publication of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline on PrEP. In 2015 -2017, the overall proportion of respondents reporting PrEP use was 11.3%, whereas from 2004 -2014, the proportion of respondents with PrEP use ranged from 0.3% to 3.2%. Eighty studies reported PrEP use in MSM, 26 studies in Black persons, 19 in Hispanic/ Latinx persons, and 19 studies in youth. Few studies reported PrEP use in PWID (k=6), transgender women (k=9) and unspecified wo men (k=4). From 2015 -2017, MSM were more likely to report PrEP use (pooled prevalence [PP] 13.9%, non -MSM (PP 5.3%, 95% CI 3.7 to 7.5) and other groups at high risk for HIV acquisition, including PWID (PP 3.7%, 95% CI women (PP 11.2%, 95% CI 5.8 to 20.6). Youth, even when including MSM, reported relatively low PrEP use (PP 7.3%, to 11.2). Hispanic/Latin x (PP 11.5%, 95% CI 7.1 to 18.1) and Black persons (PP 9.9%, 95% CI 8.3 to 11.8) reported PrE P use at rates similar to the overall proportion. The meta -analysis was not limited to surveys of individuals at high HIV acquisition risk ; although surveys generally focused on populations frequently at risk for HIV acquisition (e.g., MSM, PWID, or persons attending STI clinics or in other higher -risk settings ), they did not necessarily exclude individual respondents within those populations at lower risk. The meta -analysis had other limitations including reliance on self - report data, potential overlap among surveyed populations, high statistical heterogeneity among included studies (even when restricting analysis to only include recent surveys), and inclusion of some studies (k= 19) assessed as having high risk for bias. Eight additional studies published after the systematic review also reported disparities in PrEP utilization in different U.S. populations. Five studies reported factors associated with PrEP utilization in MSM; each accounted for confounders such as demographic factors, geographic location, HIV risk factors, income, and education. A survey of 4,475 MSM (891 considered PrEP -eligible ), found no di in utilization by race/ethnicity (Black v ersus White adjuste d prevalence ratio [aPR] 1.09, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.37; Hispanic v ersus White aPR 0.91, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.09) but did find di fferences in utilization based on age <25 years versus 25 years ( aPR 0.44, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.55), rural versus MSM ( aPR 0.45, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.62) and insured versus uninsured MSM (aPR 2.98, 95% CI 1.93 to 4.59) .202 Another survey of 10,504 people at high risk of HIV acquisition (predominantly MSM) compared current PrEP users and PrEP -na\u00efve ind ividuals .203 It found no di fferences in PrEP utilization by race/ethnicity (vs. White Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 45 Pacific Northwest EPC persons, adjusted odds ratio [aOR] for Black race 0.92, 95% CI , 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05) and no difference in utilization between MSM and transgender women (aOR= 1.27, 95% CI 0.41 to3.88). However, increasing age (aOR 1.2, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.24) and higher education (aOR 1.91 , 95% CI 1.65 to 2.20) were associated with increased likelihood of PrEP use while bisexual orientation (aOR 0.67 CI 0.37 to 0.59), housing instability (aOR 0.79, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.96) and residence in a state without Medicaid expansion (aOR 0.62, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.76) were associated with decreased likelihood of PrEP. utilization. A survey of 4,056 MSM with likely PrEP indications found that W hite MSM were more likely than Latino o r Black MSM to use PrEP ( White versus Hispanic aPR 1.2 , 95% CI 1.1 to 1.3; White versus Black aPR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.6).204 One study (n=368) found MSM at increased risk for HIV acquisition with an HIV -positive main partner were more likely to use PrEP than those without an HIV -positive main partner (OR =3.12; 95% CI=1.05 -9.31)207 and one study (n=863 ) found certain forms of intimate partner violence associated with decreased PrEP use .208 Two large, recent retrospective studies described PrEP use in general U.S. populations eligible for PrEP. In a retrospective review of 13,906 individuals referred to PrEP or with a PrEP -coded encounter within a single healthcare system, Black and Latin o patients were slightly less likely than Asian patients to initiate PrEP compared to White patients ( vs. White patients, HR for Black patients 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95; 95% CI 0.86 to 0.95; and for Asian patients HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to1.12).107 Some disparities in utilization were also identified for younger (age 45) versus older persons ( HR 1.09 , 95% CI 1.02 to 1.1), women versus men (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.80), people with a substance use disorder versus no substance use disorder (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.95.), people of lower versus higher socioeconomic status (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.99) and people with public versus private insurance (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.86 to1.07). A retrospective review of 2 3,312 patients within the Veteran Health Administration (8,001 patients with indication for PrEP based on diagnosis of gonorrhea or early syphilis) also found some disparities in PrEP initiation by race (White vs . Black , OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0 to2.7) 0.8 to2.0), though estimates were imprecise and not statistically significant . In this study, m en were more likely to initiate PrEP than women (OR 6.2 , 95% CI 2.5 to15.2) and urban residence was associated with increased likelihood of PrEP initiation than rural residence ( OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.8 to 13.5).205 A retrospective review of 25,886 people (8,063 with a PrEP indication) found no difference in likelihood of PrEP prescriptions between Black versus White p atients (aPR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.00) or Hispanic versus White patients (aPR 1.10, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.23).206 Among PWID, non -MSM were less likely to be prescribed PrEP than MSM (aPR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.91). A systematic review of 10 studies published between 2013 and 2020 reported infrequent PrEP use among PWID , ranging from 0 to 3%.209 One study found being insured associated with increased likelihood of PrEP utilization versus being uninsured (adjusted OR 4.49, 95% CI 1.68 to 12.01).104 Data on transgender identity and PrEP use are limited . One study of 863 people started on PrEP found that the likelihood of PrEP use was lowe r in transgender women than MSM (aPR 0.52 , 95% CI 0.32 to 0.85) ;206 similarly, a survey also found transgender women (n=369) were less likely to use PrEP than MSM (n=399) (Prevalence Ratio [ PR] 0.36, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.47) .210 Data on other factors such as transactional sex, cultural factors, and health literacy and disparities Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 46 Pacific Northwest EPC in PrEP utilization were lacking. Perceived stigma regarding PrEP has been associated with decreased likelihood of PrEP initiation in transgender women as well as women not identifying as transgen der.211,212 Contextual Question 5. What Is the Effectiveness of Prim ary Care Intervention s to Increase Utilization of PrEP and Decrease Disparities in Utilization ? Five randomized trials213-217 and one non -randomized study218 evaluated interventions relevant to U.S. primary care settings to increase utilization of PrEP in persons at higher risk of HIV infection. Sample sizes ranged from 50 to 164 (Appendix D Table 3 ). Four trials evaluated MSM;213-216 among these trials, one also included transgender women,213 one focused on young MSM,214 and three trials213-215 focused on Black populations. One other trial217 evaluated persons interested in PrEP without restricting to a specific risk category and the non -randomized study218 evaluated women with substance use disorders in addiction treatment. The interventions varied in intensity and methods, but generally involved counseling and education; other approaches included peer mentoring and a patient -centered decision aid. All studies were conducted in the United St ates and participants were recruited from STI, addiction treatment, and other outpatient clinics; using social network applications; or at community events, community organizations, and public venues. Four trials of HIV -negative MSM at higher risk of HIV infection found interventions associated with increased uptake of PrEP.213-216 Three trials focused on Black MSM and one of these focused on younger MSM, suggesting that the interventions could potentially reduce disparities in PrEP utilization among these populations. However, the trials were not designed to directly measure impacts on disparities in PrEP utilization. One trial (n=146, median age 26 years) of Black MSM and Black transgender women presenting in STI clinics found an intervention based on the information -motivation -behavioral skills model (adm inistered by a social work interventionist in a 60 minute face -to-face session) associated with increased likelihood of PrEP initiation at 3 months versus usual services (24% vs. 11%, p=0.05 based on self -report; 20% vs. p=0.15 based on electronic med ical record linked data).213 A smaller (n=50) trial of young (16 to 25 years, mean age 22 years) Black MSM recruited using social networking applications evaluated a personalized comprehensive client -centered counseling and education intervention (administered by a staff member who self -identified as a Black MSM) versus standard PrEP education.214 The comprehensive counseling and education intervention was associated with increased likelihood of PrEP initiation at 3 months (24% vs. 0%, p=0.02). Another trial (n=80) of older (mean age 44 years) Black MSM recruited from public venues, community organizations, and community events compared an intervention consisting of peer mentoring and group behavioral/educational activities with a customized needs assessment and incentivized referrals to health and support services versus the needs assessment and incentives alone. The addition of peer mentoring and group activities was associated with a non -statistically significa nt increase in use of PrEP at 6 months (22% vs. 9%, p>0.05).215 The fourth trial (n=86, mean age 32 years) evaluated MSM of Latinx) attending STI clini cs. Versus usual care, it found a brief (15 to 20 minute) motivational interviewing intervention administered by an STI counselor followed by a brief (<10 minute) Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 47 Pacific Northwest EPC telephone booster associated with increased likelihood of further discussing PrEP with a prescriber (OR 6.0, 95% CI 2.3 to 15.6), attending the prescriber appointment (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.5 to 8.9), and PrEP receipt (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.5 to 8.9).216 Evidence on the effectiveness of interventions to increase uptake of PrEP in populations other than MSM is limited. One trial (n=61) of adults (mean age 40 years; 34% Black, 11% White non-Hispanic, 43% Hispanic) attending outpatient clinics and interested in PrEP evaluated a strengths -based case management intervention administe red by a patient navigator in one 45 -to- 60 minute sessio n and up to 4 additional follow up visits or phone/text message contacts.217 In this trial, 15 percent of participants were women , 3.2 percent reported injection drug use, and 52 percent reported sexual orientation as gay or bisexual. The strengths -based case management intervention was associated with an increased likelihood of PrEP initiation at 12 weeks versus usual care that was not statistically significant (40% vs. 29%, p=0.37). One non-randomized study (n=164, mean age 40 years; 16% Black, 75% White) of women in addiction treatment found use of a decision aid tailored to this population and setting associated with increased likelihood of seeing a provider for PrEP that was of border line statistical significance (15.7% vs. 6.2%, p=0.05).218 Contextual Question 6. What Is the Effectiveness of PrEP Delivered Using Telehealth vs. Office -Based PrEP? Telehealth modalities could support uptake and adherence to PrEP, particularly in rural communities and other po pulations with limited access or other barriers to traditional office - based health services.84,219 Telehealth for PrEP encompasses a variety of modalities, including various provider -to-patient and provider -to-provider (e.g., telementoring or \"e -Consults\") approaches. However, evidence on the effectiveness of PrEP delivered using telehealth versus office -based PrEP is very limited. One small (n=48) observational study conducted in Washington state of men and transgender women who have sex with men with risk factors for HIV infection evaluated a telehealth appr oach to facilitate PrEP initiation.220 In this clinic, in - person visits with a physician to initiate PrE P were offered one day a week. Patients who could not attend clinic on that day or who did not wish to wait were offered a telehealth approach, in which the physician was present through interactive videoconference; however, patients still attended clinic for in -person counseling with an HIV counselor and diagnostic testing. Ten patients received the telehealth approach. There were no differences between the telemedicine and standard office -based approach in the proportion of participants prescribed PrEP (7 0% vs. 79%), the proportion attending the first follow -up visit at 1 month (83% vs. 85%), or adherence at 1 month (median missed doses 2 vs. 1). However, among patients not linked to a primary care provider, only 40 percent (2/5) of telehealth participa nts attended the 3 -month follow up visit, compared with 87 percent (20/23) of standard care participants. The telehealth participants reported missing 10 and 14 doses in the prior month, compared with a median of 2 (IQR 0 to 2) for standard care participants. Given the observational nature of the study, these differences were ascribed to confounding related to the reasons for initially selecting the telehealth approach. No cases of HIV infection occurred in either group. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 48 Pacific Northwest EPC No published randomized trials of teleh ealth versus office -based PrEP were identified. However, two U.S. trials are scheduled for completion in May 2022 ,221-223 and one other U.S. and one Canadian trial are estimated to be completed in the summer of 2023.224,225 One trial (n=396) compares a home -based support system (self -testing, centralized laboratory processing, and electronic be havioral monitoring) for follow up in MSM on PrEP, versus standard office -based follow -up visits , targeting enrollment of 50 percent of persons ages 18 to 34 years (18 to 49 years eligible) and 50 percent Black persons .223 This intervention (PrEP@Home) is intended to repl ace three of four annual follow up visits , and was previously found to be highly acceptable to patients in an uncontrolled pilot study.226 The other trial (n=217) compares a home -based system (ePrEP) for initiation as well as followup of PrEP among young, rural MSM (age 18 to 29 years) versus standard office -based care.221,222 The ePrEP intervention consists of video teleconsultations, secure messaging, behavioral risk surveys, and self -testing with centralized laboratory processing. In both tria ls, the primary outcome is adherence based on blood spot sample levels for TFV -DP; the ePrEP trial will also assess initiation and retention of PrEP. The PrEPTECH trial (n=400) aims to test the effectiveness of website providing access to PrEP to U.S. adolescent and adult MSM and adult transgender women.224 Via the website , participants will have access to laboratory testing for PrEP eligibility delivered to their home, telehealth care, and PrEP prescirptions delivered through an online pharmacy, and the primary outcome will be self - report PrEP initiation. The Canadian Virt ual PrEP (VPrEP) cross -over trial (n=142) will compare delivery of PrEP through the Freddie\u00ae mobile Health (mHealth) platform , where communication could occur over a number of days and minimizes the need for in -person interactions, versus standard delivery , with the primary outcome patient preference of the model of delivery.225 Both of these trials will also measure adherence. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 49 Pacific Northwest EPC Chapter 4. Discussion Summary of Review Findings This report synthesizes evidence on effects of PrEP on risk of HIV infection, harms, and other clinical outcomes; the diagnostic accuracy of instruments for identifying potential candidates for PrEP ; and contextual issues related to utiliz ation, adherence, persistence, and antiretroviral drug resistance . Table 10 summarizes the evidence reviewed for this report. As described in the prior USPSTF review, oral PrEP with TDF or TDF -FTC w as associated with decreased risk of acquiring HIV infect ion compared with placebo or no PrEP (11 trials, RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.66, I2=67%).51-55,66 -68,118,137,170,172 The absolute difference in risk of HIV infection was about 2 percent after 4 months to 4 years, for a number nee ded to treat with oral PrEP to prevent 1 case of HIV infection of about 50. In three trials conducted in the United States and Europe, each of which evaluated MSM (HIV incidence, 4% to 8% with placebo or no PrEP), the pooled absolute difference was larger at about 5 percent after 9 months to 2 years (range, 4% to 6%), for a number needed to treat with PrEP to prevent one case of incident HIV infection of about 20.52,66,118 Effects of PrEP on HIV infection risk were very similar for TDF alone (RR, 0.49 [95% CI, not FDA -approved for use as PrEP and is no longer recommended as an alternative regimen in the 2021 CDC guideline.84 Although s tatistical heterogeneity was present in the pooled estimate, this was not related to use of TDF alone or TDF -FTC. On the other hand, t here was a strong association between the degree of study -level adherence and estimates of effectiveness, when adherence was analyzed as either a categorical or continuous variable. In six trials in which adherence was 70 percent or greater, the pooled RR was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.19 to 0.3 9; I2=0%), with no statistical heterogeneity.51,52,66,67,118,170 Additional analyses also support an association between higher oral PrEP adherence and greater effectiveness, including within -study stratified analyses of trial participants stratified according to PrEP adherence level and analyses on the association between tenofovir levels in persons using PrEP and risk of HIV infection.51,53,54,135,137,153,170,172 Modeling based on trial data indicates that PrEP is highly effective in MSM taking four doses per week (estimated reduction in risk, 96%), and reduction in risk is substan tial even at two doses per week (reduction in risk, 76%),179 suggesting important benefits of PrEP despite incomplete adherence. These findings also suggest the potential use o f event -driven (targeted at periods of higher HIV risk) or intermittent (regular nondaily) dosing strategies in this population. One trial (IPERGAY) found event -driven PrEP in MSM associated with substantially reduced risk of HIV infection versus no PrEP ( RR, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.03 to 0.63]).66 IPERGAY evaluated a population of MSM with relatively frequent sexual intercourse (median, 10 episodes per month) and dosing of PrEP (median, 15 do ses per month), potentially reducing applicability to populations in which dosing is less frequent. However, a post hoc subgroup analysis of IPERGAY found that among adherent patients, event - driven PrEP among those who used 15 or fewer doses per month and those who used more than 15 pills per month appeared similarly effective, with no cases of incident HIV infection in either group .129 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 50 Pacific Northwest EPC The applicability of evidence on effects of adherence and event -driven or intermittent dosing from studies of MSM to other populations is uncertain. Tenofovir accumulates rapidly and at high concentrations in rectal compared with vaginal tissue, which coul d reduce the effectiveness of nondaily dosing in women , in whom the primary mode of transmission is through receptive vaginal intercourse. A modeling study estimated that 98 percent or greater of the population achieved protective mucosal tissue levels by the third day of exposure with TDF -FTC, although six doses/week were required to protect the lower female genital tract, compared with two doses/week to protect colorectal tissue.227 On the other hand, simian studies have shown protective effects of tenofovir alafenamide from rectal simian HIV challenge despite low rectal mucosal concentrations, suggesting limited correlation between rectal or genital muc osal concentrations of tenofovir and protection from HIV infection.228 No study evaluated effectiveness of intermittent or event -driven dosing in women or PWID . Findings regarding effectiveness of oral PrEP were robust in subgroup and stratified a nalyses based on HIV risk category ( MSM , PWID , or persons at risk of HIV infection via heterosexual contact), study duration, study quality, age, and sex. However, evidence in PWID was limited to one trial conducted in Thailand in which most patients recei ved directly observed therapy and sterile syringes were not provided (RR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.29 to 0.92]),53 and a ll trials of persons at risk via heterosexual contact were conducted in Africa, which might reduce applicability to U.S. practice. Effects of PrEP were stronger in trials conducted in the United States, Europe, and Canada (RR, 0.13 [95% CI, 0.05 to 0.32]) than in studies conducted in Africa, Asia, or internationally (RR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.37 to 0.79]); this could be related to high adherence in the North American and European trials or differences across countries in HIV epidemiology and management (e.g., dif ferences in the proportion of partners with HIV treated with ART). No study evaluated effectiveness of PrEP according to a sexual partner with HIV 's use of ART or viral load .52,66,118 However, the 2021 CDC guideline notes that persons with HIV with a consistently undetectable viral load pose effectively no risk for HIV transmission to sexual partners. N o randomized trial of PrEP enrolled adolescents , but in 2018 TDF -FTC was approved by the FDA for PrEP in adolescents weighing at least 35 kg. This decision was informed by a PrEP demonstration study in MSM ages 15 to 17 years that found a similar s afety profile for TDF -FTC compared with the safety profile observed in adults.184 Evidence on beneficial effects of oral PrEP on clinical outcomes other than HIV infection was sparse. Oral PrEP was associated with a statistically nonsignificant reduction in mortality risk versus no PrEP or placebo (RR, 0.81 [95% C I, 0.59 to 1.11]; I2=0%), and trials were not designed to address this outcome.51-55,66,67,118,137,170,172 No trial reported effects of PrEP on quality of life, although observational and qualitative research suggests that PrEP may reduce anxiety or worry about getting HIV.229-231 Although oral PrEP was associated with some harms, most appeared relatively mild and reversible with PrEP discontinuation. PrEP was not associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events,51-55,66 -68,118,137,170,172 and there was a statistically nonsignificant i ncreased risk of withdrawal due to adverse events (RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 0.99 to 1.59]).51,55,66,137,172 PrEP was associated with increased risk of gastrointestinal events (RR, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.26 to 2.11]; ARD, 1.95%),51-55,66 -68,118,137,170,172 that generally improved with longe r duration of therapy. Consistent with renal effects of tenofovir, oral PrEP was also associated with an increased risk of renal Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 51 Pacific Northwest EPC insufficiency (RR, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.18 to 1.75]; ARD, 0.56%),51-55,66-68,118,137,170,172 which gene rally appeared to be mild and resolved with cessation of PrEP. Our finding of an increased risk of renal adverse events was consistent with another review that found oral PrEP associated with increased risk of grade 1 creatinine elevation or worse versus p lacebo (OR, 1.39 [95% CI, 1.09 to 1.71]).232 Consistent with effects of tenofovir on bone loss, PrEP was associated with a statistically nonsignificant increase in risk of fracture (RR, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.97 to 1.56]);51- 54,66,137,170 results of the fracture meta -analysis were heavily weighted by the Bangkok Tenofovir Study of PWID .53 These findings are consistent with a recent systematic review that found oral PrEP associated with greater bone mineral density decline than placebo, with no statistically significant increase in risk of fractures.233 Studies with longer -term followup would be helpful for clarifying fracture risk, given the relatively short followup in the trials (4 months to 4 years) and potential long -term effects of tenofovir on bone density and fracture risk. Based on currently available shorter -term data, effects of PrEP on fracture risk appear small (ARD, 0.21%). One small new crossover trial found event -driven oral PrEP associated with decreased risk of short - term, mild adverse events, but was not designed to assess more serious or longer -term harms.144 A large new trial (DISCOVER) found oral daily TAF -FTC to be noninferior to TDF -FTC for incident HIV infection in primarily MSM (2% transgender women) , and potentially associated with increased efficacy (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0. 19 to 1.14).121,162 TAF -FTC was associated with positive short -term effects on bone mineral density versus TDF -FTC and negative effects on lipid parameters and weight gain, without differen ces in clinical adverse events including renal events and fractures, which require longer -term study. TAF -FTC is not approved for PrEP in women at risk for acquiring HIV infection from receptive vaginal sex because effectiveness has not been evaluated in t his situation, and it is not recommended in the 2021 CDC guideline fo r this population.84 Among persons using oral PrEP, t he rate of resistance mutations to tenofovir or emtricitabine appears low. Most cases of antiretroviral resistance occurred in persons who were infected with HIV at baseline, reinforcing the importance of clinical history and HIV testing to rule out HIV infection before initiating PrEP. Evidence to determine the effects of PrEP -selected antiretroviral resistance mutations on clinical outcomes is not available, but is likely to depend on the specific resistance mutation (s) present , impact on effectiveness of first-line ART, and availability of alternative (non-first-line) ART regimens , if needed.234 Patients with the most common PrEP nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance mutations (K65R, M184I, M184V) w ith INSTI or protease -inhibitor based regimens, with limited evidence indicating high rates of virological suppression in persons with these mutations .199,200 Furthermore, the number of HIV cases averted by PrEP appears to be substantially higher than the number of cases of antiretroviral resistance caused. Based on data from the Partners PrEP trial, there were an estimated 123 cases of HIV infection averted, compared with five cases of drug resistance.146 A concern about PrEP has been the potential for behavioral risk compensation. There was no association between PrEP and increased risk of bacterial STIs in RCTs.51,118,137,170,172 However, in most trials, patients were blinded to receipt of PrEP , which might affect sexu al behaviors differently than when patients know they are using PrEP, as in clinical practice. One open -label trial (PROUD) found no nstatistically significant association s between PrEP and STIs in MSM , consistent with the higher prevalence of risky sexual behaviors among men randomized to PrEP that was observed in this trial.118 In addition, participants in randomized trials may differ from Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 52 Pacific Northwest EPC the general population of PrEP users , who may be at higher risk for STIs.178 A systematic review that included PROUD, the U.S. demonstration study, and other open -label, nonrandomized studies found PrEP associated with an increased risk of rectal chlamydia (4 studies; OR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.19 to 2.13]), but no statistically significant association between PrEP and risk of chlamydia at any site (5 studies; OR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.00 to 1.51]), STIs overall studies; [95% 0.99 to 1.54]), syphilis (6 studies; OR, 1.12 [95% CI, 0.8 6 to 1.47]), or gonorrhea (5 studies; OR, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.78 to 1.64]).235 The nonrandomized studies had m ethodological shortcoming s, includ ing use of a before -after study design, failure to adjust for differential STI testing rates, and use of self -report to determine STI rates before initiation of PrEP. Some data suggest that persons who engage in riskier behaviors tend to be more adherent to P rEP (see Contextual Question 1),53,178,185 which might result in greater benefits in terms of reduction in HIV incidence that could offset negative effects related to any increase in risky behaviors (e.g., STIs) . There was no association between PrEP and risk of HSV infection,120,150,170 although some trials120,170 found decreased risk or a trend toward decreased risk, consistent with antiviral effects of teno fovir on HSV.119,120 Cases of acute hepatitis C virus infection have been reported in U.S. MSM using PrEP,236 but data from randomized trials are too limited to determine effects on risk of hepatitis C virus infection.66,118 In patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection, very limited evidence sugge sts that cessation of oral PrEP is not associated with hepatitis flare.55,169 However, a lmost all rando mized trials excluded patients with hepatitis B virus infection at baseline and some trials provided hepatitis B virus vaccination to eligible patients. One trial reported one case of incident hepatitis B virus infection,54 though this outcome was not a specified outcome in any trial. Alternative PrEP regimens that do not require daily administration could improve utilization and adherence. One alternative to oral PrEP in women is the dapivirine vaginal ring, which was not address ed in the 2019 USPSTF review . The dapivirine vaginal ring was associated with decreased risk of infection versus a placebo ring in African women at increased risk of HIV infection (2 trials, RR, 0.71 [95% CI 0.57 to 0.89]), and had a favorable safety profi le.73,74 However, efficacy versus placebo for preventing HIV infection was lower with the dapivirine vaginal ring than observed in trials of oral PrEP . Open-label extension s tudies suggest greater adherence and effectiveness in women enrolled in the RCTs who cho se to continue with the dapivirine ring , but utilized simulated control groups .111,112 The dapivirine ring has not been FDA -approved and has been withdrawn from the manufacturer from further FDA review. Another alternative to oral PrEP is long -acting injectable cabotegravir, which involves a bimonthly injection. Long -acting injectable cabotegravir was associated with greater reduction in risk of HIV infection than oral TDF -FTC in one new trial of MSM and transgender women (0.6% vs. 1.7%; RR, 0.3 3 [95% CI, 0.18 to 0.6 2]70 and one new trial of African women at high risk of HIV infection (0.3% vs. 2.3%; RR, 0.11 [95% CI, 0.04 to 0.31]).88 Cabotegravir was associated with increased risk of injection site reactions that were usually mild and decreased in frequency following the initial injection, and weight gain (<1 kg). A potential concern with cabotegravir is the prolonged pharmacologic tail (period of declining drug levels) when injections are disco ntinued or delayed . Low drug levels during the pharmacologic tail could select for antiretroviral drug resistance mutations if HIV infection is acquired .237,238 Resistance to one integrase strand transfer inhibitor such as cabotegravir is of concern because it may result in cross -resistance with other integrase strand transfer inhibitors, potentially limiting the use of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 53 Pacific Northwest EPC first-line ant iretroviral therapy regimens. Although randomized trials of cabotegravir reported a low incidence of INSTI resistance mutations among persons randomized to this regimen, one trial70 reported a high proportion of patients with incident HIV infection had an INSTI mutation. No cases of INSTI resistance mutations acquired following cessation of cabotegravir during the pharmacologic tail period were identified. L onger -term implementation and other studies are required to clari fy incidence and consequences of INSTI resistance mutations acquired in persons using cabotegravir for PrEP . Cabotegravir is FDA -approved for use in at -risk adults and adolescents (35 kg) to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV infection.75 Data on effects of PrEP in pregnancy remains limited. Trials excluded pregnant persons and discontinued PrEP in persons who became pregnant. Among persons who became pregnant in the trials, oral PrEP was not associated with increased risk of spontaneous abortion68,157,172 or other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Observational studies also indicate no increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes among persons with prenatal exposure to oral PrEP.239,240 A systematic review of persons infected with HIV or hepatitis B virus who r eceived tenofovir during pregnancy (not for PrEP) found mild to moderate maternal and infant harms that were not considered to be tenofovir -related, no increased risk of growth or bone abnormalities in infants exposed in utero, and no increased risk of con genital abnormalities.241 FDA labeling information and perinatal antiretroviral treatment guidelines permit use of TDF -FTC (an FDA pregnancy category B drug) during pregnancy.84 Although the FDA -approved label recommends that nursing mothers not breastfeed if they are taking TDF -FTC and data on safety in breastfeeding infants are lackin g, the 2021 CDC guideline84 notes limited exposure via breast milk. Evidence on safety of cabotegravir for PrEP in pregnant or breastfeeding persons is very sparse , although one trial88 reported no congenital abnormalities in infants with in utero exposure to PrEP. Understanding PrEP uptak e, adherence , and persistence in U.S. primary care and primary care - applicable settings could be useful for assessing applicability of RCTs, which were primarily conducted in low -income settings , and inform efforts for successful implementation of PrEP . Available evidence primarily focused on use of oral PrEP. Disparities in oral PrEP utilization have been reported, with decreased utilization among PWID, transgender women, and adolescents.93 Some st udies have found disparities in utilization by race/ethnicity,107,204,205 though findings were incon sistent. Evidence on primary care interventions to increase utilization was limited but suggested that behavioral and educational interventions tailored to specific populations (e.g., young and/or Black MSM) can increase utilization, potentially reducing disparities.213-216 Evidence on effects of telehealth for PrEP on utilization and other outcomes is extremely limited, though RCTs are in progress. Studies of U.S. MSM found that adherence based on documentation of highly protective drug levels varied widely (22% to 90%), with lower levels of adherence in yo unger MSM ; adherence also tended to decrease over time.178,184 -187 Other factors associated with decreased adherence include non -White race, lower socioeconomic status, presence of other adverse social determinants ; a factor associated with increased adherence was presence of higher -risk behaviors , indicating that patients may vary adherence according to degree of risk .242 In MSM, discontinuation of oral PrEP is frequent, and appear s related to factors similar to those associated with decreased adherence.178,186,188,193 -195 One RCT of U.S. MSM found higher adherence with daily than intermittent or event -driven PrEP.174 Evidence on PrEP utilization, adherence , and persistenc e in populations other than MSM (e.g., PWID, persons at risk due to vaginal intercourse, transgender persons) remains limited . Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 54 Pacific Northwest EPC However, trials of MSM and transgender women and women at risk due to vaginal intercourse indicate that long -acting injectable cabotegravir is associated with higher adherence (based on lack of delayed or discontinued injections) than oral PrEP (based on protective dried blood spot levels).70,88 Instruments that are accurate for predicting risk of i ncident HIV infection could help inform decisions regarding eligibility for PrEP. Five instruments for predicting incident HIV infection in MSM found moderate discrimination (AUROC estimates ranged from 0.6 0 to 0.73),140,155,165,166,171 though some instruments require further validation. All studies applied instruments retrospectively and some instruments were developed using data from older cohorts in which the effects of factors associated w ith HIV incidence (e.g., nitrates, amphetamines) may differ from contemporary populations. In general populations of HIV -negative persons, two large studies found two new instruments had moderate to high discrimination (AUROC 0.77 and 0.84) for predicting incident HIV infection.143,151 Both instruments utilized a computerized algorithm on items extracted fro m the electronic medical record. Limitations Our review had limitations. As statistical heterogeneity was anticipated in pooled analyses, we used the DerSimonian and Laird random -effects model to pool studies. The DerSimonian and Laird random -effects m odel may result in CIs that are too narrow when heterogeneity is present, particularly when the number of studies is small.125 Therefore, we repeated analyses in which statistical heterogeneity was present using the profile likelihood method ; these sensitivity analyses resulted in similar findings. To explore statistic al heterogeneity, we also performed sensitivity and subgroup analyses based on adherence level, study quality, duration of followup, HIV risk category, PrEP regimen, and geographic setting. Although statistical heterogeneity remained present in some analys es, results consistently favored PrEP, although estimates varied according to level of adherence and geographic setting. We did not have access to individual patient data. Therefore, our findings are based on analyses of study -level data and our ability to analyze subgroup effects was restricted to published reports. We excluded non -English -language articles, which could result in language bias. However, some research suggests that English - language restriction has little effect on the conclusions of systema tic reviews of non- complementary medicine topics, and we did not identify large non -English trials of PrEP versus placebo in other systematic reviews.243,244 We only assessed for publication bias usi ng statistical and graphical methods to assess for small sample effects when there were at least 10 studies, as research indicates that such methods can be misleading with smaller numbers of studies.127 Funnel plot asymmetry was present ( Appendix C Figure 1 ) for the outcome of HIV infection and a test for small sample effects was statistically significant. Although small sample effects may be due to publicat ion bias, graphical and statistical tests can be difficult to interpret in the presence of other factors that could influence study results, such as differences across trials in geographic setting, adherence levels, HIV risk category, and other factors. We identified no unpublished trials of PrEP in searches on a clinical trials database (clinicaltrials.gov). Our primary analyses were based on data reported in journal publications. In three trials included in the FDA medical review of PrEP with tenofovir an d emtricitabine, there were some discrepancies between the journal articles and the FDA report for numbers of HIV cases and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 55 Pacific Northwest EPC fractures.126 In the iPrEx trial, more HIV infections in both the PrEP and placebo arms were reported in the FDA review than in the journal publication.137 A sensitivity analysis that used the FDA data resulted in similar results for iPrEx (RR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.41 to 0.82]) compared with results in the journal publication (RR, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.36 to 0.77]) and no change in the pooled estimate (RR, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.30 to 0.66]). Similarly, although there were some discrepancies in fractures rates between the journal publication s and the FDA review of the iPrEx, Partners PrEP, and CDC Safety Study trials, a sensitivity analysis using FDA data did not affect the estimate for fracture risk. Although publication and reporting bias may be associated with industry funding, few PrEP tr ials reported receipt of industry support, with support in those trials primarily consisting of provision of study drugs. Stratified analyses did not indicate better results for PrEP in trials that reported some industry support. However, some trials that received donated study drugs may not have reported it, which could have resulted in some misclassification. Emerging Issues/Next Steps Alternative PrEP regimens that are easier to tolerate, do not require daily administration, are not associated with adv erse renal and gastrointestinal effects, do not select for drug resistance, and achieve protective levels could increase the effectiveness of PrEP, improve the balance of benefits to harms, and facilitate greater uptake of PrEP. In addition to oral TAF -FTC, the dapivirine vaginal ring and long -acting injectable cabo tegravir, which were not evaluated in the prior USPSTF review but added for this report, other PrEP regimens that have been studied include oral maraviroc,113-115 tenofovir vaginal gel,54,116,117 and injectable rilpivirine. However, these regimens have not been approved by the FDA, have limited evidence of effectiveness or evidence of low effectivene ss, and are not recommended in clinical practice guidelines. Trials of long-acting (every 6 months) injectable lenacapavir (an HIV -1 capsid inhibitor) for PrEP are currently in progress, with expected completion in 2027.245,246 PrEP could also be delivered as a biodegradable, long -acting subcutaneous implant.247 A potential advantage of implants over long -acting injectable formulations is that the y could be removed if needed without a prolonged pharmacological tail period . However, a review of nonclinical animal model studies of TAF hemifumarate subcutaneous implants identified safety and tolerability issues judged sufficiently concerning by the Ga tes Foundation to no longer pursue clinical development.248 Islatravir , a nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor, has been evaluated in or al and implant formulations for PrEP but studies have been put on clinical holds by the FDA due to observationas of decreases in total lymphocyte and CD4+ T - cell counts in some patients receiving islatravir.249 Broadly neutralizing HIV -1 monoclonal antibodies were not effective for reducing risk of HIV acquisition in initial trials,250 though further research is underway .251 Emerging areas to improve uptake of PrEP include use of telehealth for PrEP (see Contextual Question 6), same -day PrEP initiation,252 and various behavioral, educational, peer support/mentori ng, decision aids, and other interventions (see Contextual Question 5). Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 56 Pacific Northwest EPC Relevance for Priority Populations In the U.S., HIV disproportionately affects racial/ethnic minorities, in particular Black and Hispanic persons. One trial found no difference in ef fectiveness of PrEP between Hispanic and non-Hispanic persons,137 and trials found PrEP to be effective in diverse racial/ethnic populations worldwide. Among PrEP -eligible individuals, PrEP coverage is substantially hig her among White compared to Black or Hispanic/Latinx individuals , suggesting potential disparities in utilization .253 As described in Contextual Question 4, however, evidence indicating presence of disparities in utilization by race/ethnicity are somewhat inconsistent and may be attenuated after controlling fo r other factors associated with PrEP utilization, such as age, sex and gender, socioeconomic status, and other social determinants. Regardless, race and ethnicity are often correlate d with the presence of social determinants that drive disparities in PrEP utilization. Although PrEP was associated with decreased risk of HIV infection in women at high risk of acquisition via heterosexual contact, all trials of this population were conducted in Africa. As described in Contextual Question 4, s ome data suggest disparities in the United States with regard to implementation of PrEP in women. Data on the number of pregnant or lactating women on PrEP in the United States are not available, but use in these populations is likely to be low. Data on PrEP in transgender women remains limited , though one survey using a national probability sample found that PrEP was only utilized in 3 percent of respondents who had sex with cisgender men and/or transgender women .106 Barriers to PrEP use in transgender individuals include lack of knowledge, unfavorable attitudes toward PrEP , and stigma.106,212,254 Although it is unlikely that there are significant drug interactions between gender -affirming hormone treatments and PrEP,255 some evidence indicates small interaction effects of uncertain clinical significance.256,257 Randomized trials that included transgender women have not be en powered to evaluate effectiveness in t ransgender individuals . A post hoc analysis of iPrEx137 found that PrEP was effective in MSM (HR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.34 to 0.75]) but not in transgender women (HR, 1.1 [95% CI, 0.5 t o 2.7]), although the interaction was not statistically significant (p=0.09),134 precluding reliable conclusions regarding decreased effectiveness in transgender women . In the iPrEx trial, adherence was lower in transgender women than in MSM , particularly among those who reported receptive anal intercourse without a condom. In addition, there was an assoc iation between TFV drug level detectability and decreased risk of HIV infection, highlighting adherence as a potentially important implementation challenge in t ransgender individuals . The DISCOVER trial, which compared TAF -FTC versus TDF -FTC, enrolled 2 percent transgender women; no cases of HIV infection occurred in this group in either arm.121 In HPTN 083, which enrolled 13% transgender women who have sex with men, efficacy was similar in MSM (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.68) and transgender (HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.56), suggesting cabotegravir as a potential option in transgender pers ons with suboptimal adherence on oral PrEP.70 No PrEP trial enrolled transgender men and data on the prevalence of HIV infection in this population are lacking.258 Evidence on the effectiveness of PrEP in persons at risk due to injection drug use remains limited. One Asian trial found oral PrEP to be effective in PWID .53 Uptake of PrEP in PWID appears relatively low (see Contextual Question 4), though surveys indicate opportunities to improve utilization, ba sed on the proportion expressing willingness to take PrE P.259,260 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 57 Pacific Northwest EPC The FDA has approved daily oral TDF -FTC, daily oral TAF -FTC, and injectable cabotegra vir in adolescents weighing at least 35 kg who otherwise meet indications for use of these regimens as PrEP . Although 22 percent of new HIV Infections in 2018 occurred in adolescents, d ata on PrEP initiation from the manufacturer indicated that less than 5 percent of individuals receiving new PrEP in 2012 were adolescents, indicating marked underutilization.261 In addition to decreased uptake, other barriers to implementation of PrEP in adolescents include lower adherence and persistence (see Contextual Question 1) and potential privacy issues (e.g., for adolescents who may receive PrEP while on their parents' insurance plan) . Future Research Research is needed to clarify the comparative effectiveness and harms of alternative PrEP regimens, including oral TDF -FTC, oral TAF -FTC, and injectable cabotegravir; to determine the comparative effectiveness and harms of daily versus event -driven or intermittent oral PrEP; and to identify effective interventions to improve PrEP uptake, adherence, and p ersistence (including telehealth approaches and same -day PrEP initiation) . Studies comparing TAF -FTC and TDF - FTC should have sufficient power and duration to evaluate whether short -term differences in renal function, bone mineral density, lipid parameters, and weight gain are associated with differences in long -term clinical outcomes. In addition, studies are needed to determine whether TAF -FTC is effective in populations other than MSM, including women at risk due to vaginal intercourse. For cabotegravir, longer -term follow -up and implementation studies are needed to assess adherence in clinical practice and the durability of observed benefits as well as the risk of and clinical consequences of integrase strand transfer inhibitor resistance mutations. Rand omized trials and implementation studies of PrEP in U.S. populations of women at high risk via vaginal intercourse and PWID would be useful to verify the applicability of trials conducted in low -income settings to the United States, including the effectiveness of PrEP in primary care settings. Studies should measure adherence and evaluate the association between adherence and effectiveness , particularly among persons with HIV exposure through cervico -vaginal tissue or blood (i.e., injection drug use) . Research is needed to confirm the safety and effectiveness of PrEP during pregnancy or lactation and in gender nonconforming persons, the effect iveness and long-term safety (e.g., bone effects) of PrEP in adolescents, and to understand effects of PrEP on quality of life (including sexual health) . To accurately assess effects of PrEP in different populations, studies should collect accurate informa tion on sex and gender identity. Studies on factors associated with adherence and methods for increasing PrEP uptake, adherence, and persistence would be very helpful for guiding strategies for successful implementation , particularly in populations with lo w adherence, such as adolescents and various racial/ethnic group s, and other underserved populations based on socioeconomic status, insurance status, educational level, health literacy, and other social determinants of health . Additional research would he lp to further clarify effects of PrEP related to behavioral risk compensation. Open -label studies, including observational studies that include a concurrent no - PrEP comparison group or compare alternative PrEP regimens and account for differential STI testing rates , would be helpful for understanding behavioral risk compensation effects in clinical practice. Research is also needed to clarify whether oral PrEP confers protective effects against Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis for HIV Prevention 58 Pacific Northwest EPC HSV and how any observed effects on HSV affect HIV acquisition risk; determine effects of PrEP on hepatitis C virus infection, particularly in populations at high risk of hepatitis C virus (e.g., PWID , MSM ); and determine whether PrEP reduces risk of hepatitis B infection262 (due to the antiviral effects of tenofovir and emtricitabine) and verify the safety of PrEP in persons with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Research is also needed to further develop and validate instruments for identifying persons at high risk of acquiring HIV infection , particularly for populations other than MSM . Studies should perform validation in independent cohorts, ideally using more current cohorts with prospective application of risk assessment instruments and assessment of HIV incidence, and should be applicable to diverse racial/ethnic groups . For ide ntifying persons eligible for PrEP among general populations of uninfected individuals, studies are needed to verify the accuracy and impact of automated computerized algorithms using electronic medical records data.143,151 Conclusions In adults at increased risk of HIV infection, oral PrEP with TDF or TDF -FTC is associated with decreased ris k of HIV infection compared with placebo or no PrEP, although effectiveness decreases with inadequate adherence. TAF -FTC was non -inferior to TDF -FTC in MSM and long-acting injectable cabotegravir was associated with decreased risk of HIV infection versus TDF-FTC in MSM or transgender women and women at higher risk for HIV infection. Instruments for predicting risk of incident HIV infection have moderate discrimination in MSM and moderate to high discrimination in general populations of HIV -uninfected person s.

Intention -to-treat analysis is used for RCTs. Poor: Studies are graded \"poor\" if any of the following fatal flaws exists: Groups assembled initially are not close to being comparable or maintained throughout the study; unreliable or invalid measurement instruments are used or not applied equally among groups (including not masking outcome assessment); and key confounders are given little or no attention. Intention - to-treat analysis is lacking for RCTs. Diagnostic Accuracy Studies Criteria: Screening test relevant, available for primary care, and adequately described Credible reference standard, performed regardless of test results Reference standard interpreted independently of scree ning test Indeterminate results handled in a reasonable manner Spectrum of patients included in study Sample size Reliable screening test Definition of ratings based on above criteria: Good: Evaluates relevant available screening test; uses a credible reference standard; interprets reference standard independently of screening test; assesses reliability of test; has few or handles indeterminate results in a reasonable manner; includes large number (>100) of broad -spectrum patients with and without disease Fair: Evaluates relevant available screening test; uses reasonable although not best standard; interprets reference standard independent of screening test; has moderate sample size (50 to 100 subjects) and a \"medium\" spectrum of patients Append ix A6.
