The active ingredient, arnica montana, is a powerful herb that has been utilized for hundreds of years for its many restorative properties.

Homeopathic medicine has a specific way of measuring potency. A product with a potency level of 30C has been diluted more than a product with 6C \u2014 but the product with 30C affects the body in a more generalized way, whereas, the product with 6C targets a localized area of the body. Because Boiron Arnica Montana 30C has a higher level of potency, this product best supports your body's response to generalized discomfort. All you have to do is place the tablets under your tongue to dissolve before you start feeling that sweet sense of relief! If you're dealing with localized pain, such as an achy joint or a small bruise, try [Boiron Arnica Montana 6C](https://findyourhealthyplace.com/product/boiron-arnica-montana-6c/)!
