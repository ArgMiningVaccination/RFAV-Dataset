SIEGEL, ESQ. It seems like the healthcare industry has been in a constant state of flux.For better or for worse, this will con- tinue to be the case in 2012. Indeed,between upcoming legal and politicaldevelopments, this year is shaping up tobe critical for the effort to implement theprovisions of the Patient Protection andAffordable Care Act (\"PPACA\") that aredesigned to reform the nation's health-care delivery and reimbursement sys-tems through the development ofaccountable care organizations(\"ACOs\") and other innovative pro-grams. As an example, the 32 PioneerACOs (ACOs approved in December formature groups ready to take risk) beganoperations on January 1. One of thePioneer ACOs, JSA Medical Group, willbe operating in the Orlando, Tampa andSouth Florida markets.Healthcare Reform: 2012 Is Going to Be a Busy Year Continued on page 42 February 2012 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital News Need help with Meaningful Use?

University Drive Suite #7 Sunrise, FL 33322 PublisherPublisher 's Note's Note As Billy Crystal might say (while channeling the late RicardoMontalban), \"I look mahvelous, darling!\" Carol just took her favoritelittle Ken doll (me) shopping and thetrouser tag read - Size 34! (I guess nowan alert is in order to those who don'twant to hear about my annual battle ofthe bulge ... read no further.) But seriously , for several reasons I've spent the last 60 days becoming aMedifast aficionado and for me, it'sworked great. I won't lie and say eachmeal is a gourmet treat. It's quite a leapof faith to call a package of powder abeef stew entr\u00e9e, but I've never beenhungry and my world-famous addic-tion to greasy fried food appears undercontrol. So what precipitated this diveoff the \"gravy\" train? Three compelling reasons: 1. perpetual heartburn; 2. perpetually expanding waistbands; and 3. per-petually increasing Health Insurance premiums. Since Carol and I both entered a new phase of our lives (how tactfully the insurance actuary put it), we also entered a new age bracket in health insurancecosts. It was a real wake-up call and made us both carefully revisit our true insur-ance needs. So, we basically decided to forego our previous \"bells and whistles\"benefits and journey back to the days of \"major medical.\" (And somehow I thinkwe have lots of company .) For example, we figured out our past doctor visits areusually limited to 3 or 4 a year \u2014 so we will now shoulder the visit costs asopposed to enjoying our previous $15 co-pays. But even more radical for us isthe elimination of our prescription coverage. In the past several years, I've hadintermittent bouts with asthma, for which I was prescribed some pretty priceydrugs. Of course, when you only have a $15 co-pay you don't think too muchabout it. But now , paying $162 a month for one prescription really makes youpay attention. So another positive result of my losing 20 pounds ... my breath- ing is great with no wheezing. Now I fully understand that to a certain extent we are playing \"Russian Roulette\" with future healthcare costs. But after figuring out the dollars we could save monthly by decreasing our benefits and focusing on preventive medicine, we've decided on this new approach for 2012. We call it FelixCare. We're eating less, but better, and trying to get more exercise. (And as an incentive or a threat, Carol has dumped my old wardrobe!) I guess only time will tell if it is a wise decision \u2014 but in the meantime, I'm wearing a svelte size 34 and \"I look mahvelous, darling.\" Charles Felix You can reach Charles Felix at Charles@southfloridahospitalnews.com 4 February 2012 southfloridahospitalnews.com South Florida Hospital NewsHere are a few more critical dates to keep in mind: MARCH 26. The United States Supreme Court will hear oral arguments on one of the most controversial provisions ofPPACA, the so-called \"individual mandate.\" The Court hasallotted over 5 hours for oral arguments on that day . Thisunusually long time for oral arguments reflects the complexityof the issue, the Court's evaluation of its importance and thenumber of parties who want to be heard. Although 26 stateattorneys general have joined in the effort to strike down theindividual mandate, there is substantial support for upholdingthis provision. In addition to the usual suspects, a group of over500 state lawmakers, including lawmakers from all of the 26states that are seeking to have it overturned, have filed a briefin support of the individual mandate. Most observers expectthat by the time the Supreme Court's current term ends in June,the Court will issue its decision regarding this keystone provi-sion. However, whether the Court upholds or strikes down themandate, PPACA 's Medicare Shared Savings Program (\"SSP\")already has set in motion forces that likely will significantlyalter the business, if not the practice, of healthcare. APRIL 1 AND JULY 1. The ACOs that submitted their appli- cations to CMS on or before January 20, 2012 will begin oper-ation on April 1. ACOs that submitted their applications afterthat date but on or before March 30, 2012, and are approvedwill begin operation on July 1. OCTOBER 1. Notwithstanding the development of ACOs, this is the date on which the Medicare program will begin usingvalue-based reimbursement criteria for hospital services. Thesecriteria will link a part of a hospital's Medicare payments to itsability to satisfy certain performance standards. In addition,hospitals who readmit patients for preventable complicationswill see their reimbursement for these readmissions adversely impacted. NOVEMBER 3. The election. Separate and apart from what the Supreme Court decides concerning the individual mandate,the fate of PPACA and the current effort to reform the way inwhich the federal government pays for healthcare items andservices may depend on who are the winners and losers. All ofthe major Republican candidates are running on platforms thatinclude repealing \"Obamacare\". However, none of them haveprovided a great deal of information concerning which aspectsof PPACA (other than the individual mandate) they would seekto repeal. Some of PPACA 's provisions (for example, the cover-age of minors up to age 26 and the prohibition concerning pre-existing conditions) have widespread popular approval. If it isupheld, the insurance industry is likely to fight to retain theindividual mandate. In addition, ACOs and the SSP aredesigned (in part) to begin addressing the federal deficit. Thus,even if the Republicans win by a landslide, it seems unlikelythat many of PPACA 's more significant provisions will berepealed. DECEMBER 31. Under PPACA, each state has the option of establishing its own health insurance exchange. While thoseexchanges will not \"go live\" until 2014, by the end of 2012 thefederal government must certify that a state is progressingtoward that goal or risk having to implement a federally runexchange. NOTE: so far Florida has opted not to establish itsown health insurance exchange. Instead, citizens of this Statewill participate in a federally run exchange. Stephen H.

COVER STORY: Healthcare Reform: 2012 Is Going to Be a Busy Year Continued from page 1 You with Jess Farber Advertising We get results. Period! You get proven strategies and ideas that work plus uncommonly creative materials that help you achieve your marketing and sales goals. Without question! 954.614.1854 /g4a/g45/g53/g53/g20/g4a/g46/g41/g44/g56/g0e/g43/g4f/g4d/g03/g73/g03/g57/g57/g57/g0e/g4a/g46/g41/g44/g56/g0e/g43/g4f/g4dYou United A/C & RefrigerationSouth year after year, because you didn't know itexist ed, or how to go about recouping it? It happens every year in Florida, espe- cially for medical providers, MRI compa-nies and diagnostic imaging centers thattreat auto accident victims and struggleto get their full PIP claims paid. But newremote scanning technologies are mak-ing it all the easier to recover those over-due revenues in a fraction of the time itused to take. That can mean real money , in real time. How does it work? Innovative legal professionals provide the high-techscanners and install them on your com-puter, allowing you to send us data onpaid and unpaid PIP claims at the touchof a button. Since your employees arescanning Explanation of Benefits (EOBs)documents as they come in, it takes littleextra time or effort on their part. But first it means knowing your rights under Florida's Personal InjuryProtection provisions. Under PIP , regard-less of who is at fault, the cost of acci-dent victims' medical treatment is paidby their own insurance companies, up to$10,000. PIP has long been designed to help \"keep it simple\" for motorists, insurancecompanies, health care providers, attor-neys and Florida courts. But over theyears, auto insurers have engaged in apractice of routinely shortchanging orimproperly denying valid claims filed byMRI companies, doctors, hospitals andother providers. In some cases, this sleight of hand can cost providers millions of dollars in rev-enue due them for legitimate, necessarycare. But you have an effective weapon on your side - the law. And the law allowsyou to recover those monies at no costand no risk to you or your business. In one recent case, for example, the Boca Raton-based law firm of Ellis, Ged& Bodden was able to recover $2 millionsince 2008 for a single MRI provider justby auditing its files, comparing itsreceipts to valid claims filed anddemanding the difference from theinsurance companies. And this is no anomaly . Since 2008, for example, Ellis, Ged & Bodden hasgone to bat for 200 medical providerclients and helped recoup $13 million inunpaid or overdue claims rightfully due them by auto insurers. Because MRIproviders and diagnostic centers havesimpler, more streamlined billing proce-dures, fighting their improperly deniedclaims yields an even higher rate of suc-cess. Now emerging technology is making the auditing and reviewing process fasterand more efficient. The \"old\" process is still a good one, mind you. Legal professionals at firmslike ours go to your office, review yourold and current files, return to ouroffices and evaluate what the insurerspaid you versus what you billed them todetermine what is rightfully owed you. At that point, filing a simple demand letter notifying the insurance companiesof unpaid claims is often all that's need-ed to get the insurers to write you acheck for the overdue balance. Othertimes, though, we have to take them tocourt to recoup the money . Any legalfees incurred - court costs, attorney fees,etc. - are either paid by us or the insur-ance company , depending on who losesin court. You pay nothing. With new , high-tech, computerized scanners we've employed only in thepast couple of months, the process isexpedited, meaning the medicalprovider and diagnostic center is paidmore quickly . The size of a toaster, the cutting-edgeFujitsu scanner is connected to your office desktop PC by one of our profes-sionals. Every time you receive an EOBfrom the insurer detailing the paymentor nonpayment on a particular bill filedaccording to a patient's PIP benefits,your employee scans the document atthe touch of a button. Within seconds, the data is transmit- ted to our legal professionals with thehighest-standard 256-bit encryption thatprotects its security , following all HIPAAregulations. The information is thenevaluated and processed by our team bythe end of the day . It's a real-time turnaround that simpli- fies the process for your busy staff andallows you to get paid all the moneyowed more quickly . In this challenging economy , it's hard enough to keep a sound business afloat,even one that provides an essential serv-ice like healthcare. No one can afford toleave money on the table, and withtoday's technology - and consumeradvocates armed with Florida's PIP pro-tections - there's no reason to.

AA::Just like creating hurricane plans before the fury of a storm descends uponyou, now is a good time to be positioningyour practice for the impending hard mar-ket in malpractice insurance that will beunfolding in the next few years, just at atime when many practices are challenged bydecreasing income and rising expenses. The best strategy can be broken downas this: 1. Preventative: Focus yourself and your entire practice team on risk man- agement. Many times doctors overlook the importance of including the staffin risk management discussions. Studies show that the friendlier your wholepractice environment is the lower your risk of a lawsuit. Many higher end mal-practice insurers offer risk management assessments of your practice includ-ing in-office observations and recommendations, all for free. Alternativelymany offer self-assessment tools. Take advantage of these free services! 2. Review your malpractice insurance coverage with an experienced special- ist to make sure you are on \"high ground\" when the storm unfolds. Beware ofthe many offers from small, new , unrated insurance companies now offeringcoverage in Florida. Ask your broker to shop your coverage to a number ofrated insurers and remember that in this market cycle just before an upturnyou will see many offers that are too good to last. The few strong insurers havethe ability to withstand the upcoming market pressures because they are nothighly leveraged, are not offering actuarially unsound rates, and have a longterm not short term philosophy . Find those and you will be much better offwhen the high winds are pounding on your practice windows! 3. Create negotiating power: Many medical societies, networks, and hospi- tals have created malpractice insurance purchasing groups to give even small-er practices the negotiating power of larger ones. If you cannot find a suitablepurchasing group then consider creating one with your peers, now before themarket changes. Such groups are fairly simple to start, legal, and will help youweather the next cycle of sharply increasing malpractice rates. 4. Make sure that your asset protection plans are up to date and if you need to transfer assets around do so soon before many more claims get filed againstdoctors after the much predicted upcoming overturn of the 2003 caps on non-economic damages. We at Danna-Gracey are here to help if you need specific direction and rec- ommendations on any of these suggestions and would be honored to becomepart of your trusted team.

South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com February for insomnia, the Florida Office of Insur- ance Regulation's 2011 Annual Report of medicalmalpractice financial information is hard to beat. But it is chock full of great data. Issued October 1st,2011, it not only contains insurance data for Florida but compares that data to other States. One sentence thatwill draw the interest of physicians and surgeons is onpage 8: \"For each of the ten states with most medicalmalpractice premium earned in 2010, Florida's percentof earned premium paid on commissions (9.9%) was thehighest in this group.\" Yes, it's true; for selling medicalmalpractice insurance to physicians and surgeons, theinsurance agents and brokers in Florida receive thehighest commission in the entire United States: 9.9% ofthe premium. If you are a physician or surgeon with a significant claims history or an unusual clinical practice, then I recommend you retain an insurance broker to assist you through the maze of companies that will consider underwriting and providing expen-sive quotes for such difficult-to-place risks. But for the vast majority of physiciansand surgeons, the direct and indirect costs of the broker distribution system shouldbe factored into the formula used for buying insurance. If the services provided bythe broker are worth paying more, then utilize the broker. If not, then go direct.There are many companies who provide \"direct write\" services in lines of auto insur-ance, life insurance, homeowners insurance, and medical malpractice insurance. Even the federal health law now places broker fees and commissions within the cat- egory of \"administrative expenses\" (20% \"medical care andquality improvement\" (80% of premium). If administrative costs exceed 20% of pre-mium, then insurers have to give rebates to consumers. This demand for administra-tive efficiency in delivering the insurance product to the consumer is now present inall lines of insurance. The trend appears to be that consumers will increasingly go direct to the insurance company that has reduced premium based on reduced administrative expenses. Intoday's world of readily accessible information, the consumer is now able to purchasethe exact same insurance product from a \"direct write\" company that has financialstrength and stability , a team of insurance experts eager to be of service, and aggres-sive litigation defense - all at a significantly reduced premium.

Broward Health Receives $60,000 Grant From Health Foundation of South Florida Broward Health has been awarded a $60,000 grant from Health Foundation of South Florida (HFSF). The monies will be used to conduct a feasibility study on Broward Healthattaining the National Committee for Quality Assurance's patient centered medical homerecognition status. Achieving this status is critical to Broward Health's future in lieu of ongo-ing health care reform, much of which is increasingly based on patient centered medicalhome models. Patient centered medical homes organize care around patients, with medical staff work- ing in teams that coordinate and traffic care over time. Demonstration projects have shownthis model to provide higher quality care, with better outcomes and lower costs. To attain the recognition, an independent consultant will be hired to complete an inter- nal assessment of Broward Health's primary care centers. This study will include an analy-sis of Broward Health's current policies, procedures and practices, as well as an implemen-tation plan to move into the recognized status. The study and recommended implementa-tion are estimated to take two years and will be funded by the HFSF grant.

This extraordinary assembly of brilliance right here in South Florida includesmore than 2,000 health care professionals from 70 countries and six con-tinents who share their insights and experiences toward the goal of reliev-ing and eradicating pain. On its website, the WIP states that this Congress aims to advance the management of pain centers to a level of excellence and to implement theknowledge continuously provided by various pain associations. The WIP'smain goal - to better educate pain physicians for the 21st Century - is fur-thered by this Congress. Highlighting this remarkable conference are the cooperative efforts of the significant global pain societies, World Institute of Pain (WIP),European Federation of IASP Chapters (EFIC), the World Society of PainClinicians (WSPC) and the World Institute of Pain Foundation. Thesefour organizations have come together to sign a declaration for better pain treatment andpromoting pain medicine all over the world. It is a wonderful concept and the ideas and advancements in interventional pain man- agement, anesthesiology , physical therapy and rehabilitation, neurosurgery , orthopedicsand oncology will be shared so that patients everywhere will have the opportunity to feelbetter - and get better. The opening statement of the declaration asserts the following: It is the right of all mankind to have access to and the opportunity of the best possible pain relief in each and every part of the world. I am personally and professionally honored to be chairing the host committee for this outstanding group of distinguished physicians, researchers and professionals, and to bepart of this momentous occasion when the declaration is signed. The agenda for the Congress is once again replete with interesting seminars, symposia and presentations. Pioneers in their respective fields are bringing cutting-edge technol-ogy , advanced procedures and breakthroughs of medical science to this internationalgathering. The results promise to be important and inspiring.As a doctor for more than 20 years in South Florida, I have witnessed - and participated in - the evolution of pain management. I know firsthandthat experience and skills in technique can make a major difference in theoutcomes of procedures. I have seen patients who never believed that theywould be out of pain breathe a sigh of relief and claim a miracle has hap-pened. My experience is echoed all over the world, and I am thrilled toshare my perspective and to learn from my esteemed colleagues. This conference will give everyone in attendance information, insight and the path to providing patients with the most up-to-date care possible,as it has since the first World Congress in Eilat, Israel in 1998. Since thattime, we as a committed group of doctors dedicated to pain relief havetravelled to Istanbul, T urkey; Barcelona, Spain; Budapest, Hungary; andNew York, NY to learn with and from each other. It is a privilege to welcome the wide array of renowned physicians, spe- cialists and other individuals who have made combating pain a priority .This is the largest pain congress for practicing pain physicians. As with any major endeavor, it takes the unified and cooperative effort of many peo- ple to work together for a common goal. Each World Congress, and in particular thisone, with its Declaration, is making major strides to educate and inform the world aboutpain relief. The Declaration concludes with the following: T o promote this aim, the World Institute of Pain, the European Federation of IASP Chapters, the World Institute of Pain Foundation, and the World Society of Pain Clinicians and representatives of other world societies have united to make this declaration. With those words, the greatest minds in the field of pain management are changing the world. Dr. Ira Fox, founder of Anesthesia Pain Care Consultants, can be reached at (954) 720-3188.

Thismeans that a group with three EPs,could qualify for three distinct paymentswhich are paid over a five-year period. The Eligibility Process Eligibility is straightforward. The EP must: Select an electronic health record system from the list of Certified EHRTechnology . Decide for which incentives to apply . The Medicaid incentive paymentis based on a volume of at least 30%Medicaid patients, while the require-ment for the Medicare payment is con-tained in the volume requirements forthe core and other measures. Register with CMS and receive an ID number. Complete an attestation each year. Keep in mind that a distinct attestationmust be completed for each EP based onhis/her use of the system. However, the hand that giveth, also taketh away , so it's important to under-stand the requirements that constitute'Meaningful Use' and the attestationprocess that validates an EP's eligibilityfor payment. This is the point at whichsome of the clients we're coachingthrough the attestation process throwup their hands and say , \"Maybe I don'treally need the money .\" The obvious goal of this program is to ensure providers use the system to itsmaximum capabilities to deliver qualitycare. It's not unusual for a physician tomake the investment in an EHR andthen fail to devote the time to under-stand and adapt to the system. Theresult is a system that fails to deliver theefficiencies promised by the vendor. The Attestation Process An attestation is the means by which CMS ensures the system is implementedand used for key processes. The attesta-tion is also what triggers the payment. For the firstyear, the EP is required todemonstrate compliancewith 15 core measuresduring any 90-consecu-tive-day period. Some ofthe criteria are relativelysimple, such as recordingsmoking status and main-taining an active allergyand medication list.Others can be somewhattaxing, like providing aclinical summary topatients for 50% of alloffice visits within threebusiness days. But for themost part, the measures are doable once the provider overcomesany psychological barriers to the systemand realizes that the criteria will resultin better care. These criteria includeordering medications electronically andallowing the system to check for druginteractions. This process also requires meeting five Meaningful Use measures whichinclude at least one public health criteri-on. Some examples are the capability tosubmit electronic immunization andsyndromic surveillance data, as well asincorporating clinical lab test resultsinto the system as structured data. Thismeans that simply scanning in orimporting the lab report isn't sufficient.Providers need to key the actual valuesin a numeric or positive/negative formatso the data can be analyzed and aggre-gated. The burden for subsequent years is demonstrated use of the system for allrequired measures for the entire year,and not just one quarter. Obviously , it isexpected that once a provider enjoys thebenefits of an EHR, he or she will bemore apt to continue the trend. In summary , the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programremoves some of the obstacles to imple-menting this important technology bydefraying a portion of the costs and bycreating measurable goals that enhancepatient wellness and facilitate practiceefficiency . And if you haven't started the'Meaningful Use' process, the ship hasnot yet sailed on the incentive program.EPs have the balance of 2012 to securean EHR and begin using it to qualify forthe maximum payment. The Medicareincentive payments for 2013 and 2014are $39,000 and $24,000, respectively . Michelle A.

Gold Sponsor:___________________________ Award Presenting Sponsors:___________________________ Silver Sponsors:___________________________ of Merit: Institution/Program Youth Volunteer: Bio-Medical Healthcare delivery in the United States is on the path to transforma-tion through information. In our new world, we have access to data that canbe used to make decisions that improvethe quality of the care we deliver, addressthe health of our society from a populationhealth perspective, reduce medical errors;and integral to all is to analyze and drivewaste and overuse out of the system. Thisexciting time brings with it the promise oftransformation at the very heart of health-care delivery . Transformation is exciting, and our healthcare system has had a number ofbreak-throughs; however the system has acritical weak link at the core of its infra-structure. We need information - clinicalinformation that is centered on the patient- and we need to be able to analyze, under-stand, share and use that informationwherever the patient enters the system andfollow the patient wherever they go. One area where the portability of per- sonal health records could be improvedupon is what is currently happening withmedical CDs. Burning CDs for patientsoffers advantages such as easy transfer,greater storage capacity and lower cost.Although viewing a CD seems like a sim-ple matter, multiply that CD by hundreds or thousands of patients and the challengebecomes daunting. Fundamentally , a facil-ity has to determine whether it has theresources and technological capability toeven accept patient CDs. Understanding this situation and seek- ing improvements, the National Instituteof Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering(NIBIB) launched a project in 2009 todesign an Internet-based network forpatient-controlled sharing of medicalimages. They awarded the RadiologicalSociety of North America (RSNA) a $4.7million contract to execute the project.The goal would be to create a network tofacilitate access to imaging exams forpatients and physicians, potentially reduc-ing unnecessary examinations, minimiz-ing patient radiation exposure andenabling better informed medical deci-sions. The focus would be to move closerto a universal electronic health record(EHR) and help physicians meet federalmeaningful use requirements in practice.This past November during the RSNA 'sannual meeting medical image sharingfirm itMD has been selected to provide itspatient health record (PHR) system for theRSNA Image Share project. itMD is a software com- pany focused on cloudcomputing in order toeliminate the inefficienciessurrounding the transferof medical imaging. Bylimiting the use of outdat-ed media and improvingdata sharing practices, theitMD social platformempowers patients and physicians by pro-viding instant access to imaging records.The company aims to become the standardcommunications provider for the interac-tion between patients, physicians, andinstitutions, as well as the transaction plat-form for their relationships. itMD's emphasis has been in a technolo- gy which enables patients, especially thenewly diagnosed, through their challengeto make the necessary decisions to initiatethe best plan for their care. The challengeswith moving imaging studies from and tomultiple locations is a situation that mustbe improved. Using cloud computing, the goal of itMD is to enable the secure and on-demand exchange of medical imaginginformation from anywhere to anyone.Their mission is to deliver the most avail-able and relevant informa- tion to make the most cor-rect diagnosis. Collectingcopies of imaging recordsshould be a thing of the past,leaving patients free to spendevery minute with their doc- tor and medical team devel-oping the best course ofaction for their care, not waiting for CDs to arrive and then shep-herding them between different doctors. Patients should expect seamless net- work delivery of their medical images, infull diagnostic quality , delivered to anydoctor or imaging intensivists who mayneed them. Further, patients should beable to see their medical imaging data andreports, share them with their primary careor other referring physician, in a way thatmakes the primary report understandable,relevant and informative. Ultimately , increased access to one's own health record is coming closer on the hori-zon and itMD is driving this initiativethrough their image sharing solution.

Gabriel had been in foster care since the previous June after his mother was slumped in her car,surrounded by narcotics. The media reported thatGabriel had been prescribed several psychiatric drugslinked to potentially dangerous side effects, includingsuicide. Children being prescribed various psychiatricdrugs is not uncommon. In fact, Department ofChildren and Families' records show that among chil-dren aged 6-12 in state of Florida care, more than 22percent are prescribed psychiatric drugs. In a recentreport by the Government Accountability Office(GAO), it was found that in 2008 foster children cov-ered under Medicaid were prescribed psychotropicdrugs at higher rates than non-foster children.According to the GAO report, experts' opinions, and certain federal and state officials,this higher prescribing rate could be due in part to foster children's greater mental healthneeds and exposure to traumatic experiences as well as the challenges of coordinatingtheir medical care. However, psychiatric drug prescriptions to foster children were alsofound to be more likely to have potential health risks. Children in foster care enter the welfare system with serious health problems due to various factors, such as parental neglect and abuse, family substance use, and healthproblems associated with poverty (i.e., low birth weight, increased risk of lead poison-ing, malnutrition, etc.). Additionally , a significant percentage of North America's fosterchildren are younger than 1 year of age. Unfortunately , young children who have beenremoved from their biological families and placed in foster care are at significant risk forpoor developmental outcomes. Tracking the medical history of foster children has been a challenge. These children move frequently either due to changing foster parents or cycling in/out of the child wel-fare system as attempts are madeto unify them withtheir families. As aresult, the childrenuse and facili-ties and thereforemaintaining completemedical records is diffi-cult, at best. In addition tothe health implications for this vul- nerable population, there is also a tremendous burden onMedicaid spending. Medical costs for foster children are near-ly four times that of other children covered under Medicaid.Yet the vast majority of foster children do not receive minimal- ly adequate medical care or screening. In 1988, the lack of quality medical care and incomplete documentation of services provided was addressed by the Child Welfare League of America in collaboration withthe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). The group developed a comprehensivehealth care policy for children in 'out of home' care. One of the key aspects of this impor-tant policy paper is its advocacy for the use of a \"medical passport\" to document thehealth care problems and services delivered to children in 'out of home' care. Our Kids of Miami Dade and Monroe, the lead agency for Community-Based Care (1) in South Florida directly confronted this problem by creating a strategic vision to devel-op an electronic Medical Passport. In January 2010, this vision was presented to theFlorida Governor's Task Force on Child Welfare and key legislative staff. Our Kids joinedwith the Casey Family Programs and national experts on medical passports to learn fromtheir efforts. Our Kids conducted additional research (i.e., focus groups with doctors,nurses, foster parents, case managers, etc.) with the goal of developing a prototype elec-tronic Medical Passport. This prototype was patterned after a project called \"Follow MyHeart,\" an interactive electronic Personal Health Record system for patients and theirfamilies suffering from congenital heart failure. The prototyped electronic Medical Passport will be tested with 100 foster families, their doctors and case managers to determine its effectiveness on foster children's healthoutcomes. This pilot test was made possible with a recent $65,000 award by the SouthFlorida Health Foundation. Our Kids will engage a nurse case manager and independentevaluator to: 1) Measure changes in the foster children's clinical outcomes as identified in the AAP's Recommendations for Preventive Pediatric Health Care in comparison to a matched con-trol group, 2) Measure changes in health literacy of foster parents and older foster children, and 3) Review Health IT utilization.While Our Kids understands that the use of an electronic Medical Passport may not be able to save a child like Gabriel Meyers, they believe that with better coordinated care,our community's children may have a better chance of having (1) their medical needsmet, (2) appropriate interventions identified, and (3) improved health outcomes as com-pared than their peers across the United States.

Old Song, New Tune The technology that has been used by Credit Unions and the Banking Industry for years to immediately notify late mort-gage holders of their obligations is nowbeing successfully employed by Transworld Systems to remind patientsthat they have outstanding balances.Practices now can outsource first partyreminders. That means that practices cansend out a series of letters and reminderphone calls to slow paying patients in asystematic, diplomatic and thoroughfashion with the push of a button.Practices are finding this system is reduc-ing Accounts Receivables more quicklyand fewer accounts are requiring moreintensive collection measures. The state-of-the-art technology makes maximizing medical profits even easier!Practices will certainly appreciate main-taining control of their accounts and the24/7 access to their information. Theresult of outsourcing patient account fol-low-up has dramatically reduced medicalpractices' internal costs by minimizingstaff efforts. The system allows staff toconcentrate on growing the core busi-ness rather than chasing after unresolveddelinquent accounts. Furthermore,streamlining the collection process allows medical practices to submit largegroups of accounts instantly by upload-ing accounts in seconds using any stan-dard transfer format or Transworld'sinteractive software integration modules.

Collections are a particularly challeng- ing issue in today's trying economictimes, with patients often facing reducedincome and higher medical expenses. Astudy conducted by the Medical GroupManagement Association (MGMA) foundthat 30 percent of patients leave theirclinician's office without making any pay-ment, and that it takes practices an aver-age of 3.3 billing statements before apatient's outstanding balance is paid infull. The MGMA study also reports thatpractices wrote off an average of 11.3 per-cent of total accounts receivable in the2010 fiscal year. The use of an electronic check-in sys- tem called Phreesia is simplifying one ofhealthcare's most essential functions -gathering patient information. Phreesia ishelping clinicians nationwide improvetheir productivity , streamline workflowand increase cash flow. The system is alsoable to collect meaningful use data andadminister clinical scales. \"Our solution replaces the traditional clipboard with a wireless, touchscreeenkiosk called the PhreesiaPad, whichallows practices to effortlessly collectpatient information and consent, elec-tronically verify insurance and collectpayments at the point of care,\" saidNatasha Petrovic, channel manager forPhreesia, a leading patient check-in com-pany founded in 2005. \"More than 10,000 clinicians nation- wide are checking in a quarter of a millionpatients each month with a PhreesiaPad,\"Petrovic said. \"The use of Phreesia isgrowing among practices in SouthFlorida.\" Upon arrival at a healthcare facility , patients receive a PhreesiaPad and beginan automated 'electronic interview'. medicalhistory demographic and real-time insur-ance data. Electronic signatures are col-lected on all practice policies and HealthInsurance Portability and AccountabilityAct (HIPAA) contracts. Returningpatients verify , re-enter, theirinformation. Insurance coverage is verified automat- ically before each patient sees a clinician.Patients are prompted to pay their co-payand any open balances by swiping a majorcredit or debit card right on the Phreesiapad in the waiting room.\"Phreesia is a tool that increases and changes theculture of collections in a practice,\" Petrovic said. \"Often, practices are reluc-tant to enter into conversa-tions with patients about financial responsibility , and most do not pursue pay- ments aggressively ,\" she said. \"Phreesia's instant pay- ment maximizes revenuepotential and gives the patient an opportunity to pay privatelyand securely .\" Practices using Phreesia are seeing an average increase of 7-13 percent in collec-tions and saving about 5-10 minutes perpatient during each check-in. Patients arealso pleased with Phreesia - surveys showthat the service rates above 80 percent forease of use. Patient information is securely stored on Phreesia's secure servers and accessedonline through the practice's [Phreesia]dashboard. The Phreesia Dashboardallows Petrovic. a dedicatedtrainer and project manager for the firsteight weeks after going live. The practicereceives as many PhreesiaPads, routersand charger s as necessary to meet patient volume. We are 100 percent HIPAA andPayment Card Industry (PCI) compliant.\" To consistently develop and improve its service, Phreesia has ongoing relation-ships with prestigious medical and edu-cational institutions, and receives contin-uous feedback from its rapidly growingnetwork of medical practices. Many prac-tices across Florida have seen excellentresults with Phreesia. A Tampa skin andcancer center found that co-pay collec-tions have increased by over 50 percent,and the office staff no longer spends mul-tiple hours per week manually logging inthe day's transactions. \"Using technology such as Phreesia's combinedwith best practices for workflow , health-care facilities can streamline their opera-tions and focus more on patient care,\"said Petrovic. She noted that Phreesia adds value to the dollars many practices are spendingon merchant processing fees by providingan entire system designed for medicalpractices that will help automate proce-dures and increase collections. The exclusive payment processor for Phreesia is Elavon, a wholly owned sub-sidiary of U.S. Bancorp and a leadingglobal payments provider. Elavon pro-vides end-to-end payment processingservices to more than 1.2 million mer-chants in North America, Europe,Mexico and Brazil.

It's Better To Be Direct.South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com February 2012 19Many believe that 2012 is the transi- tion year from what we have done inthe past to EHR based medicine. Recently , Medical Economics published theresults of a survey performed by a healthcareresearch company , SK&A. After queryingalmost 40,000 practice locations they foundthat 72.6% of physicians offices aren't sure yetwhen they are going to adopt EHR technolo-gy . The survey , \"EHR Adoption in MedicalOffices Looking also identified thatalmost 21% of physicians were not evenaware of government financial incentives forEHR adoption. Not surprisingly , the larger thepractice the more likely they are to haveimplemented an EHR. As has been discussed in previous issues of South Florida Hospital News & Healthcare Report, a dichoto- my is beginning to develop between the larger singlespecialty practices, the hospital owned practices, andeveryone else. If this trend continues, it could havelong-term detrimental effects on the practice of medi-cine in our region. As we have seen with the recent deci-sion by CMS to grant a 3-month reprieve on compliancewith 5010 standards, the government moved the targetback due to the fact that change is not being accepted asquickly as anticipated even with over one year to imple-ment. Why has this happened, and why does it appearphysicians are not as receptive to EHR implementationas would have been expected? I think it all boils down to education. Physicians need to make the time to learn, and vendors need to make thetime to educate. If physicians under- stood the HITECH Act and how theycould receive compensation forimplementation of an EHR, morewould. If physicians understoodhow full implementation of theirEHR could make their practice lifeeasier, they would. The problem isthe smaller physician practice doesnot have enough time or does notmake enough time to learn aboutthings critical to their long-term suc-cess. The average physician does not care about whether software is serv-er based or cloud based. The average physician does not care about the \"APPS\" that might behelpful to them. The average physician needs informa-tion to make decisions and if it is provided to them, theywill. It is my opinion that a large percentage of the72.6% of physicians nationwide who are not sure whenthey are going to implement an EHR feel that waybecause they are lacking the basic knowledge uponwhich to make a decision. It is incumbent on our ven-dors to do more than a hard sell for their services whileputting down the competitor. Enhancing the knowledgebase of our physicians in the coming year will fuel theimplementation of the EHR and other technology .

With a shiftin the way medicalrecords are being keptplus a tendency for work-places to become evermore technologicallysophisticated, there aremany valid reasons tobecome proficient andeducated in this field now. Part of the U.S. govern- ment's American Recovery andReinvestment Act signed into law in2009 mandates that all medical recordsbe converted to an electronic format bythe end of 2014. The U.S. Bureau ofLabor Statistics projects that employ-ment within the field of medical recordsand health information technicians isexpected to grow much faster than aver-age and that job prospects will be verygood, with more than 200,000 total andmore than 35,000 new positions avail-able nationally by 2018. This representsan overall growth of 20%. According tothe BLS website, the yearly median wagefor a medical biller / coder is $30,610,with the highest 10% of professionals in the fieldearning more than$50,000 per year. Medical billers and coders work independent-ly and alongside physi-cians or within healthcareprovider networks. Theyare responsible for assem-bling, updating and main-taining patient medicalrecords, managing andensuring the accuracy ofhealthcare data and sub-mitting information thatprovides reimbursement and compensation for medical servicesrendered to patients. They can also spe-cialize in specific areas such as cancerregistry . For the squeamish, this field isone of the handful of healthcare-relatedjobs that do not involve the hands-ontreatment of patients, but still plays avital role in the patient's overall care.

BY ELIZABETH V . MARTINEZHEALTHCARE EDUCATION HEALTHCARE EDUCATION HEALTHCARE EDUCATIONSouth Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com February 2012 21BY MARTI ECHOLS, PH.D., M.ED. As we reflect on the different stages of our professional development,we can often identify people who had strong influences on who we are, ourapproach to our work, or how we presentourselves. The mechanism for facilitatingthis type of learning in the health profes-sions is often called mentoring. Mentoringsystems in medicine are well establishedand a very important component of profes-sionalism. Over the years, mentoring hasalso been part of the \"hidden curriculum\"in medical education. Much like other areas of medicine, men- toring is evolving within the profession.Previously , mentoring occurred sponta-neously between people with shared inter-ests, but now includes an organizationalrole as well as dedicated time andresources. The mentoring model at NovaSoutheastern University College ofOsteopathic Medicine (NSU-COM)reflects the new paradigm of mentoringwithin the profession. Therefore, whileencouraging spontaneous mentoring rela-tionships, the college provides more for-mal modes of mentoring as students men-tor students, faculty members mentor stu-dents, and faculty members mentor otherfaculty members. Students Mentoring Students The framework of academical societies is the organizational structure used atNSU-COM to provide mentoring within the student body . Since their inception fiveyears ago, the academical societies havecontinued to evolve. Each year, first-yearstudents apply to become peer mentors forthe incoming class members who replacethem as they matriculate into their secondyear. Three to four students in each socie-ty commit to become peer mentors anddedicate time to transition new studentsinto the college. Peer mentors also provide lecture reviews, course notes, smiles, support,food, and fun. The class of 2014 mentorsenhanced the academic support of newstudents with the formation of organizedSunday Study Tables for biochemistry ,physiology , and anatomy . In addition, peertutors were on hand to answer questions,monitor study groups, or just provide aquiet structure for daily study . The peermentors also recruit and serve as tutors for the first-year classand provide a critical compo-nent to our course evaluationprocess. Faculty Mentoring Students Each academical society has an identified academic leader, inaddition to other faculty mem-bers who provide academicguidance to students withintheir society . Academic leadersreceive training in areas such as learning styles and academic resourcesavailable through the college, the HealthProfessions Division, and the university .They learn techniques to assist with studyskills and time management and help stu-dents cope with the stress of being medicalstudents. Academic leaders dedicate time each semester to reach out to students that maybe experiencing challenges and offer guid-ance to them. Since the inception of thisvenue, students have shared their appreci-ation for the confidential hand of guidancefrom faculty members, who enjoy connect-ing with students early and watching themblossom into confident medical students. Faculty Mentoring Faculty Perhaps the ideal type of a mentoring program is one which happens by chance.However, we cannot always count onstumbling into one of those relationships. Therefore, while encouraging spontaneousmentoring relationships, the college pro-vides more formal modes of faculty men-toring. Each new faculty member isassigned a department mentor by thedepartment's chair, but also has the oppor-tunity to be matched with a college men-tor, whose intention is to help new facultymembers adjust to their new environment. The college's mentor program, which began in 2010, has become a bridgebetween the senior and junior faculty .Three times each year, mentors andmentees fellowship together as they learnabout the history of the college, academicmedicine, the peer review process, gover-nance and structure of osteopathic medi-cine, and networking skills. From the traditional model of mentor- ing, NSU-COM continues to evolve as wemeet the needs of students, alumni, facul-ty members, and the community . The aca-demical society structure has become ahome for expanding mentoring and con-nections among students. With input andguidance from everyone involved, we willcontinue to evolve and serve for manygenerations to come as we value the pastand build the future.

Countries such as Bangladesh, Peru, and Argentina have been added to the list of nations that already receive medical outreach from NSU's College of Osteopathic Medicine (COM). Those nationsinclude Jamaica, Ecuador, and the Dominican Republic. During four recent medical outreach endeavors in December, second-year medical students took time off from their winter vacations to travel abroad to rural and medically underserved communi-ties in Peru, Argentina, Bangladesh, and Jamaica to provide medical services such as physicals, can-cer screenings, and other medical examinations. Many of these medically underserved patients from poor, rural communities have never seen a physician before and suffer from illnesses such as tuberculosis, scabies, malnutrition, hypertension,and diabetes. The students, supervised by the college's medical faculty and local physicians, bringmedical supplies and provide health and wellness lessons to help patients live healthier lives. In addition to volunteering their vacation time, participating students pay up to $2,000 for their travel expenses. The COM international medical outreach programs will continue this spring with atrip to Ecuador and a summer trip to Jamaica.FAU Science Eminent Scholar Elected as a 2012 Fellow of the Society of Experimental Psychologists Scott Kelso, Ph.D., Glenwood and Martha Creech Eminent Scholar Chair in Science and founder of the Charles E.

Throughout the year,health seminars and screenings will be offered at the Fred Lippman Multi- Purpose Center at 2030 Polk Street.ICD-10 training and education represents approximate- ly 30% to 40% of your entire ICD-10 transition. It istruly the most significant portion of being ready for ICD-10. When selecting a vendor to provide your ICD-10 train- ing, consider the following important qualifying factors: Seek training from those who you know are skilled and effective at being educators and presenters. Lots of peopleknow how to code, but how many can actually teach whatthey know to others? Use an organization which not onlyhas an expertise in coding but also understands the educa-tion arena and understands how to accomplish learningobjectives. Make sure the entity providing the training is capable of preparing your coders for certification and your cliniciansin clinical documentation. They should also offer continuing education beyond the ICD- 10 transition to help keep your coders certified. Don't hesitate to view a demonstration of the course and to ask for the review of their curriculum. Ensure that the course is taught at the appropriate level for you. Because ICD-10 is new to everyone, I recommend starting with something very fundamental. This includes eventhose who may have many years of ICD-9-CM experience; it will be somewhat like learn-ing a different system. Expand to more complex and comprehensive training in the 16-18 months prior to the implementation date. Remember; take baby steps so that the tran-sition isn't so overwhelming! A few on-line training programs give the student the abili-ty to test out of certain topics if they can show mastery , thus not having to take a classthey already have an expertise in. With ICD-10, most people will need to take all class-es, but it is good to have this option. Focus training based on your needs. If you are a professional services coder (e.g., CPC) you only need to learn ICD-10-CM unless you plan on also being an inpatient facility coder. Explore training mediums and options that best fit your organizational needs. Inmost cases, online training should be themajority of your strategy for trainingcoders as there are so many to train and itis the most cost effective way to reacheveryone. Some may learn best in a liveclass, while others may fare better via awebinar, specifically physicians, may prefermore of a hybrid approach with a combina-tion of the above. There are some very good on-line train- ing programs. When choosing one, youshould make sure that is very interactive.There are only handfuls that offer actualinteraction with professors and give thestudent an ability to ask questions and havelectures different than what they are read-ing on-line. Also, make sure the training isperformance based and there is testingalong the way . Finally , make sure that theprogram selected for ICD-10 training canprovide regular reports on the progress ofthose being trained. It is critical to be ableto track the progress of coders, physiciansand others as they go through their ICD-10training. There are many things to consider as we move closer to October 1, 2013 and contin-ue to tackle the items on your ICD-10-CM/PCS training checklist. The key pointsI highlighted above is certainly not an all-inclusive-list but is a good guide. A fairnumber of people have asked me latelywhether there is only one place to learnICD-10-CM/PCS, and I wanted everyone toknow you have alternatives just like you donow for education on CPT/HCPCS II andICD-9-CM.

E-mail your News Items to sflahospitalnews @aol.comCritical Selection Criteria for Your ICD-10 T raining BY IRA SHAPIROHEALTHCARE EDUCATION HEALTHCARE EDUCATION HEALTHCARE EDUCATIONThe Ed.D. in Nursing Education at Nova Southeastern University'sFischler School of Education gives nursing professionals multiple vocationaloptions. Career nurses with a doctor ineducation may enter the teaching field,but they may also find careers in healthadministration, clinical research, oradvanced clinical practice. They maysecure lucrative opportunities as consult-ants; they may become managers of nurs-ing infrastructure at large hospitals; orthey may become researchers, helping toformulate solutions to the larger questionsof health-care policy at national and inter-national levels. To be sure, the utility and versatility of the degree is not in question, nor is itsvalue underestimated. Salaries for mostnurses possessing this advanced level ofeducation begin at around $50,000 forfaculty at the Assistant Professor level, andrise as high as $200,000 for nursing exec-utives at the larger medical center com-plexes of universities and city hospitals. All of the above may be incentive enough for those in the profession to pur-sue a doctoral degree in nursing educa-tion, yet here's another: the country is indire need. According to Wanted Analytics,in May of 2011, new job ads for registerednurses exceeded 121,000, an increase of46% from the same period in 2010; inApril of 2011, the U.S. Bureau of LaborStatistics announced that\u2014in spite of therecent recession\u2014the healthcare sector ofthe economy continued to grow , adding37,000 jobs in March of 2011, many ofwhich were for RNs; in October of 2010,the Robert Wood Johnson Foundationand the Institute of Medicine announcedthat\u2014in order to keep pace with thehealth demands of an aging population\u2014the number of nurses with baccalaureatedegrees would need to rise by 80%, andthe population of nurses with doctoraldegrees would need to double. No one disputes that the incipient nurs- ing shortage is a looming health care cri-sis, though there is widespread disagree-ment on a viable solution. Certainly ,increasing the numbers of nursing educa-tors is an integral component to anyapproach, especially since a leading factorin the rejection of qualified applicants to nursing programs is insufficient universi-ty faculty . The American Association ofColleges of Nursing confirms: \"U.S. nurs-ing schools turned away 67,563 qualifiedapplicants from baccalaureate and gradu-ate nursing programs in 2010 due to aninsufficient number of faculty , clinicalsites, classroom space, constraints.\" The Fischler School of Education's Ed.D. in Nursing Education offsets someof this deficiency . Like all of Fischler's programs, the Ed.D. in Nursing Education offers a flexi-ble and versatile path to obtaining a doc-toral degree. The 18 hours of courseworkfor the concentration in NursingEducation can be taken online or in ablended format \u2014\"online courses allowstudents to interact in a virtual classroom,while blended programs combine on-siteand online instruction ... on-site coursesare offered periodically over weekendsand supplemented with online study .\" This kind of flexibility has broad appeal for nursing professionals who desire toenhance their education - whether theyintend to explore new avenues inresearch, consultancy , or teaching, orwhether they simply wish to expand theirclinical repertoire as they continue towork as an R.N. Irrespective of the career objectives of prospective applicants, the Doctor ofEducation in Nursing at the FischlerSchool will provide students with anenhanced skill set in a crucial professionwhose ranks are diminishing just whentheir services are needed most. By increas-ing the numbers of qualified faculty toinstruct the next generation of RegisteredNurses, the Ed.D. in Nursing Education atthe Fischler School helps to solve thisgrowing crisis.

From the invention of the X-Ray machine to thedevelopment of MRI andCT scanning, physiciansaround the world have beenable to take advantage oftechnology to identify andtreat many ailments thatafflict millions of people. Until now , medical imag- ing was limited by the \"afterthe fact\" findings, where thedisease process was already establishedand was affecting the individual. Takefor example the coronary angiogram, orcardiac catheterization. Both are greattechnologies, but useful to treat estab-lished coronary artery disease. Over the past few decades, advance- ments in imaging technology are allow-ing doctors to now identify early diseaseprocesses, before they afflict individuals.T wo examples include the CoronaryArtery Calcium (CAC) Scan and theCarotid Intima-Media Thickness test. The former, a simple CT scan of the heart, is non-invasive and takes about 10minutes to complete. In the appropriatepopulation, that which is pre-identified by yourphysician as having amoderate risk of incurringcardiovascular disease,this simple test can be alife saver. It measures anyamount of calcification, ifpresent, in your heartarteries. Depending on theamount of calcium found,your risk for a future heartattack can be derived. Ascore of 0 is desirable asyour risk is negligible,while a score greater than 100 implies a higher risk. Anyone with ascore of 400 or more will require furthertesting as the risk is the greatest. CAC testing allows your physician to institute therapy that can prevent a heartattack and that under traditional moni-toring, may not be given. There are plen-ty of clinical studies published demon-strating that a coronary artery calciumscan is of great advantage in predictingheart attacks, over simple modalities likecholesterol tests. The CAC test is highlyrecommended. Carotid Intima-Media Thickness (CIMT) is an ultrasound test that meas-ures the thickness of a layer of thecarotid arteries (in your neck). In this test, a technician will image a section ofthe carotid arteries. These are the mainconduits of blood flow to your brain.The test looks for any increase in thick-ness of 2 layers of this artery , the mediaand intima. Increase in thickness impliesthat there is significant build-up ofplaque not only in the carotid artery butin the arteries that provide blood flow tothe heart or the coronary arteries. Thetest takes approximately 15 minutes tocomplete and can be done in a physi-cian's office. Both tests are recommended in men over age 45 and women over 55. If there is a strong family history of heart attacks and/or strokes, or if youhave other risk factors like obesity , dia-betes, or are a smoker, then it is recom-mended at age 40 and 50 respectively . In summary , CAC and CIMT are proven imaging technologies that canpredict and detect early cardiovasculardisease, a process that can save your life.

Medical care the way it should be.Florida Heart Research Institute (FHRI) has joined forces withMiami-Dade County Mayor Carolos Gimenez and six local Miami-Dade County Fire Departments to helpsave lives from sudden cardiac arrest in apublic awareness campaign that launch-es February 6th in conjunction with StopHeart Disease Week issued by proclama-tion from Governor Rick Scott in aneffort to encourage Floridians to becomemore proactive in the fight against sud-den cardiac arrest and heart disease. The PUSHCPR\u00ae campaign empha- sizes the need to act quickly by calling911 and starting CPR when witnessingor finding someone who has collapsedand is not responding and not breathingnormally . Nearly 300,000 lives are losteach year due to sudden cardiac arrest -most without any warning. \"FHRI hasjoined forces with Mayor Gimenez andour local Miami-Dade County FireDepartments to let the public know thatwe need their help to save lives andincrease survival rates of sudden cardiacarrest in our community\", imploresFHRI's Chief Executive Officer, KathleenDuCasse. Since victims of sudden car-diac arrest are already clinically dead, itis the quick actions of bystanders thatincrease the chances of survival. MayorGimenez and local Miami-Dade CountyFire Chiefs demonstrate the simplicity ofPUSHCPR\u00ae in the English and Spanishpublic service announcements. The 30second videos explain that no longer ismouth to mouth contact required, justpush hard and fast in the center of thechest until help arrives. Florida law pro-tects Good Samaritans from any liability .Communities that promote the use ofthis simple technique have proven toincrease survival rates of sudden cardiacarrest from seven percent to nearly fifty percent. The public service announce-ments will be aired on municipal TV sta-tions throughout February . In addition, Stop Heart Disease Week is a reminder to all Floridians to \"KnowYour Numbers\" for blood pressure, cho-lesterol and glucose. Abnormal clinicalvalues are often a precursor to heart dis-ease, our Nation's leading cause of deathand disability . FHRI encourages allFloridians to adopt a healthy lifestylethat includes a diet rich in fresh fruitsand vegetables, lean meats, whole grainsand low sugar along with daily physicalactivity in order to reduce the risk factorsfor heart disease. \"We encourage allFloridians to take the time to getscreened and find out if they're at risk,\"says FHRI's Chief Executive Officer,Kathleen DuCasse. \"Heart disease is nota death sentence - it can be prevented,stopped and even reversed when theproper corrective steps are taken.\" The campaigns are funded by the Stop Heart Disease license plate which sup-ports heart disease research, educationand prevention programs throughout thestate of Florida. In Florida, there will bemore than 50,000 deaths per year fromcardiovascular disease, and hospitaliza-tion costs to care for Floridians withheart disease will top $18.6 billion thisyear.

Dr.Gellman is a Diplomate of the AmericanBoard of Medicine in Advanced HeartFailure - the first physician in BrowardCounty and one of the first in Florida toachieve this.Early diagnosis and treatment (adher- ence to medication therapies, reducingsalt in the diet and getting daily physicalexercise) can improve quality of life andlife expectancy for people who haveheart failure. BHIPMC created an inter-disciplinary team to provide self-man-agement training for patients living withheart failure. The team developed a care manage- ment tool that ensures patients have fol-low-up arrangements for their care priorto discharge. This includes access tomedications and resources they need inorder to focus on maintaining a normalquality of life. Post discharge, patients are contacted by BHIPMC two to three days later, andthen again three to four weeks later tomake sure they have seen a health carepractitioner and are keeping up withnutritional and exercise plans, as well asvaccinations. \"We now have a team in place to take care of patients' specific needs and pro-mote a self management approach totheir condition. The program ensures that the right disciplines are involvedearly in the patient's treatment plan andfollow up care after discharge,\" said Dr.Cioci. \"If a patient or loved one is edu-cated on their condition, it empowersthem to ask questions so they are deter-mined to take on a healthier lifestyle.\" BHIPMC holds a heart failure educa- tion/support group on the 2nd T uesdayof each month at 11:30 a.m. For more information, call (954) 940-7064.

Our affiliation with the University of Heidelberg will bring a new lineof knowledge in clinical medicine and broaden our perspective about new develop-ments in patient care,\" Barry T. Katzen, M.D., founder and medical director of theInstitute, said. The relationship will benefit South Florida patients, who will have access to the most advanced treatments available for cardiac and vascular systems performed byheart surgeons, interventional radiologists and vascular surgeons. \"In our regulatory environment, it takes three to four years for innovations to be approved here. Our doctors, by traveling to Heidelberg, will already have beeninvolved in early-stage technology . As a byproduct of this partnership, over time itwill have significant implications in patient care,\" Dr. Katzen said. Both organizations are internationally renowned as groundbreakers in cardiovascu- lar care, involved in dozens of clinical trials and sophisticated diagnostic, treatmentand rehabilitation services. In addition, they share a goal of searching for the leastinvasive treatments, particularly important for an aging population that isn't alwayseligible for traditional surgery due to high risk factors. Teams of interventional radi-ologists, clinical and interventional cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, vascularsurgeons, electrophysiologists, and neuroradiologists work together to provide aspectrum of care ranging from wellness to the most complex endovascular and opensurgical procedures for heart and circulatory problems.Broward Health North Broward Medical Center (BHNBMC) is offering interven-tional cardiology services in its cardiac catheterization lab to treat patients whoare having heart attacks. Interventional cardiology allows physicians to diag- nose blockages to blood vessels in the heart, and also open those vessels that posecritical and potentially life threatening risks. The addition of interventional cardiology means that local residents suffering heart attacks can now be transported by ambulance directly to BHNBMC. Prior to the avail-ability of interventional cardiology at BHNBMC, patients being transported by EMSwould have to bypass BHNBMC and travel a greater distance.

South Florida Hospital News southfloridahospitalnews.com February 2012 35Cardiology FOCUS BY JANICE MEADOWS The Frances Langford Heart Center at Martin Health System had plen-ty to celebrate in 2011. In August, the heart center commem- orated its fifth anniversary with a heart-screening and educational session host-ed by cardiovascular surgeons MichaelCrouch, MD, and James Thornton, MD. Then in November the heart center received another reason to celebrate,when Martin Medical Center was namedone of the nation's 50 TopCardiovascular Hospitals in an annualstudy by Thomson Reuters. It was thesecond consecutive year Martin Healthwas recognized as a 50 TopCardiovascular Hospitals winner andwas one of just two hospitals fromFlorida. Martin Medical Center was alsonamed one of the nation's 65 Hospitalswith Great Cardiology Programs byBecker's Hospital Review. Selected from more than 1,000 hospi- tals across the United States, winners ofthe prestigious 50 Top CardiovascularHospitals award provide \"top-notch car-diovascular care\" according to resultsfrom an exhaustive analysis. For all of us who provide care at the heart center, it was recognition of ourmission to provide the communities weserve with the best possible cardiovascu-lar care. We have an incredible team ofphysicians and clinical staff, who com-bine skill, professionalism and compas-sion to provide exceptional cardiovascu-lar care to residents of the TreasureCoast. Martin Health partners with cardiolo- gists at Cardiology Associates of Stuart,Stuart Cardiology Group and FloridaHeart Center, as well as the Ocala Heart Institute for open-heart surgeries. That partnership is paying off for resi- dents of the Treasure Coast. Lives havebeen saved, health has been improvedand members of our community haveincreased peace of mind knowing thatquality cardiovascular care is availableclose to home. The Thomson Reuters 50 Top Cardiovascular Hospitals study showsthat 97 percent of cardiovascular inpa-tients in U.S. hospitals survive andapproximately 96 percent remain com-plication-free, reflecting improved car-diovascular care across-the-board overthe past year. The 50 Top Hospitals' per-formance surpasses these high-watermarks as indicated by: Better risk-adjusted survival rates Lower complications Fewer patients readmitted to the hospital after 30 days Shorter hospital visits and lower costs Increased use of internal mammary artery (IMA) for coronary artery bypasssurgeries However, despite the recognition the Frances Langford Heart Center hasreceived in recent years, we are constant-ly seeking ways to improve throughindustry best practices, training for clin-ical staff and utilizing sophisticated tech-nology . It has been an exciting five yearsat the Frances Langford Heart Center.But we are looking forward to evengreater things in the years to come.

Worldwide, approximate-ly 300,000 people have been diagnosed with this condition (100,000 in the U.S.),which occurs when the heart's aortic valve is narrowed, restricting blood flow fromthe heart to the body . Approximately one-third of these patients are deemed at toohigh a risk for open-heart surgery as the condition typically affects an older demo-graphic and develops in individuals between the ages of 50 and 70. The MedtronicCoreValve Clinical Trial will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the CoreValveTranscatheter Aortic Valve System in these groups of patients. \"The procedure we are evaluating does not require open-heart surgery or surgical removal of the native valve,\" said Dr. Beohar, Director of the Cardiac CatheterizationLaboratory at the Mount Sinai Heart Institute. \"This potential treatment option isespecially desirable because so many patients with aortic stenosis are not able to with-stand surgery .\" The Medtronic CoreValve System is a new technology designed to replace a dis- eased aortic heart valve percutaneously - meaning through the skin - without openheart surgery and without surgical removal of the diseased valve. The new valvereplacement procedure channels a catheter (thin tube) with a prosthetic valvethrough the femoral artery to reach the heart. The CoreValve System is designed withself-expandable technology , deploying the new valve inside the diseased aortic valvewithout open-heart surgery or surgical removal of the native valve. Outside the U.S.,CoreValve received CE (Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne) Mark in Europe in 2007. Mount Sinai Medical Center is currently enrolling patients in the trial.

You will probablybe asked not to eat or drink anything after mid-night. \"Before the procedure, check with your doc-tor if you are taking any medications, especiallyblood-thinning or antiplatelet prescriptions,\" reminds Dr. Carida. In the catheteriza-tion laboratory , or cath lab, you will lie on an examination table and electrodes (smallmetal disks), which are attached by wires to an electrocardiogram machine, will beplaced on your chest to monitor heart rhythm during the test. You will be given asedative before the cardiac catheterization to help you relax but will remain awakeduring the 30- to 60-minute procedure. The area where the catheter is inserted isnumbed and a small incision is made into a blood vessel usually in the arm or upperthigh. Special X-rays are taken as the catheter and guide wire are gently threaded to the proper place in the heart to perform necessary tests or treatments. You may feel somediscomfort at the incision site or from having to remain still for an extended periodof time. A special dye may be administered through the catheter to allow your doctorto see how well your heart is pumping. Your doctor also could use the catheter to takeblood samples from different areas of the heart or to perform minor heart surgery . Ifthere are blockages in the arteries, your doctor may perform an angioplasty toimprove blood flow. After the procedure is finished, the catheter is removed and theincision site is closed and bandaged. Usually you can return home the same day asthe procedure. You may feel some tenderness or soreness for about a week. \"Cardiac catheterizations are performed frequently and rarely cause serious prob- lems or complications,\" concludes Dr. Carida. For more information, contact Delray Medical Center at 561-498-4440. Dr. Robert CaridaDiagnosing Heart Diseases: T ests that Get to the Heart of the Matter Heart disease is a big deal. For many of us, it's the No. 1 threat to our health. So if yourdoctor thinks you're at risk for the disease- or that you already have it - chances are you'regoing to undergo some testing, which will helpdetermine if you need treatment. \"There is no one test to determine whether or not you have heart disease,\" says Rahul Aggarwal,M.D., interventional cardiologist at Palm BeachGardens Medical Center. In order to get a completepicture of your heart's health, your doctor mightwant you to have two or more tests. Most of the tests for diagnosing and evaluating heart disease are painless. In fact, many of themdon't require even a needle stick in your arm. Buteach one you undergo is like a puzzle piece, givingyour doctor more information to guide your treat-ment. Here are some common tests used to diagnose heart disease, followed by a brief description of how and why each test is done. The information comes from severalgroups, including the American Heart Association (AHA); the National Heart, Lung,and Blood Institute; and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Your doctor is your best resource in what can be a scary or confusing time,\" Dr. Aggarwal says. Each step of the way , you can ask him or her questions about the ben-efits and risks any test holds for you. Noninvasive tests are those that don't require putting needles, dyes, tubes, or other materials into your body , notes the AHA. Some frequently used ones include: Chest x-ray: A chest x-ray can give your doctor a look at your heart, lungs and bones. It can't actually see inside your heart but it can show its shape and size. An x-ray also can show if your lungs are filling with fluid from a heart attack. Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG): An ECG can show three major electrical sig- nals-or waves- produced by your heart, says the AHA. Each wave represents a differ-ent part of you heartbeat. Some information you doctor can glean includes: Anabnormal heart rhythm, evidence of a heart attack, enlargement of the heart muscle,and problems with blood flow to the heart. Stress test (exercise ECG): A stress ECG tells your doctor how your heart han- dles workloads. \"It helps us learn the cause of your chest pain, see what your risk forhaving a heart attack is and help you plan an effective yet safe fitness plan,\" Dr.Aggarwal says. Echocardiography: Your doctor is able to see your heart's size and shape, plus how well blood pumps through it with every beat. The test can reveal problems withheart valves and whether part of your heart muscle is weak. As for invasive tests, some require only a quick needle stick. Others - like trans- esophageal echocardiography - use special probes and can take a half-hour or more.Examples of invasive tests include: Thallium stress tests (myocardial perfusion imaging): The thallium test measures the blood supply to different parts of your heart. If an area isn't getting enough blood,that can indicate atherosclerosis-narrowing of the arteries due to fatty plaquebuildup. Cardiac catheterization: Catheterization is one of the most valuable tests for diagnosing heart disease, says the AHA. It lets your doctor measure blood pressureor take blood samples within the heart itself. It can find blockages in the arteries. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE): Similar to noninvasive echocardiog- raphy , this test offers a detailed look at your heart's structure and function.

At St.Mary's, the multidisci-plinary team is here tomeet every need ofeach patient as well ashis or her family mem-bers, no matter whatage or disease stage thechild is in. \"Our Pediatric Cardiovascular SurgeryProgram utilizes experienced pediatricspecialists including surgeons, cardiolo-gists, anesthesiologists and intensivists,\"says Linda Rankin, BS, of PediatricServices at St. Mary's. \"The operatingroom staff and Pediatric Intensive Carenursing staff are highly trained to offerpatients the maximum level of care.\" The Children's Hospital at St. Mary's also features a new operating room andcatheterization laboratory to ensurepatients have access to the mostadvanced care. \"No matter what a patient'sneeds, we are here forthem,\" says Rankin.\"The Children'sHospital at St. Mary'scan provide extensivepediatric specialty to the children ofSouth Florida andbeyond.\" Nearly one in100 babies in the UnitedStates is born with acongenital heart defect,according to theChildren's Health Foundation. To support babies in need of care for congenitalheart conditions, the Children's Hospitalat St. Mary's now offers pediatric cardio-vascular surgery . In September, the Pediatric Cardiovascular Surgery Program wel-comed the arrival of Michael D. Black,M.D., MBA, Medical Director of thePediatric and Congenital Open HeartProgram at the Children's Hospital at St.Mary's. Dr. Black brings 20 years of sur-gical expertise to St. Mary's and was atthe forefront of the development of theminimally invasive surgical techniquesand technology cardiovascular surgeons use today . \"By making smaller incisions,patients experience less tissue trauma,\"says Dr. Black. \"Other techniques that do not divide the breast bone - a practice typically per-formed in traditional cardiac procedures- also reduce infection rates while allow-ing patients to grow up with minimalscarring so they can live a more normallife.\" Once surgery is complete, childrencan return home after just a few days.\"T ypically , newborns may need toremain in the hospital for observationfor a week,\" says Dr. Black. \"However,most children can return home to theirfamilies within days.\" Thanks to advanced surgical tech- niques, there are currently 2 millionpeople living normal lives with congen-ital heart defects in America, accordingto the Children's Heart Foundation.While high-tech approaches and a mul-tidisciplinary medical team are availableto ensure all patients' medical needs aremet, the most important part of thePediatric Cardiovascular SurgeryProgram is providing patients and theirloved ones with the support theyneed.\"My main goal is to ease parents'minds,\" says Dr. Black. \"Any questionsor concerns they may have, I am here to answer. I make a point to stay overnightat the hospital when a patient hasundergone surgery to ensure I can dowhatever possible to make the child andparents feel comfortable.\" Dr. Black is working to make the Cardiovascular Surgery Program at theChildren's Hospital at St. Mary's one ofthe most innovative programs inFlorida. In addition to children, Dr.Black specializes in the treatment ofadults with congenital heart disease.This provides all patients with congeni-tal heart disease continuity of carethroughout their lifetime at St. Mary'sMedical Center. \"When parents find outtheir child needs to undergo surgery , itcan be an overwhelming experience,\"says Dr. Black.\"Now , for residents in theGreater Palm Beach area, we can offerservices without the need to travel. It'smy goal to offer a surgical solution thatwill last a lifetime so children with con-genital heart defects can live long, happylives.\" For more information about the Pediatric Cardiovascular Program, visit www.stmaryschildrensmc.com. T aking Care of the Tiniest Hearts: High-tech Approach with a Human T ouch Dr. Michael D. Black It would perhaps not be fair or even appropriate for a prestigious researchinstitute such as FHRI to minimize thecomplexity of heart disease and the mul-titude of treatments, both establishedand emerging. In fact, a frequent visitorto the internet will be confused at best.For years physicians sung the anticipat-ed benefits of hormonal replacement inpost-menopausal women. Coronaryheart disease is uncommon in women ofchildbearing age; incidence acceleratesrapidly thereafter, surpassing that inmen at around age 65. It thereforeseemed obvious that hormonal replace-ment would lower the risk. In fact, labo-ratory studies documented the favorableeffect of estrogen on platelet and otherkey functions. All was well until the mat-ter was actually studied, and it was dis-covered that such therapy actuallyincreased the risk of thrombotic events(stroke and deep venous without coronary artery disease.Elevated homocysteine levels were clear-ly associated with increased risk of disease. Folate successfully lowers homocysteine levels. Ergo, folate shouldlower the risk of coronary disease in peo-ple with elevated levels of homocysteine.Reasonable, but, once studied, wrong.Multiple studies demonstrated the suc-cess of folate in lowering homocysteinelevels and doing absolutely nothing tolower the risk of coronary events. CRP isa serum marker of inflammation whichis also associated with increased risk ofcoronary disease. Therefore, anti-inflam-matory vitamins such as C and E shouldlower the incidence of coronary events.Reasonable again, and, once again, oncestudied, false. More recently , epidemio-logic evidence suggests that those peoplewho have high calcium in their diet mayhave a reduced risk of coronary disease.However, studies which supplement cal-cium found ... found ... (yes, by nowyou must have guessed it) an increasedincidence of coronary events. Vitamin Dis the \"vitamin of the 21st century .\"Once felt to be solely involved in calci-um metabolism, this vitamin is found tohave receptors throughout the bodywhich may be involved in multiple criti-cal cellular events. Multiple epidemio- logic studies have found that low serumlevels of Vitamin D seem to be associat-ed with multiple disease processes,including cardiovascular disease. Andthe data on supplementation? - some-what preliminary , but so far not so prom-ising. Obviously the situation in medicine is always somewhat more complex thanlogic would seem to dictate. A carbohy-drate-based extreme low fat diet (such asthe Ornish diet) and an intelligent fatand low carbohydrate diet (such as theSouth Beach diet) both seem to be pro-tective against cardiac events. Caffeine asa stimulant would seem to be dangerousfor the heart, yet coffee is, if anythingmore protective than harmful to theheart. Theoretically , if there were anyform of alcohol that should be beneficialto the heart, it should be red wine; butno one has every convincingly demon-strated that red wine (or any wine) ismore protective in moderate quantitiesthan any other form of equivalentamounts of alcohol. It would seem thatlogic has no chance when it comes tomedicine. However, even though reason must always surrender to evidence, there arecertain rational thoughts that it might behelpful for our hearts to consider thismonth. A body that ingests more caloriesthan it consumes will necessarily storethem as fat. A body that does not exer-cise is removing one of the major intrin-sic homeostatic mechanisms for health.A body that ingests cigarette smoke, orany other toxin, on a regular basis is poi-soning itself. A body that engages inexcess is likely to lose its internal bal-ance. A person that focuses on fear,anger and/or depression is unlikely todevelop nurturing relationships. For allthe rest, leave it to the researchers, andwe'll keep you posted as the storiesunfold.

He has14 teeth, eleven have cavities and the two front teeth are missing, rotted out, most likely from being put to bed since infancy with a bottle. He needs two implants notcovered by Medicaid. I am transfixed by the missing front teeth of the four year-old,and I can't help thinking ...does he ever smile? Given his family's economic circum-stances and the high cost of implants, it seems a possibility that his two front teethwill not be replaced in his lifetime without intervention. I wonder if I am witnessingthe most defining crossroads in this child's life, and it is occurring at the age of 4.Theother photo in my office is of a 7-year-old girl crying from pain. She needs six rootcanals. In 2011, KID opened a 12 chair pediatric dental clinic in a 1500 square-foot office building at our Wilton Manors campus. We brought in students, residents and facul-ty from Nova Southeastern University's College of Dental Medicine to provide dentalservices to the children. Generous seed money from donors such as HealthFoundation of South Florida, helped with the expense of setting up a large-scale char-itable dental clinic. The model is unique for using a social services agency to providehealth services to the vulnerable in collaboration with a university academic program.The program's objective is to provide affordable dental care to any child in SouthFlorida, including the tens of thousands of impoverished children living in BrowardCounty who find it difficult to access a dentist. National Statistics rank Florida thelowest in the nation for children accessing dental care. With that sobering thought in mind, we continue to encounter tremendous unfore- seen challenges - one is the amount of time as well as the number of professionalsneeded to address such severe cases of infection and decay , and the second is beingable to raise the funds necessary to treat these uninsured children. We know we are the right agency to provide this service as our presence in thou- sands of the most at-risk homes in Broward County every year helps influenceappointment setting, insurance enrollment, and preventative health practices. Ourestablished relationship with Nova Southeastern University and other social servicesagencies in our community also assists with this responsibility . But at the heart of it, both Kids In Distress and Nova Southeastern University agree: Given the long-lasting impact untreated dental decay has on a child's overall health,self-esteem, future job prospects, and quality of life, providing children in SouthFlorida with this resource is simply the right thing to do.Think about it ... what is the point of making sure children have safe homes, if a situation just as dangerous lies within their own bodies?
