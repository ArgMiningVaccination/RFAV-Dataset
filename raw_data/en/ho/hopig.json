Milden, BA; Daniel Stokols, PhD This article offers a review of the research literature on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and presents the findings from an exploratorysurvey of the beliefs, attitudes, intentions, and behaviors of conventionallytrained physicians toward CAM. Earlier studies of CAM focused primarily onpatients' attitudes and behaviors rather than those of physicians. Physiciansplay a crucial role in moderating patients'beliefs about and use of CAM treat-ments. Accordingly, this study focused on physicians' knowledge of medicalefficacy and their impressions of CAM treatments. The findings from a surveymailed to a random sample of California physicians revealed that physicians'use or recommendations of CAM in their practices are limited by concernsabout medical professional norms, yet are positively associated with their useof computer technology for self-education and communication with peers.Sixty-one percent of physicians do not feel sufficiently knowledgeable aboutCAM safety or efficacy, and 81% would like to receive more education onCAM modalities. The findings raise important issues for medical educationand patient care. Index Terms: beliefs, behaviors, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), intentions, physicians' attitudes Patient attitudes toward medical care in the United States have shifted away from relying solely on traditional West-ern imedicine. Although not entirely willing to abandon their primary care physician and conventional biomedicaltreatments, many patients are no longer satisfied with mere-ly being diagnosed and medicated or exposed to invasiveand potentially unnecessary surgeries. In some cases, suspi-cious of or dissatisfied with traditional medicine's inabilityto alleviate symptoms (especially those associated withchronic illness), Americans have sought to supplement orreplace treatments provided by their primary care physi-cians with new healing modalities they believe will providea higher level of physical health and well-being. 1,2DEFINITION AND HISTORY OF CAM Eisenberg and colleagues3defined complementary and alter- native medical (CAM) therapies as \"interventions neithertaught widely in medical schools, nor generally available inU.S. hospitals.\" (p246)Their follow-up trend analysis4report- ed that patient use of CAM had risen from 34% in 1990 tomore than 47% in 1997, even though CAM treatments arenot widely taught or available. This increase was due pri-marily to an increase in the number of people seeking CAM,as opposed to the same people using additional treatments.Americans now spend more than $27 billion each year out-of-pocket for CAM treatments, up from $14 billion in 1993, 4 clearly expressing a change in their healthcare preferences. Although patients increasingly use CAM to supplement conventional medical treatment, a discrepancy exists betweenpatient and physician reports of conventional physician Ms Milden and Dr Stokols are with the School of Social Ecology, University of California, Irvine. 73 inquiry into CAM use.4-7 Furthermore, because many physi- cians have little or no training in CAM modalities, they often dismiss them as being ineffective or unsafe. Despite somephysicians' dismissive stance toward CAM treatments,patients continue to use them for the purposes of illness pre-vention, nutritional supplementation, enhancement of well-being, and personal empowerment, 8while often remaining unaware of potentially dangerous contradictions. WHO USES CAM? Eisenberg and colleagues'3nationally representative survey, published in 1993, is regarded as a landmark study thatrevealed the prevalence, patterns of use, and costs of CAM.By 1997, 47% of the US population used some form ofCAM, 4and visits to CAM providers outnumbered the total number of visits to primary care physicians. Similar usageof CAM was found across all socioeconomic groups,although current indicators suggest greater CAM useamong females and those with higher education, higherincome, poorer health, 3transformational (spiritual) experi- ences, and commitment to personal control.8 The reported prevalence of CAM use depends on the spe- cific criteria used to define CAM.3-5,9The majority of CAM treatments are used to treat chronic illnesses.4,10-12A correla- tion does exist between the lack of perceived emotional sup-port from conventional physicians and patients' increasedinterest in CAM. 13 Patient willingness to take risks also is cor- related with CAM use.14Astin8found that dissatisfaction with conventional medical care was not a predictor of CAM use.Eisenberg and colleagues' 5findings support Astin8and indi- cate that patients are mainly concerned with their primarycare physician's ability to understand CAM treatments whenused in combination with their conventional treatments. WHAT TYPES OF CAM ARE USED MOST OFTEN? Complementary therapies (those used to supplement conven-tional treatment) are used more often than alternative thera-pies, particularly among patients with serious illness. 13,15,16In studies that examine CAM treatments used by individualswith breast cancer, melanoma, and colorectal cancer, forexample, the highest use of CAM therapies (greater than 40%responding) were complementary in nature, including spiri-tual or prayer therapies, vitamin therapy, herbal therapy, mas-sage or physical therapies, and nutrition. INSTITUTIONAL TRENDS Responding to the rise in patients' decisions to use CAM,the National Institutes of Health (NIH) created the Officeof Alternative Medicine (OAM) in 1992, eventually renam-ing it the National Center for Complementary and Alterna-tive Medicine (NCCAM). The original goal of OAM investigation . . . [and] examine thepotential efficacy, effectiveness, safety, and validity ofCAM practices, as well as the physiological or psycholog-ical mechanisms underlying these practices.\" 17 The NCCAM has further refined its mission as being dedicatedto exploring CAM practices in the context of rigorous sci-ence, training CAM researchers, and disseminating author-itative information to the public and professionals. 18 NCCAM Director Stephen Strauss, MD, is optimistic that\"CAM will be integrated with conventional medicine asscience affords a fuller understanding of its benefits andrisks.\" 19(p25) Albeit small by government research standards, Congress increased NCCAM's annual budget for 2002 to $104.6 mil-lion, up $54 million from 1999, with most of its budget allo-cated to studies of the efficacy of various CAM treatments. 19 These include the use of shark cartilage for lung cancer,Ginkgo biloba to prevent dementia, acupuncture for osteoarthritis, and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid (EDTA)chelation therapy to prevent coronary artery disease. In 2001, with more than 350 therapies 20meeting the defining CAM criteria, the NCCAM created 5 generic cat-egories of CAM: (1) Alternative Medical Systems, (2)Mind-Body Interventions, (3) Biologically Based Treat-ments, (4) Manipulative and Body-Based Methods, and (5)Energy Therapies. 17 Figure 1 provides examples of treat- ments and methods that fall into each category. US medical schools also have responded to what has become a consumer driven demand for healthcare. Recog-nizing that CAM treatments have become part of main-stream self-healthcare, Spiegel et al 21report that by 1998, at least 27 US medical schools included CAM in their cur-riculum, although that number is reported by some studiesto be as high as 75, collectively; 6and the number of CAM- accredited programs grew by 90% between 1990 and2000. 22Nationwide, student enrollment is up by 35% in chi- ropractic programs, enrollments in naturopathy programsincreased from 319 to 1,523, and enrollments in acupunc-ture programs tripled. WHEN IS CAM NOT CAM? Although unique for the United States, CAM is the normfor most other nations. The World Health Organization esti-mates that 80% of the world's population is using someform of CAM for their primary healthcare. Thus, most ofthe world's population would consider the Westernizedform of medicine (allopathic) as \"complementary\" or\"alternative,\" because it represents a departure from theirtraditional forms of medicine. 10 ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 74 Behavioral Medicine TWO HEALING PARADIGMS: WESTERN MEDICINE AND CAM During the last 100 years, Western medicine has made signif- icant contributions to human health and increased longevitythrough its empirical approach. 23These scientific advances have produced state-of-the-art diagnostics, pharmaceuticals,and surgical treatments, all of which are supported by stan-dardized medical training and experimental research.Any attempt to answer the question, \"Why do physicians receive little or no training in CAM modalities?\" leads to thephilosophical divide that has long separated Western medi-cine and CAM. The 20th century advances of Western medi-cine are due in large part to the cultivation of objectivism andthe positivist philosophies that embrace the scientific method,a foundation of conventional medical training. These think-ing styles, although essential for scientific research, have his-torically neglected the joint influence of spirit and mind onhealth and illness. Particularly significant is the relationshipbetween the patient and the physician, because many CAMtreatments rely heavily on relationship-centered therapies. 24 Other reasons for the disinterest in some CAM treatmentsmay include the practical matters mentioned by Wynia et al, 25 who suggest that \"more important issues took precedenceover CAM, such as [in These issues may reflect a struggle over which healing paradigm is superior, and which type of treatment is moreimportant. If the institutions that support the traditional medical paradigm are unwilling to consider a more holisticand complementary approach to healthcare, then physiciansinterested in CAM treatments must acquire informationabout them on their own, once they graduate from medicalschool. For instance, Eisenberg et al 4and Wynia et al25 found that practicing physicians may not feel competent toadvise patients about the risks and benefits of certain CAMtreatments due to a lack of training. Similarly, Pietroni 26 notes: \"Some of the methods that fall into these categories[chiropractic, acupuncture, naturopathy] require 4 years offull-time training akin to graduate medical school . . . it isclear that the general practitioner will require guidancebefore deciding which treatments to include in their prima-ry healing service.\" (pp2-3)This lack of training and confi- dence also breeds concerns about legal liabilities (yet anoth-er reason cited by some physicians for a reluctance toembrace certain CAM treatments). 25 Some earlier studies suggest that relatively younger physicians, assumed to berecent medical school graduates, are generally more accept-ing of CAM treatments than their older counterparts, 7,27 despite (or perhaps because of) older physicians' longerexposure to conventional medical training and practice. PREVIOUS STUDIES EXAMINING PATIENT-PHYSICIAN COMMUNICATION Follow-up studies 8,11,13,16,28building on Eisenberg's research examined whether or not patients voluntarily shareCAM usage information with their physicians. They alsoinquired as to whether primary care physicians ask orinform their patients about CAM treatments during aMILDEN ET AL V ol30, Summer 2004 75Alternative Medical Systems These are complete systems of medical theory developedindependently of Western medicine, in some cases cen-turies before it. 17 Examples include: Traditional Oriental Medicine Homeopathy Ayervedic Medicine Naturopathy Mind-Body Interventions Although many mind-body interventions are now consid-ered mainstream, the following are still considered CAM: Meditation Music Hypnosis Art TherapyDance Prayer Biologically Based Treatments Examples include:Herbal Therapies Special Diets believed to control or prevent illnessOrthomolecular Mega-vitamins and chemicals Biological Shark Cartilage to treat cancerBee Pollen to treat autoimmune diseases Manipulative and Body-Based Methods Examples include: Chiropractic OsteopathMassage Therapy Energy TherapiesThese therapies focus on subtle energy fields* either with-in or outside the body, and include: Qi Gong Therapeutic Touch (laying on of hands) Reiki Magnetic Therapy *In some cases these energy fields have not been experi- mentally proven to exist. FIGURE 1. Examples of CAM treatments. patient history examination. On the whole, the findings from these studies suggest that physicians should take amore proactive role in ascertaining their patients' actualCAM use. In surprising contrast to patients' reports that their physi- cians do not inquire about CAM use, 384% of physicians surveyed by Amster et al7indicated that they asked their patients about CAM use during consultations. Those whodo not recommend CAM reasoned that they do not knowenough about the harm or efficacy of CAM treatments.Although 88% look forward to an integration of CAM withconventional medicine, 69% are cautious of treatments thatare not based on biomedicine, and female physicians rec-ommend CAM 16% more often than male physicians.Whereas age (< 46) was found to be significantly associat-ed with CAM use among men only, no significant correla-tion was evident for ethnicity. Consistent with their highlevel of interest in patient use of CAM (80%), 92% of allphysicians surveyed by Amster et al 7reported willingness to refer patients for CAM treatment, and 84% reported aninterest in attending continuing medical education courseson CAM. THE PRESENT STUDY The existing research literature on CAM suggests the valueof more directly investigating physicians' attitudes towardand use of CAM in their medical practice. Therefore, weundertook an exploratory survey study of physicians' (1)attitudes toward their patients' use of CAM, (2) willingnessto prescribe or inquire about CAM treatments for theirpatients, (3) decision to offer or perform CAM treatments asa part of their practice, and (4) consultations of CAM liter-ature and providers, or personal use of CAM treatments.This survey also assessed physicians' self-reported know-ledge of medical efficacy and general impressions ofapproximately 22 CAM modalities and the kinds of tech-nologies, if any, that physicians use in supporting their ownlevel of medical knowledge\u2014CAM or conventional medi-cine. Finally, the survey examined the levels of research,education, and institutional support that are perceived to benecessary for conventional physicians to feel comfortablesupporting the interests of patients in their consideration ofCAM treatments and the conditions under which conven-tionally trained physicians feel confident advising the use ofor against the use of a CAM treatment, and the conditionsunder which they are willing to work in concert with aCAM provider. The survey design was guided largely by Fishbein and Ajzen's 29theoretical model of the relationships between indi- viduals' beliefs, attitudes, behavioral intentions, and behav-ior.iiIn Fishbein and Ajzen's29model, attitudes are defined as positive or negative feelings toward particular objects or con-cepts. Beliefs are perceived links between 2 or more concepts or objects. Behavioral intentions are statements made by individuals indicating that they plan to enact a particularbehavior at some time in the future. Fishbein and Ajzen 29 suggest that although beliefs and attitudes are important, spe-cific behavioral intentions (in this case, intentions to useCAM) are the most reliable predictors of actual (CAM)behaviors. Therefore, the ability to identify which beliefs andattitudes will result in positive intentions is important for pre-dicting actual behavior. Fishbein and Ajzen 29found, however, that in addition to being causal predictors of intention andbehavior, both beliefs and attitudes are themselves subject tonormative beliefs about expected or anticipated behavior,thereby promoting greater correspondence between norma-tive expectations (about what behaviors are considered to beappropriate by one's peers or elders) and the individual's actu-al behavioral intentions. An important implication of this the-ory, and the hypothesis for the present study, is that physi-cians' beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors toward CAM areinfluenced by professional normative beliefs and perceivedexpectations, including, but not limited to, legal liability con-cerns, health insurance reimbursement, conventional medicalprotocol, and patient expectations. METHODS Participants We chose a random sample of 200 California MDs from a list of 56,000 physicians licensed by the California MedicalBoard. We obtained a CD-ROM containing a database of thelicensed physicians from the California Board of ConsumerAffairs. 30We then used a computer to randomize a subset of the database containing only those physicians designated as\"active\" and included all specialties. We selected the first200 randomly drawn names to receive the CAM survey. iii Once the survey was approved by the University of Califor-nia Irvine Institutional Review Board, each selected physi-cian received a survey mail packet containing a letter ofintroduction, a consent letter, a survey, and a self-addressed,stamped return envelope. We asked the participants to returnthe survey by mail within 3 weeks. Of those initially con-tacted, 51 physicians filled out and returned the surveys. Theaverage age of physicians was 49 years, with approximately30% of respondents being women. Seventy-seven percent ofall respondents were Caucasian; the remainder identifiedthemselves as African American, Asian, Latino, or Other.Eighty-two percent attended medical school in the UnitedStates, and 98% of all respondents were board certified inALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 76 Behavioral Medicine their specialty. Only 20% received some form of CAM train- ing in medical school. RESPONSE RATE Of the 200 surveys mailed, the US Post Office returned 4 asundeliverable. Of the 196 surveys delivered, a total of 51 eli-gible surveys were returned, yielding a response rate of 26%.Of the 51 surveys returned by physicians, we excluded 6 inthe statistical analyses because they contained substantiallyincomplete data. Owing to the lack of respondents' phonenumbers, it was not possible to make follow-up phone callsto solicit a higher response rate among nonresponders.Although it is not uncommon for physician response rates onmailed surveys to fall below the 20-25% range because oftheir busy schedules, 31response rates in that range pose con- cerns about potential self-selection and positivity responsebiases among participants in the study. The exploratorynature of the survey notwithstanding, we made efforts toassess potential response biases by examining the mean,mode, median, minimum, and maximum values on each ofthe survey items and summary scales. These descriptive sta-tistics revealed marked variation in the CAM-related atti-tudes, beliefs, behavioral intentions, and practices reportedby respondents, suggesting the absence of consistently posi-tive response biases across the different categories of surveymeasures. SURVEY PROCEDURES We mailed an anonymous self-report survey to physiciansduring February of 2003. ivThe survey was 6 pages in length, contained 5 sections, and took approximately 15minutes to complete. The first page included a brief intro-duction and definition of CAM, as well as treatment cate-gories and examples. The next section, Physician Orienta-tions, contained a list of 29 questions, inquiring aboutphysician beliefs, attitudes, intentions, knowledge, andbehavior toward CAM. vWe presented these questions as 6- point Likert-type scales, each incorporating 1 of 2 sets ofanchors: Strongly Disagree (1), Agree (3), Strongly Agree(5), and Don't Know (6); Never (1), Sometimes (3), Often(5), and Don't Know (6). We did not supply anchor termsfor the values 2 and 4 on the Likert-type scales. vi We also presented physicians with 2 open-ended ques- tions and asked them to write in their comments about theintegration of CAM with traditional medicine, as well aswhat CAM resources they thought would be most valuableto them in their practice. Another section of the surveyincluded a list of 22 CAM modalities, categorized intoAlternative Medical Systems, Mind-Body Interventions,Biological Treatments, Manipulative Body-Based Methods,and Energy Therapies. We asked physicians to rank theirknowledge of the medical efficacy of the CAM treatmentslisted on a 1- to 6-point Likert-type scale ranging from Inef-fective (1) to Moderately Effective (3) to Very Effective (5)and Don't Know (6). In an effort to crossvalidate the beliefsqueried in previous questions, we asked physicians to ratetheir impressions of the CAM treatments listed on the sameLikert-type scale from Very Negative (1) to Neutral (3) toVery Positive (5) and Don't Know (6). Additionally, the survey incorporated 8 questions on the use of technology in the physicians' medical practices as wellas their interest in CAM education. We asked respondentsabout their use of online databases to obtain peer-review jour-nals for either CAM or traditional medicine. They also wereasked about the number of hours per day or week that theyspent on the Internet in association with their medical prac-tice, their use of a personal digital assistant (PDA), e-mail, orWeb sites to communicate or gather medical data. Some ofthe questions in the technology and education section weredichotomous, although most were scored on a Likert-typescale ranging from 1 to 5, where 1 = Never, 3 = Sometimes,and 5 = Often. The final section of the survey assessed demographic information, including age, gender, ethnicity, country oforigin, and the country in which the respondent attendedmedical school. The last page of the survey contained ques-tions asking whether or not respondents had received anyCAM training in medical school, the year they graduatedfrom medical school, their number of years in practice, theirmedical specialty, whether or not they were board certified,whether or not they were a sole practitioner and, if not, withhow many MDs they shared a practice or work. DATA ANALYSES We performed Statistical analyses using the SPSS softwareprogram (v.11.0). Following initial data entry, survey itemswere recoded exclude \"Don't Know\" answers and miss-ing data. We computed descriptive statistics including mean,mode, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation to iden-tify any data coding anomalies. We computed 2-tailed Pear-son bivariate correlations on all variables to identify statisti-cally significant relationships between measures of beliefs,attitudes, intentions, and behaviors, as well as technologyand demographic data. We performed a series of multivari-ate stepwise regression analyses to explore the potentiallinks among key variables (eg, CAM-related attitudes, nor-mative concerns, and behavioral intentions as predictors ofphysicians' CAM practices). These analyses were highlyexploratory in view of the cross-sectional design of the sur-vey and the low response rate noted earlier.MILDEN ET AL V ol30, Summer 2004 77 Univariate Measures and Composite Indexes We incorporated relevant clusters of univariate survey mea- sures into the following composite indexes: Positive CAMBehavior, Use of CAM, viiPositive Beliefs About CAM, Posi- tive Attitudes Toward CAM, Institutional Concerns,viiiKnowl- edge of CAM, Efficacy of CAM Treatments, Impressions ofCAM Treatment, and Use of Technology in Practice. Wechose to cluster similar questionnaire items into a smallernumber of composite indexes to reduce the likelihood of type1 errors (obtaining statistically significant findings by chance)and to increase the ratio of survey respondents to the numberof survey items examined in the statistical analyses. For pur-poses of the analyses, we calculated mean scores (on a 1-5scale) for each composite index (see Table 1). RESULTS CAM-Related Beliefs, Attitudes, Intentions and Behaviors As shown in Table 1, the mean for all respondents on sur-vey items aimed at identifying positive beliefs toward CAM was 3.2 (1 = most negative and 5 = most positive), indicat-ing slightly better than midrange positive beliefs towardCAM. Similarly, the mean score across those survey itemsassessing physicians' attitudes toward CAM was 3.4, sug-gesting a mildly positive reaction to CAM across surveyrespondents. These slightly positive trends among physi-cians' beliefs and attitudes toward CAM were in contrast totheir more negative responses on survey items designed toassess their current use or intentions to use CAM treatmentsin the future. For instance, the mean value on the summaryscale measuring physicians' intentions to use CAM in theirpractice was 2.3. Also, the mean value on the summaryscale assessing physicians' positive CAM behaviors (eg,their current use or recommendation of CAM treatments inthe practices) was 2.8 (where 1 = least positive CAMbehavior and 5 = most positive CAM behavior), indicatingan overall tendency among survey respondents\u2014even thoseexpressing mildly positive beliefs and attitudes towardCAM\u2014to avoid using such treatments in their practices.

N includes only those physicians who answered all of the survey questions included in each sum- mary measure. Positive CAM Behavior is a composite of 7 questions designed to assess a physician's current positive behaviors toward CAM. Use of CAM is a subset of Positive CAM Behavior and includes 4 questions aggregated separately to assess actual use of recommendation of CAM treatments. Positive Beliefs about CAM reflects an aggregate score of 7 questions assessing existing beliefs about CAM. Institutional Concerns is a composite of 3 questions designed to assess concern of medical profession norms, potential legal liability, health insurance coverage, etc. Intention to Use CAM includes 1 direct intention to use CAM and a subset of 4 belief, attitude, and behavior questions. Knowledge of CAM includes a summary of 3 questions examining the physician's own confidence in his or her knowledgeof various CAM treatments. Efficacy and Impression Scales exclude Energy Therapies. Of the 23 CAM therapies listed on the survey, 4 of them are considered \"energy therapies,\" such as Qi Gong, Reiki, Ther-apeutic Touch, and Magnetic Therapy. The overwhelming majority of physicians answered \"Don'tKnow\" when responding to questions about either the medical efficacy of or their impressions towardEnergy Therapies, presumably because of their lack of knowledge, resulting in a relatively low n for each of these scales. Use of Technology is a composite of the results of 4 questions that assessed the physi- cian's use of technology (e-mail, Web sites, and PDAs), not only as a practice management tool, but alsoto access or research current medical studies (eg, PUBMED and MEDLINE), as well as to communi-cate with other healthcare professionals. Knowledge of CAM, Perceived Efficacy of CAM, and Institutional Concerns Although the composite index of physicians' CAM knowl- edge yielded a mean score of 2.6, their mean ratings of CAMefficacy (2.8) and general impressions (2.8) of 22 differentCAM treatments were skewed by the fact that 36 out of 45respondents answered \"Don't Know\" (see Table 1). Theincomplete data on these treatment-specific ratings reflectedthe fact that most participants were unfamiliar with manyCAM therapies (such as Ayervedic Medicine, shark cartilageand bee pollen treatments, Qi Gong, Reiki, magnetic therapy,etc). This general unfamiliarity with several CAM treatmentsmay account for physicians' relatively high scores on thesummary index of Institutional Concerns. The mean score of4.1 on this index suggests that respondents are very con-cerned about issues such as legal liability, CAM licensure,and the lack of health insurance coverage for CAM treat-ments. Physicians' use of technology in their medical practice(eg, use of e-mail, the Internet, and PDAs to retrieve or com-municate either conventional or CAM data) yielded a meanscore of 1.9, suggesting that, among these respondents, com-puter technology does not serve as a major vehicle for theirdelivery of healthcare services. Bivariate Correlation Results We found a significant correlation between intention to use CAM and positive attitudes toward CAM, r(31) = .813, p< .000. Additionally, we found stated intentions to use CAM tobe significantly correlated with positive CAM behaviors,r(32) = .483, p< .004, and physicians' CAM-related attitudes likewise were significantly correlated with CAM practices,r(31) = .528, p< .002. Intention to use CAM in one's practice was inversely correlated with physicians' years in practice(and with their age), r(37) = -.374, p< .021. Although only a small number of respondents (9) indicated that they receivedsome form of CAM training in medical school, belief orknowledge of medical efficacy of CAM treatments was sig-nificantly correlated with CAM training received in medicalschool, p< .016. concerns about non-traditional medicalpractices to be with their positive beliefstoward CAM, r(28) = -.486, p< .007. Regression Analyses When we controlled for age, gender, ethnicity, and years in practice, multivariate regression analyses revealed a signifi-cant inverse correlation between age and positive CAMbehavior (R 2= .347, p< .05), suggesting that approximate- variance in explaining non-CAM behavior isdue to physicians' older ages. In recalculation of the regres-sion, we included both technology and attitudes as stepwisevariables while we controlled for age, gender, ethnicity, andyears in practice, and we found technology use to be a moresignificant predictor of positive CAM behavior ( R 2= .610, p< .05) than attitudes toward CAM. Physicians' Responses to Open-Ended Questions Among those physicians who chose to answer the open- ended questions soliciting their comments, suggestions, orconcerns regarding the incorporation of CAM treatmentsinto traditional medicine (n = 22), the following quotes reflect a generally positive stance toward the integration ofCAM and biomedical therapies: \"I believe in the biopsychosocial model. The biomolecular model works best with pathological states, but allows forCAM integration.\" \"I think CAM and Western Medicine complement each other. The integration of CAM in a systematic and scientifi-cally rigorous manner is essential.\" \"High quality objective research is very badly needed . . . CAM needs to be evidence based to become fully acceptable.\" \"There is a well established scientific method to research the efficacy of medications (traditional or otherwise). Not to applythis test to all products and medications is archaic thinking.\" DISCUSSION Americans' use of CAM therapies is on the rise. Historically, patients have looked solely to their primary care physiciansfor medical treatment and advice. During the past decade,however, patients have begun to take a more proactive roleregarding their own health and well-being. Therefore, theability of patients to discuss both traditional and alternativetreatments with their physicians is becoming increasinglyimportant. Accordingly, the provision of adequate informa-tion and education regarding CAM practices and their effica-cy has become essential for both patients and physicians. Although there is disagreement across both patient and physician studies as to how often physicians ask theirpatients about CAM use, this study found that 76% of physi-cians responding to the survey do so. Whereas the majority(61%) of physicians surveyed find themselves discouragingCAM therapies because they are not knowledgeable enoughabout the safety or efficacy of CAM treatments, 81% alsoclaim to want more CAM education. Perhaps because theyhave not yet received CAM education, 80% of the respon-dents in this study would prefer to rely solely on conven-tional biomedical treatments. A qualitative analysis of theopen-ended comments provided by almost half of the physi-cians reveals their general openness toward CAM, providedMILDEN ET AL V ol30, Summer 2004 79 that sufficient clinical trials, education, and resources to sup- port CAM practices are made available. Respondents' lackof familiarity about certain CAM techniques (eg, energytherapies; see Table 1) may partly explain the observed biasamong respondents against using CAM practices with whichthey are unfamiliar and whose therapeutic validity theybelieve remains untested or unknown. Physicians are more willing to use online databases such as PUBMED or MEDLINE to search out peer-reviewedarticles on either CAM or conventional medicine (42%)than they are to search conventional medical Web sites(36%). As noted earlier, physicians' use of technology is asignificant correlate of their willingness to use CAM. Physicians who had been in practice the longest (and were therefore presumably older) expressed the most opposition toCAM, r(37) = -.374, p< .021. Both their lack of CAM train- ing, as well as the length of time they had been influenced bythe institutional norms that historically have resisted CAM,may explain their opposition. This study further indicates thatgender was neither significantly correlated with nor predic-tive of positive CAM beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors. Physicians holding positive attitudes toward CAM are significantly more likely to express positive behavioralintentions to use CAM, r(31) = .813, p< .000. However, consistent with Fishbein and Ajzen's 29theory that social norms can override beliefs, attitudes, and intentions (there-by inhibiting attitudinally-consistent behavior), the findingsfrom this study suggest that physicians' institutional con-cerns about non-traditional medical treatments significantlyinfluence their willingness to use CAM regardless of theirpositive beliefs, attitudes, and intentions toward CAM,r(28) = -.486, p< .007. Through their responses on both the scaled and open- ended survey items, physicians expressed their desire forgreater access to information derived from CAM clinicaltrials and educational opportunities related to CAM treat-ments. The results of this study, however, suggest thatalthough positive beliefs toward CAM efficacy are positive-ly correlated with CAM training, institutional concernsdiminish actual adoption of CAM practices. Contributions and Limitations of This Study One contribution of this exploratory study is that it focused explicitly on physicians' CAM-related attitudes, beliefs,intentions, and behaviors, whereas prior studies focused pri-marily on patients' perception and use of CAM. This focuson physician respondents is valuable, considering that med-ical doctors play a major role in influencing the healthcaredecisions of their patients. Second, we grounded the physi-cian survey used in this study in a widely tested conceptualmodel of attitude change and behavior, namely, Fishbein andAjzen's 29theory of the relationships among individuals' atti- tudes, beliefs, behavioral intentions, and actual practices.Thus, we designed the survey to examine (albeit inexploratory fashion) certain hypotheses derived from thistheory, including the predicted and observed influence ofnormative beliefs on actual and intended CAM behaviorsand the strong association between behavioral intentions andCAM practices. Third, we randomly selected the partici-pants in this study from a statewide listing of all Californiaphysicians and medical specialties. Although we drew thesample randomly from only 1 state, California is the mostpopulous (and one of the most culturally diverse) state in theUnited States and often serves as a bellweather for emergingsociocultural, demographic, and public health trends. The methodological limitations of this study include: (1) the low response rate (26%) obtained; (2) the cross-sectionalrather than longitudinal research design which precludescausal inferences from the descriptive, correlational, andexploratory regression analyses; and (3) the lack of supple-mental data provided by nonrespondents that might be usedto corroborate participants' self-reports\u2014for example, sur-veys of nurses or other professional associates who are in aposition to report on a physician's CAM practices. The strengths and limitations of this study must be weighed together to assess its contribution to the research lit-erature on behavioral medicine and CAM. For instance, a lowresponse rate on surveys may result in self-selection andresponse biases that cloud the interpretation of data. Amongthe physicians participating in this study, we did find mildtrends toward positivity in their attitudes and beliefs aboutCAM. However, these trends were in contrast to participants'tendencies to avoid using CAM treatments in their medicalpractices. In the context of these contrasting attitudinal andbehavioral trends, it was possible to identify the potentiallyimportant role of professional norms regarding the efficacy ofCAM in discouraging the use of CAM treatments by con-ventionally trained physicians. The opportunity to assess the-oretically derived hypotheses regarding physicians' CAM-related attitudes, beliefs, behavioral intentions, and medicalpractices (issues that have received little attention in behav-ioral medicine research previously) may offset, at least inpart, limitations placed on the representativeness of thesefindings California physicians, let alone those practicing inother states, because of the cross-sectional design and sam-pling constraints of the study. CONCLUSIONS The results of this exploratory survey study must be inter-preted and generalized cautiously because of the limitationsALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 80 Behavioral Medicine noted earlier. Longitudinal survey designs examining physi- cian beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors at repeated intervals(for example, both before and after exposure to CAM train-ing), the incorporation of larger survey samples, and the useof observational (as well as self-report) measures of physi-cians' CAM practices remain priorities for future research inthis area. Western medicine has made tremendous strides toward improving human health and longevity over the past century.A new era in healthcare has emerged, which demands thatWestern medicine empirically evaluate and possibly inte-grate healing concepts that, initially, may appear to be aliento a traditional medical paradigm. The definition of whatboth physicians and patients consider as CAM is changing asmore CAM treatments come to be viewed as mainstream. Inthe meantime, it is important that physicians continue to beopen to the CAM modalities that remain outside the tradi-tional medical model of allopathic medicine. Willingness toconsider the whole person (body, mind, and spirit) as well astheir environment is an important first step toward achievingmore comprehensive and effective approaches to medicaleducation and healthcare delivery.

The terms Western medicine, conventional medicine, and bio- medicine are used interchangeably within this article and refer specif-ically to the mainstream medical care available in the United States. ii. The Fishbein and Ajzen model 29is one of several alternative theories that might be used to explain the consistencies betweenphysicians' CAM-related attitudes and behavior. We chose toemphasize their model because it emphasizes the importance ofindividuals' stated intentions to behave in a particular manner as areliable predictor of their subsequent behavior and because the pre-dicted relationships between behavioral intentions and actualbehavior have been found in several earlier studies. iii. Prior to mailing the final survey form to physicians, we con- ducted a pilot survey to assess the clarity of the CAM survey items.We administered 12 pilot surveys to physicians based in OrangeCounty, California. We identified physicians as prospective partic-ipants for the survey on the basis of their willingness to participate.We encouraged participants to make suggestions on the survey andto complete and return it within 10 days. Eight completed pilotsurveys were returned and used as a basis for refining the final sur-vey items. iv. Although no compensation was offered for participation in this study, physicians were given the opportunity to request andreceive a copy of the survey results. If they wished to remainanonymous, we asked participants to submit an e-mail request tocamsurvey@uci.edu for a summary of the findings. v. We scored questions 1 through 21 on a 1- to 6-point Likert- type scale ranging from Strongly Disagree (1) to Strongly Agree(5), and Don't Know (6). We scored questions 22 through 29 on a1- to 6-point Likert-type scale of Never (1) to Often (5). vi. Examples of the questions survey included: (1) Beliefs: \"In some cases I consider CAM treatments to be superior to tradition-al medical protocols\"; (2) Attitudes: \"I find myself annoyed when my patients bring me articles from magazines or the Internetregarding CAM therapies\"; (3) Intentions: \"I plan to expand treatments\"; and (4) Behaviors: \"I rec- ommend CAM therapies to my patients.\" vii. Use of CAM is a subset of Positive CAM Behavior and includes 4 questions aggregated separately to assess actual use orrecommendation of CAM treatments. viii. Institutional Concerns include questions meant to assess concern over medical profession norms, legal liability, healthinsurance coverage, etc. REFERENCES 1. Sutherland LR, Verhoef M.
