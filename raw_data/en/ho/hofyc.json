You're also eligible for free shipping in Canada and the U.S Due to the toxicity of our modern environment cleanses should be done every six months. Use LiverTune for six weeks for a first time cleanse. For subsequent cleanses, use LiverTune for four weeks. If your dog has elevated liver enzymes, you can consult with your veterinarian about using this protocol for up to six months continuously to support the liver. Dogs live in a challenging environment. The canine liver processes the toxins, pollution and chemicals found everywhere in our world. A semi-annual liver cleanse is the best way to ensure your dog's liver is in top-notch shape and your dog is healthy and lives a long life. LiverTune helps expel toxins from the liver and the body and GreenMin provides a gentle detox. We expect to see changes in stool, mucus passing, some diarrhea and sometimes ear or skin irritation as the body adjusts and rids itself of these toxins. Side effects usually only last a few days to a week, but if they become severe, we recommend reducing the dose until the body adjusts. LiverTune can be used in conjunction with Natural Healing supplements and most other supplements, as well as conventional medications. However, we don't recommend using supplements with the same main ingredients as LiverTune at the same time. For example, if the supplements you're using contain milk thistle or any of the other main ingredients found in LiverTune, then we recommend you stop using one of them. We always recommend checking with your treating veterinarian before adding any supplements to your dog's routine. Below is a link to the ingredients in LiverTune. [LiverTune ingredients](https://peterdobias.com/products/livertune-supplement) Even young dogs benefit from a cleanse because they get exposed to vaccines, anesthetics and medications. We recommend a first cleanse at 6 months of age and then repeat every spring and fall. GreenMin can be given at any age, including to pregnant and nursing mothers. Young and senior animals, in particular, can benefit because they are prone to deficiencies that can cause growth and developmental abnormalities and a shortened lifespan. GutSense is a whole food, raw formula that is good for all ages. We respect nature, where there is no difference between the diet of younger or senior mammals, with the exception of nursing animals. Please read the following link. [Guidelines for introducing our essential supplements](https://peterdobias.com/pages/guidelines-for-introducing-our-essential-supplements) LiverTune is intended to be given twice per year. A first time cleanse is six weeks long and then follow up cleanses are four weeks long. If you wish to use it longer than the recommended period, it is important to work closely with your treating veterinarian to continuously monitor your dog's liver function by having regular blood work done. Dr. Dobias has found a cleanse to be very beneficial for dogs with liver disease. Read more on treating and preventing liver disease naturally [here](https://peterdobias.com/blogs/blog/11014997-treating-and-preventing-liver-disease-naturally). Our product LiverTune is a liver cleanse and contains various herbs. We suggest that you take a look at our [cautions and contraindications](https://peterdobias.com/products/livertune-supplement), listed under the LiverTune product page under the FAQ section, to ensure your dog does not have any of the conditions listed. Caution: Dr. Dobias often recommends not doubling up on similar supplements. If, for example, you are already giving your dog a product for the liver and it contains milk thistle we wouldn't recommend using LiverTune at the same time as that supplement. Unfortunately we cannot comment on products that we do not have any personal or clinical experience with, but we do recommend LiverTune. The protocol for giving LiverTune for six weeks initially and four weeks during follow-up cleanses is standard and one that Dr. Dobias has had success with. GutSense is a probiotic formula custom made for dogs. Most canine probiotics are made of human probiotic bacteria strains. GutSense is different. We have meticulously cherry-picked each probiotic strain to reflect the natural microflora of dogs, NOT humans. GutSense is appropriate to use as a daily probiotic. The individual colonies of bacteria, or CFU count, is 10.1 billion per two capsules. We also include prebiotic as 'food' for the bacteria to ensure it's survival within the capsules and through your dog's stomach acid, so it can reach the gut and the culture can flourish there. The test results will show the deficiencies and toxicities in your dog. HairQ Test results are for additional information only. They are not indicative of any medical problems, but can help lead you in the right direction regarding diagnostic testing if your dog is experiencing any symptoms that are unexplained. The test requires a minimum of a tablespoon or 125mg of cut hair to run the test. We cannot accept hair that has been brushed out or shed, it must be cut close to the skin. Although a consultation is not included, a supporting document with a general outline of the most common toxins and mineral deficiencies is provided along with the test results. Information on the HairQ product page may be useful and we recommend doing some research online about your unique test results.
