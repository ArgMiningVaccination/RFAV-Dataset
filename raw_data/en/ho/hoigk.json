Her Father began mentoring her in Energy Healing at the age of 14. She founded Evertruth Healing with her late husband Kevin Michael. She has refined her practice over the years to include several holistic practitioners that work cohesively to help you achieve your health and wellness goals. A graduate of Logan College of Chiropractic with a degree in Chiropractic Neurology. Sai-Ling continues the work her Father Dr. Victor Frank began pioneering in Human Energy Healing. She comprehends the human condition and uses her insight to communicate and resolve the underlying emotional and spiritual causes of either illness or injury. She specializes in hormonal imbalances, nutritional deficiencies and neurological disorders. Joshua Michael, DC Joshua was the last person to realize his passion for healing. His journey began with the guidance of his parents, Sai-Ling and Kevin. Constant chiropractic care, meticulously chosen nutrition, and endless love gave Joshua a foundation of what true health means. As a child, he role-played the medic, the priest, or the shaman; characters whose purpose is to heal others. It was not until he left home for college that his hidden passion became his purpose. During college breaks Joshua would assist and work underneath his parents at Evertruth Healing. This only increased his passion and he decided to attend, Cleveland Chiropractic College of Los Angeles, where he graduated in 2009. Under the mentorship of Dr. Jensen, Joshua focused on physio-therapy and rehabilitation. He furthered his studies at the Prague School of Rehabilitation under Dr. Kolar. Joshua strives to educate and practice balance between the structural, neurological, nutritional and spiritual elements of our bodies. Tim Barreto, DC Tim began his chiropractic journey almost 30 years ago. He also studied at the Cleveland Chiropractic College of Los Angles. He is a trusted and compassionate healer who first learned energy healing while assisting and mentoring with Dr. Kevin Michael. Tim's devotion to human energy healing is reflected not just in his chiropractic practice but also in his daily life. He enjoys practicing Tai-Chi and Qi Gong in his free time as well as spending time with his family. He believes that compassion and movement are the beginnings of healing within our body. Lynn Van Metre, DC Lynn has joyfully pursued many avenues in the healing arts for over 30 years, and has been a Chiropractor and associate of Drs. Sai-Ling and Kevin Michael for the last 15 years. Lynn utilizes a bio-structural and social-spiritual approach in caring for her patients and continually draws upon her education in cranio-sacral therapy, kinesiology, nutrition, and Chinese Medicine to assist her in aligning the body and supporting what she knows is her patient's innate ability to heal. She continues her studies seeking an advanced degree in Oriental Medicine to offer her patients a rare blend of healing talents.

John-Allan Macunovich John-Allan has practiced as a cranio-sacral therapist for over 28 years, providing an exceptional level of care to his extensive list of grateful clients. Cranio-sacral therapy releases the fascia surrounding the nervous system and balances the flow of cerebral-spinal fluid, which surrounds the brain and spinal cord. He has found his treatments especially beneficial for those dealing with headaches, TMJ problems, and other related ailments. John-Allan's constant companion (and helper) during most of his treatments is his dog, Teddy. Dr. Beverly Driver, Acupuncturist Beverly graduated cum laude from Pacific College of Oriental Medicine San Diego in 1994, with a Masters in Science. She also completed her training in Traditional Chinese Medicine at the same time. In 1997 she earned her Board Certification in Acupuncture Orthopedics. Then in 1999 she interned at Beijing University Hospital's Neurology Department. Despite all her achievements she feels that she deepened her exploration of Traditional Chinese Medicine after her schooling. Her self study of Chinese Classics continues to broaden her understanding of nature to medicine, and how this can influence our perception of wellness.
