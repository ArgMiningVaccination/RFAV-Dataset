If you wish to try them for lactation-related purposes, consulting an expert is necessary. Read on as we tell you more about the safety of ginger for breastfeeding mothers, its effect on breast milk supply and flavor, its possible health benefits, side effects, and ways to consume it safely. Is Ginger Safe When Breastfeeding? According to the US Food And Drug Administration (USFDA), using ginger as a spice is \"generally regarded as safe (GRAS)\" for [breastfeeding mothers](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/chia-seeds-and-breastfeeding_00397645/), postpartum [(2)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK501786/).

Breastfeeding mothers with sensitive digestive systems may consider consuming small quantities of ginger only as a spice. Does Ginger Increase Breast Milk Supply? The use of ginger as a [lactogenic food](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/best-foods-to-increse-breast-milk_0076100/) is prevalent in traditional medicine.

However, every [breastfeeding mom](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/best-foods-breastfeeding-moms_0022432/) is unique and may react different to any potential galactagogue. If you wish to use ginger as a dietary supplement for lactation-related purposes, consult a lactation consultant. Does Ginger Affect The Flavor Of Breast Milk? Research studies show that maternal consumption of strongly flavored foods and spices may affect the flavor of [breast milk](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/breast-milk-production-stages-of-preparing-your-breasts-for-feeding_0092504/) within hours after ingestion [(5)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30982867/#:~:text=Moderate%20evidence%20indicates%20that%20flavors,in%20a%20time%2Ddependent%20manner.). The chances of ginger affecting the breast milk's flavor are likely, although the clinical evidence to support this assumption is sparse. Different babies have varying degrees of tolerance to changes in breast milk's flavor. A few infants can be sensitive and may act fussy and refuse to breastfeed. If your infant becomes fussy while breastfeeding, feeds less than usual, or refuses to feed after you consumed ginger, discontinue ginger use and see if the situation improves. If the problem persists, consult a lactation expert or a pediatrician.
