Used as an essential oil, ginger's warming quality helps to ease muscular aches and energize you mentally. \"It's considered an aphrodisiac,\" says Hamdan. 4) Black pepper. \"It's mainly prescribed in Ayurveda in food, but I have found that this small black spice has an array of rich properties,\" says Hamdan. \"It's a powerful antioxidant with antibacterial properties that contains essential nutrients such as manganese, potassium, Vitamin C and K. As a warming essential oil, it can help in the treatment of pain relief, rheumatism, blood circulation and exhaustion.\" 5) Ghee, also known as clarified butter. \"It supports the digestive fire that is important for overall health and wellness. It's also used to increase the effectiveness of herbal preparations, calm the mind and nourish the eyes. Because of its oily nature, it helps to hydrate dryness and is best for balancing Vata (air) and Pitta (fire) doshas. For insomnia, try adding a tablespoon of Ghee to a large glass of warm organic milk with a dash of cinnamon and cardamom before bed,\" says Pasquale. "}
