FDA Releases Summary Report on Ready-to-Eat Dips and Spreads Sampling Assignment June 15, 2023: Today, the FDA released findings from a sampling assignment that collected and tested refrigerated, multi-commodity ready-to-eat (RTE) dips and spreads. The assignment sought to estimate the presence of Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes in these products as part of the FDA's ongoing effort to proactively ensure food safety and remove adulterated product from the market. From March 2021 to January 2022, the FDA collected and tested a total of 747 samples of refrigerated, multi-commodity RTE dips and spreads that contain ingredients such as sesame, vegetables, cheese, and seafood. The agency detected Salmonella spp. in one sample of hummus and Listeria monocytogenes in three dip and cheese spread samples.

IFT Report Recommends Collaboration and Innovation to Advance Food Traceability May 17, 2023: The Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) has released a report commissioned by the FDA that evaluates food traceability trends based on 90 submissions from teams that participated in FDA's 2021 Low- or No-Cost Tech-Enabled Traceability Challenge. This report is intended to contribute to ongoing industry discussions about the role of technology in food traceability and provide high-level recommendations to key stakeholders on advancing the tech-enabled traceability landscape. Specifically, IFT seeks to answer how improvements in interoperability, support and infrastructure, usability, and cost could provide opportunities for future traceability advances. IFT determined that the knowledge, means, and technology have been developed to make end-to-end tech-enabled traceability a reality, but it will not be realized without collective action and continued innovation among the diverse food industry community. Furthermore, developing low-cost traceability solutions that are intuitive to all levels of experience, available in multiple languages, promote the use of data standards and data communication protocols, and consider applicability to specific supply chain segments or commodities are critical for advancing traceability.

Historically, outbreaks associated with queso fresco type cheeses were found to be associated with unpasteurized milk; however, recent investigations have found these cheeses have been made from pasteurized milk with contamination occurring during the cheese making process. The prevention strategy reflects a review of outbreak findings, historical data and stakeholder engagement with industry and other stakeholders to identify public health interventions that can be taken to reduce future incidences of foodborne illness linked to soft fresh QFT cheeses. As part of the prevention strategy the FDA has also released a fact sheet to help manufacturers of soft queso fresco-type cheeses better understand food safety risks the can occur during production.

FDA Updates Protocol for the Development and Registration of Treatments for Preharvest Agricultural Water January 6, 2023: The FDA has worked with the EPA to update the protocol to remove Listeria monocytogenes from the organism test panel. This change is being made because pilot studies have found that sanitizer treatments that will likely be effective for E. coli and Salmonella may be different from those that are most effective for L. monocytogenes. This is likely due to the physical characteristics of E. coli and Salmonella being distinctly different from those of L. monocytogenes. In light of recent outbreaks of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) and Salmonella linked to produce, FDA and EPA agreed and decided to move forward with removing L. monocytogenes from the panel. We expect that doing so will facilitate the registration of antimicrobial treatments against STECs (and other E. coli) and Salmonella in pre-harvest agricultural water, the availability of which will be a significant resource for farms to protect their crops against these pathogens. Companies may opt to continue testing against L. monocytogenes for inclusion in their registration with EPA.

FDA Reminds Manufacturers of Effective Date for Sesame as a Major Food Allergen December 15, 2022: The FDA is reminding manufacturers that effective January 1, 2023, foods containing sesame will be subject to specific food allergen regulatory requirements, including labeling and manufacturing requirements. Sesame is joining the list of major food allergens defined in the law as the result of the FASTER Act, which was signed into law April 23, 2021. Sesame joins eight other major food allergens: milk, eggs, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybeans. FDA reminds consumers that foods already in interstate commerce before 2023, including those on retail shelves, do not need to be removed from the marketplace or relabeled to declare sesame as an allergen. So depending on shelf life, some food products may not have allergen labeling for sesame on the effective date. Consumers should check with the manufacturer if they are not sure whether a food product contains sesame.

Advancing Food Safety Culture as Science Not a Slogan: A Systematic Literature Review December 12, 2022: Today, the FDA released a systematic review of the scientific literature on food safety culture (FSC) as a foundation for the FDA's work on food safety culture with industry, consumers and within the agency. A total of 79 articles met eligibility criteria for the review and are included in this analysis. The FDA conducted the literature review to better understand the latest science of FSC, including how it is defined, how it is developed and maintained by various organizations, and how it is assessed or measured. While food safety culture is defined in various ways in the literature, the review identified the most frequently cited definition of FSC as the aggregation of the prevailing, relatively constant, learned, shared attitudes, values and beliefs contributing to the hygiene behaviors used within a particular food handling environment (Griffith, Livesey, and Clayton 2010). The literature review also identified numerous key determinants that contribute to an FSC, as well as challenges and barriers to establishing and maintaining a strong and effective FSC. The FDA will use this research to inform its continued efforts in support of food safety culture.

Foods subject to the final rule requirements appear on the Food Traceability List (FTL). The FTL includes fresh cut fruits and vegetables, shell eggs, and nut butters, as well as certain fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, ready-to-eat deli salads, cheeses, and seafood products. At the core of the final rule is a requirement that persons who manufacture, process, pack or hold food on the FTL maintain records including Key Data Elements related to Critical Tracking Events. The final rule provides full and partial exemptions for some entities and foods, such as certain small producers, small retail food establishments and restaurants, farms that sell food directly to consumers, and foods that receive certain types of processing, among others. The final rule can be [reviewed here](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2022-24417/requirements-for-additional-traceability-records-for-certain-foods).

As part of this effort the FDA is announcing targeted sampling of leafy greens grown on farms and ranches during the fall 2022 harvest season in the Salinas Valley region of California, releasing results from a 2021 sampling assignment, and providing an update on other work under the action plan. During the fall 2022 harvest season the FDA plans to collect about 240 lettuce samples at farms/ranches in the Salinas Valley. These farms/ranches were identified by traceback investigations in recent years as being potentially associated with a foodborne illness outbreak in which lettuce or leafy greens were the likely or suspect food vehicle. The FDA also may collect environmental samples such as water, soil, and scat, as appropriate, based on observations made at the time of sampling and a farm/ranch's past inspection history. All samples will be tested for Salmonella spp. and E. coli O157:H7 and sampling will begin in mid-September 2022 and run through October 2022. In 2021, the FDA conducted a different leafy greens sampling assignment and is releasing a [summary report of the results](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnks.gd%2Fl%2FeyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDEsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjA5MDguNjM0MDU4MzEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5mZGEuZ292L2Zvb2Qvc2FtcGxpbmctcHJvdGVjdC1mb29kLXN1cHBseS9taWNyb2Jpb2xvZ2ljYWwtc3VydmVpbGxhbmNlLXNhbXBsaW5nLWZ5MjEtY29sbGVjdGlvbi1hbmQtdGVzdGluZy1sZXR0dWNlLWdyb3duLXNhbGluYXMtdmFsbGV5LWNhP3V0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1nb3ZkZWxpdmVyeSJ9.VqrHJOgn6veAbukvkkOM_2L2KizYVLmrpI3M5doadiQ%2Fs%2F1255716660%2Fbr%2F143701678558-l&data=05%7C01%7Cstephanie.brown%40oregonstate.edu%7Caad03fe46af743de6fc908da91b7cbad%7Cce6d05e13c5e4d6287a84c4a2713c113%7C0%7C0%7C637982516102227150%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=Dl0ejdwuOlzgtHYiL%2B%2FILDDMWYsHsDKA2GFXfsc6j5s%3D&reserved=0).

FDA Works to Enhance the Safety of Berries July 22, 2022: Consistent with the FDA's commitment to enhance produce safety, the FDA is developing a food safety prevention strategy to enhance the safety of fresh and frozen berries. The strategy is being developed in response to a history of hepatitis A (HAV) and norovirus (NoV) outbreaks linked to the consumption of both fresh and frozen berries. Much like ongoing prevention work for other commodities, such as leafy greens, tahini, and imported specialty mushrooms, the food safety prevention strategy for berries will be informed by the findings of surveillance sampling. In August, the FDA plans to resume an assignment to collect and test frozen berries that it paused at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The assignment seeks to estimate the prevalence of HAV and NoV in frozen strawberries, raspberries and blackberries and help the FDA identify sites where practices or conditions may exist that constitute safety vulnerabilities. To date, the FDA has collected and tested more than 1,100 samples under this assignment and plans to collect and test about 427 more to meet the assignment's public health goals. The agency does not plan to collect or test any additional frozen strawberries as we have already met our collection target for that commodity. FDA Proposes Compliance Date Extension for Pre-Harvest Agricultural Water Requirements July 18, 2022: Today the FDA issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking to extend the compliance dates for the pre-harvest agricultural water provisions as outlined in the recent 2021 [agricultural water proposed rule](https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnks.gd%2Fl%2FeyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJidWxsZXRpbl9saW5rX2lkIjoxMDAsInVyaSI6ImJwMjpjbGljayIsImJ1bGxldGluX2lkIjoiMjAyMjA3MTguNjA5MTg4ODEiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5mZGEuZ292L2Zvb2QvZm9vZC1zYWZldHktbW9kZXJuaXphdGlvbi1hY3QtZnNtYS9mc21hLXByb3Bvc2VkLXJ1bGUtYWdyaWN1bHR1cmFsLXdhdGVyP3V0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1nb3ZkZWxpdmVyeSJ9.s-Z3febskKZSpcp2wb44IMqrZuWOEYSUGJ4Ub4SIzHM%2Fs%2F1255716660%2Fbr%2F141199356439-l&data=05%7C01%7Cstephanie.brown%40oregonstate.edu%7Cd6846019073e4ffef82a08da68d64782%7Cce6d05e13c5e4d6287a84c4a2713c113%7C0%7C0%7C637937566770283987%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=T0st7sDHNMZqSv92s8qfC%2BTZSU%2F%2Bp%2Fvw3OoLwjwgc7Y%3D&reserved=0). The 2021 agricultural water proposed rule, if finalized, will require farms to conduct annual systems-based agricultural water assessments to determine and guide appropriate measures to minimize potential risks associated with pre-harvest agricultural water. The FDA is now proposing extended compliance dates for those proposed pre-harvest requirements and is also providing clarifying information about the enforcement discretion policy for the harvest and post-harvest agricultural water requirements. The supplemental rulemaking proposes to establish the following compliance dates for the pre-harvest agricultural water requirements for covered produce other than sprouts: - 2 years and 9 months after the effective date of a final rule for very small businesses; - 1 year and 9 months after the effective date of a final rule for small businesses; and - 9 months after the effective date of a final rule for all other businesses. Compliance Dates for Harvest and Post-Harvest Agricultural Water Requirements- The 2021 pre-harvest agricultural water proposed rule did not propose substantive changes to the harvest and post-harvest agricultural water requirements in the Produce Safety Rule; however, the FDA recognizes that prior to the proposal, stakeholders did not have clarity on whether FDA might propose to change the harvest and post-harvest agricultural water requirements. In addition, the FDA recognizes that adequate training and technical assistance are needed to fully recognize the benefits of the harvest and post-harvest requirements. Therefore, we intend to continue enforcement discretion for the harvest and post-harvest agricultural water requirements of the Produce Safety regulation until the following dates: - January 26, 2025, for very small businesses; - January 26, 2024, for small businesses; and - January 26, 2023, for all other businesses. FDA is reopening the comment period only with respect to the proposed compliance dates for the pre-harvest agricultural water provisions until September 19, 2022. Comments should be submitted to docket FDA-2021-N-0471 on Regulations.gov.

The scientists found that E. coli O157:H7 survived significantly better in cold-stored packaged romaine harvested in the fall than on the same varieties harvested in late spring. The research team also demonstrated that the microbiome present on bagged romaine differed by season, lettuce deterioration state, and whether the survival of E. coli O157:H7 on the lettuce was high or low. For example, the team found that E.coli O157:H7 survived better in lettuce that was harvested in the fall than lettuce harvested in the spring during cold storage.

Use of the tool is optional. If finalized, the proposed rule would require farms to conduct systems-based agricultural water assessments to determine and guide appropriate measures to minimize potential risks associated with pre-harvest agricultural water. The assessment would include an evaluation of the water system, agricultural water use practices, crop characteristics, environmental conditions, potential impacts on source water by activities conducted on adjacent and nearby land, and other relevant factors, such as the results of optional testing. Covered farms would be required to conduct pre-harvest agricultural water assessments annually, and whenever a significant change occurs that affects the likelihood that a known or reasonably foreseeable hazard will be introduced into or onto produce or food contact surfaces. The Agricultural Water Assessment Builder prompts users to answer questions and/or fill in information specific to their farms. Information entered into the tool is not shared with the FDA and will not be saved. However, users have the opportunity save or print the information they provide to their local computers.

FDA Releases Summary Report on Multi-year Processed Avocado and Guacamole Sampling Assignment March 16, 2022: Today the FDA released findings from a sampling assignment that collected and tested processed avocado and guacamole from November 2017 to September 2019. The assignment sought to estimate the prevalence of Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes in processed avocado and guacamole as part of the FDA's ongoing effort to proactively ensure food safety and prevent contaminated food from reaching consumers. During the assignment the FDA collected and tested a total of 887 samples of both domestic and imported processed avocado and guacamole. The agency detected Salmonella spp. in two samples, which were later determined to be distinct samples of the same brand of domestically manufactured guacamole. The FDA detected Listeria monocytogenes in 15 samples. Following whole genome sequencing conducted on the pathogens detected, the agency determined in the case of each positive that either there was no linkage to any clinical illnesses or that the available epidemiological information was inconclusive with respect to the food or other vehicle involved in the illnesses.

FDA Issues Guidance on Enforcement Discretion Policies for Certain FSMA Regulations March 11, 2022: Today the FDA issued guidance on its intent not to enforce certain provisions of five rules that implement the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA). As FDA began implementation of these rules, they received questions and comments from stakeholders regarding specific provisions. In certain situations the FDA has determined it is appropriate to take time to consider options, including rulemaking, to address concerns raised by stakeholders, while continuing to protect public health. As FDA works on solutions, the agency does not intend to enforce these provisions as they currently apply to entities or activities addressed in the guidance.

FDA Proposes Changes to Agricultural Water Requirements in the Produce Safety Rule December 2, 2021: Today, the FDA published a proposed rule that would revise subpart E of the FDA FSMA Produce Safety Rule to change certain pre-harvest agricultural water requirements for covered produce other than sprouts. Under this proposal, farms would be required to conduct annual systems-based agricultural water assessments to determine and guide appropriate measures to minimize potential risks associated with pre-harvest agricultural water. The assessment would include an evaluation of the water system, agricultural water use practices, crop characteristics, environmental conditions, potential impacts on source water by activities conducted on adjacent and nearby land, and other relevant factors, such as the results of optional testing. For more information, please visit the FSMA [Proposed Rule on Agricultural Water](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-proposed-rule-agricultural-water?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) webpage and the [Federal Register proposed rule](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2021-26127/standards-for-the-growing-harvesting-packing-and-holding-of-produce-for-human-consumption-relating?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) webpage. FDA Issues Final Rule for Laboratory Accreditation for Analyses of Foods December 1, 2021: Today, the FDA issued a final rule establishing the Laboratory Accreditation for Analyses of Foods (LAAF) program as required by the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA).

October FY 2019 Pesticide Report: Consistent with Trends Over the Past 8 Years, Pesticide Residue Levels Remain Low October 20, 2021: The FDA has issued its annual Pesticide Residue Monitoring Program Report for FY 2019. They tested for 812 pesticides and industrial chemicals across 4,692 total samples and the majority of samples had pesticide residues below the limits (known as \"tolerances\") set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These results are consistent with the trend of low levels of pesticide residue violations over the past 8 years.

Release of 2019 Annual Report on the Sources of Foodborne Illness by the Interagency Food Safety Analytics Collaboration October 15, 2021: In an ongoing effort to understand sources of foodborne illness in the U.S., the Interagency Food Safety Analytics Collaboration (IFSAC) collects and analyzes foodborne illness outbreak data for four pathogens - Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157, Listeria monocytogenes, and Campylobacter - and specific foods and food categories that are responsible for foodborne illnesses in the U.S. The data are analyzed by calendar year and released in an annual report. The CDC estimates that, together, these four pathogens cause nearly two million cases of foodborne illnesses in the U.S. each year. IFSAC's newest annual report, \"Foodborne illness source attribution estimates for 2019 for Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157, Listeria monocytogenes, and Campylobacter using multi-year outbreak surveillance data, United States,\" is now available and can be viewed [here](https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/ifsac/pdf/P19-2019-report-TriAgency-508.pdf?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery). FDA Encourages Food and Agriculture Workers to Get Vaccinated Against Flu and COVID-19 October 14, 2021: The FDA encourages food and agricultural workers to protect themselves by getting an annual flu vaccination and a COVID-19 vaccination. Throughout the pandemic, millions of workers on the front lines of processing, preparing, selling, and delivering food for humans and animals have remained steadfast and on the job. Right now, the best protection for these workers, their family, their workplace(s), and their community, is to get vaccinated against both the seasonal flu and COVID-19. CDC recommends that adults and children 6 months of age and older get a flu vaccine by the end of October, ideally before flu activity starts. To learn more about how and where to get a flu shot, contact your doctor or employer and visit: [www.cdc.gov/flu](/www.cdc.gov/flu). When an essential worker is vaccinated against the flu and COVID-19, they protect themselves, their families, co-workers, and their communities. Healthy workers help to ensure the availability of a safe and nutritious food supply. For more information, please visit: [www.cdc.gov/flu](/www.cdc.gov/flu) or [www.vaccines.gov](/www.vaccines.gov).

The agency will test the samples for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), including E. coli O157:H7, and Salmonella spp. as part of ongoing surveillance efforts following reoccurring outbreaks linked to this region, including most recently in the fall of 2020. The FDA assignment will direct sampling to be conducted at commercial cooling and cold storage facilities where field heat is removed from harvested lettuce and where product is cold-stored before processing. Sampling may include pre-cooled product (preferred) or post-cooled product. Sample collection at commercial coolers helps the FDA efficiently obtain samples from multiple farms at centralized locations and facilitates prompt traceback and follow-up if contamination is detected. The agency plans to collect and test a total of approximately 500 post-harvest samples of iceberg, leaf and romaine lettuce. Each sample will consist of 10 subsamples, each made up of one head of lettuce (trimmed, cored and possibly wrapped), or in the case of romaine lettuce, loose leaves or one package of hearts. FDA laboratories will conduct all testing. The FDA will take extra precautions to help ensure the safety of agency investigators and firm employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. FDA investigators will preannounce their visits to firms per the Agency's COVID-19 safety practices. They will be outfitted with personal protective equipment and will carry out their work while adhering to local, state and applicable CDC guidance. FDA Opens Industry Portal for FSVP Records Submission May 10, 2021: Today, the FDA opened the [FSVP Importer Portal for FSVP Records Submission](https://www.access.fda.gov/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery) for importers of human and animal and human food into the U.S. The FDA established the Portal to serve as a dedicated, streamlined way for importers to submit FSVP records electronically to the FDA, if they choose. The FDA Foreign Supplier Verification Programs for Food Importers (FSVP), requires importers to perform certain risk-based activities to verify that their foreign suppliers are producing food in accordance with U.S. food safety standards. The FDA typically conducts inspections of FSVP records at an importer's place of business. However, if requested in writing by the FDA, the FSVP regulation requires importers to provide FSVP records to the agency electronically, or through another means that delivers the records promptly. Importers with an active FDA Account ID and password can access the Portal on the FDA's Unified Registration and Listing System (FURLS) page. FDA Releases Report on Foodborne Illness Risk Factors in Delis May 7, 2021: The FDA has released its report on a study of foodborne illness risk factors in retail food store deli departments.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) Update: FDA Outlines Inspection and Assessment Activities During Pandemic, Roadmap for Future State of Operations May 5, 2021: Today, the FDA issued a new report titled, \" [Resiliency Roadmap for FDA Inspectional Oversight](https://www.fda.gov/media/148197/download?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery),\" outlining the agency's inspectional activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and its detailed plan to move toward a more consistent state of operations, including the FDA's priorities related to this work going forward. In March 2020, the FDA announced that it was temporarily postponing all domestic and foreign routine surveillance facility inspections, while continuing mission critical inspections when possible. Beginning the week of July 20, 2020, the FDA began to work toward resuming prioritized domestic inspections using its COVID-19 Advisory Rating system. The report outlines inspections that the agency was unable to complete during the past year due to travel restrictions or inability to ensure the safety of our workforce or the workforces the agency regulates. The report also outlines the number of mission-critical inspections the agency completed during that time including the response to foodborne disease outbreaks or other food safety risks such as undeclared allergens. Additionally, the report outlines the FDA's continued successful use of alternative tools and approaches where inspections were or are not currently feasible, including remote interactive evaluations (e.g., remote livestreaming video of operations, teleconferences or screen sharing), record requests and leveraging information from trusted regulatory partners. The report further outlines the ongoing steps the agency is taking in order to resume standard operational levels of inspection activities, including how it intends to prioritize domestic and foreign inspections that were not performed during the pandemic. The plan highlights a variety of possible scenarios given the continued uncertainty of the trajectory of the ongoing pandemic. Inspections considered critical to the FDA's mission will remain the primary focus. When planning routine surveillance inspections, the agency will prioritize higher-risk establishments. Therefore, a longer interval between inspections will occur for the less high-risk facilities as the FDA adjusts to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This means that postponed inspections will be prioritized based on risk and conducted over a longer period of time, ultimately increasing the amount of time between inspections of certain lower-risk facilities.

The samples will be tested for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and Salmonella spp. as part of ongoing surveillance efforts following the spring 2018 multistate E. coli O157:H7 outbreak of foodborne illness linked to romaine lettuce from the Yuma agricultural region. Salmonella spp. also commonly causes foodborne illness outbreaks in the United States which have at times been linked to romaine lettuce consumption. The FDA plans to begin collecting samples of romaine lettuce from commercial coolers in February and intends to continue sampling through the end of the romaine harvest season in Yuma. The FDA assignment will focus on commercial cooler and cold storage facilities where field heat is removed from harvested romaine and where product is cold stored before processing and shipment. The focus on these sites enables the FDA to efficiently collect samples from multiple farms at centralized locations, following a similar model used during an assignment conducted in FY19.

January FDA Adds Clarifying Descriptions to the Food Traceability List; Publishes FAQ on Food Traceability Proposed Rule January 12, 2021: The FDA has made two updates to its materials for stakeholders regarding the [Food Traceability Proposed Rule](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/fsma-proposed-rule-food-traceability?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery). First, the agency has made clarifying edits to the [Food Traceability List (FTL)](https://www.fda.gov/food/food-safety-modernization-act-fsma/food-traceability-list?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery), which lists the foods for which the additional traceability recordkeeping requirements in the proposed rule would apply. The edits to certain commodity descriptions were made for clarity and do not reflect a change in which foods are on the FTL. All of the specific edits are described in a memo titled [\"Food Traceability List for 'Requirements for Additional Traceability Records for Certain Foods' Proposed Rule- Clarified Language](https://www.fda.gov/media/145050/download?utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery).\" Second, the FDA has published an FAQ, addressing questions that the agency has received about the proposed rule (e.g. during the public meetings, through the FSMA Technical Assistance Network, and during other outreach engagements) to assist stakeholders who are considering providing feedback during the comment period, which has been extended until February 22, 2021.

FDA Signals that it Intends to Extend Comment Period for the Food Traceability Information Collections Provisions November 18, 2020: During the second public meeting to discuss the proposed traceability rule, the FDA expressed their intent to extend the comment period for the information collection provisions that is set to close on November 23rd. FDA also is considering whether to provide any extension of the comment period for the proposed rule. After hearing concerns from several stakeholders that more time is needed to adequately review and analyze the information collection provisions with consideration to the entire proposed rule, the agency intends to formally announce an extension to the comment period for these provisions in a forthcoming notice in the Federal Register. Some stakeholders also have asked the FDA to extend the comment period for the proposed rule, which is currently slated to close on January 21, 2021. Any extension of the proposed rule comment period would be announced through a notice in the Federal Register and issuance of a Constituent Update. FDA Issues Draft Guidance for Industry on Voluntary Disclosure of Sesame When Added as Flavoring or Spice November 10, 2020: Today, the FDA issued a draft guidance for voluntary sesame labeling to encourage manufacturers to clearly declare sesame in the ingredient list, when it is used as a \"flavoring\" or \"spice\" or when the common or usual name (such as tahini) does not specify sesame. This voluntary labeling guidance to industry aims to help consumers who are allergic or sensitive to sesame to avoid these products. Sesame is not one of the eight major food allergens required by the 2004 Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA) to be included in specific allergen labeling, but in most cases, it does have to appear in the ingredient statement. An exception is when sesame is part of a flavoring or spice. In those cases, it may be declared as simply \"spice\" or \"flavor\" on the label without requiring \"sesame\" to be included, so its presence may not be obvious to consumers.

Comments for this draft guidance are being accepted through January 11, 2021.

FDA Updates Health and Personal Hygiene Handbook for Food Employees October 7, 2020: The FDA has released an updated version of the Employee Health and Personal Hygiene Handbook for retail food managers and food employees. The handbook includes best practices and behaviors that can help prevent food employees from spreading bacteria and viruses, such as Salmonella and norovirus, that cause foodborne illness. This handbook has been revised to include updates from the 2017 Food Code. While the Food Code does not address respiratory illness, such as COVID19, the Employee Health section emphasizes long-standing public health principles for preventing disease transmission - hand washing; excluding ill employees from the workplace, prohibiting bare-hand contact with ready-to-eat foods; and reporting of illness and symptoms, among others. Along with several updates to the text, including procedures on how to respond to vomiting or diarrheal events, the handbook also highlights effective interventions to prevent the transmission of foodborne viruses and bacteria on food and food-contact surfaces.
