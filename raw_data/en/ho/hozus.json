About Dr. Sheba Roy Sheba S. Roy, ND FABNO was born in Detroit, raised a portion of each year in Africa and the other in the States. Roy left Michigan following her high school graduation from Cranbrook Kingswood, for Calcutta, India where she lived and worked with Mother Teresa, in pediatric hospice. She returned to the U.S. to matriculate the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, where she double majored in biological anthropology and print journalism. While still a university student, Roy traveled and studied extensively overseas in Eastern Europe and in East Africa. Following graduation, Roy returned to Calcutta, to work in adult hospice. Inspired by work in death and dying, she matriculated into Harvard University's post-baccalaureate, pre-med program. She graduated pre med from the Health Careers Program at Harvard University Extension. Prior to matriculation medical school, Roy was accepted on academic scholarship to a masters in public health policy at Johns Hopkins University. Concurrent with her first year at Hopkins, Roy served as the educational coordinator for the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America, MD/ DE chapter. In addition to designing educational programming for inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer patients, she ran nine patient peer support groups. Motivated by what she saw and heard and patients who persisted in asking about alternatives to drug management and natural therapy for side effects, Roy withdrew from Hopkins to pursue her doctorate in natural medicine. She was accepted by Bastyr University for a doctoral degree that combines traditional didactic and clinical medical curriculum with evidenced-informed complementary and alternative medicine. Roy pursued additional clinical hours in internal medicine at St. Joseph Medical Center in Detroit, non consecutive. Roy was one of a handful of graduates nationwide to be accepted to fellowship in integrative oncology; and the only graduate, nationwide, to be accepted to the program at Cancer Treatment Centers of America, Eastern Regional Medical Center in Philadelphia. While a fellow, Roy made significant clinical contributions to the field in the development of protocols for bowel regulation and co-management of bowel protocol pre and post, heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy. Roy is currently boarded in the interaction between natural therapies and drugs in a cancer setting and is one of approximately 75 fellows of the American Board of Naturopathic Oncology practicing in the U.S. and Canada. Roy left Eastern Regional Medical Center in Philadelphia to join Beaumont Hospitals Integrative Medicine department under Oncology Services. Roy worked at the Royal Oak and Troy campuses and was instrumental in establishing the Gross Pointe location. She left Beaumont to found a private practice in Bloomfield Hills that reflects a holistic model of care. Roy has received honors for humanitarian work, the most notable being a prayer medallion from Missionaries of Charity for work done in service of the 'blessed poor'. As a board specialist in naturopathic oncology, Roy is committed to advancing the leading edge of healthcare. Her goal is to bring the highest standard of care to those that face this life-threatening illness, by meeting both patient and provider needs to have a trustworthy liaison between conventional management and complementary care. Cancer behaves differently in each individual. Dr. Roy does not provide alternatives to cancer care. She augments the care that exists, to get you the best of evidenced based outcomes.
