You hear holistic and herbal, homeopathic and natural. What does it all mean? Herbal and homeopathic treatments are actually quite different, but both can be a great alternative to pharmaceuticals or over the counter drugs. Herbal medicine is the easier of the two to understand so I say we start there. It is simply the use of plants to treat a problem. Using herbs differs from using plant derived drugs such as Aspirin (which is derived from Willow bark) because in the case of plant derived drugs, the one active chemical is isolated and often synthesized, and that is all that is used. When using herbs you are dealing with all the chemical compounds of the plant and this is why science can not always explain why or how a medicinal herb works. Herbs can be taken in a number of ways but the most popular are tinctures, teas and capsules. Capsules are typically an empty capsule filled with a dried or freeze dried herb crushed up inside. Teas are made by steeping the herb in hot water and a tincture is an alcohol distilled liquid concentrate of the herb. It is important to remember that herbs and supplements can interact with conditions, drugs or even other herbs and supplements so always let your healthcare practitioner know what drugs you are on and what conditions you have. Homeopathy is quite different and a bit confusing. A homeopathic remedy is made by taking the ingredient and diluting it hundreds or thousands of times until there are actually no molecules of that ingredient left. Science is still not quite sure exactly how it works, but recent discoveries have shown that this process seems to physically change the water to carry some properties of the active ingredient. When choosing a homeopathic remedy there are combinations, which are usually marketed for different ailments such as cold or pain and there are singles, which are only one ingredient. All of these work on a \"treat like with like\" system. This means that you will be given something that creates similar symptoms to what is wrong with you, but that your body might have an easier time recognising or understanding how to respond to. Due to the way they are made, homeopathic remedies are considered totally safe. Since there is no active ingredient per se in them, you can not overdose. It is an interesting concept for sure. I hope this shed some light on some of the drug alternatives available for your ailments.
