Northumbria's [vision of becoming a \"challenger\" university](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/northumbria-university-quits-university-alliance) offering a \"credible alternative to more established institutions\" was first set out in 2008 and was completed in 2021 with a Research Excellence Framework submission that recorded the [biggest rise in research power of any UK university](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/research-intensive-post-92s-can-drive-levelling) for the [second REF in a row](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/ref-2014-winners-who-performed-best/2017591.article), a measure that reflects academic strength across the campus. But the judges noted that Northumbria had not lost sight of its role within its city and region, drawing 40 per cent of undergraduates under the age of 21 from widening participation backgrounds and placing as many graduates into highly skilled employment across the north-east as all the Russell Group institutions combined. \"The scale of [Northumbria's] ambition, the rigour and effectiveness with which it has been pursued, and its role in transforming lives and supporting its region all make it a deserving winner,\" the panel said. The awards - dubbed the \"Oscars of higher education\" and now in their 18th year - span 20 categories covering the full range of university activities. This year's winners, focusing on achievements at UK and Irish institutions during 2020-21, were announced at a ceremony at the Hilton London Metropole hotel.

The citation hailed how she had \"broken through the ivory tower's walls and brought her unique enthusiasm for her subject - and crucially, what it can teach us about contemporary life and politics - to the world\", through television programmes and public commentary. Other big winners included [Dublin City University](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/dublin-city-university), which took the honours for Outstanding Estates Team and for Widening Participation or Outreach Initiative of the Year; and the [University of Reading](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-reading), which was victorious in the Research Project of the Year: STEM and in the Outstanding Technician of the Year categories. John Gill, THE's editor, said that even though the Covid-19 pandemic had significantly disrupted the 2020-21 academic year, the entries demonstrated how institutions had \"focused on the core missions of universities to deliver world-changing research, life-changing teaching, and all the other ways in which they engage and support communities, regions and countries\". \"There is little sense...that these were universities struggling through such exceptional times. Instead, the picture that is painted is of a sector that has risen to the occasion with skill and confidence, and refused to be pushed off course,\" Mr Gill said. This year's awards attracted more than 550 entries, with over 70 institutions and teams making the shortlists.
