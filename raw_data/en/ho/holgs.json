Erectile Dysfunction (ED) is one of the most ignored disorders even though it can be addressed in very simple ways at the initial stages. However, most people ignore the symptoms or get confused with normal stress-related issues. Sometimes people are not able to act due to shyness or in absence of the right information. Besides active sexual life, Erectile dysfunction should not be ignored because of the following reasons. - Many times ED is an early symptom of other diseases such as blood flow-related issues. ED can be instrumental in the early diagnosis of forthcoming health issues. - Untreated ED slowly and gradually starts impacting the self-confidence and self-esteem of men which further starts impacting day-to-day personal and professional life. With the right actions at the right time, you can avoid not only many forthcoming medical issues but also live life without missing one of the most important parts of life i.e. sexual life.

By the time you complete the reading, you will have a clear roadmap to guide you on moving forward irrespective of how old the ED problem is and how many times you have failed to correct the disorder. Before we start the discussion, Let's first understand what the ED is and what are the factors one should consider while choosing a treatment option. Table of Contents Important Factors to consider before choosing option for Erectile Dysfunction Treatment which is right for you. The following factors will help you to make an informed decision for choosing the right treatment options for you. These are the factors that will definitely come to your mind at some point in time. So it's better to consider these factors proactively before taking any decision. 1. Sustainability ( Short term vs Long Term results): You should definitely understand whether the results generated by treatment or medicine are going to be temporary, short-lived, or have an effect for the long term. There are a few products/ medications which are effective, ranging from 1 time to 1 month to a few months to a few years. What's really important is that you should know which treatment option will remain effective for how many days/months or years. Most people believe to go for options with long-lasting effects. 2. Waiting time for results: Waiting time is one of the crucial parameters for ED treatment. There are some options which give results in a couple of hours and there are few which will give results in months. Typically people want fast results as long as there are no side effects and results are comparable. This is another factor like cost which should be considered with results before choosing any option. 3. Natural feeling Vs Artificial feeling: Anything which doesn't give a natural feeling before and during sex is typically what people tend to avoid. Any treatment option which gives the natural feeling is better as sexual intercourse is not just a mechanical exercise but a blend of an emotional and physical activity that gives required satisfaction. Again, condoms are a good example. Few males try to avoid it because of a lack of natural feelings. 4. Side Effects: You should consider the possible side effects as one of the considerations before choosing a treatment option. Anything - products/medicine/therapy which has a high probability to cause bigger damage to the body in the short term or in the long run are definitely better to avoid. 5. Cost: The treatment cost is an important factor that you should keep in mind. Anything which is costly and not affordable, people tend to avoid that. However, there are few people who believe results are more important than cost. However, what fits your budget and fulfills your needs is what is definitely recommended. 6. Dependency building on treatment: Any product/medicine/therapy starts making your sexual life dependent on them. Slowly and gradually you will realize that you are not able to perform without them at all. In general, people tend to avoid products that have a tendency to make you dependent. These products are like an addiction. You first take some substances for temporary joy and later you can't live without them. 7. Ease of Use: Another factor to compare is how easy or difficult to use the product/medicines/ treatment option. Pills and medicines are generally considered easy to use whereas devices that need to perform something just before the sex are considered a disruption in a flow. At times, people consider wearing a condom also a disruption in the flow.
