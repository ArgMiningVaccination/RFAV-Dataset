Before the cleanse I was living on coffee, granola, cookies, vegetarian take-out, vegan ice cream, and weekly cappuccinos and croissants. I was addicted to caffeine and sugar. I wasn't cooking. I wasn't feeling good. Now, forty days later, I am joyfully in the kitchen, either cooking or preparing raw meals daily; I have no cravings for caffeine, sugar, wheat or dairy. I learned the community of good food. The Facebook group during the cleanse was my favorite reading. The cooking demonstrations from Nirbhe Kaur taught me so much- many recipes and how to bring lightness and love to it. My meditation practice feels deeper. I'm calmer and have less arthritic pain. I'm going to keep going. Thank you Mahan Rishi and Nirbhe Kaur for this beautiful transformational journey. Your sincerity, lightness and wisdom from our classes continue to guide and inspire me.\" - May 2021 Spring Cleanse Leslie G. \"This was the first time I signed up for the fall cleanse. I had no idea what to expect. I am so pleased to say that after one month, my entire outlook on eating, meditating and daily pranayama has changed in so many positive ways! In fact, the effects on my outlook and energy levels were so great that I have continued with the program into the following months. Mahan Rishi and Nirbhe Kaur made everything seem possible! Their support and effort they put into the program were invaluable. Thank you to both of you for the inspiration! Hugs and love, Fran L Fall Cleanse 2022 \"These cleanses with you and Nirbhe Kaur have been the most influential experiences for me. I have stayed committed, seen tangible results, and most importantly, have taken advantage of the opportunity to go within and clear out old thoughts, habits and emotions that were ready to move through. I hope to be cleansing with you for the next one! Much love and gratitude\" Jen K Fall Cleanse 2022 \"Highly recommend Cleansing with Mahan Rishi. It was Mahan Rishi who got me off gluten and diary almost 15 years ago. This changed my life. What a journey its' been. I joined Mahan Rishi's Cleanse last March 2017 - 40 days - this way of eating continues on into 2018. Feel great. Lots of energy. Clear thoughts and direction. Creating better health starts in the kitchen. Not the gym. Forever grateful to Mahan Rishi and Nirbhe Kaur for their love, support and guidance. Wahe Guru!!!!\" Julie S \"Sometimes the cleanse can be challenging but with the ongoing support of Mahan Rishi and Nirbhe Kaur along with their positive encouragement it's very manageable.

This work has changed my perception of food, diet and eating. It has changed my relationship to the food I eat and the liquids I drink, for the better. I have more energy. My weight dropped 20 pounds. My blood pressure dropped significantly. I am happy I did this work and plan to continue on this path.\" Hanan I November 2017 \"The effects were noticeable in the first week. This really opened my eyes to alternative ways of eating, and experimenting with new choices that are so healthy and delicious. I was really pleased with the mental aspect of the cleanse first thing in the morning....a great way to start the day.\" November 2017 \"Highly recommend Cleansing with Mahan Rishi.

It is setting now a template for the long term. I feel blessed to have the loving guidance of Mahan Rishi and Nirbhe Kaur. Thank you\" Pooh W May 2019 \"This was probably my 5th cleanse and with each one the benefits to my overall health have increased. I would personally recommend this program. The Khalsa Healing Arts and Yoga Center have had a significant effect in my maintaining good health. Their motto of \"it is easier to stay healthy, then to get healthy\" is a motto I personally believe and follow.\" Barbara O 85 year old participant May 2019 \"The most valuable lesson I learned from this cleanse was how little I need to depend on the food and food habits I've depended on. We tend to eat in circles - the food we eat begetting the same food and the same bad habits. But after one week, I realized how easy it was to give up some of those injurious habits for better food, more energy, and better health. And when I craved those old foods, I just drank more water! Yes, I lost weight. But more than that, I gained an understanding - that you cannot get just from hearing about it - about how easy it is to transform my eating habits. Thank you Mahan Rishi and Nirbhe Kaur.\" May 2021 Wendy P. \"This cleanse is TRULY transformational.

I was eating what I thought was a healthy diet (eating organic and very little processed foods), but what I learned from this cleanse is that there is healthy and there is HEALTHY. Letting go of coffee and meat was significantly more healthy and I realize that digestion is a key factor which by eliminating these foods improved my digestion. I am ready for part 2!!! Living, loving and being. Thank you both for this gift of a life time!\" Deb M. May 2021 \"I have incorporated good habits into my life. I appreciate you and this program for opening new doors. Alternative food Universe.!\" Donna A May 2021 \"Amazing cleanse with two amazing teachers! You will not be the same person. Day 41 and going forward. No longer craving caffeine, dairy, gluten, sugar, or alcohol. Lost seven pounds, blood pressure now 110/62. Just did blood work and total cholesterol dropped 30 points! If you want to change your way at looking at foods and have a transformation with your health, well-being and vitality - this is the cleanse for you!\" Nancy H May 2021 \"The cleanse was not just a cleanse but a new way of being in the world and thinking about one's health for beyond well beyond the 40-day period. As someone who suffered from migraines and body ache and constant exhaustion, I feel renewed and back to the energy I had pre-children. I realize one of my primal fears was going hungry or perhaps this came from having low blood pressure. If I didn't eat frequently I would start to get a headache and/or cranky. The cleanse realigned my fears but also taught me the difference between being thirsty and hungry and, I was surprised by how little food one actually needs! I have happily discovered new foods, and have become vegan. I also have eliminated sugar, alcohol, caffeine, wheat, dairy, and I don't feel I have \"given\" it up. The cleanse is not about deprivation but about an expansion of breath, life, energy and new, yummy foods. Thank you!\" Nandini S May 2021 \"For me, the spring cleanse 2021 came at the right time. I knew I was stuck in a \"loop\", and other things I have tried did not really work well for me. I needed a change, and I was ready to jump in.\" \"After 2020, my weight was up 30 pounds and I had started to take blood pressure medication two months prior to the cleanse. This is the first time I \"needed\" to take medication daily. I was also experiencing some digestive issues sour stomach/mild acid reflux. In the end, after going through the cleanse: I lost 35 pounds. My blood pressure is back to normal; I no longer need to take blood pressure medication. My digestive issues have disappeared. I gained insight as to how eating a natural diet can have a profound benefit to your health. One of the surprising benefits to eating a plant-based diet, taking a good amount of yoga classes, and walking barefoot outside everyday was how much more connected I felt to everything (the earth, animals, people...). I improved the variety of things that I eat, incorporating more vegetables into my diet and the ability to actually cook things \" Joe Z Spring Cleanse 2021 \"A wonderful journey into improved health and well-being on every level. Within an inclusive and cozy community of loving support, experience the joy of learning how to truly nourish body, mind and spirit!\" Saranbir May 2021 \"Although the cleanse was a bit challenging for me to follow with a full-time work & parenting schedule, I was able to stick to the protocol fairly well, and I felt very well-supported throughout. All my questions were answered promptly via the Facebook group, and it felt good (and motivating) to be going through the cleanse with the other participants. Having instructions for what to do every day made it easy to comply with the protocol, and I ended up losing some weight, experiencing decreased abdominal bloating (which had been a problem for me prior to the cleanse), and improved gastrointestinal functioning. I really appreciated doing this cleanse with such a positive and supportive community. Thank you!\" June 2021 Summer Solstice Radiant Blood Nicole A \"I had trepidation going into this cleanse as I was a little worried we would be just drinking celery juice and air for 40 days. The 3 steps process made the transition easy along with the guidance from Mahan Rishi and Nirbhe Kaur. The weekly check-ins with the group and private Facebook page (in order to share recipes, ask questions or touch base with the group) was also beneficial. You do need to be dedicated and take the time to prep your food, so you set yourself up for success. I work very long days and if I can do this anyone can. Overall health should be your goal, but if you are driven by numbers I lost 16 lbs in 40 days. I have never had results like that on any other program. This cleanse inspired me to keep going with my new habits, continue to try new recipes and have fun in the kitchen, and carve out a little time each day to just breathe. Thanks a million\" Katharine T May 2021 \"Sometimes the cleanse can be challenging but with the ongoing support of Mahan Rishi and Nirbhe Kaur along with their positive encouragement it's very manageable. Having acommunity of fellow cleansers makes for a richer experience.\" So grateful Deb M Summer Solstice Radiant Blood Cleanse June 2021 \"As an older person I believe that eating a healthier diet is instrumental in achieving and maintaining better health, more mobility and more youthful attitude. Job well done.\" Deb M Fall Cleanse and Immune Empowerment Program Oct 2021 \"Working with the Khalsa's during their Winter cleanse demonstrated to me how cleanses are an invaluable part of healthy living. I was able to better understand my triggers for unhealthy food choices that do not nurture or promote better health. It was not difficult to stay on the program and my results included weight loss, better glucose numbers and a plan for a continued healthy lifestyle.\" Yvette H Winter Cleanse Feb 2022 \"Thank you for your commitment with regards to meetings and cooking demonstrations. Meeting like minded people is also a great benefit!\" Deb M Winter Cleanse Feb 2022 \"An excellent cleanse program. The experience and expertise of facilitators really makes a difference. I saw significant positive changes in my blood work. I lost weight easily and naturally without much effort. I experience significant decrease in inflammation and moved more easily and fluidly. My vitality was replenished and my joints less stiff. My attitude and outlook improved too. I became a lot more aware of the effects of certain foods on my body. I am very grateful to Mahan Rishi and Nirbhe Kaur for the opportunity.\" Winter Cleanse 2022 Pam Z. \"This cleanse was exactly what I needed to make my health a top priority in my life. I was able to break unhealthy habits rather quickly, and stay motivated throughout the 40 days and beyond. I loved the yoga and meditation classes as part of the cleanse to keep me grounded and connected. Mahan Rishi and Nirbhe Kaur are masterful teachers who inspired us to be our very best. With much love and gratitude, \" Jennifer Spring Cleanse 2022 \"Great way to understand your eating habits, and live a very healthy diet for a month. Amazing cleansing and immune boosting supplements and teas that you will want to use forever! The yoga and meditation classes are very supporting and uplifting! Sat Nam!\" Nancy H Fall Cleanse 2022 \"I wanted to share feed back to the cleanse , i filled out forms but as you can see handwriting is hard to read. I really had a easy time overall. even the first week as i had mentioned my lifestyle eating habits are a recipe that needed to be changed and with no fast food or breakfast sandwiches from chicken parm dinners or calzones for dinner. alot of coffee in the morning to several beers at night. i had assumed first week would be tough but with the guide and supplements and teas it never phased me. i believe both you and nirbhe kaur with the food demonstrations really bring everything to the table. all the zoom meeting check ins were great as were the other guest hosts . the movie fat, sick and nearly dead was an inspirational opener. for the last year or so when i would get home from work my lower back would ache and i do acupuncture / chiropractor and massage. and would use heating bad in recliner. halfway through the cleanse i realized, hey i do not need this heating pad and i through it to the side. also last couple years i would cough at night and occasionally have acid reflux. but when you shared the study from japan about if your lower bowels aren't working properly the gases would come up into the lungs. and i noticed a couple weeks into cleanse that was no longer coughing at night, then yesterday when i went for physical the doctor was amazed because 1 1/2 ago my weight was up to 268 and as of now my weight is at 228 and my total cholesterol 268 and now 175, vitamin D was 30 now 60 aside from just those two so many levels that were high came down . about 8 months ago i was at another dr, who when he saw my blood work a1c 6.3 wrote 2 prescriptions one for metformin and one for a statin. i told him i would not take and i will do through lifestyle change. i told him medications are bad, that some have their place, but nature provides everything we need and the body wants to heal. So for me it's always a slow start and I was always an emotional eater as I've had a lot of loss in my life, but as i worked through all that the healthier i became. several years ago, when i first attended yoga classes at your studio and some meditation classes the true release started and has been ongoing, every now and again i need reboot just like the computers. the meditation with you opened my eyes to a whole new level as i heard you through consciousness , so i am looking forward to new levels as they appear . my personal things that i could have done better and still need to do are water intake and pranayama. Everything you provided was more than fulfilling for everyones needs. its up to the individual to follow through. sending love and light !!! all the best\" Steve T Fall Cleanse 2022 \"This was the first time I signed up for the fall cleanse.

I believe I had a clarity of my spirit during this time. Since I started eating as a clean vegan, I have eliminated all of my diabetes medication and have also gotten off of most of my other medications, with a couple of exceptions. I feel vibrant and full of energy. I no longer take medication of diabetes, cholesterol, triglycerides, blood pressure. The cleanse booklets have been very important to me. I like to information contained about the supplements and other additional information. I love being able to refer to the recipes during and after the cleanse, and during the cleanse, I can see clearly what is supposed to be on my \"plate,\" as far as food and supplements and teas. That was very helpful for me to stay on track. \" Merle S Winter Cleanse Feb. 2023 \"Thank you for another successful cleanse. It is more than trying to lose weight. It is about adopting a healthier lifestyle in a creative, fun, supportive, community driven environment.\" Katrina R "}
