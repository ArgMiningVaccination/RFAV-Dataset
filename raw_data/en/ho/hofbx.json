CEPI welcomes five new partners based in India and Africa to join its Centralized Laboratory Network (CLN), significantly expanding the scale and footprint of its epidemic and pandemic vaccine testing laboratory network in the Global South. [https://bit.ly/3qfouLF](https://bit.ly/3qfouLF?trk=public_post_reshare-text) The CLN is the largest global group using the same methods and materials to standardise and accelerate the evaluation of vaccines. Members of the CLN are ready and waiting to help rapid development of vaccines during an outbreak of Disease X; while during interepidemic periods, they support testing of vaccines against CEPI's priority pathogens - Chikungunya, Lassa, MERS, Rify Valley Fever, SARS-CoV-2. The network will be a key enabler of the 100 Days Mission, which aims to reduce vaccine development timelines to just 100 days, by helping researchers and regulators to evaluate the most promising vaccine candidates quickly and accurately when faced with a future Disease X. Dr [Melanie Saville](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/melanie-saville-ab16021a?trk=public_post_reshare-text), Executive Director of Vaccine R&D, explained that \"Expanding the footprint of CEPI's Centralised Laboratory Network to include additional expert facilities in the Global South will help to reduce sample transfer and testing times, potentially accelerating the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases while supporting sustainable and resilient regional outbreak preparedness infrastructure.\" Join us in welcoming our new partners to the CLN: [ Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)](https://in.linkedin.com/company/icmrorganization?trk=public_post_reshare-text), [Institut Pasteur de Dakar](https://sn.linkedin.com/company/institut-pasteur-de-dakar?trk=public_post_reshare-text), [KAVI "}
