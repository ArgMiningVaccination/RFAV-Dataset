He then orders the thin man to swallow a bitter yellow drink, followed by two bananas. \"Whatever you do there are bound to be sceptics, but I can tell you my method is foolproof,\" Yahya Jammeh says, surrounded by his bodyguards inside his presidential compound as he prepares to treat more patients. \"Mine is not an argument, mine is a proof. It's a declaration. I can cure Aids and I will.\" In a continent suffering from the world's worst Aids epidemic, claims of miracle cures like those of Mr Jammeh are alarming public health workers already struggling against the corrosive effect of faith healers dispensing herbal remedies from thatched huts. The biggest concern to experts is that Mr Jammeh requires his patients to cease their anti-retroviral drugs, a dangerous move since doing so can weaken the body's immune system, making the patient prone to infection, said Antonio Filipe, the local head of the World Health Organisation in Senegal. Since January, when he announced his cure to a gathering of foreign diplomats, Mr Jammeh has thrown the bureaucratic machinery of his small West African country behind his claim of a cure. Although compared with other African nations the HIV rate is relatively low here - 1.3% of Gambia's population of 1.6 million - the last six press releases on the country's official website are dedicated to the president's treatment. Regular radio and TV addresses publicise his alleged cure, available to Gambians free of cost. The health ministry issued a declaration of support. Dr Filipe was diplomatic about Mr Jammeh's claims, saying his organisation respected the president's point of view. But he added: \"As the World Health Organisation, we would like to state quite clearly the following: No 1, so far there is no cure for Aids.\" Mr Jammeh, 41, a former army colonel who wrested control of his country in a coup in 1994, says his treatment is entirely voluntary and argues that his medications cannot be mixed with other drugs because \"I don't want any complications\". The claim of a cure has prompted comparisons to the South African minister of health, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, who drew international ridicule last year for suggesting that a diet of garlic, beetroot and lemon juice is more effective than anti-retroviral drugs. The South African president, Thabo Mbeki, has been accused of not addressing the epidemic. (His government did not provide Aids drugs until a suit by Aids activists forced it to in 2002.) Waiting outside Mr Jammeh's treatment chamber, the patients themselves said they did not need laboratory results to tell them they felt better. \"It feels as if the president took the pain out of my body,\" said Ousman Sowe, 54, who said he was diagnosed with HIV in 1996. Mr Sowe was among the first batch of nine men and women who were treated by Mr Jammeh and have been in his care for nearly a month. Mr Jammeh has so far refused to disclose details of his herbal concoction, saying only that the treatment uses seven plants - \"three of which are not from Gambia\". The treatment begins with the president applying the green paste, stored inside a plastic food container. Next is a grey-coloured solution, which he splashes on the patient's skin. It is stored inside an old Evian mineral water bottle, as is the yellowish, tea-like brew that patients are asked to drink. The therapy is administered numerous times over the course of several weeks. After treating the original nine, Mr Jammeh emerged from his black-tinted treatment chamber, carrying a tall wooden staff, a string of Islamic prayer beads and a leather-bound Qur'an. In front of him, 30 new patients waited, drawn like the first batch from the roughly 20,000 people living with HIV in Gambia. He told them that during treatment, they must cease drinking alcohol, tea and coffee. They also cannot eat kola nuts or have sex. Mr Jammeh held up the Qur'an, pointing it at each of the patients in turn: \"In the name of Allah, in three to 30 days you will all be cured,\" he said. The 30, still awaiting treatment, were herded into a minibus and driven to an empty hospital ward on the outskirts of the capital, where they were to stay in dormitory-style rooms for the duration of the treatment. Also there was Amadou Jallow, 25, who quit his job at a tourist hotel after his mother was diagnosed with Aids. In his savings account is 8,000 dalasis (about \u00a3150) - enough, he says, to last him the 30 days Mr Jammeh promises it will take to heal his mother. \"I'm just afraid that, what if my account runs low?\" he said. \"But by then, I think "}
