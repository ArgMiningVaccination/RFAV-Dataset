Over 65s The Federal Government is again funding a specific Influenza Vaccination Program for Australians aged 65 years and over. The Monash program can provide this government-funded vaccination. As per Australian Immunisation Register requirements, Monash staff aged 65 years and over who require the age-specific immunisation must register via the online booking link and present their Medicare card at their appointment. Staff can access the over-65 vaccine through this program. Please note this may be subject to government availability of the vaccine at the time of your appointment. As you will have provided your date of birth on the registration form, your age will be visible to the nurse at the time of your appointment. They will ask you and provide you with the appropriate vaccine at the time of your appointment. On the day DO NOT attend a flu vaccination appointment if you are unwell. - We strongly recommend wearing a mask while you receive your flu vaccination, as you will be within 1.5 metres of the person providing you with the vaccination. - You must bring your Monash ID card or M-Pass to be scanned to record your attendance at the time of your vaccination. - To cancel your appointment and rebook, refer to your booking confirmation email from Health Watch Australia (HWA).

Record of vaccination Your flu vaccination will be recorded on the [Australian Immunisation Register (AIR)](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/medicare/australian-immunisation-register).

We strongly encourage all members of the Monash community to get their booster as soon as they're eligible and able (six months after your last dose or COVID infection). There is currently no combined influenza and COVID-19 vaccine, so if you require both vaccines, you will need to make separate bookings.
