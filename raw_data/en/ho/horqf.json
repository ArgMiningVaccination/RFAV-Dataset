Purification The sweet refreshing scent of Purification instantly deodorizes unpleasant odors in the air.

Or, leave a glass jar filled with baking soda + 5 drops of purification in your fridge to prevent bad odors. Frankincense Frankincense is known for its sweet, warm, balsamic aroma with calming properties that can increase spirituality and inner strength. Frankincense helps to support healthy cellular regeneration, and is therefore commonly used in skincare and facial products. Copaiba Distilled from gum resin that is wild harvested from Brazilian copaiba, copaiba contains the highest amounts of beta caryophyllene (55 percent) of any known essential oil. Beta caryophyllene is a natural chemical constituent that has been extensively studied for its ability to modulate the body's response to irritation and inflammation. Copaiba is a great oil for anyone, because we ALL experience inflammation in the body, on some level! This oil is also commonly used topically on babies, for gentle & soothing relief of teething gums.

Northern Lights Black Spruce (bonus oil for Canadian members) Northern Lights Black Spruce essential oil comes from Young Living's new Northern Lights farm in British Columbia, Canada. Diffuse this rich, woodsy, and invigorating scent during meditation to create a fresh aromatic atmosphere. Add it to skin care products or apply topically to help improve the appearance of dry skin or to help maintain the appearance of healthy-looking skin.
