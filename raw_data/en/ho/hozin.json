I came in with this awful, chronic back pain. I've tried everything, physical therapy, regular massages. Nothing worked for more than a few hours at best. Kari has worked with me to create a better foundation that allows me to build the right muscles and strengthen the areas on my back that are in so much pain. I can genuinely say nothing else has worked as well as the treatments I've had here. Plus, Kari is hilarious and always fun to visit. Definitely check this place out! - 5/30/2023 I have been fortunate to be a patient of Prajna's for more than a decade. I began with Prajna for \"Acupuncture Face Lift\", and that has been fantastic. The true benefit, though, is the effect it has had on my rare blood cancer. COVID unfortunately brought me the proof that leads to this yelp. During COVID I could not see Prajna and my blood work became progressively worse. Once I was able to return to Prajna, we discussed my blood numbers and went back to work on the problem. No surprise to me within two months my blood numbers were back to an acceptable level where they remain. I am beyond grateful to have found Energy Matters, Prajna and acupuncture which have been an essential element of my continuing excellent health. Thank you Prajna!

The session included acupuncture and a \"mother warming\" treatment that involved burning moxa/mugwort in a box that was placed directly on my abdomen. The treatment soothed my pelvic discomfort and felt deeply nourishing to my postpartum nervous system. Prajna's astute attention helped my postpartum healing process on multiple levels: energetic, physical, and emotional. - 2/10/2023 Energy Matters is awesome. Clean, calm, soothing space. Very conscientious about Covid safety practices. Helpful and efficient front office staff and procedures. My only complaint is that they are in-network with only one insurance company (not mine). But - even given that - they give you cost-cutting deals if you buy more than one session and/or pay promptly. I've been seeing Angela Coon there and I really can't say enough good things about her - as an acupuncture practitioner and as a human being. I've been to a fair number of acupuncturists over the years, and she's inarguably the most skilled/helpful I've been to. Even though I'm a bit needle-phobic, the combo of her skill/technique with the needles and her sensitivity to my anxiety about them made a HUGE (positive) difference in my experience. The initial problem I went to see her for was complicated and longstanding (12 years on and off). With a combo of acupuncture and some herbal capsules she prescribed, after a couple months of treatment, I'm 80-90% better than I was when we started. That's stunning to me. As well, she's got great 'bedside manner.' Thoughtful, kind, funny, boundaried, good listener and delightful human. I look forward to returning to her with other issues I'd like her expert help in addressing! - 2/25/2022 I have been going to Energy Matters for a number of years. Most recently I've been seeing Kari who is treating a chronic back issue. Her treatment is alleviating symptoms I've had for years. I had consulted with three different orthopedic surgeons - none of whom helped at all. Kari is supremely talented with addressing this issue. Recently I was suddenly stricken with Bell's Palsy which was very scary. The ER prescribed antiviral meds + prednisone but that didn't alleviate symptoms much. Then Kari advised I see Prajna and her facial acupuncture did miracles. After the first session I had immediate improvement. After two more treatments, all my symptoms were gone. If you know of anyone diagnosed with Bell's Palsy - have them get to Energy Matters immediately & see Prajna! I love the Energy Matters practitioners - they are the very best!! - 1/11/2022 I have been going to Energy Matters for many years and it is without question my healing sanctuary. Kari is a body magician and Prajna has helped me heal skin issues that western medicine has not been able to address! After an acupuncture session with Prajna, I often feel like I have had a full night of sleep in one session! Both Prajna and Kari are amazing and caring healers - my life is better because of them. Plus, they are just simply extraordinary human beings. We need more healers like Prajna and Kari in the world! - 5/26/2021 I've been coming to Energy Matters for some years now and rely on them for so many aspects of my wellness. Each practitioner has their specialties so I've worked with most of the staff targeting different issues be it diet and gut health, aesthetic acupuncture, or injury rehab. They carry excellent, high quality supplements and I feel soothed, relaxed, and well cared for physically and emotionally after every session. Angela is awesome. Prajna is super talented. I've even done the Qi gong! I cannot recommend this practice and these practitioners enough - 6/14/2021 I recently participated in Prajna's Inner Peace, Outer Peace meditation series, and it was nothing short of spectacular. Prajna is both knowledgeable and insightful. She meets students were they are and creates a safe space for personal growth and healing. I highly recommend the series and Prajna! - 4/3/2018 This was my first acupuncture appointment ever and it was surprisingly effective. I didn't know what to expect and come from a relatively skeptical group of friends who were dubious about the efficacy of acupuncture. Kari, my acupuncturist, was patient, made sure to explain the entire process to me (as well as why she had chosen specific muscles to needle) and paused often for questions. In the end, it took just over 15 minutes with the needles in, and I almost instantly felt as if all the tension on the problematic muscles on my back had been released. This lasted a few days before my laptop centric lifestyle brought the tightness back, but I'd certainly rate it about as effective as a typical massage. The best part is, my insurance (and many others) cover it - so it actually ended up working out considerably cheaper than my usual massages! - 5/25/2021Updated review Energy Matters has gone above and beyond throughout the pandemic to make clients feel safe and cared for. At every point during the pandemic, they have had policies that put me at ease about coming in for treatments. Angela Coon has been my family's go-to practitioner for about seven years. She has worked with me, my husband, my mother (70s), my daughter (20s) and my son since he was 7 years old. She is trustworthy, compassionate and knowledgeable. The staff is friendly and organized. The owner, Kirstin has created a lovely environment at Energy Matters for both clients and staff. I would give ten stars if I could!3/22/2015Previous review I can't say enough wonderful things about Angela Coon and the entire staff at Energy Matters! Angela has treated my entire family for over a year now. As you can imagine, in a family of 4, ages 8, 20, 40 and 42, we all have very different reasons for receiving acupuncture treatments. Angela has treated all of us with a level of knowledge and care that is beyond anything I could ever hope for in a health care practitioner. Not only have her treatments been successful, but she consistently offers her support between visits via email. I would recommend her to anyone, of any age, as I trust her with the care of my "}
