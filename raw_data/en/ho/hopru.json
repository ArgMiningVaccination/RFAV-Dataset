This has 35 been challenged by public mistrust and spread of misinformation regarding vaccine safety. 36 Hence, better understanding and communication on the longer -term and comparative 37 experiences of general population individuals following SARS -CoV-2 vaccination are required. 38 39 Objective: To evaluate and compare self -reported adverse effects following SARS -CoV-2 40 vaccination, participants' perceptions regarding vaccinations and their compliance with 41 recommended public health measures. 42 43 Design, Setting and Participants: Population -based longitudinal cohort of 575 adults, randomly 44 selected from all individuals presenting to the reference vaccination center of the Canton of 45 Zurich, Switz erland, for receipt of -78436735 vaccines. 48 49 Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcomes included period prevalence, onset, duration, 50 and severity of self -reported adverse effects over 12 weeks following vaccination with a specific 51 focus on the proportion of participants reporting allergic reactions, menstrual irregularities, or 52 cardiac adverse effects, or requiring hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included risk factors 53 associate d with reporting adverse effects, perception of vaccine importance, trust in public 54 .

Prevalence was highest among mRNA -1273 recipients (88.7% vs. 77.3% after 59 BNT162b2, JNJ -78436735). Most adverse effects were systemic (72%), occurred 60 within 24 hours (67.9%), and resolved in less than thr ee days (76.3%). 85.2% were reported as 61 mild or moderate. Allergic reactions were reported by 0. 4% of participants , hospitalizations by 62 0.7%, cardiac adverse effects by 1.4%. Menstrual irregularities were reported by 9% of female 63 participants younger than 50 years. Female sex, younger age, higher education, and receipt of 64 mRNA -1273 were associated with reporting adverse effects. Compared to JNJ -78436735 65 recipients, a higher proportion of mRNA vaccine recipients agreed that vaccination is important 66 (87.5% vs . 28.5%), and trusted public health authorities (80.2% vs. 30.3%) and pharmaceutical 67 companies (71.7% vs. 23.6%). 68 69 Conclusions and Relevance: Our population -based cohort provided real -world data on self - 70 reported adverse effects following SARS -CoV-2 vaccin ation and highlights the importance of 71 transparent communication regarding adverse effects and building trust in public health 72 authorities to ensure successful future vaccination campaigns. 73 74 .

Apart from the obvious focus on efficacy , concerns about vaccine -related adverse 78 effects dominated the professional and public discourse during the campaign. The fast-track 79 authorization of the technologically new mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 (Pfizer -BioNTech ) and 80 mRNA1273 (Moderna) in some countries and misinformatio n contributed to vaccine skepticism 81 and hesitancy .[1-5] This highligh ts the importance of understanding and accurately 82 communicat ing information regarding adverse effects , including vaccine safety profiles, to 83 improve vaccine confidence and uptake . 84 The current body of evidence on adverse effects following SARS -CoV-2 vaccination consists 85 mostly of data reported in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and reports to government -based 86 surveillance systems, such as the European EudraVigilance, US VAERS (Vaccine Adverse Event 87 Reporting System), or Swiss E lViS ( Electronic Vigilance System) . Adverse effects reported in RCTs 88 have been primarily mild and self-limited ,[6, 7] with systemic reactions (e.g. fatigue, headache, 89 pain) and local injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, swelling) being the most frequent. [8- 90 10] In contrast, severe adverse effects accounted for a significantly higher proportion of reports 91 in governmental surveillance systems. [11-13] This was to be expected as reporting to surveillance 92 systems is subject to several biases including underreporting of mild and common adverse effects 93 and increased reporting of those which are severe or widely reported in the media. [14, 15] 94 Although RCTs pr ovided important evidence on the safety of individual vaccine s, they offered 95 little side-by-side comparisons. Furthermore, RCTs yield data collected on selected population s 96 .

The few studies 97 eliciting patient -reported symptoms following different vaccines in real -world settings often had 98 cross -sectional design s and were conducted among very specific groups such as healthcare 99 workers or university students , which may not be representative of the general population .[6, 7] 100 In this population -based study , we aimed to deliver a comprehensive comparative analysis of 101 self-reported adverse effects up to 12 weeks after receipt of three SARS -CoV-2 vaccines approved 102 in Switzerland in 2021 . Further objectives were to examine the general perception and attitudes 103 of individuals regarding SARS -CoV-2 vaccination and their compliance with recommended public 104 health measures . Thereby, we aim to improve our understanding of the adverse health e ffects 105 experience d following vaccination in the general population to provide an evidence base for 106 future vaccination campaigns in view of the likely implementation of additional booster 107 vaccinations and updated SARS -CoV-2 vaccines . 108 109 Methods 110 Study design , participants, and recruitment 111 This study is based on the Zurich SARS -CoV-2 Vaccine Cohort, an ongoing prospective population - 112 based cohort study. We recruited participants between March 10, 2021, and January 27, 2022, 113 at the University of Zurich's (UZH) vaccination center , the reference center for the Canton of 114 Zurich, Switzerland. All individuals scheduled to receive one of the SARS -CoV-2 vaccines approved 115 in Switzerland 116 (Johnson & Johnson), were screened for eligibility. Eligibility criteria were being 18 years or older , 117 .

We excluded i ndividuals who had already received a first dose 119 of a SARS -CoV-2 vaccine. A daily age -stratified (18 -64 years, 65 years or older) random sample 120 was selected separately for each approved vaccine from all eligible individuals belonging to the 121 following vaccination groups as defined by the Canton of Zurich [16, 17] : \"Over 75 years\", \" over 122 65 years\", \" between 50 -64 years\", and \"between 18 -49 years\". We excluded individuals 123 belonging to groups specific for \"healthcare workers\", \"caretakers of high -risk patients\", 124 \"individuals living in communal facilities\", and \"individuals with the highest risk diseases\" to 125 ensure that that our sample was representative of the general population. [18, 19] Randomly 126 selected individual s were then invited to participate in our study . We obtained written informed 127 consent from all participants. We were unable to reach the desired sample size for JNJ -78436735 128 recipients 65 years or older , due to limited demand . 129 The study protocol was prospectively registered on the International Standard Randomized 130 Controlled Trial Number Registry (ISRCTN 15499304) and approve d by the ethics committee of 131 the Canton of Zurich (BASEC 2021 -00273 ). 132 .

We pooled BNT162b2 and mRNA -1273 recipients into 145 one \"mRNA vaccine\" group since they expressed similar perceptions towards vaccination and 146 compliance with recommended measures (Supplement 1). 147 We prov ided p articipants with a paper symptom diary and instructed them to record any adverse 148 effect they experienced during 12 weeks after vaccination, as free text , including start and end 149 dates, perceived severity (on a 5 -item Likert scale , ranging from \"Very mild \" to \"Very severe \"), 150 and consequences of the adverse effects (i.e., self-medication , need for healthcare services, or 151 hospitalizations ). Symptom diaries were collected at the 12 -week follow -up visit. Participants 152 received additional electronic questionnaires at 4, 6, and 12 weeks, in which they were asked to 153 report any positive SARS -CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or rapid antigen test s. We 154 excluded all reported adverse effects starting within three days before and at any timepoint after 155 positive SARS -CoV-2 test s to ensure that reported symptoms were related to vaccination rather 156 than infection . To determine the proportion of participants with past SARS -CoV-2 infection, we 157 measured participants' anti -SARS -CoV-2 Spike (S) -IgA and IgG antibodies at baseline using a 158 highly sensitive and specific Luminex technology -based assay. [20] 159 We collected and managed all study data using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) 160 system. [21, 22] 161 162 .

Most adverse effects were mild to moderate and resolved with in 275 three days . Allergic reactions (0. 4%) and adverse effects requiring hospitalization (0. 7%) were 276 rare. Around 9% of female participants younger than 50 reported menstrual cycle changes , more 277 frequently among mRNA vaccine recipients . Female sex, receiving mRNA -1273 , higher education 278 and younger age were associated with experiencing adverse effect s. JNJ-78436735 recipients less 279 frequently perceived vaccination to be important and had lower trust in public health authorities 280 and pharmaceutical companies compared to mRNA vaccine recipients . There were no d ifferences 281 between vaccine groups in compliance with preventive public health measures . 282 Our results on the prevalence and severity of adverse effects are in line with previously 283 reported data from RCTs and other observational studies. [6, 9, 10, 24 -26] In an online survey 284 among individuals vaccinated with either BNT162b2, mRNA -1273 , or JNJ -78436735, Beatty et 285 al. reported that 80.3% of participants experienced adverse effects, with comparable estimates 286 for each vaccine type .[6] Our data also matches the prevalence published in the RCTs for each 287 vaccin e individually. [8-10]. The proportion of adverse effects that were self-assessed to be 288 severe or required hospitalization in our study (14.8%) was well below that of Swiss and 289 European governmental surveillance systems ( 37.9% in Swiss ElViS ).[11, 12] US surv eillance 290 reports also stated higher estimates of serious adverse events based on hospitalization rates , 291 serious illness and deaths (9.2% vs. our 0.7%).[13] These higher estimates from governmental 292 reporting systems are likely related to the underreporting of mild symptoms and underscore 293 .

[14, 15] There is wide variation in reports on prevalence of 294 anaphylaxis and severe allergic reactions ranging from 0.03 % to 3%, due to differing 295 definitions .[6, 27, 28] In our study , two (0. 4%) participants reported allergic reactions, without 296 requiring medical attention. 297 Our follow -up over 12 weeks allowed us to assess adverse effects that occur with some delay , 298 such as menstrual changes reported in 9% of female participants younger than 50 years . Few 299 studies have described menstrual irregularities following SARS -CoV-2 vaccination with 300 prevalence ranging between 0.3% and 46%. [29, 30] This large variability and the high prevalence 301 (37.8%) of menstrual irregularities in the general population regardless of vaccination underscore 302 the challenge of attributing changes in the menstrual cycle to vaccination. [31] Further research 303 is needed on the influence of SARS -CoV-2 vaccination on menstruation and the general impact 304 of vaccination on female recipients, as we and others observed that female recipients were 305 generally more likely to experience adverse effects. [32-35] 306 We also found that participants who were younge r than 65 years and received mRNA -1273 were 307 more likely to report adverse effects possibly due to stronger immune responses among these 308 groups. [6, 13, 26] Similarly, other studies have found evidence that SARS -CoV-2 infections prior 309 to vaccination may be associated with adverse effects reports due to increased 310 immunogenicity. [6, 7] While we found that individuals with prior SARS -CoV-2 infections were 1.8 311 times more likely to report adverse effect s compared to those without , the findings were not 312 statistically significant , potentially due to insufficient power in our study . 313 mRNA vaccine recipients trusted vaccines in general and thus were mostly motivated to be 314 vaccinate d as soon as SARS -CoV-2 vaccines became available.

Other studies describ e these concerns about the rapid development and fears of 318 adverse effects to be among the main reasons to wait for non -mRNA -based vacci nes or other 319 alternative s.[36-38] General skepticism and the presence of nocebo effects , as demonstrated by 320 a Amanzio et al, may have translated into a higher proportion of JNJ -78436735 recipients 321 perceiving adverse effects as sev ere. [38-40] Increasing awareness of these nocebo responses 322 and using positive framing around the low risk of severe adverse effects may contribute to 323 improving vaccine acceptance . 324 This study provided evidence from a representative cohort recruited from the general population 325 and followed -up over a 12 -week period. Data collected through symptom diaries and adverse 326 effect coding according to MedDRA terms generated a comprehensive dataset allow ing a 327 comparative analysis of three common SARS -CoV-2 vaccines . 328 However, t here are several l imitations to our study . First, self-selection bias may have occurred 329 if individuals who are more health literate or less hesitant participate d in our study , leading to 330 overestimations of trust in public health authorities and more positive perceptions of vaccines. 331 However, we con sider the data on the prevalence of adverse effects as broadly representative . 332 Second, our data is self -reported . While this allows for an accurate description of vaccine 333 recipients' experiences, it is subjective and no verification of the relation of adverse effects and 334 vaccination by a healthcare provider was possible . Third , the absolute numbers of reports for 335 som e adverse effects when analyzed individually are relatively small (e.g., menstrual changes) . 336 Finally, our analysis was restricted to basic immunization of the three SARS -CoV-2 vaccines 337 .

Further research on adverse effects 338 occurring after booster vaccinations , other types of vaccine s and combinat ions of different 339 vaccines is needed . 340 341 Conclusion 342 This study demonstrates the safety of three SARS -CoV-2 vaccines in a representative population - 343 based cohort and provides real -world estimates on adverse effect prevalence after vaccination. 344 Thereby, we importantly extend the evidence base for health -care providers to answer many of 345 the questions of individuals seeking vaccination . While further evidence on adverse effects after 346 booster vaccination and other vaccine types is required , our study suggests that transparent 347 communication regarding adverse effects and building trust in public health authorities are 348 pivotal future vaccination campaigns ' success . 349 350 .
