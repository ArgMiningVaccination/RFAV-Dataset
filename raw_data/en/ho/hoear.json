SUMMARY 2.1 Main risks and target organs Main risk is adverse reactions which may be local or involve multiple organs. 2.2 Summary of clinical effects Local effects: Local reactions at injection site include tenderness, erythema, induration, warmth and oedema. Rarely, the local reactions may become extensive as a result of hypersensitivity. The incidence of reactions increases with the 2nd and 3rd injections, but the reactions are generally not severe. Systemic effects: transient fever, malaise, generalized aches and pains, rash, generalized urticaria or pruritus, lymphadenopathy, tachycardia and hypotension. More rarely, a severe anaphylactic reaction may occur. Neurological disorders include cochlear lesions, brachial plexus neuropathies, paralysis of radial or recurrent nerves, accommodation paresis, EEG disturbances. Dysphagia and polyradiculoneuropathy have been reported. 2.3 Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on occurrence of local and/or systemic reactions following the parenteral administration of the vaccine. 2.4 First aid measures and management principles Immediate allergic reactions should be controlled with antihistamines, and anaphylaxis with the administration of epinephrine 1:1000 (see Treatment protocol). 3. PHYSICO-CHEMICAL PROPERTIES 3.1 Origin of the substance Tetanus vaccine is prepared from tetanus toxin produced by the growth of the bacterium Clostridium tetani. The toxin is converted to tetanus formol toxoid by treatment with formaldehyde solution. In addition, for tetanus toxoid adsorbed or adsorbed tetanus vaccine, aluminium phosphate or aluminium potassium sulphate is used as a mineral adjuvant to adsorb the tetanus antigens. This prolongs and enhances the antigenic properties by retarding the rate of absorption of the injected toxoid into the body. [There are slight variations of the production methods used by different manufacturers but all products must meet the established potency of 5 to 7.5 Lf units/0.5 ml dose]. 3.2 Chemical structure Not relevant. 3.3 Physical properties 3.3.1 Properties of the substance Tetanus vaccine is a clear, colourless to brownish yellow or slightly turbid liquid, free from evident lumps or particles, having a characteristic odour or an odour of formaldehyde. Tetanus toxoid adsorbed (USP) or Adsorbed tetanus vaccine (BP): Turbid, white, slightly grey or slightly pink suspension, free from evident lumps after shaking. 3.3.2 Properties of the locally available formulation Pasteur tetanus vaccine is a preparation containing purified tetanus toxoid adsorbed onto aluminium hydroxide. Each 0.5 ml dose contains: purified tetanus toxoid (1 vaccination dose q.s. 0.5 ml); aluminium hydroxide (expressed as aluminium) (2.25 thiomersal (preservative) (0.05 mg maximum); isotonic sodium chloride solution corresponding to at least 40 immunizing international units. One dose (0.5 ml) of Behring Preparation contains adsorbed tetanus vaccine (tetanol) (75 IU); aluminium hydroxide (1.5 mg) and sodium p-ethyl-mercuri-mercapto- benzol-sulphate (0.025 mg) as preservative. 3.4 Other characteristics 3.4.1 Shelf-life of the substance The expiry date of tetanus toxoid and tetanus toxoid adsorbed is not later than 5 years after the date of issue from the manufacturers cold storage or one year when the manufacturer's cold storage was at 5\u00b0C. 3.4.2 Shelf-life of the locally available formulation Not less than 5 years from the date on which the potency test was begun. 3.4.3 Storage conditions Tetanus vaccine or adsorbed tetanus vaccine should be stored in a refrigerator at a temperature ranging between +2 and +8 \u00b0C; it should be used on or before the date of expiry given on the pack. It must not be frozen and should be protected from light. 3.4.4 Bioavailability One hundred percent. 3.4.5 Specific properties and composition Not relevant. 4. USES 4.1 Indications Tetanus vaccines are used for active immunization against tetanus. The main objective of tetanus immunization is to prevent the severe complications (or death), which arise from the potent exotoxin elaborated by Clostridium tetanus. Unless otherwise contraindicated, all infants of 6 to 8 weeks of age or older, all children, and all adults should be immunized against tetanus with the primary series of tetanus vaccine and a booster injection every 10 years throughout their lives, including: - Adults: Especially those of 50 years of age and older. In recent years, approximately two-thirds of persons contracting tetanus have been in this age group. - Persons with uncertain histories of complete primary courses of vaccination with tetanus vaccine or immunizing agents containing tetanus toxoid. - Travellers - Persons at increased risk of receiving lacerations and abrasions through their occupation or recreational activities. - Persons with known hypersensitivity to horse serum or with asthma or other allergies. This is to minimize the possible need for passive immunization with tetanus antitoxin (TAT) of animal origin (usually horse) if a wound is received. Although human tetanus immune globulin (TIG) is usually used for passive immunization, TAT of animal origin may still be used in certain areas of the world and risks causing adverse reactions in hypersensitive patients. - Pregnant women who are not immunized or inadequately immunized and who may deliver their infants in conditions of poor hygiene thereby exposing their infants to neonatal tetanus. - Those recovering from tetanus. Since an injection of TAT or TIG does not confer immunity, immunization with tetanus vaccine should be initiated or continued at the time of recovery from the illness. - Persons who are injured may require emergency tetanus prophylaxis depending on the number of primary immunizations, the timing of any boosters, and the type of wound received. The active immunization of children is not discussed further in this monograph. When a single entity vaccine is used, adsorbed tetanus vaccine (BP) or tetanus toxoid adsorbed (USP) are the vaccines of choice for primary immunization because greater antigenic stimulation and longer lasting immunity are achieved than with the tetanus toxoid (USP) or tetanus vaccine (BP). For wounds, tetanus toxoid (fluid) USP may be used as emergency prophylaxis of tetanus. 4.2 Therapeutic dosage 4.2.1 Adults The dosage of tetanus vaccine/tetanus toxoid is the same for all persons, infants, children and adults. 4.2.2 Children (See 4.2.1) - Tetanus toxoid adsorbed (injection) A primary vaccination course of tetanus toxoid adsorbed consists of 3 doses each of 0.5 ml (not less than 40 units for adsorbed vaccine or not less than 14 Lf for non-adsorbed vaccine). Usual adult and adolescent dose: Intramuscular, 0.5 ml. First dose: at initial visit Second dose: 4 to 8 weeks after the first dose Third dose: 6 to 14 months after the second dose Booster doses: every 10 years. - Tetanus Vaccine/Toxoid (Fluid) (Injection) Usual adult and adolescent dose: Intramuscular or subcutaneous 0.5 ml (US, UK, Zimbabwe) or 1 ml (Canada). First dose: at initial visit Second dose: 4 to 8 weeks after the first dose Third dose: 4 to 8 weeks after the second dose Fourth dose: 6 to 12 months after the third dose Booster doses: every 10 years. N.B. In other countries the strength of the vaccine, dosages and schedules may differ slightly from that outlined above. Immunization against tetanus forms part of the World Health Organization's Expanded Programme on Immunization, which recommends the treatment schedules. 4.3 Contraindications Tetanus vaccine and adsorbed tetanus vaccine are contraindicated in individuals who have had a prior systemic hypersensitivity reaction to either vaccine. - The US Public Health Service Immunizations Practices Advisory Committee states that tetanus toxoid and tetanus toxoid adsorbed are contraindicated in individuals who experienced a neurological reaction after a previous dose of a tetanus toxoid-containing preparation. - Routine administration of the vaccines is contraindicated in patients having acute respiratory disease because routine primary or booster immunization should not be administered until the symptoms of the patient's illness have abated; however, emergency tetanus prophylaxis for wounds should be administered as usual. Minor illness, such as upper respiratory tract infection, does not preclude administration of tetanus toxoid. - The vaccine should not be administered during an outbreak of poliomyelitis; elective immunization of patients over the age of 6 months with tetanus toxoid should be deferred during an outbreak of poliomyelitis. - Tetanus vaccine is contraindicated in individuals with tetanus infection. Tetanus toxoid should not be used to treat a tetanus infection, for which tetanus antitoxin, preferably tetanus immune globulin (TIG), should be used instead; vaccination with tetanus toxoid should begin after recovery. 5.

PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY 7.1 Mode of action 7.1.1 Toxicodynamics Not relevant. 7.1.2 Pharmacodynamics Following intramuscular toxoid adsorbed or either intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of tetanus toxoid, an antigen response is induced in the immunized patient causing the formation of antibodies to tetanus toxins (USP DI 1990). 7.2 Toxicity 7.2.1 Human data 7.2.1.1 Adults Local reactions are more common in adults than in children and an incidence in adults of 1 - 2% has been reported (Martindale, 1982). 7.2.1.2 Children Local reactions are more common in adults than in children and an incidence in adults of 1 - 2% has been reported (Martindale, 1982). 7.2.2 Relevant animal data Not relevant. 7.2.3 Relevant in vitro data Not relevant. 7.3 Carcinogenicity No data available. 7.4 Teratogenicity There is no evidence that tetanus toxin is teratogenic. In general, waiting until the second trimester is a reasonable precaution to minimise any theoretical concern (PDR, 1992). 7.5 Mutagenicity No data available. 7.6 Interactions No data available. 7.7 Main adverse effects Common adverse effects include redness or hard lump at injection site, which may persist for a few days. Hypersensitivity to reinforcing doses of tetanus toxoid has been described (Dittmann, 1988), especially in individuals who are sensitive to the mercury in thiomersal. Slight local reactions such as induration, erythema and tenderness seem to be more common with the adsorbed type of vaccine. If aluminium adsorbed toxoid is given subcutaneously, a small granuloma may occur due to deposition of material at the injection site. Intramuscular injection of tetanus toxoid is generally better tolerated and the product can best be injected into a large muscle (gluteal) (Dittmann, 1988). Anaphylactic reactions may occur rarely and can be sudden and severe. These include difficulty in breathing or swallowing; hives and itching, especially of the soles or palms; reddening of skin, especially around the ears, swelling of the eyes, the face, of the inside of the nose; unusual tiredness or weakness. Adverse neurological effects include confusion, fever over 39.4\u00b0C (103 \u00b0F), severe or continuing headache, seizures, excessive sleepiness, unusual irritability and severe or continuing vomiting. Lymphadenopathy (swelling of glands and armpit). Swelling, blistering, or pain at injection site, which may be severe and extensive. Allergic reactions of the delayed and the cell-mediated type occur occasionally and include pain, tenderness, itching, or swelling at injection site, chills, fever, irritability or unusual tiredness. A nodule or sterile abscess at the injection site, probably caused by the aluminium content of tetanus toxoid adsorbed, may persist for several weeks. Skin rash has also been reported (McEvoy, 1988; USP DI 1990). 8.
