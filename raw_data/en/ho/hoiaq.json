The safety and efficacy of BENLYSTA have not been evaluated in patients with severe active central nervous system lupus. The efficacy of BENLYSTA in SLE patients of Black African heritage has not been clearly established. 1.1 Pediatrics No data were made available to Health Canada; therefore, Health Canada has not authorized an indication for pediatric use. 1.2 Geriatrics Although da ta are limited, dosage adjustment is not recommended in patients > 65 years of age (see 10.3 Pharmacokinetics ). 2 CONTRAINDICATIONS Benlysta is contraindicated in patients who are hypersensitive to belimumab (e.g., have demonstrated anaphylaxis) or to any ingredient in the formulation , including any non -medicinal ingredient, or component of the container. For a complete listing see 6 DOSAGE FORMS, STRENGTHS, COMPOSITION AND PACKAGING . 3 SERIOUS WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS BOX Serious Warnings and Precautions Infusion/Injection -Related Systemic Reactions and Hypersensitivity, including Anaphylaxis Administration of Benlysta may result in infusion or injection -related systemic reactions and hypersensitivity reactions, which can be severe or fatal. Serious infusion reactions and serious anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity have been observed uncommonly (see 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, General, Infusion/Injection -Related Systemic Reactions and Hypersensitivity ). Severe and sometime s fatal Infections, including Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) Severe infections, including PML have been reported in patients receiving Benlysta , and other immune -modulating therapies for the treatment of SLE. Some cases were fatal (see 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Immune , and 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS, Infections , and 8.5 Post -Market Adverse Drug Reactions ). May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 5 of 68 Psychiatric Disorders : Depression and suicidality have been reported in trials with Benlysta . Patients should be instructed to contact their healthcare provider if they experience new or worsening depression, or suicidal thoughts/behaviour (See 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Psychiatric , and 8 ADVERSE REACTION S, Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions, Psychiatric Disorders ). 4 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTR ATION Where instructions are specific to either the intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection, this administration route is specifically named under each subheading below. 4.1 Dosing Considerations Discontinuation of treatment with Benlysta in SLE should be considered if there is no improvement in disease control after 6 months of treatment. In active lupus nephritis, Benlysta should be used in combination with corticosteroids mycophenolate or cyclophosphamide for induction, or mycophenolate or azathioprine for maintenance. The patient's condition should be evaluated continuously. 4.2 Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment Intravenous Administration SLE or lupus nephritis The recommended dosage regimen is 10 mg/kg at 2 -week intervals for the first three doses and at 4 - week intervals thereafter. Benlysta should be infused over a 1 -hour period. The infusion rate may be slowed or interrupted if the patient develops an infusion reaction. The infusion must be discontinued immediately if the patient experiences a potentially life -threatening infusion rea ction (see 2 CONTRAINDICATIONS and 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ). Premedication Recommendations Premedication with an oral antihistamine, with or without an antipyretic, may be administered before the infusion of belimumab (see 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ). Subcutaneous injection SLE The recommended dosage is 200 mg once weekly given as a subcutaneous injection in the abdomen or thigh, preferably on the same day each week. Subcutaneous dosing is not based on weight. Lupus Nephritis In adult patients initiating therapy for lupus nephritis (see 14 CLINICAL TRIALS ), the recommended dosage regimen is a 400 mg dose (two 200 mg injections) once weekly for 4 doses, then 200 mg once weekly thereafter. The dose is given as subcutaneous injection(s) in the abdomen or thigh, preferabl y on the same day each week. In patients not requiring induction therapy for lupus nephritis, the recommended dosage is 200 mg once weekly. The efficacy and safety of 200 mg administered subcutaneously in patients with active lupus nephritis is based on da ta from administration of 10 mg/kg intravenously (see Intravenous Administration) and pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 6 of 68 Transitioning from Intravenous Therapy to Subcutaneous Therapy If a patient with SLE is being transitioned from Benlysta intravenous therapy to Benlysta subcutaneous therapy, administer the first subcutaneous dose of 200 mg 1 to 4 weeks after the last intravenous dose (see 10.3 Pharmacokinetics ). If a patient with lupus nephritis from Benlysta intravenous therapy to Benlysta subcutaneous therapy, administer the first subcutaneous dose 1 to 2 weeks after the last intravenous dose. This transition can or may occur any time after the patient completes the first 2 intravenous doses (see 10.3 Pharmacokinetics ). 4.3 Reconstitution Table 1 Reconstitution of lyophilized powder for intravenous infusion Vial Size Volume of Diluent to be Added to Vial Nominal Concentration per mL Upon Reconstitution Approximate Available Volume Upon Final Dilution 120 mg as lyophilized powder in 5 mL vial 1.5 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP 80 mg/mL* 250 mL 400 mg as lyophilized powder in 20 mL vial 4.8 mL Sterile Water for Injection, USP *The reconstituted solution must be further diluted to 250 mL in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal saline). Preparation of Solutions Benlysta is provided as a lyophilized powder in a single -use vial for intravenous infusion after reconstitution and dilution. Benlysta does not contain a preservative; therefore reconstitution and dilution must be carried out under aseptic conditions as follows: 1. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for the vial to warm to room temperature. 2. Reconstitute the Benlysta powder with Sterile Water for Injection, USP (sterile water), as follows. The reconstituted solutio n will contain a concentration of 80 mg/mL belimumab. Reconstitute 120 mg in 5 mL vial with 1.5 mL sterile water. Reconstitute 400 mg in 20 mL vial with 4.8 mL sterile water. 3. The stream of sterile water should be directed toward the side of the vial to m inimize foaming. Gently swirl the vial for 60 seconds. Allow the vial to sit at room temperature during reconstitution, gently swirling the vial for 60 seconds every 5 minutes until the powder is dissolved. DO NOT SHAKE. Reconstitution is typically complet e within 10 to 15 minutes after the sterile water has been added, but it may take up to 30 minutes. Protect the reconstituted solution from direct sunlight. 4. If a mechanical reconstitution device (swirler) is used to reconstitute Benlysta , it should not exceed 500 rpm and the vial swirled for no longer than 30 minutes. 5. Once reconstitution is complete, the solution should be opalescent and colourless to pale yellow, and without particles. Small air bubbles, however, are expected and acceptable. 6. Dilute the reconstituted product to 250 mL in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal saline) for IV infusion. 5% Dextrose IV solutions are incompatible with Benlysta and should not May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 7 of 68 be used. From a 250 -mL infusion bag or bottle of normal saline, withdr aw and discard a volume equal to the volume of the reconstituted solution of Benlysta required for the patient's dose. Then add the required volume of the reconstituted solution of Benlysta into the infusion bag or bottle. Gently invert the bag or bottle t o mix the solution. Any unused solution in the vials must be discarded. 7. Inspect the solution of Benlysta visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Discard the solution if any particul ate matter or discoloration is observed. 8. The reconstituted solution of Benlysta , if not used immediately, should be stored protected from direct sunlight and refrigerated at 2 to 8C. Solutions of Benlysta diluted in normal saline may be stored at 2 to 8C or room temperature. The total time from reconstitution of Benlysta to completion of infusion should not exceed 8 hours. 9. No incompatibilities between Benlysta and polyvinylchloride or polyolefin bags have been observed. 4.4 Administration Intravenous Administration Benlysta vials for intravenous infusion must be reconstituted and diluted prior to administration (see Preparation of Solutions). Do not administer as an intravenous push or bolus. Benlysta should be administered in an appropriate setting by qualified healthcare providers trained to give infusion therapy and prepared to treat hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis. Monitor patients during and for an appropriate amount of time after administration of Benlysta (see 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ). The intravenous infusion of the diluted solution of Benlysta should be administered over a period of 1 hour. It is recommended that a 21-25 gauge needle be used when piercing the vial stopper for reconstitution and dilution. Benlysta should not be infused concomitantly in the same intravenous line with other agents. No physical or biochemical compatibility studies have been conducted to evaluate the co -administration of Benlysta with other agents. Subcutaneous injection Autoinjectors must NOT be used for intravenous injection. It is recommended that the first subcutaneous injection of Benlysta should be under the supervision of a healthcare professional. After an initial training in proper subcutaneous injection technique and education about signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions (see 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS , hypersensitivity reactions ), a patient with SLE may self -inject (or the patient caregiver may administer) Benlysta if a physician determines that it is appropriate and with medical follow -up as necessary. See also PATIENT MEDICATION INFORMATI ON and INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE. Instruct the patient or patient caregiver to follow the directions for administration provided in the PATIENT MEDICATION INFORMATION and INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE. Instruct the patient to remove the autoinjector from the refrigerator and allow it to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to the subcutaneous injection. Do not warm Benlysta in any other May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 8 of 68 way. Prior to administration, instruct the patient or patien t caregiver to visually inspect the window of autoinjector for particulate matter or discoloration, whenever solution and container permit. Benlysta should be clear to opalescent and colorless to pale yellow. Do not use Benlysta if the product exhibits dis coloration or particulate matter . Benlysta may be given as a subcutaneous injection in the abdomen or thigh. When injecting in the same body region, advise the patient to use a different injection site for each injection; never give injections into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. When a 400 mg dose is administered at the same site, it is recommended that the 2 individual 200 mg injections be administered at least 5 cm (approximately 2 inches) apart. Instruct the patient to administer Benlysta once a week, preferably on the same day each week. 4.5 Missed Dose Intravenous Administration If a dose is missed or the patient is unable to attend appointment for one of the infusions, the missed dose should be administered as soon as possible. Subcutaneous injection If a dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible. Thereafter, patients can resume dosing on their usual day of administration, or start a ne w weekly schedule from the day that the missed dose was administered. 5 OVERDOSAGE There is limited experience with overdosage of Benlysta . Adverse reactions reported in associati on with cases of overdose have been consistent with those expected for Benlysta . Two doses of up to 20 mg/kg have been given 21 days apart by intravenous infusion to humans with no increase in incidence or severity of adverse reactions compared with doses of 1, 4, or 10 mg/kg. For management of a suspected drug overdose, contact your regional poison control centre . 6 DOSAGE FORMS, STRENGTHS, COMPOSITION AND PACK AGING To help ensure the traceability of biologic products, including biosimilars, health professionals should recognise the importance of recording both the brand name and the non -proprietary (active ingredient) name as well as other product -specific identifiers such as the Drug Identification Number (DIN) and the batch/lot number of the product supplied.

Route of Administration (Common Name) Dosage Form / Strength Non -medicinal Ingredients Intravenous Infusion (belimumab for injection) Lyophilized powder for intravenous infusion 120 mg in 5 mL vial 400 mg in 20 mL vial (80 mg/mL after reconstitution) citric Injection (belimumab injection) Solution for subcutaneous injection 200 mg in 1 mL L-arginine hydrochloride, L-histidine, L -histidine monohydrochloride, p olysorb ate 80, sodium chloride, water for injections May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 10 of 68 General Benlysta treatment should be initiated and supervised by a qualified physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of SLE or lupus nephritis. Concomitant Use with Other Biologic Therapies Available data do not support the co-administration of rituximab with Benlysta in patients with SLE (see 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS, Conc omitant Use with Other Biologic Therapies ). The safety and efficacy of Benlysta in combination with other biologic therapies, including B -cell targeted therapies , have not been established . Therefore, the use of Benlysta is not recommended in combination w ith biologic therapies . Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis As with other immunomodulating agents, the mechanism of action of Benlysta could increase the risk for the development of malignancies. The effect of treatment with Benlysta on the development of malignancies is not known (see 8 ADVERSE REACTION S, Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions ). Driving and Operating Machinery There have been no studies to investigate the effect of Benlysta on driving performance or the ability to operate machinery. No detrimental effects on such activities are predicted from the pharmacology of belimumab. Exercise caution when driving or operating a vehicle or potentially dangerous machinery. The clinical status of the patient and the safety profile of Benlysta should be borne in mind when considering the patient's ability to perform tasks that require judgement, motor or cognitive skills. Immune Immunization Live vaccines should not be given for 30 days before, or concurrently with Benlysta as clinical safety has not been established. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection from persons receiving live vaccines to patients receiving Benlysta . Because of its mechanism of action, Benlysta may interfere with the response to immunizations. However, in a study evaluating the response to a 23 -valent pneumococcal vaccine, overall immune responses to the different serotypes were similar in SLE patients receiving Benlysta compa red with those not receiving treatment at the time of vaccination. Limited data suggest that Benlysta does not significantly affect the ability to maintain a protective immune response to immunizations received prior to administration of Benlysta . Infections As with other immunomodulating agents, the mechanism of action of belimumab may increase the risk for the development of infections. In controlled clinical studies, fatal infections were uncommon, but occurred more frequently in patients receivi ng belimumab compared with placebo. Overall, the incidence of serious infections was similar across the belimumab and placebo groups (see 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Patients who develop an infection while undergoing treatme nt with belimumab should be monitored closely, and consideration should be given to stopping immunosuppressant therapy. Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of Benlysta in patients with severe or chronic infections. Progressive Mul tifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) resulting including fatal May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 11 of 68 cases, has been reported in SLE patients receiving immunosuppressant pharmacotherapy, including belimumab. A diagnosis of PML should be considered in any p atient presenting with new onset deficits or deterioration in cognition, speech or ocular functions, and/or motor and gait disturbances, and/or seizures. If PML is suspected it should be urgently investigated by a neurologist or other appropriate specialis t, considering also CNS lupus in the differential diagnosis. Where appropriate, immunosuppressant medications including Benlysta should be withheld until PML is excluded. Immunogenicity In the two controlled Phase III intravenous SLE clinical studies (St udies 2 and 3), anti -belimumab antibodies were detected in 4 of 563 (0.7%) patients receiving Benlysta 10 mg/kg and in 27 of 559 (4.8%) patients receiving Benlysta 1 mg/kg. The reported frequency for the group receiving 10 mg/kg may underestimate the actua l frequency due to lower assay sensitivity in the presence of high drug concentrations. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in three patients receiving Benlysta 1 mg/kg. Three patients with anti -belimumab antibodies experienced mild infusion reactions of nausea, erythematous rash, pruritus, eyelid edema, headache, and dyspnea; none of the reactions were serious. The clinical relevance of the presence of anti -belimumab antibodies is not known. In the subcutaneous SLE study (Study 4), there was no formation of anti -belimumab antibodies in 553 patients who received Benlysta 200 mg SC once weekly dose during the 52 -week placebo -controlled period. In the Phase III lupus nephritis study with Benlyst a 10 mg/kg administered intravenously (Study 5), none of the 224 adult patients developed anti -belimumab antibodies during the 104 week, placebo -controlled period. The data reflect the percentage of patients whose test results were positive for antibodies to belimumab in specific assays. The observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay is highly dependent on several factors, including assay sensitivity and specificity, assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant med ications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to belimumab with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. Neurologic The safety and efficacy of Benlysta have not been evaluated in patients with severe active central nervous system lupus. Psychiatric In controlled clinical intravenous and subcutaneous studies, psychiatric disorders (depression, suicidal ideation and behaviour, and self -injury) have been reported more frequently in p atients receiving Benlysta , including one suicide in a patient receiving 10 mg/kg and one suicide in a patient receiving 1 mg/kg (see 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS, Psychiatric Disorders ). Physicians should carefully assess the risk of depression, suicide and self -injury considering the patient's medical history and current psychiatric status before treatment with Benlysta , and continue to monitor patients during treatment. Health professionals should advise patients (and caregivers whe re appropriate) to contact their healthcare provider in a timely manner if they experience new or worsening psychiatric symptoms. The risk and benefit of continued treatment with Benlysta should be carefully assessed for patients who develop such symptoms. May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 12 of 68 Sensitivity Infusion/Injection -Related Systemic Reactions and Hypersensitivity Administration of Benlysta may result in infusion or injection -related systemic reactions and hypersensitivity reactions, which can be severe or fatal. In the event of a severe reaction, Benlysta administration must be interrupted and appropriate medical therapy administered. Patien ts with a history of multiple drug allergies or significant hypersensitivity may be at increased risk (see 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Infusion or injection -related systemic reactions and hypersensitivity reactions occurred more frequently with the first two doses and tended to decrease with subsequent doses (see 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Delay in the onset of acute hypersensitivity reactions and recurrence of clinically significant reactions after initial resolution of symptoms following appropriate treatment, have been observed. Patients treated with Benlysta should be made aware of these potential risks, the signs and symptoms of such reactions, and the importance of immediately seeking med ical attention. Symptoms may include anaphylactic reaction, dyspnea. Delayed -type, non -acute hypersensitivity reactions may also occur and include symptoms such as rash, nausea, fatigue, myalgia, headache, and faci al edema. Additional information for intravenous infusion If administered intravenously, Benlysta should be administered in an appropriate setting by qualified healthcare providers trained to give infusion therapy and prepared to treat hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis. In clinical trials, serious infusion and hypersensitivity reactions affected less than 1% of patients. Delay in the onset of hypersensitivity reactions has been observed. Therefore, patients should be monitored during and for an appr opriate period of time after intravenous infusion of Benlysta . Premedication with an oral antihistamine, with or without an antipyretic, may be administered before the infusion of belimumab. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether premedication diminishes the frequency or severity of infusion reactions (see 4 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Dosing Considerations ). The BENLYSTA MONARCH PROGRAM has been established to facilitate the administration of Benlys ta. The BENLYSTA MONARCH PROGRAM clinics are staffed by qualified healthcare professionals that have been trained in the administration of Benlysta . These clinics are available throughout Canada. Information about these clinics and the location of these cl inics can be obtained by calling GSK Medical information at: 1 -800-387-7374. 7.1 Special Populations 7.1.1 Pregnant Women There are limited data on the use of Benlysta in pregnant women. No formal studies have been conducted. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, including belimumab, can cross the pla centa. Benlysta should not be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. If prevention of pregnancy is warranted, women of childbearing potential should use adequate contraception while using Benlysta and for at least 4 months after the last Benlysta treatment. Animal studies did not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to maternal toxicity, pregnancy or embryofetal development except reductions in B -cells and IgM in infant monkeys exp osed in utero (see 16 NON -CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY ). May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 13 of 68 Monitor infants of treated mothers for B -cell reduction and depending upon the results, consider delaying infant vaccination with live viral vaccines. B -cell reduct ion in infants may also interfere with the response to immunisations (see 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ). Pregnancy Registry : To monitor maternal -fetal outcomes of pregnant women with lupus exposed to Benlysta , a pregnancy registry has been established. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to refer patients , and pregnant women are encouraged to enrol themselves by calling 1 -877-311-8972 or visiting https://mothertobaby.org/ongoing . 7.1.2 safety of Benlysta for use during lactation has not been established. There are no data regarding the excretion of belimumab in human milk, or systemic absorption of belimumab after ingestion. Although belimumab was excreted into the milk of cynomolgus monkey, published literature suggests that human neonatal and infant consumption of breast milk does not result in clinically significant absorption of maternal IgG antibodies into circulation. There were treatment -related reductions in B -cells and IgM in infant monkeys exposed in ute ro which lasted 3 -6 months post -partum (see 16 NON -CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY). It is recommended that a decision should be made about Benlysta therapy in breast -feeding mothers, taking into account the importance of breast -feeding to the infant and the importance of the drug to the mother, and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Benlysta or from the underlying maternal condition. 7.1.3 Pediatrics No data were made available to Health Canada; therefore, Health Canada has not authorized an indication for pediatric use. 7.1.4 Geriatrics Although data are limi ted, dosage adjustment is not recommended in patients >65 years of age (see 10 CLINICAL PHARMACOLO GY, Pharmacokinetics ). 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS 8.1 Adverse Reaction Overview Clinical trials have been conducted in SLE patients treated with intravenous and subcutaneous Benlysta , plus standard therapy . The overall safety profil e for patients receiving Benlysta intravenously and subcutaneously was similar, with the exception of injection site reaction. The most common serious adverse events were serious infections (5.7% and 5.2% in the groups receiving intravenous Benlysta and p lacebo, respectively, and 4.1% and 5.4% in the groups receiving subcutaneous Benlysta and placebo, respectively). Serious opportunistic infections occurred in <1% of patients receiving intravenous or subcutaneous Benlysta , and no patients receiving placebo . Some infections were severe or fatal (see 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS and 8.2 Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions ). The safety of Benlysta 10 mg/kg administered intravenously plus standard therapy (n = 224) compared with placebo plus standard therapy (n = 224) was also evaluated in adults with lupus nephritis for up to May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 14 of 68 104 weeks (see 14 CLINICAL TRIALS ). The adverse reactions observed were consistent with the known safety profile of intravenous or subcutaneous Benlysta plus standard therapy in patients with SLE. The data presented within Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions therefore reflects the known safety profile as defined in SLE studies, and data from lupus nephritis studies is also presented, where differences exist. 8.2 Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions Clinical trials are conducte d under very specific conditions . The adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials ; therefore, may not reflect the rates observed in practice and should not be compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug . Adverse reaction inf ormation from clinical trials may be useful in identifying and approximating rates of adverse drug reactions in real -world use. In three placebo -controlled pre -registration intravenous SLE trials, 674 patients received Benlysta (10 mg/kg intravenously over a 1-hour period on Days 0, 14, 28, and then every 28 days up to 52 weeks) plus standard therapy , and 675 patients received placebo plus standard therapy . In the 674 patients receiving Benlysta , treatment was received for up to 52 weeks in 401 patients and up to 76 weeks in 273 patients. In the intravenous SLE trials, the population receiving Benlysta was aged 18 to 71 years, 96% female, and the race distribution was 50% white/Caucasian, 19% Asian, 19% Alaska native/American Indian, 32% of subjects were Hispanic/Latino ethnicity . The majority of patients were also receiving one or more of the following concomitant treatments for antihypertensives (24%). More than half of the patients were receiving systemic corticosteroids at doses equivalent to >7.5 mg/day of prednisone (54% of patients receiving Benlysta 10 mg/kg and 55% of pa tients receiving placebo). The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to any adverse events was 6.7% for patients receiving Benlysta 10 mg/kg and 7.1% for patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse events resulting in discontinuation of treatment (>2 subjects in either treatment group) were lupus nephritis and infusion reactions (1% 0.3% placebo). In the placebo -controlled pre -registration subcutaneous SLE trial, 556 patients received 200 mg Benlysta plus standard therapy once weekly up to 52 weeks, and 280 patients received placebo plus standard therapy (see 14 CLINICAL TRIALS ). The overall population had a mean age of 39 years (range: 18 to 77), 94% were female, and 60% were white. The majority of subjects were also receiving one or more of the followi ng using steroids, the average prednisone dose was >7.5 mg/day for 60.2% of subjects. The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to any adverse reaction during the controlled clinical trial was 7.2% of patients receiving Benlysta and 8.9% of patients receiving placebo. The most common adverse reactions resulting in discontinuation of treatmen t (>2 subjects in either treatment group) were lupus nephritis (0.7% in both arms) and thrombocytopenia (0% for Benlysta and 1.1% for placebo). Table 3 and Table 4 list adverse events, regardless of causality, occurring in at least 1% of patients who received Benlysta , and at an incidence at least 1% greater than that observed with placebo, in the three intravenous studies and one subcutaneous SLE controlled clinical study, respectively.

Overall, the incidence of serious infections was similar in patients receiving Benlysta compared with placebo. Physicians should exercise caution when considering the use of Benlysta in patients with severe or chronic infections. Con sider interrupting Benlysta therapy in patients who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with Benlysta and monitor these patients closely. In the controlled intravenous pre -registration clinical trials, the overall incidence of infections was 71% in patients receiving Benlysta compared with 67% in patients receiving placebo. The most frequent infections (>5% of patients receiving Benlysta ) were upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, and influenza. Serious infections occurred in 6.0% of patients receiving Benlysta and in 5.2% of patients receiving placebo. The most frequent serious infections included pneumonia, urinary tract infection, cellulitis and bronchitis. Infections leading to discontinuation of treatment occurred in 0.7% of patients receiving Benlysta and 1.0% of patients May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 17 of 68 receiving placebo. Infections resulting in death occurred in 0.3% (4/1458) of patients receiving Benlysta and in 0.1% (1/675) of patients receiving placebo. In the controlled subcutaneous clinical study (N = 836), the overall incidence of infections was 55% in the group receiving Benlysta and 57% in the group receiving placebo. Only bacterial urinary tract infection occurred in at least 3% of patients receiving Benlysta and at least 1% more frequently than patients receiving placebo. Serious infections occurred in 4.1% of patients receiving Benlysta and 5.4% of patients receiving placebo; serious opportunistic infections accounted for 0.2% and 0% of these, respectively. Infections resulting in death occurred in 0.5% (3/556) of patients receiving Benlysta and in no patients receiving placebo (0/280). In the randomized, double -blind , placebo Benlysta 10 mg/kg administered intravenously (N = 4,003), serious infections occurred in 3.7% of patients receiving Benlysta and in 4.1% of patients receiving placebo. Serious infect ions leading to discontinuation of treatment occurred in 1.0% of patients receiving Benlysta and in 0.9% of patients receiving placebo. Fatal infections occurred in 0.45% (9/2002) of patients receiving Benlysta and in 0.15% (3/2001) of patients receiving p lacebo, while the incidence of all -cause mortality was 0.50% (10/2002) in patients receiving Benlysta and 0.40% (8/2001) in patients receiving placebo. In the randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 104 -week trial of active lupus nephritis, adult patients were receiving standard therapy in addition to Benlysta administered intravenously (N = 448) (see 14 CLINICAL TRIALS ). The overall incidence of infections was 82.1% (184/224) in patients receiving Benlysta compared with 76.3% (171/224) in patients receiving placebo. Serious infections occurred in 13.8% (31/224) of patients receiving Benlysta and in 17.0% (38/224) of patients receiving placebo. Fatal infections occurred in 0.9% (2/224) of patients receiving Benlysta and in 0.9% (2/224) of patients receiving placebo. Infusion/Injection -Related Systemic Reactions and Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions and infusion - or injection -related systemic reactions were observed in clinical trials. 'Hypersensitivity reac tion' covers a group of terms, including anaphylaxis, and can manifest as a range of symptoms including hypotension, angioedema, urticaria or other rash, pruritus, and dyspnea. 'infusion/injection -related systemic reaction' covers a group of terms and can manifest as a range of symptoms including bradycardia, myalgia, headache, rash, urticaria, pyrexia, hypotension, hypertension, dizziness, and arthralgia. Due to overlap in signs and symptoms, it is not possible to distinguish between hypersensitivity react ions and infusion/injection -related systemic reactions in all cases. Intravenous Infusion The incidence of infusion reactions, including hypersensitivity reactions, in SLE trials was 17% and 15% in the groups receiving intravenous Benlysta 10 mg/kg and pl acebo, respectively. The most common infusion reactions ( 1% of patients receiving intravenous Benlysta 10 mg/kg) were headache, nausea, infusion -related specified), arthralgia, hypotension, hypertension, and pyrexia. Dermatologic manifestati ons were 1.8% of patients receiving intravenous Benlysta and 1.5% of patients receiving placebo and included events such as urticaria, other rashes, and pruritus. Severe and/or serious infusion or hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 1.2 % and 0.6% of subjects receiving intravenous Benlysta 10 mg/kg and placebo, respectively. Reactions that led to discontinuation of treatment occurred in 1% and 0.3% of subjects receiving intravenous Benlysta 10 mg/kg and placebo, respectively. Infusion rea ctions were generally observed on the day of the infusion, and occurred more frequently with the first two infusions and tended to decrease with subsequent infusions. Delayed -type, May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 18 of 68 non-acute hypersensitivity reactions have also been observed and include d symptoms such as rash, nausea, fatigue, myalgia, headache, and facial oedema. Patients with a history of multiple drug allergies or significant hypersensitivity reactions may be at increased risk. Serious and/or severe hypersensitivity reactions included dr ug hypersensitivity (not specified), anaphylactic reaction, and angioedema (see 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether premedication diminishes the frequency or severity of infusion reactions. Over 15,000 belimumab infusions were administered in the Phase III clinical studies, with approximately 800 belimumab infusions administered to patients who had been premedicated with an antihistamine and antipyretic at the investig ator's discretion. In these trials, subjects with a history of allergies were more likely to have been premedicated (22%) than subjects without a history of allergies (9%). The proportion of infusions with infusion reactions was numerically greater for pre medicated infusions than non -premedicated infusions (3% vs 2%, respectively). However, the incidence of serious and/or severe infusion reactions was 0.1% for non -premedicated infusions while none occurred with premedicated infusions. Subcutaneous Injection In the subcutaneous SLE clinical study, the frequency of injection site reactions was 6.1% (34/556) and 2.5% (7/280) for patients receiving Benlysta and placebo, respectively. These injection site reactions (including pain, erythema, hematoma, pr uritus, and induration) were mild to moderate in severity. The majority did not necessitate drug discontinuation. Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions associated with Benlysta administered subcutaneously and requiring permanent treatment disco ntinuation were reported in 0.2% (1/556) of patients. Malignancies The effect of treatment with Benlysta on the development of malignancies is not known. In the controlled SLE clinical trials (N=2969) of Benlysta administered intravenously (1 mg/kg, 4 mg /kg, 10 mg/kg) or subcutaneously (200 mg) for 52 weeks, malignancies (including non -melanoma skin cancers) were reported in 0.3% (7/2014) of patients receiving Benlysta and 0.3% (3/955) of patients receiving placebo. In the controlled clinical trials, mali gnancies, excluding non -melanoma skin cancers, were observed in 0.2% (4/2014) and 0.2% (2/955 of patients receiving Benlysta and placebo, respectively. As with other immunomodulating agents, the mechanism of action of Benlysta could increase the risk for the development of malignancies. Psychiatric Disorders In the pre -registration intravenous SLE clinical studies, serious psychiatric events were reported in 1.2% (8/674) of patients receiving belimumab 10 mg/kg and 0.4% (3/675) of patients receiving placebo. Serious depression was reported in 0.6% (4/674) of patients receiving belimumab 10 mg/kg and 0.3% (2/675) of patients receiving placebo. One suicide was reported in a patient receiving belimumab 10 mg/kg (and one was reported in a patient receivin g belimumab 1 mg/kg); there were no reports in patients receiving placebo. In the large post -marketing SLE study (BEL115467) with belimumab 10 mg/kg administered intravenously, serious psychiatric events were reported in 1.0% (20/2002) of patients receivin g belimumab and 0.3% (6/2001) of patients receiving placebo. Serious depression was reported in 0.3% (7/2002) of patients receiving belimumab and <0.1% (1/2001) receiving placebo. The overall incidence of serious suicidal ideation or behaviour or self -injury without suicidal intent was 0.7% (15/2002) in the belimumab group and 0.2% (5/2001) in the placebo group. On the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 19 of 68 Scale (C -SSRS), 2.4% (48/1974) of patients receiving belimumab reported suicidal ideation or behaviour comp ared with 2.0% (39/1988) of patients receiving placebo. No suicide was reported in either group. The intravenous studies did not exclude patients with a history of psychiatric disorders. In the pre -registration subcutaneous SLE clinical study, which exclud ed patients with a history of psychiatric disorders, serious psychiatric events were reported in 0.2% (1/556) of patients receiving belimumab and in no patients receiving placebo. There were no serious depression related events or suicides reported in eith er group. On the C -SSRS, 1.3% (7/554) of patients receiving belimumab reported suicidal ideation or behaviour and 0.7% (2/277) of patients receiving placebo. Concomitant Use with Other Biologic Therapies Concomitant Use of Rituximab in Adults: Benlysta administered subcutaneously in combination with a single cycle of rituximab was studied in a Phase III, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 104 - week study in adult patients (n=292) with SLE (Study 205646). A higher frequency of adverse events (91.7 % vs. 87.5 %), serious adverse events (22.2 % vs. 13.9 %), serious infections (9.0 % vs. 2.8 %) and post -injection systemic reactions (13.2% vs. 9.7%) were observed in patients treated with Benlysta in combination with rituximab as compared to Benlysta in combination with placebo. 8.3 Less Common Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions The uncommon adverse reactions are related to infusion reactions, which include: anaphylactic reactions, angioedema, rash, and urticaria. See 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS, Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions, Infusion / Injection -Related Systemic Reactions and Hypersensitivity . 8.5 Post -Market Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions have been identified during post -approval use of Benlysta . Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Fatal anaphylaxis (see 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Infusion/ Injection -Related Systemic Reactions and Hypersensitivity ). Fatal progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (see 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Immune ). 9 DRUG INTERACTIONS 9.2 Drug Interactions Overview Formal drug interaction studies have not been performed with Benlysta . Co-administration of steroids and angiotensin -converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors increased mean clearance of Benlysta but the magnitude was within the range of normal variability of clearance . In clinical trials, concomitant use significantly influence Benlysta pharmacokinetics. The effect of other biologic therapies, including B -cell targeted therapies, on the p harmacokinetics of Benlysta has not been established . May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 20 of 68 10 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOG Y 10.1 Mechanism of Action Belimumab is a B Lymphocyte Stimulator (BLyS) -specific inhibitor that blocks the binding of soluble BLyS, a B-cell survival factor, to its receptor on B -cells. Belimumab does not bind B -cells directly, but by binding BLyS, belimumab inhibits the survival of B -cells, including autoreactive B -cells, and reduces the differentiation of B -cells into immunoglobulin producing plasma cells. 10.2 Pharmacodynamics In the controlled clinical SLE stud ies, treatment with either IV or SC formulations of BENLYSTA provided similar results, including effects such as reduced circulating CD19+, CD20+, na\u00efve, transitional, and activated B -cells, plasma cells, plasmacytoid cells, and the SLE B -cell subset at We ek 52. Reductions in na\u00efve, plasma and short lived plasma cells as well as the SLE B -cell subset were observed as early as Week 8 and were sustained to Week 52. Memory cells increased initially and slowly declined toward baseline levels by Week 52. The cli nical relevance of these effects has not been established. Treatment of SLE with Benlysta also led to reductions in IgG and anti -dsDNA, and increases in complement (C3 and C4). These changes were observed as early as Week 8 and were sustained through Week 52. The clinical relevance of these effects has not been established. In a long -term uncontrolled SLE extension study, B -cells (including na\u00efve, activated, plasma cells and the SLE B -cell subset) and IgG levels were followed for more than 7 years. A substantial and sustained decrease in various B -cell subsets was observed. A reduction in IgG levels was also observed. Over the course of the study, the reported incidence of AEs generally remained stable or declined. In patients with lupus nephritis, fol lowing treatment with Benlysta or placebo, there was an increase in serum IgG levels which was associated with decreased proteinuria. Relative to placebo, smaller increases in serum IgG levels were observed with Benlysta group as expected with the known mechanism of belimumab. At Week 104, the median percent increase from baseline in IgG was 17% for belimumab and 37% for placebo. Reductions in autoantibodies, increases in complement, and reductions in circulating total B cells and B -cell subsets observed we re consistent with the SLE studies. 10.3 Pharmacokinetics SLE The pharmacokinetic parameters displayed in Table 5 are based on population parameter estimates from 1122 SLE patients who received intravenous belimumab 1 mg/kg (N=559) or 10 mg/kg (N=563); and from 661 subjects, comprised of 554 SLE patients and 107 healthy s ubjects, who received belimumab injected subcutaneously (see 14 CLINICAL TRIALS ). May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 21 of 68 Table 5 Population Pharmacokinetic Parameters After Intravenous Infusion of BENLYSTA 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, or Administration weekly Pharmacokinetic Intravenousa, BENLYSTA (n = BENLYSTA 10 mg/kg (n = 563) Subcutaneousa BENLYSTA 200 mg weekly (n= 661) Peak concentration (C max, g/mL) 30.1 313 108 Area under the curve (AUC 0-, dayg/mL) 308 3,083 726 Distribution half -life (t \u00bd, days) 1.14 1.75 1.1 Terminal half -life (t \u00bd, days) 12.5 19.4 18.3 Systemic clearance (CL, mL/day) 215 215 204 Volume of distribution (V ss, L) 3.70 5.29 4.95 a IV population: SLE patients. SC population: 554 SLE, 107 healthy. b Intravenous infusions were administered at 2 -week intervals for the first 3 doses and at 4 -week intervals thereafter. c The 1 mg/kg dose is not recommended Lupus Nephritis A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted in 224 adult patients with lupus nephritis who received belimumab 10 mg/kg intravenously (Days 0, 14, 28, and then every 28 day s up to 104 weeks) plus standard therapy (see 14 C LINICAL TRIALS ). In patients with lupus nephritis, due to renal disease activity, belimumab clearance was initially higher than observed in SLE studies . After 24 weeks of treatment and throughout the remainder of the trial, belimumab clearance and exposure were similar to that observed in patients with SLE who received belimumab 10 mg/kg intravenously. Based on population pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation, the avera ge belimumab concentration during the first 12 weeks was predicted to be 78 \u00b5g/mL following the subcutaneous 400 mg weekly loading dose s for the first 4 doses then 200 mg weekly thereafter , which is similar to the estimated concentration of 89 \u00b5g/mL following intravenous administration. In addition, t he steady -state average concentrations of subcutaneous administration of belimumab 200 mg once weekly in adults with lupus nephritis are predicted to be similar to those observed in adults with lupus neph ritis receiving belimumab 10 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks. Absorption Following belimumab intravenous infusion over 1 hour, maximum serum concentrations (C max) were reached shortly after the completion of infusion. The C max was 30.1 \u00b5g/mL and 313 \u00b5g/ mL for 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses, respectively. AUC 0- was 308 and 3083 \u00b5g\u00b7day/mL for 1 and 10 mg/kg doses, respectively. Following belimumab weekly subcutaneous administration, the time (Tmax) to reach maximum serum concentration (Cmax) at steady -state was 2.6 days after administration. There were minor fluctuations around the average concentration (Cavg 104 mcg/mL), with Cmax 108 g/mL and Cmin 97 mcg/mL at steady state. The bioavailability of belimumab was approximately 74%. May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 22 of 68 Distribution Belimumab, as a macromolecule, is expected to distribute to plasma and intracellular compartments and have limited distribution to tissue s. Consistent with PK parameters from other monoclonal antibodies, the volume of distribution of belimumab at steady -state was 56 -80 mL/kg based on median body weight of the population [66.3 kg]). Metabolism Belimumab is a protein for which the expected metabolic pathway is degradation to small peptides and individual amino acids by widely distributed proteolytic enzymes. Classical biotransformation studies have not been conducted. Elimination Serum belimumab concentrations declined in a bi -exponential manner. In general, renal elimination is relatively unimportant for monoclonal antibodies, since their large size prevents efficient filtration through the intact glomerulus. Accordingly, no studies of renal elimination of belimumab were performed. Althoug h increases in creatinine clearance and proteinuria (>2 g/day) increased belimumab clearance, these effects were within the expected range of variability. The effect of renal disease on elimination of belimumab is otherwise unknown. Transitioning from Int ravenous to Subcutaneous Administration SLE Patients with SLE transitioning from 10 mg/kg intravenously (IV) every 4 weeks to 200 mg subcutaneously (SC) weekly using a 1 to 4 week switching interval had, on average, pre -dose belimumab serum concentrations at their first SC dose which closely approximated the trough concentration achieved 7 weeks after the first SC dose. Lupus Nephritis Based on population pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation, 1 to 2 weeks after completing the first 2 intravenous doses, patients with lupus nephritis transitioning from 10 mg/kg IV to 200 mg SC weekly, are predicted to have average belimumab serum concentrations similar to patients dosed with 10 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks (see 4 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Special Populations and Conditions The following information is based on the population pharmacokinetic analyses of intravenous and subcutaneous administration of Benlysta . Pediatrics : No pharmacokinetic data are available in pediatric patients. Geriatrics : Age did not affect belimumab exposure within the overall SLE patients studied; while the majority of subjects were between 18 and 45 years (70% with intravenous dosing; 74% with subcutaneous dosing) Limited pharmacokinetic data are available on elderly patients. Less than 2% of the subjects were 65 years or older in the pharmacokinetic analyses. Gender: Gender did not significantly influence belimumab pharmacokinetics in the largely female study population (94% 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 23 of 68 Ethnic Origin : Race did not significantly influence belimumab pharmacokinetics. The racial distribution with intravenous administration was Asian, 16% Alaska native/American and 14% American. The racial distribution with subcutaneous administration was 61% White, 20% Asian, 6% Alaska native/American Indian. Hepatic Insufficiency : No formal studies were conducted to examine the effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of belimumab. Belimumab has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Baseline ALT and AST levels did not significantly influence belimumab pharmacokinetics. Renal Insufficiency : No formal studies were conducted to examine the effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of belimumab. During clinical development, belimumab administered intravenously and subcutaneous ly was studied in a limited number of SLE patients with mild (creatinine clearance 60 and <90 mL/min), moderate (creatinine clearance 30 and <60 mL/min), (creatinine clearance 15 and <30 mL/min) renal impairment: 770 patients with mild renal i mpairment, 261 patients with moderate renal impairment, and 14 patients with severe renal impairment received belimumab intravenously; 121 patients with mild renal impairment and 30 patients with moderate renal impairment received belimumab subcutaneously. Obesity : Following belimumab subcutaneous administration at fixed dose of 200 mg once weekly, subjects with higher body weight had lower systemic belimumab exposure. However, no clinically relevant effect of body weight or body mass index (BMI) on the pharmacokinetics of belimumab was observed. Therefore, no dose adjustment is recommended based on weight or BMI for subcutaneous administration. 11 STORAGE , STABILITY AND DISPOSAL Lyophilized powder for intravenous infusion Store vials of Benlysta refrigerated between 2 to 8C.

Patients had to have a SELENA -SLEDAI score >4 at baseline and a history of autoantibodies (anti -nuclear antibody (ANA) and/or anti-double -stranded DNA (anti -dsDNA), but 28% of the population was autoantibody negative at baseline. The co -primary endpoints were percent change in SELENA -SLEDAI score at week 24 and time to first flare over 52 weeks. No significant differences between any of the Benlysta groups and the placebo group were observed. Exploratory analysis of this study identified a group of patients (72%), who were autoantibody positive, and in whom Benlysta appeared to offer benefit. The results of this study informed the design of studies 2 and 3 and led to the selection of a target population and indication tha t is limited to autoantibody -positive SLE patients. Studies 2 and 3: SLE - Benlysta 1 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg Eligible patients had active SLE disease, defined as a SELENA -SLEDAI score 6 and positive anti -nuclear antibody (ANA or anti -dsDNA) test results (ANA titre 1:80 and/or a positive anti -dsDNA [30 units/mL]) at screening. Patients were on a stable standard therapy SLE treatment regimen consisting of any of the following (alone or in combination): corticosteroids, antimalarials, NSAIDs, and/or immunosupp ressive s. In the studies, patients were not required to be treated with each of these drugs; the choice of agent or agents was based on clinical judgment. Patients were excluded from the study if they had ever received treatment with any B-cell targeted ag ent; if they had received another biologic investigational agent in the previous year; or if they had a positive response to testing for HIV antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis C antibody. The two studies were similar in design except that Study 2 was a 76-week study and Study 3 was a 52 -week study, but in both studies the primary efficacy endpoint was determined at 52 weeks. 268 subjects from Study 2 entered an open label extension study for a median of 2167 days, receiving a median of 67 ( \u00b1 26.4) Benlysta infusions. Study 2 (HGS1006 -C1056) was conducted primarily in North America and Western Europe. The racial distribution was 70% white/Caucasian, 14% 21% of subjects w ere of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity. Study 3 (HGS1006 -C1057) was conducted in South America, Eastern Europe, Asia, and Australia. The racial distribution was 38% Asian, 26% were BLISS -52 (HGS1006 - C1057) Multicentre, -blind, placebo randomized study Belimumab 1 mg/kg and/or 10 mg/kg (on days 0, 14, 28, and then every 28 days) up to 52 weeks 1 mg/kg: N=288 -centre, -label, continuation 1 mg/kg and/or 10 mg/kg (every 28 days); for up to 2674 days BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 29 of 68 The concurrent SLE medications allowed were controlled with provision for adjustments early in the trial and protocol outlined restrictions or prohibitions after specified study visits for each category of medication. This provision permitted subjects an opportunity to have their disease activity managed with medication adjustments optimized while minimizing unnecessary subject requests for withdrawal for lack of efficacy or mild disease flares. Patient mean a ge across both studies was 38 years (range: 18 to 73 years), and the majority (94%) were female. Baseline concomitant medications included corticosteroids (Study 2:76%, Study 3: 96%), immunosuppressives (Study mycophenolate), and (Study 2: 63%, Study 3: 67%). Most patients (>70%) were receiving 2 or more classes of SLE medications. In Study 2 and Study 3, more than 50% of patients had 3 or more active organ systems at baseline. The most common active organ systems at baseline based on SELENA SLEDAI were mucocutaneous (82% in both Study 85%); and musculoskeletal (Study 2: 73%, Study 3: 59%). Less than 16% of patients had some degree of renal ac tivity and less than 7% of patients had activity in the vascular, cardio -respiratory, or CNS systems. At screening, patients were stratified by disease severity based on their SELENA -SLEDAI score (<9 vs 10), proteinuria level (<2 g/24 hr vs 2 g/24 hr), a nd race (African or Indigenous -American descent versus other), and then randomly assigned to receive Benlysta 1 mg/kg, Benlysta 10 mg/kg, or placebo in addition to standard therapy . The patients were administered study medication intravenously over a 1 -hour period on Days 0, 14, 28, and then every 28 days for 48 weeks in Study 3 and for 72 weeks in Study 2. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite endpoint (SLE Responder Index) that defined response as meeting each of the following clinically relevant criteria at Week 52 compared with baseline: 4-point reduction in the SELENA -SLEDAI score, and no new British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) A organ domain score or 2 new BILAG B organ domain scores, and no worsening (<0.30 -point increase) in Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score. The SLE Responder Index uses the SELENA -SLEDAI score as an objective measure of reduction in global disease activity; the BILAG index to ensure no significant worsening in any specific organ system; and the PGA t o ensure that improvements in disease activity are not accompanied by worsening of the subject's condition overall. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (S LE) (Subcutaneous injection) The safety and efficacy of Benlysta administered subcutaneously were evaluated i n a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study including 836 patients with SLE according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria. Patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive Benlysta 200 mg or placebo subcutaneously once weekly for 52 weeks (Study 4, see Table 7).

Patients were stable on a standard therapy SLE treatment regimen including any of the following (alone or in some countries, treatment with a B-cell-targeted agent was permitted if received a year or more prior to baseline, otherwise, treatment with a B -cell-targeted agent was not permit ted. Patients were excluded from the trial if they were currently receiving other biologic agents. Anti -tumor necrosis factor plasmapheresis were not permitted within the previous 3 months or during the trial. Patients had to have a Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment -Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Index (SELENA -SLEDAI) score of 8 and positive autoantibody test (anti - nuclear antibody [ANA] and/or anti -double -stranded DNA [anti -dsDNA]) results at screening. Patients were excluded from the study if they had severe active central nervous system lupus or severe active lupus nephritis, or if they had a positive response to testing for HIV antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, or hepatitis C antibody. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite endpoint (SLE Responder Index or SRI) that defined response as meeting each of three criter ia (SELENA -SLEDAI, Physician's Global Assessment, BILAG) at Week 52 compared with baseline (see detail presented in the intravenous section above). Secondary efficacy endpoints included time to first severe flare (as measured by the modified SLE Flare Inde x) and the proportion of subjects whose average prednisone dose has been reduced by 25% from baseline to 7.5 mg/day during weeks 40 through 52. A health outcomes endpoint included mean change in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT )-Fatigue Scale score at week 52. Patient median age was 37 years (range: 18 to 77 years), and the majority (94.4%) were female. More than 50% of patients had 3 or more active organ systems at baseline. The most common active organ systems at baseline base d on SELENA -SLEDAI 11.8% of patients had some degree of renal activity and less than 15% of patients had activity in the vascular (7.7%), cardio -respiratory (5.6%), or C NS systems (1.1%). Patients were stratified by disease severity based on their SELENA -SLEDAI score (9 and 10), complement level (C3 and/or C4 low vs. other), and race (black vs. other), and then randomly assigned to receive Benlysta 200 mg subcutaneously weekly or placebo in addition to standard therapy. Baseline concomitant medications included corticosteroids (86%), patients (approximately 80% ) were receiving 2 or more classes of SLE medications. May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 31 of 68 Lupus Nephritis The efficacy and safety of Benlysta 10 mg/kg administered intravenously over a 1 hour period on Days 0, 14, 28, and then every 28 days, were evaluated in a 104 -week randomized (1:1), double -blind, placebo - controlled, Phase III study (BEL114054) in 448 patients with active lupus nephritis. Table 8 Summary of Patient Demographics for Clinical Trial in Patients with Lupus Nephritis Study # Trial design Dosage, route of administration and duration Study subjects (n=number) Mean age \u00b1 SD (Range) Gender (BEL114054) trial Belimumab 10 mg/kg IV on days 0, 14, 28 and then every 28 days for 104 - weeks N=223, 10 mg/kg N=223, placebo 31 (range: 18 to 77) Female (88%) The patients had a clinical diagnosis of SLE according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria, biopsy proven lupus nephritis Class III, IV, and/or V and had active renal disease at screening requiring standard therapy (corticosteroids with 1) mycophenolate mofetil for induction and maintenance, or 2) cyclo phosphamide for induction followed by azathioprine for maintenance). This study was conducted in Asia, North America, South America, and Europe. Patient median age was 31 years (range: 18 to 77 years); the majority (88%) of patients were female. The primar y efficacy endpoint was Primary Efficacy Renal Response (PERR) at Week 104 defined as a response at Week 100 confirmed by a repeat measurement at Week 104 of the following parameters: urinary protein:creatinine ratio (uPCR) 0.7 and estimated glomerular fi rate (eGFR) 60 mL/min/1.73m2 or no decrease in eGFR of >20% from pre -flare value. The major secondary endpoints included: Complete Renal Response (CRR) defined as a response at Week 100 confirmed by a repeat measurement at Week 104 of the following parameters: uPCR <0.5 and eGFR 90 mL/min/1.73m2 or no eGFR of >10% from pre -flare value. PERR at Week 52. Time to renal -related event or death (renal -related event defined as first event of end stage renal disease, doubling of serum creatinine, renal worsening [defined as increased proteinuria and/or impaired renal function], or receipt of renal disease related prohibited therapy). For PERR and CRR endpoints, patients dropping out of the study early or receiving prohibited medication s were considered as failures. For these endpoints, in order to be considered a responder, steroid treatment had to be reduced to 10 mg/day from Week 24. May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 32 of 68 14.2 Study Results Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) (Intravenous Infusion) In both studies 2 and 3, the proportion of SLE patients achieving an SRI response, as defined for the primary endpoint, was significantly higher in the Benlysta 10 mg/kg group than in the placebo group. The effect on the SRI was not consistently significantly different for the Benlysta 1 mg/kg group relative to placebo in both trials. The 1 mg/kg dose is not recommended. The trends in comparisons between the treatment groups for the rates of response for the individual components of the endpoint were generally consistent with that of the SRI ( Table 9). At week 76 in Study 2, the SRI response rate with Benlysta 10 mg/kg was not significantly different from that of placebo (39% and 32%, respectively). The reduction in disease activity seen in the SRI was related primarily to improvement in the most commonly involved organ systems namely, mucocutaneous, musculoskeletal, and immunology. Table 9 Clinical Response Rate in Patients with SLE After 52 Weeks of Treatment Response1 Study 2 Study 3 Placebo + Standard therapy (n = 275) BENLYSTA 1 mg/kg + Standard therapy2 (n = 271) BENLYSTA 10 mg/kg + Standard therapy (n = 273) Placebo + Standard therapy (n = 287) BENLYSTA 1 mg/kg + Standard therapy2 (n = 288) BENLYSTA 10 mg/kg + Standard therapy (n = 290) SLE Responder Index 34% 41% (p = (p < 0.001) Odds Ratio (95% CI) vs. placebo 1.3 (0.9, 1.9) 1.5 (1.1, 2.2) 1.6 (1.1, 2.2) 1.8 (1.3, 2.6) Components of SLE Responder Index Percent of patients with reduction in 4 36% 43% 47% 46% 65% 75% 69% 73% 79% 81% 73% 69% 69% 79% 80% 1Patients dropping out of the study early or experiencing certain increases in background medication were considered as failures in these analyses. In both studies, a higher proportion of placebo patients were considered as failures for this reason as compared to the BENLYSTA groups. 2The 1 mg/kg dose is not recommended. May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 33 of 68 There were too few males or patients over 65 years of age enrolled in the controlled clinical trials to draw meaningf ul conclusions about the effects of gender or age, on clinical outcomes. Effect in Black/African Patients Exploratory subgroup analyses of SRI response rate in patients of Black race were performed. In Study 2 and Study 3 combined, the SRI response rate i n Black patients (N=148) in the Benlysta groups was less than that in the placebo group (22/50 or 44% for placebo, 15/48 or 31% 18/50 or 36% for Benlysta 10 mg/kg). In Study 1, Black patients (N=106) in the Benlysta groups did not appear to have a different response than the rest of the study population. Although no definitive conclusions can be drawn from these subgroup analyses, caution should be used when considering Benlysta treatment in SLE patients of Black Afri can heritage since efficacy has not been clearly established. Effect on Concomitant Steroid Treatment In Study 2 and Study 3, 46% and 69% of patients, respectively, were receiving prednisone at doses > 7.5 mg/day at baseline. The proportion of patients ab le to reduce their average prednisone dose by at least 25% to 7.5 mg/day during Weeks 40 through 52 was not consistently significantly different for Benlysta relative to placebo in both studies. In Study 2, 17% of patients receiving Benlysta 10 mg/kg and 19% of patients receiving Benlysta 1 mg/kg achieved this level of steroid reduction compared with 13% of patients receiving placebo. In Study 3, 19%, 21%, and 12% of patients receiving Benlysta 10 mg/kg, Benlysta 1 mg/kg, and placebo, respectively, achieve d this level of steroid reduction. Effect on Severe SLE Flares The probability of experiencing a severe SLE flare, as defined by a modification of the SELENA Trial flare criteria which excluded severe flares triggered only by an increase of the SELENA -SLEDAI score to >12, was calculated for both Studies 2 and 3. The p roportion of patients having at least 1 severe flare over 52 weeks was not consistently significantly different for Benlysta relative to placebo in both studies. In Study 2, 18% of patients receiving Benlysta 10 mg/kg and 16% of patients receiving Benlysta 1 mg/kg had a severe flare compared with 24% of patients receiving placebo. In Study 3, 14%, 18%, and 23% of patients receiving Benlysta 10 mg/kg, Benlysta 1 mg/kg and placebo, respectively, had a severe flare. Effect in Higher Disease Activity Univariat e and multivariate analysis of the primary endpoint in pre -specified subgroups demonstrated that the greatest benefit was observed in patients with higher disease activity including patients with SELENA SLEDAI scores 10, patients requiring steroids to co ntrol their disease, and patients with low complement levels. Post -hoc analysis has identified high responding subgroups such as those patients with low complement and positive anti -dsDNA at baseline, see Table 10. Of these patients, 64.5% had SELENA SLEDAI scores 10 at baseline.

The rates of response for the individual components of the endpoint were consistent with that of the SRI and all 3 were statistically significantly higher in patients receiving Benlysta (Table 11).

A higher proportion of placebo patients were considered as failures for this reason as compared with the grou ps receiving Benlysta . The reduction in disease activity seen in the SRI was related primarily to improvement in the most commonly involved organ systems namely, mucocutaneous, musculoskeletal, immunologic, and vascular. Statistically significant differen ces in the SRI response were observed by week 16 and sustained through week 52 (Figure 1). May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 36 of 68 Figure 1 Proportion of SRI Responders by Visit Effect on Severe SLE Flares A severe flare in SLE was defined by the modified SELENA SLEDAI SLE Flare Index where the modification excludes severe flares that are triggered only by an increase of the SELENA SLEDAI score to >12. The proportion of patients reporting at least 1 severe f lare during the study was lower in patients treated with Benlysta (10.6%) compared with those receiving placebo (18.2%). Patients treated with Benlysta had a 49% lower risk of experiencing at least 1 severe flare during the 52 weeks of observation, relativ e to the patients receiving placebo (HR = 0.51 [95% CI: 0.35, 0.74]; P =0.0004). Of the patients experiencing a severe flare, the median time to the first severe flare was delayed in patients receiving Benlysta compared with placebo (171 days vs.118 days ). Effect on Concomitant Steroid Treatment At baseline, 60% of patients in both groups were receiving prednisone at doses >7.5 mg/day (or equivalent). Among these patients, 18.2% of patients receiving Benlysta were able to reduce their average prednisone dos e by at least 25% to 7.5 mg/day during Weeks 40 through 52 compared with 11.9% of patients on placebo (OR = 1.65 [95% CI: 0.95, 2.84]; P = 0.0732). Regardless of baseline prednisone dose, fewer patients in the Benlysta treatment group than the placebo group had increases in prednisone at week 52 (OR=0.55 [95% CI: 0.34 -0.87]; P = 0.0117); this difference was statistically significant starting from Week 20 to Week 52, with the exception of Week 32. Effect on Fatigue Benly sta demonstrated improvement in fatigue compared with placebo as measured by the FACIT Fatigue Scale score. The mean improvement in FACIT -Fatigue Scale score from baseline to week 52 was significantly greater with Benlysta (4.4) compared with placebo (2.7) ; (P=0.0130). Among patients receiving Benlysta , 44.4% of patients experienced improvement in FACIT -Fatigue Scale score exceeding the minimally important clinical difference (improvement greater than or equal to 4) at week 52 compared with 36.1% of patient s receiving placebo (P=0.0245). May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 37 of 68 Effect in Higher Disease Activity Subgroup analysis of the primary endpoint demonstrated that the greatest benefit was observed in patients with higher disease activity at baseline, including patients with SELENA SLEDAI sco res greater than or equal to 10 or patients requiring steroids to control their disease or patients with low complement levels. An additional, previously identified serologically active group, those patients with low complement and positive anti -dsDNA at b aseline, also demonstrated a greater relative response to Benlysta , see Table 12.

May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 38 of 68 Lupus Nephritis In Study 5, the proportion of lupus nephritis patients achieving PERR at Week 104 was statistically significantly higher in patients rec eiving Benlysta 10 mg/kg compared with placebo ( Table 13). The major secondary endpoints also showed statistically significant improvement with Benlysta plus standard therapy compared with placebo plus standard therapy (Table 13).

Patients who discontinued treatment early, received prohibited medication or increases in background standard therapy, or withdrew from the study were considered non -responders. Prohibited medications and increases in background standard therapy were defined as: 1) use of corticosteroids above that allowed by protocol ; 2) additional immunosuppressive agents (except topicals) beyond their induction/maintenance regimens; 3) angiotensin enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or initiated after Week 24; 4) -permitted doses for standard 5) other biologics, IV immunoglobulin, or plasmapheresis. 3The percentage of patients who did not take prohibited medications or have an increase in bac kground standard therapy at Week 104 was 83% for Benlysta and 74% for placebo. 4When excluding deaths from the analysis (1 for belimumab; 2 for placebo), the percentage of patients with a renal -related event was 15% for belimumab compared with (HR = 0.51; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.78). A numerically greater percentage of patients receiving Benlysta achieved the Primary Efficacy Renal Response beginning at Week 24 compared with placebo, and this treatment difference was maintained through Week 104. Beginning at Week 12, a numerically greater percentage of patients receiving Benlysta achieved Complete Renal Response compared with placebo and this numerical difference was maintained through Week 104. The proportion of responders for PERR and CRR by visit through Week 104 is shown in Figure 2.

Complete Renal Response (CRR) a The same patients may not have responded at each timepoint. In descriptive subgroup analyses, the PERR and CRR rates were examined by induction therapy (mycophenolate or cyclophosphamide), biopsy class (Class III or IV, Class III + V or Class IV + V, or Class V), and uPCR levels at base line (<3 g/g or 3 g/g; post -hoc analysis) ( Figure 3 ).

In descriptive subgroup analyses of time to renal -related event or death, results were consistent with the overall endpoint regardless of induction therapy (my cophenolate or cyclophosphamide), biopsy class (Class III or IV, Class III + V or Class IV + V, or Class V; post -hoc analysis), and baseline proteinuria (<3 g/g or 3 g/g; post -hoc analysis). The treatment difference was primarily driven by the renal worse ning and renal -related treatment failure components of the endpoint. 15 MICROBIOLOGY No microbiological information is required for this drug product. May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 42 of 68 16 NON -CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY General Toxicology: Nonclinical data revealed no special hazard for humans based on studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive toxicology. Intravenous and subcutaneous administration to monkeys resulted in the expected reduction in number of peripheral and lymphoid tissue B -cell counts with no associated toxicological findings (see Table 14). Safety pharmacology endpoints were included in the 4 week and 6 month toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys. No belimumab related adverse effects were noted on cardiovascular or renal endpoints at doses up to 50 mg/kg. Although no formal assessments of effects on central nervous or respiratory systems were undertaken, no treatment -related changes in these parameters were noted at repeated doses up to 50 mg/kg. Carcinogenicity: No carcinog enicity studies have been conducted with belimumab . Genotoxicity: No genotoxicity studies have been conducted with belimumab. Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology: Reproductive studies have been performed in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys receiving belimumab 150 mg/kg by intravenous infusion (approximately 9 times the anticipated maximum human clinical exposure based on AUC ) every 2 weeks for up to 21 weeks, and belimumab treatment was not associated with direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to maternal toxicity, developmental toxicity, or teratogenicity. Treatment -related findings were limited to the expected rev ersible reduction of B -cells in both dams and infants and reversible reduction of IgM in infant monkeys. B -cell numbers recovered after the cessation of belimumab treatment by about 1 year post -partum in adult monkeys and by 3 months of life in infant monk eys; IgM levels in infants exposed to belimumab in utero recovered by 6 months of age (see Table 14). Neurobehavioural assessments were conducted in in fants, and no changes were noted at maternal doses up to 150 mg/kg. May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 43 of 68 Table 14 Summary of Toxicology Findings with BENLYSTA Study ID Species/ Dose/(mg/kg)/ Route Study Design Findings / Conclusion Short Term Repeat Dose Studies A 4 Week Repeat Dose Toxicity Study of Benlysta Administered by Intravenous Injection to Cynomolgus Monkeys, with a 4 Week Recovery Period Cynomolgus monkey Doses: 0 (vehicle control), 5, 15, 50 Weekly Route: IV (bolus) after treatment; remaining 2/sex/group necropsied after 4 weeks of treatment followed by 4 weeks of recovery period In all BENLYSTA -treated dose g roups: A reduction of B cells in spleen and/or mesenteric lymph node, the expected pharmacological effect of treatment with Benlysta , was noted. There was no significant difference in the absolute numbers of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) populations (total lymphocytes, B lymphocyte subsets, T lymphocyte subsets or monocytes) at the end of treatment or at the end of the recovery phase. An increase in T cells was observed and is considered to be secondary to the decreases in B lymphocyte pop ulations. Minimal to mild thyroid follicular epithelial degeneration was noted in 1 out of 10 and 5 out of 10 Benlysta -treated monkeys at 5 and 50 mg/kg, respectively. A possible treatment relationship could not be excluded; however, similar findings were not observed in the 6 month repeat dose study. At 50 mg/kg BENLYSTA dose group: Splenic abscess (1 out of 10) and necrotizing granuloma (1 out of 10) were noted. These findings may have been associated with infection, and possible treatment relationship c ould not be excluded. In the subsequent 6 month repeat dose study, similar findings were not observed, confirming the view that the observations in the 4 week study were not treatment -related. The NOAEL is 50 mg/kg (12-fold human exposure AUC) .

The B lymphocyte reductions in the spleen and MLN resolved by the end of the recovery period. Also, a reduction in peripheral blood B cells was noted after 13 weeks of treatment in the 15 and 50 mg/kg groups and in all groups by Week 26. The reduction in B cells persisted into the recovery period through Week 39 followed by a trend for rec overy of peripheral blood B lymphocytes back to baseline levels at Week 45, which continued through to the end of the recovery period. Consistent with the pharmacologic effect of Benlysta , there was a reduction in spleen weights at Week 26. In addition, at Week 13, microscopic changes attributed to BENLYSTA administration consisted of decreased lymphoid follicle size and/or number in the spleen. A reduction in the size and/or number of lymphoid follicles in the spleen and mesenteric lymph node was also evid ent in the Benlysta - treated animals at Week 26. These effects correlated with decreases in splenic and MLN B lymphocytes at Weeks 13 and 26, as well as reduced splenic weights at Week 26. These changes, as well as splenic mesenteric B lymphocyte reduction s, resolved by the end of the recovery period. The NOAEL is 50 mg/kg (5-fold human dose on a mg/kg basis ). May 23 , 2023 BENLYSTA, Belimumab Page 45 of 68 Study ID Species/ Dose/(mg/kg)/ Route Study Design Findings / Conclusion Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity Studies Maternal, Fetal and Neonatal Toxicity Study of Benlysta Administered Bi-Weekly by Intravenous (Bolus) Injection to Pregnant Cynomolgus Monkeys, Including a One Year Postnatal Evaluation Cynomolgus monkey Doses: 0 (vehicle control), 5, 150 mg/kg Dosing: within 2 days of confirmed pregnancy by ultrasound [Gestation Day 20 (GD20) to GD22], on GD34 and every 14 days throughout pregnancy (GD150) Route: IV (bolus) 0 (vehicle control) mg/kg: Total 21 females of which 11 females were C -sectioned at GD150, and 10 females were followed out to 1 year postpartum 5 mg/kg: Total 25 females of which 13 females were C -sectioned at GD150, and 12 females were followed out to 1 year postpartum 150 mg/kg: Total 20 females of which 9 females were C -sectioned at GD150, and 11 females were followed out to 1 year postpartum In all BENLYSTA -treated dose groups: No maternal toxicity and no adverse effects on embryofetal development or teratogenicity were noted. As expected, there were decreases in total and mature B lymphocytes in maternal peripheral blood during dosing and in fetal lymphoid tis sues. Recovery of the total and mature B lymphocytes was observed in maternal blood and in infant blood and tissues after the cessation of dosing. Infant serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels were decreased in the first 3 months of life but recovered to cont rol levels by 6 months after birth. In addition, it was confirmed that Benlysta , like other antibodies of the immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) subclass, is able to cross the placenta and can be secreted into milk. After cessation of dosing and clearance of Benlyst a and just prior to (or concomitant with) B cell recovery, BLyS levels, which pre -dose were very low in adult females, transiently increased in both mothers and infants prior to returning to baseline levels. There were a total of 12 fetal losses (12 out of 66 or 18.2%); overall incidence of fetal losses and stillbirths was 3 out of 21 (14.3%) in the 0 (vehicle control), 6 out of 25 (24.0%) at 5 mg/kg dose and 3 out of 20 (15.0%) at the 150 mg/kg dose of Benlysta . There were a total of 3 neonatal deaths (3 o ut of 43 or 7.0%); overall incidence was 0 out of 10 in the 0 (vehicle control), 2 out of 12 (16.7%) at 5 mg/kg dose and 1 out of 11 (9.0%) at the 150 mg/kg dose of Benlysta . No Benlysta -related adverse effects were seen on embryofetal development in fetu ses examined following C -section (GD150) or in the aborted or stillborn fetuses. No abnormalities were noted in the 3 neonates lost within the first few weeks, confirming that the deaths were not related to Benlysta treatment. Reproductive failure through abortions and stillbirths in early and late pregnancy and neonatal losses within the first few weeks is significant and common among non -human primates. The number of fetal losses / stillbirths and neonatal / infant deaths in this study are consistent with historical data in cynomolgus monkeys of 17.8% and 21.9%, human exposure based on AUC) . Other Studies - Safety Pharmacology Stand -alone safety pharmacology studies were not undertaken with Benlysta . Instead, safety pharmacology end points were assessed as part of the 4 week and 6 month repeat dose studies. No Benlysta -related adverse effects were noted on cardiovascular or renal end points at do ses up to 50 mg/kg. Although no formal assessments of effects on central nervous or respiratory systems were undertaken, no treatment -related changes in these parameters were noted in the repeat dose toxicology studies at doses up to 50 mg/kg, and no neuro behavioral changes were noted in infant monkeys in a reproductive toxicology study at doses up to 150 mg/kg.

NOAEL is 25 mg/kg. Other Studies - Immunogenicity Week Subcutaneous Injection Immunogenicity and Toxicokinetic Study with in Cynomolgus Doses: (vehicle control); 1 mg/kg twice per four week Route: SC 5/sex/group SC injections of BENLYSTA for 13 weeks followed by a 9 week recovery period SC injection of Benlysta for 13 weeks followed by a 9 week recovery period was well tolerated. There were no Benlysta -related effects on clinical signs, body weight or food consumpt ion. BENLYSTA significantly reduced the number of peripheral blood B cells (CD20+) in both dose groups (expected pharmacological effect). NOAEL is 1 mg/kg.
