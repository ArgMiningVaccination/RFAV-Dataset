Animals store food and create cozy hibernation spaces. Temperatures cool, and we spend more time indoors. Green trees yield to majestic colors of flame, reminding us that change is the only constant in life. Then, those brilliant leaves let go of their branches, giving us the courage to let go of what is not needed for our own preservation. And, in these most interesting of times, that seems to be a very thoughtful question: what is needed for our own preservatio n? As we go through life, we embark on healing journeys, and we often encounter the concept that \"things may get worse before they get better.\" This is the idea that our being has accumulated various wastes and toxins as we have been busy \"living lif e,\" even though the storage of them may not be conscious or visible. At some point, we decide that old ways must change, and we move off the old trail onto a new one. This new trail may include new ways of thinking, affirmations, avoiding certain foods , exercising, eating different foods, adding supplements into our daily regimen, all with the goal of returning to an even grea ter state of health than we had previously experienced. In this process, we cleanse and shed those old accumulations, whether it be by physical means, such as skin rashes or changes in bowel habits, or by mental and emotional means, such as crying or letting go of people and things. Probably, most of you are aware and feeling it: that our world is about ready to branch off the main trail and follow a new one. The world, itself, is building up to have a great healing challenge. So, again, the idea: \"it may get worse before it gets better.\" As we all prepare for the new direction toward which our world is heading, and pray that the trail it is taking is one of tru th and freedom, maybe it would be wise to consider what is necessary for our self -preservation and the preservation of humanity. The following pages are full of information to help in your preparation, and certainly, the conferences we will be holding on Oct ober 1 and 2 are designed precisely for this intention. And, if it appears that the world's path does not have healing as its destination, let's not forget that Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote: \"Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.\" May we all have the courage for th is transformation. Bountiful blessings, Amy Jo Howard , ND Director of Education Herbs Etc Now Carries Wearable Bio Photon Patches Boost Immunity Increasing Stem Cells Balance Hormones Incredible Energy Relieve Pain 2Blood clots have been on the forefront of conversation this year especially as a side -effect to the experimental COVID injections. Blood clots are gel -like clumps that form in the blood and are very useful to stop bleeding when a person is injured. However, clots that form in the veins and arteries and are not able to dissolve on their own can cause life -threatening conditions such as heart attack, stroke and other serious medical ailments. According to Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, known as the most knowledgeable physician on the adverse effects of vaccines, clots have formed following the COVID injection in the extremities and the veins responsible for draining blood from the brain (Tenpenny, 2021) https:// rense.com/general96/20 -mechanisms -of-injury.php It is critical that we expand our knowledge on blood clot prevention and share the following tips with family and friends. Many of you know that I love to promote and share the benefits of \"Eating Right for Your Blood Type.\" The founding principle of the Blood Type Diet is that all foods have a chemical reaction with your blood that produces a positive or negative outcome. Foods contain a naturally - occurring protein called lectins that can act as agglutinate in our blood. In other words, when certain blood types ingest particular foods high in lectins, the negative outcome is that it makes the blood \"sticky\" or clump together like glue. The easiest way to focus on blood clot prevention and circumvent \"sticky\" blood is to modify your diet based on your blood type. Below is an easy to follow chart listing four foods for each blood type that are high in lectins and best avoided for preventing blood clots: Common Foods to Avoid for Each Blood Type That Contain Harmful Lectins Another food that assists in healthy blood flow is garlic. Garlic is considered an herb and is excellent for promoting circulation and thinning the blood. In order to receive medicinal benefits from garlic, it must be used fresh and not over -cooked. I recommend cooking with garlic but also using the supplement as well. At Herbs Etc we carry two high quality and affordable options; regular Garlic capsules and High -Potency Garlic capsules. Cayenne pepper is also a natural blood thinner and can help prevent blood clots. Cayenne, like garlic, can be used when cooking but those seeking an herbal blood thinner can find Capsicum on the shelf at Herbs Etc. Blood Type O does best on capsicum and if circulation is a major concern, using the supplement, Capsicum & Garlic with Parsley is ideal! Two more foods to consider for blood clot prevention are turmeric and beets. Turmeric can easily be added to soups and stir- fry's and is found at most major grocery stores. The active constituent in turmeric for preventing blood clots is Curcumin. I recommend Turmeric Curcumin in capsule form from Herbs Etc beecause of the potency and the quality. We also carry a liquid form by Herb Pharm as well. As far as beets, it is best to eat them or juice them but I know not everyone likes them. The easiest way to work with beets is to roast several in the oven and eat them throughout the week on salads. You can also purchase Red Beet Root at Herbs Etc in capsule form or in our popular Rejuvenaid powered form. For those that already have blood clots, I recommend two things to help break them up. The first is a powerful enzyme at Herbs Etc called Protease Plus. Protease Plus or High Potency Protease is a digestive enzyme that can break up clots in the blood. It is best taken on an empty stomach between meals to have the most potent effect. The second is an anti -clotting agent used in Asia for centuries called Nattokinase. Nattokinase is a blood -clot dissolving protease protein produced from fermented soybeans. At Herbs Etc, we carry it in a supplement called Nattozimes Plus that also contains heart -supporting herbs such as hawthorn berries and capsicum. 3 Type O Type A Type B Type AB Wheat Soybean oil Peanut Dairy Potatoes Tomato Beef Most Dairy Chicken Corn Soybean Peanut Chicken Corn Banana Soybean Blood Clot Prevention By Charis Calender -Suemnick, Natural Health Therapist 34 Dr. Culley -Healy's best advice to students Highlights from Dr. David Brownstein At this summer's Natural Health Independence Freedom Festival (NHIFF), we were privileged to have Dr. David Brownstein speak. Dr. Brownstein is the Medical Director of the Center for Holistic Medicine in West Bloomfield, Michigan. He lectures internationally, is the author of numerous books, and is a huge proponent for natural and nutritional therapies for health. When the coronavirus pandemic shut down many practices, Dr. Brownstein kept his Center open and continued to serve his patients, even when that meant meeting them in the parking lot and treating them in their cars. Here are some of his top recommendations for supporting the immune system and countering viruses: Vitamin A - It improves cellular communication, cell growth differentiation, stabilizes immune function, and supports the reproductive system, heart, lungs, and vision. Vitamin C - This vitamin helps fight viruses, supports the epithelial barriers, is antimicrobial, enhances the differentiation of B and T cells, and helps rid the body of old, injured tissues. Vitamin D3 - Also having antimicrobial properties, Vitamin D3 reduces inflammatory responses, inhibits inflammatory cytokines, promotes calcium absorption in the gut, and helps with glucose metabolism. Dr. Brownstein said that Covid infections were 64% more common in people with Vitamin D deficiencies. Iodine - Every cell in the body requires iodine for proper function, especially those in the glandular tissues. Iodine is anti - inflammatory, improves phagocytosis (how the immune system gets rid of unwanted materials), and works against microbes, viruses, and other toxins. Dr. Brownstein also uses intravenous Vitamin C, hydrogen peroxide, and ozone therapies in his practice. Stop in to Herbs Etc for his books or to stock up on the highlighted supplement I have been seeing a trend over the last few months. A trend of more and more issues with clients' guts. Why is this happening? Is it because we have been under a tremendous amount of stress? Lockdowns, mask mandates, businesses closing, unemployment, and sickness. All of those things have created a fear and uncertainty we have never had to deal with. Stress really takes a toll on the body, it puts our body into a \"fight or flight\" state. This fight or flight state activates our sympathetic nervous system, which means our body is ready to fight or run away from something perceived as a threat to survival. It increases heart rate, speeds up breathing and diverts blood to the skeletal muscles and brain. Adrenaline is released, which stimulates the body's store of glucose and fat. Our body's are designed to have this part of our nervous system activated for short periods of time. In the world we live in today, some people have been locked in this state for months at a time, which means your body is not in a \"rest and digest '' state. The rest and digest state is the job of the parasympathetic nervous system. Our bodies can not digest the food we eat if we are locked into a fight or flight state. Then if you add in poor food choices, po or sleeping habits, dehydration, and no exercising it is no wonder digestive issues are common occurrences. Your digestive system has four activities: ingestion, digestion, absorption, and elimination. Which means eating food, breaking it down, taking nutrients into the bloodstream, and getting rid of what our body does not want. The digestive system breaks down food into substances the body can use for energy, growth and repair: proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. Your guts can heal and you do not have to suffer. I recommend scheduling an appointment with one of the Natural Health professionals here at Herbs Etc. We can work with you to develop a program that includes the right foods for your personal chemistry, vitamins, minerals, herbs and therapies to improve your physical, mental and emotional health. Most folks can tell a difference in the first 30 days! What's up with your gut? By Carla Anderson, NT 45 Detoxification Baths Bathing or soaking in water is a wonderful way to detoxify the body of chemicals, heavy metals, and other unwanted toxins. The basic idea is to use the body's largest channel of elimination (the skin!) to get rid of waste material. To amplify the effects of your detox bath, do some dry skin brushing prior to bathing. Using a \"dry skin brush,\" brush the entire body, except the face, in a circular motion toward the heart. Start with the feet, then the legs, and work your way up. Brushing can be done very lightly; this is easier on the skin, and it opens the lymphatic system to dump its waste material. To brush the entire body, it only takes 3 -5 minutes. With the dead skin cells removed, the skin pores open, and the lymphatic system is ready to dump, so then, you can carefully get in the bathtub and soak up to your chin. Fill the bathtub with fairly warm water (preferably non - chlorinated). Add your detoxification ingredients. Remain in the bath for at least 25 minutes and no longer than 45 minutes. In the bath, you may be feeling good, yet upon getting out, you may experience some dizziness. Be careful getting out of the tub. If possible, shower off the bath water to assist in the removal of toxins the bath water has brought out. Dry yourself down from head to toe to re -establish proper skin flow. Put on comfortable, non -synthetic clothing, and if possible, go to bed. Baths can be done daily if needed. In cases of chemical removal, you may have to do several baths before the chemicals begin to release. Some people have reported changes in the color of the bath water. Results will vary from person to person; however, by the third bath soak, you will be releasing toxins even if you cannot smell them or see them. Bath and Foot Soak Recipes Choose whichever bath sounds most appropriate to you, or alternate between them throughout the length of your program. Any of these baths can also be done as foot soaks (in case you need a bath break, are traveling, or don't have a tub). However, to maximize your detoxifying capabilities, the baths have been found to be more effective than the foot soaks.

AAddddiittiioonnaall TTooppiiccss CCoovveerreedd:: Essential Oils for Viruses Breath Work & Tapping for Stress Homeopathics for the Pandemic Herbs and Minerals for Immunity Home Remedies for Emergencies 78 Our Changing World By Bessheen Baker, ND Last year while on a shopping trip to Meijer, a retired, well - dressed woman, whom I did not know, stopped me to point out two young mothers who were essentially loading up on spaghetti noodles and sauce. She said, \"Look they're hoarders; I just saw them at Walmart doing the same thing!\" I did not respond; how could I judge two mothers putting up food for their family? We've all seen the supplies dwindle at numerous stores. And, it's not always about food. Tractor parts, equipment, general supplies, our seasons of the almighty, abundant, plenty have come to a sudden halt. It's hard to get enough workers all around the globe, plus stringent policies have slowed everything. Many companies will not make it back to full operation or have already closed for good! Many cultures and religions around the world teach to have a year's supply of food on hand for your family! The reasoning is because at any time, you could have a job loss, sickness, or injury and then, you would have one less burden for your family to endure. You now also need to consider extreme weather, financial collapse, and \"brown outs\" when the supply chain is deeply interrupted due to the above reasons. While many of you may already be thinking about laying in some extra supplies, how long could you live on your current groceries? Most Americans, at best, have a two week supply; some are preparing for a three month need. To help you with the math, consider this: An adult can get by on 1500 calories per day but would do far better on 2000. Each person in the household will need, between hydration and minor hygiene, one gallon of water per day. When people talk about stocking up, the company FB has literally asked for the people's friends to report them! Now, what in the 'Sam Who Heckers' is that all about?! Tell you what, TO EACH HIS OWN, you do what makes sense for you, and leave others out of it, and probably, the best advice is to not share with others what you are up to. Creating a small family or neighborhood group to be able to check on and support each other is the best idea. Most canned goods and boxed food can be good for 1 to 2 years, home canning can last a bit longer, maybe up to 5 years, freezers are great as long a you have power or a back up generator with 50 plus gallons of gas! Many are going to freeze dried foods, because it actually stays good for 25 years and is far more tasty than dehydrated food items. There are many sources for freeze dried meals: one is called 4Patriots, another one worth mentioning and more like a grocery style of shopping is Thrive Life. Water is best stored in barrels with two to four drops of food grade hydrogen peroxide. Remember to have a pump mechanism for getting the water out and not needing to handle 5 to 50 gallon barrels on your own. If you had to clean water of microorganisms, you would want to boil it for no less than 10 minutes, 15 would be great. Or, you could add 1 drop of Clove or Cinnamon oil to one gallon of water for one hour, and it will kill everything in the water! That doesn't mean there won't be particles but nothing living if you can wait the one hour. It's okay to put away some \"emotional food,\" but keep in mind, you are better off with 4 solid meals than a stash of chocolates and chips. Eating for your blood type and/or metabolic type, because you will feel better and be more healthy during the time you are relying on your supplies. 89 Herbs Etc carries the small to community size Berkey Water Purifiers.

What History Can Teach Us By Amy Jo Howard, ND, CH As we have dealt with the coronavirus pandemic for nearly two years now, it is interesting to look back at the Spanish Influenza pandemic of 1918 -1919 and see what we can learn. The Spanish Influenza had an incredibly short incubation period and would debilitate people within a matter of hours. It circled the globe in less than six months in a time before international air travel. Over 50 million people perished. One striking symptom of that influenza was sudden nosebleeds and hemorrhaging with people losing as much as a pint of blood at a time from their nosebleeds. And, what was one of the most common medical treatments given for influenza at that time? Aspirin. Yes, aspirin was widely prescribed in an attempt to manage fevers, and it took the allopathic doctors 45 more years to realize how disastrous it can be to use aspirin in the treatment of viral diseases. However, the homeopaths understood how medications suppress symptoms and create dangerous side effects. They stayed true to their homeopathic principles, and they have a vastly different account for how their patients fared through the influenza pandemic. Here are some accounts from homeopathic doctors which originally appeared in the American Institute of Homeopathy in 1920: Dr. T.A. McCann, from Dayton, Ohio, reported that 24,000 cases of flu were treated allopathically which had a mortality rate of 28.2%, while 26,000 cases of flu treated homeopathically had a mortality rate of only 1.05%. Dr. Frank Wieland, from Chicago, Illinois, reported only one death in a plant of 8,000 workers. He said: Gelsemium was practically the only remedy used. We used no Aspirin and no vaccines. Dr. Cora Smith King, from Washington, D.C., said out of 350 cases, I lost one, a neglected pneumonia that came to me after she had taken one hundred grains of Aspirin in twenty -four hours. Dr. Murphy of Lansing, Michigan, treated 325 cases of influenza in a camp where the mortality had been 20%, while the mortality under his homeopathic treatment was less than 3%. Dr. G.H. Wright, from Glen, Maryland, said: I attended over one hundred cases without any fatalities. I never deviated from the homeopathic remedy. I never gave Aspirin. This epidemic should encourage us to renewed faith in Homeopathy. So, let us be prepared. Here are some remedies that are common in most Homeopathic Kits or important remedies with which to start if you are building your own kit. Of course, one remedy covers a myriad of different health concerns; presented here are brief keynotes pertaining to symptoms of influenza and other viruses. Aconite - Symptoms develop suddenly, especially after exposure to cold winds; most helpful if taken within first 24 hours of symptoms; short, dry cough; intense thirst; high fever; restlessness; extreme anxiety and fear. Antimonium tart - Rattling cough; rattling respiration, unable to expectorate mucus; great drowsiness and sleepiness; worse from lying down, warmth, and being overheated. 1213 Arsenicum album - Rapid loss of energy; secretions and excretions burn and cause redness; constriction and tightness of chest; dry, wheezing cough; body is cold but head feels hot; can have vomiting and diarrhea; restless and anxious. Belladonna - Sudden and violent onset; throbbing headache; red face and dilated pupils; high fever; hypersensitive to noise and lights; burning, dryness, and constriction of throat; may experience delirium or hallucinations. Bryonia - over; from movement; extreme irritability; wants to be left alone; thirsty for large quantities of cold drinks. Gelsemium - Muscle weakness and trembling; intense weariness; severe headache often with visual disturbance or vertigo; chills up and down the spine; droopy appearance; lack of thirst; apathetic; worse from emotions like dread or surprise. Lachesis - Tickling, irritating cough; feeling of constriction in throat and chest; exhaustion; easy bleeding and hemorrhaging; throbbing headache; worse during and after sleep; sensitive to all stimuli, especially touch and noise; nervous; excitable. Nux vomica - Bursting headache; scraping feeling in throat; very chilly; runny nose during the day and stuffy nose at night; oppressed breathing; dry cough; can have constipation, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; irritable, cranky, and fault finding. Phosphorus - Sudden onset of symptoms; dry, short, hacking cough; laryngitis; tightness in chest; nosebleeds; may look well even when very sick; nervous; needs sympathy and reassurance. Rhus tox - Stiff and achy; cannot bear to be in one position for very long; dry mouth; dry, burning throat; dry, tickling cough; headache in back of head; extreme physical restlessness; feels better from movement and warmth; anxious and depressed. Remember what Dr. Wright said: This epidemic should encourage us to renewed faith in Homeopathy. The lesson from history is that our bodies are designed for healing, and if we support them naturally, we can maintain our health and when necessary, regain our health even in the most trying of times.

In naturopathy, we believe that getting sick is not about the germ we are exposed to, but whether the body is a good \"host.\" An important step in making sure your body is an uncomfortable place for viruses to overpopulate is supporting the immune system. I'm sure you have heard of Vitamin C, Zinc, Elderberry, and Vitamin D3, all wonderful herbs, vitamins, and minerals for doing just that. However, there is a not so new kid on the block: mushrooms. These fascinating little fungi, as a whole, work to regenerate and coat the nerve endings, nourish the nervous system, and stimulate brain function improving memory, focus, and clarity of thought. As fungi, they also contain tons of little friendly bacteria that work to fight off the bad, which is one of the most important parts of a well functioning immune system. Mushrooms are also adaptogens, meaning they have the ability to work wherever and however they are needed in the body. They have the ability to reduce stress, which can reduce cellular damage and many of the other effects stress has on the body. Some of the most common varieties of mushrooms include Lion's Mane, Reishi, Cordyceps and Chaga. Lion's Mane - is said to protect against cancer, stimulate digestion, strengthen the immune system, reduce inflammation, and improve cognitive function. Reishi - stimulates the immune system by improving the function of white blood cells, reducing stress, improving the quality of sleep and alleviating fatigue. Reishi mushrooms also have the ability to improve one's overall vitality and life force energy. Cordyceps - are known to be a natural energy booster. They are also helpful in treating coughs and respiratory disorders. Cordyceps stimulate immune cells and work to improve kidney function and liver health. Chaga - can slow the aging process in the body, lower cholesterol, lower blood pressure, lower blood sugar, support the immune system, and fight inflammation.
