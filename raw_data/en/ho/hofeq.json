Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton gynecologist Dinah Gonzalez-Braile, MD, recently completed a fellowship in integrative medicine, which addresses patients' lifestyle choices and seeks to uncover the root cause of symptoms. Now board-certified in both obstetrics and gynecology and integrative medicine, Dr. Gonzalez-Braile incorporates this approach into her practice to benefit patients. Here, she explains how integrative medicine is used to treat gynecologic conditions. What is integrative gynecology? With integrative medicine, we combine traditional treatments with holistic approaches, such as exercise, supplements, nutrition, chiropractic and acupuncture. To provide such comprehensive care, we spend more time counseling patients about treatment. How are gynecologic conditions treated with this approach? Women in perimenopause\u2014the transition to menopause\u2014often gain weight. We recommend a multipronged approach to this problem. We encourage participating in aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, running or cycling. We also promote a Mediterranean-style diet, which emphasizes plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and nuts, and healthy fats like olive oil instead of butter. Many times, I'll order thyroid testing because an underactive thyroid often shows up in the years surrounding menopause and can affect weight. I also screen patients for vitamin D deficiency, which is common and can affect overall well-being. Another example is pelvic pain. When I perform an ultrasound and examine a patient, she may appear normal. But sometimes there's birth trauma, which can take years to show up. We see a lot of success when we recommend pelvic floor physical therapy for these patients. Physical therapy involves internal and external massage and other techniques. How does integrative gynecology benefit patients? We empower patients to take charge of their health. For example, I prescribe probiotics to help restore the natural vaginal flora after a patient is treated with antibiotics for an infection. When she uses this treatment, she feels she's doing something positive for her health. What kind of feedback about integrative gynecology have you received from patients so far? Patients know I spend extra time with them. They say, \"Thanks for listening to me.\" At the end of the day, I offer patients additional treatment options, and they are happier and healthier as a result. For me, that's what counts.
