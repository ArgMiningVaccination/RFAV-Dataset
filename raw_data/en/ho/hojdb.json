What People Say: \"When I first decided to explore Reiki Sound Healing sessions with La Reina, I went with the hope of it being simply a relaxing way to meditate. As a musician, I've been curious about the positive effect vibration can have on the body and spirit, too. It was every bit as relaxing as I'd hoped, but I wasn't prepared for how deeply cathartic the experience would be. Like everyone else, I was just starting to come back into social interactions following these years of isolation, which included the loss of family and close relationships. Hearing the sound of the bowls mixed with La Reina's intuitive affirmations had a profound effect on me that has kept me coming for the past 8 months. It's helped me process grief in a way that other types of therapy have not. I highly recommend La Reina's Reiki Sound Healing to anyone struggling with anxiety or simply wanting to receive support in a calm, meditative way. \" -Drew P.
