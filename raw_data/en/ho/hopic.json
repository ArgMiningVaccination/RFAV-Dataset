GUIDE SPA THE SPA GUIDE It is no longer news that the world of spas and health holidays is blossoming, if not fully fledged. The word 'wellbeing' has become an integral part of our everyday language, accessible to all, achieved through a well-accepted code of living: sleep more, stress less, eat green, disconnect to reconnect, meditate to levitate. Yet sometimes I, for one, feel we are being bombarded from all sides by this notion of perfected living and I often wonder if I can keep up with all the rules. Frequently I berate myself for my 'bad' behaviour, only to remember I am also meant to be thinking positively. Many of us are also juggling careers with the needs of our children. Mine recently gave me a card depicting everything I love on it - the cinema, sunshine, chocolate (100 per cent dark, obviously), our dog, and then there it was - my laptop - because apparently I am 'always' on it. I almost started to feel guilty. Almost. Because, if it weren't for my computer my children might not wake up to a view of rolling green hills every day. They might never picnic by a stream in the summer or know the everyday magic of the changing seasons. We all have our codes. I want my children to know that they don't have to be chained to an office desk for life. And that hard work can help not to just put food on the table, but to achieve a satisfied life, mind and heart. For me, health is more and more about fulfilment. Unlike our Instagram accounts, this is not something that can be filtered, though there are definitely times when we might need help remembering how to live the best possible lives we can, for us, in this present moment. This guide is a barometer to the most inspiring spas in the world right now. Each has been tried and tested, and all of them are indeed dedicated to your personal wellbeing. Our advice? Dip in, travel, seek revelation, return refreshed. Take with you only the pieces of guidance that work for you. Don't aim for 100 per cent obedience. Aim to be you, in your brilliance, and to have fun in the process. Because we only do this once. And it is definitely meant to be an enjoyable journey. So take good, very good, care of your self.

This time, though it's to address his mental, not physical wellbeing Arriving at the Ananda Spa in the Himalayas is not a new experience for me. I have visited twice before. The trouble is, the moment I leave, I just want to go back. This time it was a nine year wait. Too long. The Ananda regularly features on the 'best spa in the world' lists. It is in a beautiful location - in the foothills of the Himalayas overlooking the Ganges river valley - and its spa is matchless, with 25 rooms spread across thousands of square footage. But that is not why I love the Ananda. I love it because it is sincere, a quality hard to articulate in writing. You just have to go there. The spa is slick and professional. The staff are utterly charming, not simply trained to charm. You change into white linen pyjamas the moment you arrive, and get a fresh pair every evening. Their signature massage is a joy to experience. I could talk at length about the physical treatments, but I wanted to find out if the Ananda was as good for my mental health. Because it struck me that the whole wellness industry seems to avoid mental health issues - sticking to the respectively more tangible and more ephemeral issues of the physical and the spiritual. But as a lifelong suffer of depression and recently diagnosed with ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder), I wanted to see if a spa could do anything for my mind. The spa seemed a little bemused when I asked them to put together a schedule to address my issues. Really, the truth is there was nothing in particular that spoke to the mind specifically, except the general idea of relaxation, adjusting chakras and energies and alterations to the diet. On arrival, you have a consultation with a doctor who categorises you as pita, kapha or vata, and thereafter your treatments and diets are based around that, your body type. But there is little for psychological matters. The best mind food I could find was the twice-daily Vedanta lessons. This is a unique feature I have not come across before - philosophy lessons to help you achieve peace of mind. Vedanta is a philosophy that goes back thousands of years, but the teachers here are from the modern Vedanta Academy in Delhi where there is a 90-year-old guru, Swami Parathawarsy, in charge. By contrast, the teacher at the spa looked about 19, but he was charming, funny and very sweet. The Indians have a genius for philosophy and storytelling and he was expert at both. I attended lectures about marriage, choice, self-control, ego and more besides. The scheme of Vedanta itself seems largely about personal mental discipline, and making sure your intellect is in charge of your passions. Nothing new here, really. I listened in particular to his advice about marriage, having recently got divorced - the other person is always right apparently. If only that had occurred to me at the time. To tell the truth the most peace of mind I could have had was with some good sleep. But for some reason, I suffered from insomnia. I have no idea why. I even changed the pillows (they have that ultimate symbol of decadence, the pillow menu). It was a bit stuffy and I couldn't open the window because of the monkeys coming in and - well, my imagination stops there. I don't know what monkeys do to people in the night. Apart from this, everything was pretty much perfect. I hardly spoke to anyone all week, which was fine by me. The food was superb. By the end though, I was getting stressed by the amount of relaxation I was required to do. And some of the treatments were vaguely irritating - having oil poured onto your head for 30 minutes as in shirodhara, reminded me too much of getting stuck under my Hillman Imp in the 1970s with a leaking sump. But the thing is, you do get peace of mind - and even elevation of mind. This isn't only through meditation and so on, but also - the highlight for me - the visit to Rishikesh for Aarti where they hold a sunset ceremony on the Ganges with children from the local ashram. This was not merely novel and colourful, but deeply moving. At the end of my stay, I was still feeling a little rough - the lack of sleep had got to me - but I had had wonderful time. Did it help my depression? Well - I'm not depressed. As for the ADD, it's... where was I? Oh yes, as for the ADD, it's still there. I think. But there is a limit to what even the best spa in the world can achieve. And the Ananda may be exactly that.BOOK IT: Seven-night wellness programmes from around \u00a33,150, based on two sharing, full board. anandaspa.com Think spas are mostly for the female of the species? Think again. We despatched three men to India, Austria and Switzerland for some 'me-time'. This is how they got on...A MAN'S EYE VIEW THE SPA GUIDE May 2018 | COUNTRYANDTOWNHOUSE.CO.UK | 119 PACKING ESSENTIALS VIVAMAYR Maria W \u00f4rth, Austria Henry Conway gives his liver a break Toxicity could be my middle name. Over the past decade and a bit, I have habitually gone to bed at 4am more nights than most and never held back when it comes to a dry Martini or three. So seven days at VivaMayr, where I would be denied all my favourite things, would be anathema to me but no one can accuse me of not being game. The advantage of the Mayr is that it's like a private hospital - various appointments with a doctor, six blood tests later, and you really do get a full body 360. Even for the most pampering-averse, you get a proper look over. It's a hypercondriac's dream. My test results were pleasantly surprising - I seem to have a 'superliver', hence my rare hangovers despite a level of bacchanalian abuse that would m ake Caligula blush. It turns out I also have hig her than average testosterone - my feather boas are just a ruse... Mornings start with a 'Kneipp' - basically stepping from steaming hot buckets of water to icy cold ones (cue small shrieks), all in the name of circulation. Then the gut work starts. The Mayr method is based on a 'healthy gut, healthy body' theory, so each day also starts with a pre-breakfast Epsom salts drink, which makes you appreciate each room's bidet. NEVER do this with a lover. Your meal plan is prescribed by your doctor - balancing protein and carbs, and even though diet food (properly tiny portions), it is delish. You have to chew everything 40 times, and dress properly for dinner. Oddly though I never felt hungry and nor did I particularly miss alcohol. I did miss caffeine dreadfully - the sleepless headachy third d ay was all caffeine withdrawal. The rest of your day is punctuated by massages, liver compresses and voluntary exercise. I did Nordic Walking, basically bouncing over the mountains with sticks. If you are a regular gym-goer, the exercise classes are very gentle; but with your calorie restrictions, that's for the best. I came back feeling revived and everyone told me I looked fresher - though most of my friends thought I had been forced into rehab rather than the gentler Mayr. I didn't manage to keep up the regime quite as the doctors would have liked - we touched down at Heathrow at 2pm, and by 6.30pm I had a glass of cold Veuve Clicquot in hand. A leopard may not change his spots, but a good detox did kick start a healthier new me, and I now want to go back once a year for an MOT.

Despite its unparalleled luxury and glamour - or perhaps because of it - St Moritz is a deathtrap for the aristos and playboys who throw themselves down its historic slopes and tracks. Unless you're racing horses on a frozen lake at 'White Turf', notching up head-first speeds of 80mph on the Cresta Run, or skiing by moonlight on the Kulm Hotel's private mountain, you might as well go home. But for those willing to risk life and limb, a reward awaits them at the Kulm Spa. Because the key, in my experience, to relishing an afternoon of wellness, as a male of the species, is to feel like you've earned it. The jackpot, that is. A proper pool, for starters; Jacuzzis and a spectacular open-air whirlpool, too, but it's the magnificent 20m centrepiece that announces the Kulm's leading edge. After a serious swim, there's a reassuringly gadgety, even macho maze of corners to explore - an infrared cabin and a saltwater grotto, Kneipp footpaths and gender-segregated saunas - before your massage. My 'AktiVital' treatment zapped both overwork- and snowsport-induced tension with startling precision, in an atmosphere of heated pine, Alpine herbs and total competence. Adrenaline pumped, then diffused, with my masculinity totally in tact. Perfect.

Emotional issues, science increasingly shows, likely stem from our bellies rather than our brain. When our microbiome, latest health buzz word and formal term for the 2-4kg 'pool' of microbes that populate our intestinal tract, is out of balance, so is our state of mind. We've long known that our brains affect our guts - the queasy butterfl y tummy before a date - but perhaps our guts have more control on how we feel. The fl ow of information via neurotransmitters in the intestinal ecosystem that travels up the vagus nerve - our gut-brain axis - can directly infl uence brain activity. 'Messages sent in this process fl ow in both directions, but the majority seem to go north from the gut,' explains Professor Bobby Prasad, a consultant gastroenterologist at London's Lister Hospital. 'Changes in the microbe levels might play a role in conditions such as depression, anxiety and even autism-spectrum disorders.' These changes come from a blossoming of bad bacteria over friendly fl ora that kick off a chain of problems: constipation, bloating and IBS, unexplained weight gain, the tell-tale sign of sugar cravings, even symptoms of arthritis and, more profound, a breakdown of emotional boundaries and self-esteem. When the microbiome is low so are levels of serotonin. 'We should think of our gut like a rose garden,' says nutritionist Hannah Richards (hannahrichardswellness.spac e). 'If we don't tend to it, the weeds will grow.' So she suggests an annual gut MOT starting with a stool test to check the weed levels and types. Her personalised programme for clients includes a supplement regime, a shift in what you eat, how you eat (ideally chewing 30 times per mouthful) and even how you prepare to eat: with regular mealtimes, lovingly prepared. 'Bodies get very confused and constipated when they don't know when the next meal is coming,' she says. There's also a case for not eating, for a while at least, because when we give our digestive systems a rest, the body can divert energy into cellular repair. Dr Nyjon Eccles, of the Natural Doctor in Harley Street, agrees that calorie restriction activates AMPK (adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase), an enzyme that's shown to stimulate a healthier more youthful metabolism, but one that naturally slows down after the age of 30. He says that the link between metabolic pathways and the anti-ageing effect is an intriguing area of study, proving that eating less can lead to living longer. 'Also a diet rich in polyphenols, compounds found in a broad range of plant foods, particularly red berries and green tea which encourage growth of healthy bacteria in the bowel,' he says. But it's not all about food. Experts agree that stress of all kinds also affects gut health, even walking, working and being on phone while eating activates our parasympathetic nervous system and so our ability to digest. Mindful practices - yoga, meditation and walking all help, so does a planting a garden, a direct way to encourage more friendly microbes through the mud on our hands! 'In my experience, ten times out of ten, people with gut issues have an underlying emotional issue,' says Hannah. Be good to your gut and it will be good to you.

QuercusGOOD GUT TIPS 1 Start each meal with a slug of cloudy apple cider vinegar or bitter vegetables - cress, dandelion, chicory or radicchio -to stimulate digestive enzymes. 2 Chew, chew, chew - the more work the teeth do the less the digestive system has to do. 3Drink 20 minutes before a meal, not while eating, it dilutes the digestive enzymes. 4 Take raw white cabbage juice shots (juicing is best) or eat cabbage generally. It contains L-glutamine which repairs gut tissue. 5 Eat fermented foods such as yoghurt, keffi r, kimchi, kombucha, pickles and miso which contain live bacteria that help reinoculate the gut and curb carb and sugar cravings. 6 Make chicken broth. The collagen (especially in the claws), protein and gelatine heals the gut lining. 7 Get your hands dirty: nature's own bacteria on our skin is good for boosting ours. 8 Eat inulin-rich foods such as leeks, onion, garlic, Jerusalem artichoke - they are not broken down by gastric juices so act as food for benefi cial gut bacteria.Recent studies reveal just how much control your gut has over your physical and mental wellbeing, so it's worth caring for it, says Sophie BengeGUT REACTION THE SPA GUIDE Love yourself, love your gut Bodhimaya retreat at glorious Cowdray Manor Yoga and meditation help to alleviate stress which can cause gut infl ammation PHOTOS: GETTY IMAGES May 2018 | COUNTRYANDTOWNHOUSE.CO.UK DOCTOR'S ORDERSPACKING ESSENTIALS ESPACE CHENOT AT L'ALBERETA Brescia, Italy A regime from Henri Chenot, the king of Italy's detoxing, may not be what you first expect from this glorious Relais & Ch \u00e2teaux hotel close to Milan. Usually Italy means exceptional food - and there are temptations nearby. But a dedicated restaurant for those on 'the cure' and a super busy spa timetable make things easier.

Energy-giving acupuncture and Chinese cupping massages focus on rebooting your meridians, and daily hydro-jet baths and mud wraps are designed to break down fatty tissue, stimulate the lymphatic system and aid deep body cleansing. Powdered magnesium, which acts as a laxative also helps, as does the one-day liquid broth cleanse. Otherwise, three course meals satisfy all your senses (though they are tiny), and you should swim, walk, hit the gym, sleep, read, sleep some more, so as not to notice the hunger. Some guests lose up to h alf a stone in a week, and the nutritionists really help you crack not just your physical needs, but your emotional approach to food, which - let's face it - needs work in most of us. It's all about banning guilt and enjoying different flavours and textures in every meal.

Everywhere, those gorgeous mountains have been unveiled, plus a new bathhouse with a pool that has a salt content hovering at 3.5 per cent, and new cryotherapy chamber. Its practice, built organically over decades, is detoxification and de-acidification of the body through gut cleansing rituals. Like all Mayr Clincs, it offers that magical fusion of cutting-edge medicinal diagnostics and traditional holistic healing. You can come post-chemo to have infusions to strengthen the immune system; to re-start your gut health, to eat healthily and play golf, or to rest and have some pampering. It's perfect for anyone with white-coat syndrome, as it doesn't feel like a clinic - more slick hideaway.

Come to Yoga Rosa for daily two-hour morning yoga classes and meditation in the evening. Rosa is your teacher and she is passionate, authentic and works from the heart. Having recovered from a near-death accident, she now shares the tools she acquired with guests, and her feel-better magic can help shift you out of a rut. Her yoga is accessible to all, and while the hour's meditation may be challenging to begin with, the pace and methods used are varied enough that you'll cope better than you might think. This is yoga as a philosophy, not a sport - and Rosa's intention is to balance intellect with instinct. Meals are decadent and nourishing - taken as a group - and consist of a hearty brunch (eggs, porridges, the best tomatoes and avocado), followed by an early evening supper overlooking the setting sun. The chef carefully calibrates everything, and you barely realise you've gone vegan. Some days are allocated for silence and digital detoxing. Relish the me-time and rediscover your inner world. Meanwhile there are beaches and markets to explore (if you hire a car), or you can hunker down on the estate with its two pools, pigs and chickens. The sunshine is healing in itself. A real find.

Dip into the complimentary daily programme of classes and you might find yourself practising early morning zen meditation or full moon yoga. Or book in for a treatment in one of the wooden cabins with a cenote-facing balcony. The Mayan herbal compress massage, where herbs grown onsite are combined with organic oils to ease muscle tension, leaves you floating. Tucked away in the forest is the temazcal FOUR SEASONS BALI AT SAYAN , Indonesia The journey begins as soon as you arrive at the resort - over the lush valley via an Indiana Jones-style wooden sky-bridge and into a reception area like a sleek modern spaceship landed in the jungle. The spa itself nestles near the sacred Ayung River, lost in the rice paddies and verdant grounds dotted with soaring palms and fragrant frangipani. While it offers all the holistic beauty treatments you'd expect, it is in its bid to pamper the inner - as well as the outer - that it shines. The clue to this is in the bright eyes of the therapists. Conceived as a journey inward, or 'sweat lodge' for anyone wanting a deeper, more soul-searching experience. It's not for the faint hearted (literally - as volcanic rocks are heated to up to 1,000 \u00b0C) or those who are claustrophobic (you sit in the igloo-shaped lodge in the dark), but it can be incredibly emotionally cleansing as chanting and gentle questioning by a shaman help you recall some of your earliest feelings.

Boy does it feel good. You haven't felt this clear-headed, determined and svelte for months. If only it could last for the rest of your life. And so, as you set off back down the mountain, you vow to keep up the good work of the last few days. The reality, of course, is that depending on the path you take, you may find yourself back to square one in anything from a week to about a month. The chances are that hard-won feelgood factor is likely to ebb almost without you realising, until you reach a point where it feels like it's time to set off back to a spa to regain it. For the seasoned detoxer, this cycle is not dissimilar to yo-yo dieting, when in truth what we should all be aiming for is a little less perfection and a few better habits. We may not be able to live our lives at the high octane bliss we experience at the end of a spa break, but if we can find a realistic path where the majority of our habits are good ones, we are doing well. So instead of setting yourself an impossible range of targets, I would keep just five considerations in mind. SMALL CHANGE BIG DIFFERENCE This may sound like a clich\u00e9, but rarely is it more apt than when applied to our diet. For most people, weight gain has less to do with eating mounds of junk food and takeaways every night, than the slow but insipid creep of extra kilos that come with an additional 200-300 calories a day. If you think of the myriad ways you might incur that energy, it becomes apparent just how easy it is to trim them. If you have small children, for instance, one habit is having a nibble of whatever you happen to be feeding them. A tablespoon of Greek yoghurt with honey, a fish finger and splodge of mash, a spoonful of ice cream, a corner of buttered toast with jam, adds up in no time. And who can resist a taste (or three) of whatever they are cooking. So as you get back into the daily routine, be aware of these little habits. Once broken, we rarely miss them. WEEKLY NOT DAILY It is all too easy to beat yourself up when you first diverge from the clean habits of a detox. This can be the beginning of an unhealthy relationship with treat foods, which in reality will always be a part of our lives. So instead of judging yourself meal by meal, try to observe your diet over the period of a week. The slice of chocolate fudge cake you enjoyed at a friend's birthday will be less of a cause of guilt if you see it as seven small bites. If you happen to go out for a three-course blow-out supper, fine, just eat less over the next couple of days and it will average out. VEG FOR BREAD Bread is so often the first line of convenience for a snack, or partner to a bowl of soup. Full of salt, high in carbs and most likely refined, and that is before we get to the butter. But, there are any number of lovely veggie options that will stand in, especially with dips or a sliver of cheese, or with a splodge of nut butter or miso. As well as crudit\u00e9s, cooked spears of asparagus and fine green beans, or some roast or grilled veg will make for a luxurious stand-in. My own treat is slices of roast aubergine that make a great base for bruschettas and the like. PROTEIN SNACKS Aside from trying to limit energy intake there is no logic in limiting snacks or suggesting a dietary regime. If you are someone who prefers to eat little and often rather than three times a day, a grazer for whom large meals are unappetising, you may even be placing yourself at an advantage, by avoiding the spikes in insulin that tend to accompany large meals. So if snacking throughout the day is what works for you, there is no reason to change. The secret is to include a little protein, which will lead to a sense of feeling well-nourished. With the highest satiety index among the macronutrients, quite simply it reduces your appetite. SUGAR TRAPS Even if we think we have given up sugar, by avoiding chocolate, cake and fizzy drinks, it is the hidden or expected sources that are most likely to catch us out and drive up our energy intake. Smoothies, in particular, count as 'free sugars' or those to be limited, some contain a small basket of fruit (but without the benefits of whole fruit); cartons of juice are little better. Other sugar traps are ready-made foods, of all types. In the region of 75 per cent of off-the-shelf products have added sugar. Again, frequently where you least expect to find it, in nuts and savoury snacks, pasta sauces and salad dressing, chilled dips, yoghurts, and preserved fish. So the guideline here is tobuy as much fresh produce as possible.We've all been there, piling on the pounds after we've worked so hard to shed them, so how do you really keep the long-lasting benefits of a spa detox?

Or spend anything, really. Forest bathing is therapy for free. Trees, the dear trusty things, are increasingly proven by science to be actively beneficial to our health - and in more ways than ever suspected. So forget expensive massages and just let a tree or two do its calming, curative thing. Forest bathing was born in Japan, where Shinto reverence for the natural world is culturally ingrained. In 1982 Japanese scientists discovered that being among trees - walking in a wood, leaning against the bark, hugging a tree - measurably reduces stress and blood pressure. Three minutes' exposure, they discovered, is all it takes before levels start to fall. The research prompted the Forest Agency of Japan to launch a preventative health programme of shinrin-yoku, 'taking in the forest atmosphere' by bathing one's entire being, body, soul and psyche in the fragrance of a forest. From 2004 to 2012, a $4m Japanese research programme discovered trees emit phytoncides, airborne aromatic oils that ward off potentially damaging insects and bacteria, and that inhaling these phytoncides has a beneficial effect on human immune systems, too, boosting natural anti-cancer killer cells and improving resistance to bacteria and viruses. In response to the results Japan launched a country-wide network of Forest Therapy Trails, with equipment en route allowing walkers to measure their blood pressure, pulse and skin temperature before and after a walk, and logs are strategically placed along the trails for lying down to meditate among the trees. Today, the restorative power of forest bathing and spending time in nature is recognised around the world. Forest bathing doesn't mean going into a wood and stripping off and stretching out. Not necessarily, anyway. It's enough just to be among trees, consciously, mindfully enjoying them through every sense the sight, scent, sound and sensation of the forest, breathing deeply, stroking bark, watching the play of light, enjoying the woody fragrance and listening to birdsong. And, if walking in a wood is good for you, sleeping in a forest, with a window open to the stillness and the silence and the phytonicides, is even better. ARASHIYAMA BAMBOO FOREST, Kyoto The epicentre of forest bathing is Kyoto's otherworldly Arashiyama, above the Tenryu- Ji Temple - beautiful, but with a tarmacked lane running through it and very crowded, it's best and emptiest around dawn. Exploring the woods surrounding some of the ancient city's other 1,600 temples, however, takes you into enchanting mossy worlds where you can walk alone, drinking in the utmost beauty.
