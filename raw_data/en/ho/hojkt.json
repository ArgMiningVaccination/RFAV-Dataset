It didn't occur to me that not only can eating the wrong foods make us sick, but so can a toxic home. Do you need to detox your home? The fact is, our homes can be filled with over 500 different chemicals. Think about that! And what's worse, they get trapped inside our sealed up, insulated walls. It's estimated that indoor air is 2-5 times more polluted than outdoor air. There's even a sickness coined \"Toxic Home Syndrome\" when your home literally makes you sick. More and more serious diseases and conditions are being linked to environmental toxins, such as reproductive disorders and autoimmune diseases. The sad truth is that we can't ignore our toxic environment. We have to be proactive in detoxing our homes. Thankfully, awareness of the chemical environment in which we are surrounded is growing. The public is demanding substances that don't seep into our bloodstream and damage our health. The ideas of \"nontoxic\" and \"natural\", once on the fringe, are moving to the mainstream. Here are ways that you can detox your home. November is the Healthy Home Challenge as part of the Happy Healthy Mama Healthy Year Challenge. Check out this list and get to work! Many of these things I've already done in my home, but many more I'm going to be working on incorporating this month. Let's do this together. 27 Ways to Detox Your Home - Use natural, green cleaning products. - If you treat your lawn, seek out safe alternatives to chemical fertilizers and pesticides. More and more companies are offering organic options. - Have a \"No shoes in the house\" policy. Shoes bring in the contaminants from outside and it's best to keep them on the bottom of your shoes rather than trek them all over the floors. - Open your windows on a daily basis. Recycling the air is so important! - Get rid of artificial air fresheners. Essential oils diffused into the air are a great alternative that smell wonderful. [Eliminate as many plastics as you can](https://happyhealthymama.com/25-ways-to-use-less-plastic.html). - Avoid non-stick pans. I love my [stainless steel All-Clad pans](http://amzn.to/2edGzih)and also my [Lodge cast iron pans](http://amzn.to/2edKxrh). - Get a [water filter system](http://amzn.to/2f0Tshs)for your drinking water. - Use a [shower head water filter](http://amzn.to/2fcHZf5)that will take out the chlorine and other harmful chemicals. - Use untreated fabrics as much as possible. Stain-resistant furnitures have volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as formaldehyde. The same is true for flame-retardant clothing, such as children pajamas. Look for tight-fitting pajamas that are not flame-retardant for your children. - If you dry clean your clothes, let them air out outside for a few hours before bringing them into the house. - Change your filters for your furnace and air conditioner often, and if possible upgrade to an allergy reduction filter. - Stop using dryer sheets. [Wool dyer balls](http://amzn.to/2ensDps)are an excellent, natural alternative. - Be on the look out for mold. Beware of areas in the home that may have too much moisture in the air and seek to control it. Use a dehumidifier for any area that you aren't able to keep the relative humidity below 60%. - Add [Himalayan Salt Lamps](http://amzn.to/2fcBzwq)to as many rooms in your home as you can. - Use [organic sheets and bedding](http://amzn.to/2fvcH72), especially for babies and kids. - Use potted plants to help purify the air. - Use non-VOC paint. - Allow new products, such as stuffed furniture that may contain toxins, to off gas outside or in the garage for a few days before bringing into the house. - Use organic mattresses. If you can't (they are very expensive), cover your regular mattresses with an [organic mattress cover](http://amzn.to/2edDKxK). - Clean your surfaces with antibacterial cloths, such as [e-cloths](http://amzn.to/2f0SAcm)and water. - Dust and vacuum often, as \"dust bunnies\" are found to be magnets for chemicals. - Seek out natural pest control methods rather than harsh, chemical-based pest control products. - Turn your phone to airplane mode when you sleep, especially if it's in the same room with you. - Regularly vacuum your mattress and furniture. - Replace your pillows every five years. - Use natural [personal care products](https://happyhealthymama.com/the-oil-cleansing-method-for-clear-and-younger-skin.html).
