Every day, new U.S. technical and material assistance arrives in hospitals and labs around the world. These efforts, in turn, build on a decades-long foundation of American expertise, generosity, and planning that is unmatched in history. In the DRC, we recently announced an initial tranche of $6 million to provide health-related support and supplies and to bolster water and sanitation activities, and through the U.S.-DRC Privileged Partnership for Peace and Prosperity more American assistance is coming. The United States provides aid for altruistic reasons, because we believe it's the right thing to do. We also do it because pandemics don't respect national borders. If we can help counties contain outbreaks, we'll save lives abroad and at home in the U.S. That generosity and pragmatism explains why United States was one of the first countries to help to the Chinese people as soon as reports emerged from Wuhan of another outbreak. In early January, the United States government offered immediate technical assistance to the Chinese Centers for Disease Control. In the first week of February, the U.S. transported nearly 18 tons of medical supplies to Wuhan provided by Samaritan's Purse, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and others. We also pledged $100 million in assistance to countries to fight what would become a pandemic - including an offer to China, which was declined. Our response now far surpasses that initial pledge. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the U.S. government has committed nearly $500 million in assistance to date. This funding will improve public health education, protect healthcare facilities, and increase laboratory, disease-surveillance, and rapid-response capacity in more than 60 of the world's most at risk countries- all in an effort to help contain outbreaks before they reach our shores. America's unsurpassed contributions are also felt through the many international organizations fighting Covid-19 on the front lines. The U.S. has been the largest funder of the World Health Organization since its founding in 1948. We gave more than $400 million to the institution in 2019 - nearly double the second-largest contribution and more than the next three contributors combined. It's a similar story with the U.N. Refugee Agency, which the U.S. backed with nearly $1.7 billion in 2019. That's more than all other member states combined, and more than four times the second-largest contributor, Germany. Then there is the World Food Program, to which the U.S. gave $3.4 billion last year, or 42% of its total budget. That's nearly four times the second-largest contributor, and more than all other member states combined. We also gave more than $700 million to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), more than any other donor. We are proud that when these international organizations deliver food, medicines, and other aid all around the world, that too is largely thanks to the generosity of the American people, in partnership with donor nations. Our country continues to be the single largest health and humanitarian donor for both long-term development and capacity building efforts with partners, and emergency response efforts in the face of recurrent crises. This money has saved lives, protected people who are most vulnerable to disease, built health institutions, and promoted the stability of communities and nations. America funds nearly 40% of the world's global health assistance programs, adding up to $140 billion in investments in the past 20 years - five times more than the next largest donor. Since 2009, American taxpayers have generously funded more than $100 billion in health assistance and nearly $70 billion in humanitarian assistance globally. The United States has provided the DRC nearly $1.6 billion in health assistance over the past 20 years. We, through USAID programs, currently cover more than one-third of the Congolese population in maternal and child health, nutrition, malaria and TB interventions. We support antiretroviral treatment for over 130,000 people living with HIV in the DRC. We helped the DRC develop its Mashako Plan for routine immunization strengthening, which aims to mitigate the impact of the ongoing outbreaks of polio and measles. And we are the DRC's principal partner in ending the Congo's 10th Ebola outbreak, having contributed over $500 million to the response and deployed hundreds of health experts since August 2018. Our hearts broke when learning of a new Ebola case in North Kivu just days before declaring an end to the outbreak. Despite this setback, we remain optimistic that families in eastern DRC will soon have one less worry, no longer living in fear of the Ebola virus. The United States has been in DRC before the first case of Ebola and we will be here long after the last case. Our help is much more than money and supplies. It's the experts we have deployed worldwide, and those still conducting tutorials today via teleconference. It's the doctors and public-health professionals trained, thanks to U.S. money and educational institutions. And it's the supply chains that we keep open and moving for U.S. companies producing and distributing high-quality critical medical supplies around the world. Of course, it isn't just our government helping the world. American businesses, NGOs, and faith-based organizations have given at least $1.5 billion to fight the pandemic overseas. American companies are innovating new technologies for vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and ventilators. This is American exceptionalism at its finest. As we have time and time again, the United States will aid the DRC and others during their time of greatest need. The COVID-19 pandemic is no different. We will continue to help countries build resilient health care systems that can prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease outbreaks. Just as the U.S. has made the world more healthy, peaceful, and prosperous for generations, so will we lead in defeating our shared pandemic enemy, and rising stronger in its wake. "}
