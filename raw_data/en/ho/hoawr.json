A Regional Survey of Health Insurance Coverage for Complementary and Alternative Medicine: Current Status and Future Ramifications MARIA B. CLEARY-GUIDA, M.S., HEATHER A. OKVAT, B.A., MEHMET C. OZ, M.D., and WINDSOR TING, M.D. ABSTRACT Objective: The purpose of this survey is to evaluate the extent of health insurance coverage for complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) within one region in the United States, a study prompted by the increased utilization of CAM. Design: Prospective telephone interview of health insurance representatives. Location: A contiguous three-state area (New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut) in the North- east. Results: Almost all of the insurers surveyed cover chiropractic services. Less than half of the insurers reimburse acupuncture, usually for chronic pain management. Coverage for massage therapy is minimal and usually associated with physical therapy or chiropractic treatment. Other CAM services receive negligible coverage. Conclusions: Current health insurance coverage of CAM is limited essentially to chiropractic medicine, acupuncture and massage therapy. Coverage of CAM is made confusing by different policies, practitioner requirements, and health plans within each carrier. 269INTRODUCTION Utilization of complementary and alterna- tive medicine (CAM) among the U.S. pop- ulation in different reports ranges from 10% to 50% (Elder et al., 1997; Paramore, 1997; Astin et al., 1998; Eisenberg et al., 1998). Eisenberg and associates (1998) estimated that Americans made more than 600 million visits to CAM practitioners in 1997, compared with approxi- mately 400 million visits to all primary care physicians during the same year. They pro- jected that the annual expenditure in 1997 for CAM professional services exceeded $21 billion with approximately 60% paid out-of-pocket. One study suggested that CAM has a growth rate close to 30% per year (Blecher, 1997) at- tributed to an increase in the proportion of the population seeking alternative therapies, rather than increased visits per patient (Eisen- berg et al., 1998). This information indicates a CAM market that is significant in size, utilized by a major segment of the population, and un- dergoing unparalleled growth. Whereas health insurance coverage for allopathic medicine has been well-studied and reported, similar reports on health insurance coverage for CAM have been few in numbers. The purpose of this study College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY.was to evaluate the coverage of CAM services by health insurance carriers. The geographic fo- cus is a three-state region of the northeastern United States, including New York, New Jer- sey, and Connecticut. The findings may not nec- essarily reflect the whole United States due to regional differences. For example, CAM has been reported to be utilized at a greater extent on the west coast and may be covered by more insurance carriers (Smith, 1997). A mandate in Washington State prohibits insurance compa- nies from excluding coverage of licensed prac- titioners in naturopathy, acupuncture, mid- wifery, chiropractic and massage therapy (Goch, 1997). This survey, although regional in scope, provides important observations relating to the current status in health insurance cover- age of CAM and a foundation for discussion. METHODS Listings of health insurance carriers were ob- tained through latest available edition of the trade manual, The 1997 Healthcare Blue Book. Many of the companies listed were bought out or merged by the summer of 1999, reflecting a field in rapid transition. The State Insurance Departments of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut were also queried for names of health insurance carriers. Calls were made to 70 companies with responses from 43, 2 of which were not insurance companies but a pre- ferred provider organization (PPO) and a dis- count referral service. Twenty-seven (27) com- panies did not respond either because they were no longer in operation or they have merged with other carriers. The 43 insurance carriers represented the major health insurance companies with subscribers in the locale at the time of this study. A randomly selected service representative who answered the telephone between May and July 1999 was the subject of the interview. The focus was insurance cover- age for chiropractic, acupuncture, massage therapy, acupressure, nutritional counseling, reflexology, and other CAM services. There were also questions on co-pay, deductible, an- nual maximal coverage, and network CAM providers.FINDINGS The findings of the survey are summarized in Table 1. Information on group coverage through an employer was difficult to obtain without a policy number and name of an em- ployer. In addition, each carrier may have sev- eral different group policies. Therefore, Table 1 generally represents the coverage available to a consumer as a direct-pay individual plan. A wide range of individual plans with dif- ferent benefits and provisions are offered by each individual plan. For example, the same in- surance carrier may cover acupuncture in one benefit plan but not in another. If a particular service is covered in any of the plans of that carrier, it is listed in the table as a covered ser- vice. Even though Connecticut has a mandate for naturopathic medicine, our survey does not show any significant change in coverage com- pared to New York and New Jersey. Chiropractic medicine Virtually all of the insurance carriers in the survey cover chiropractic services in some form. Acupuncture Less than half of the insurance companies surveyed (17/43) cover acupuncture with two companies looking into adding the service and one company offering it at a discount. Among the 17 plans, 4 require that acupuncture be per- formed or supervised by a physician while the remaining 13 plans cover the procedure by a li- censed acupuncturist. Massage therapy Whereas 16 insurance carriers cover massage therapy, it is usually as part of physical ther- apy or as a discounted service. Acupressure is covered by 3 carriers and yoga instruction by Oxford only. Two insurance companies are evaluating the addition of extra CAM services. Coverage for other CAM services is negligi- ble.CLEARY-GUIDA ET AL. 270CAM AND Other Aetna/U.S. Health Care 1 1 Massage Allmerica Financial 1 1 Massage, Acupressure AmeriHealth HMO 1 Massage Anthem BC/BS of CT 1 Massage Bronx Health Plan 1 1 Massage, Acupressure Celtic Insurance Co. 1 1 CIGNA 1 1 Christian Science Practitioners Connecticare 1 Massage Elderplan 1 Empire BC/BS of NY 1 1 Fortis Benefits 1 1 Massage Golden Rule 1 Massage Group Health Ins. 1 Guardian 1 1 Massage HealthChoice of CT 1 HealthNet (IPA) and Empire 1 1 Health Choice Health Plans Inc. 1 Massage Healthsource CT 1 HIP 1 Independent Health Assoc.

CAM, complementary and alternative medicine.DISCUSSION The near-universal coverage of chiropractic services may serve as an important case study. The inclusion of chiropractic services within health insurance plans was set in motion with the addition of chiropractic benefits under Medicare in 1972 (Kaptchuk, 1998). The estab- lishment of a standardized education system and accreditation process and the licensure of chiropractors are also important (Shekelle et al., 1996; Cherkin and Mootz, 1998). The inclusion of chiropractic medicine took place when the health insurance industry was in an early stage of development and cost containment was not yet an issue facilitated the process. Legislative actions at the state and federal levels also played an essential role (Jensen et al., 1998; Hurwitz et al., 1998). According to the Ameri- can Chiropractic Association, 45 states have legislative mandates requiring health insur- ance coverage as of 1994. Some states also mandate that health plans include chiroprac- tors in their provider networks, most notably in New York (West, 1997). In contrast, coverage of acupuncture is sig- nificantly less even although it shares many similarities with chiropractic medicine includ- ing the requirements of board certification and licensure. According to the American Associa- tion of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, all 50 states currently license and regulate the practices of acupuncture. A more recent intro- duction of acupuncture may be one explana- tion for the difference. Although attendance at a standardized train- ing program, board certification, provider cre- dentialing, practice and procedural guidelines, standardized billing codes, medical record doc- umentation, and continuing education may be necessary for health insurance coverage, they do not guarantee coverage. Moreover, these re- quirements will likely increase the cost of CAM services. Is it better to take a laissez-faire ap- proach to CAM coverage and keep overall cost low, or to increase regulation and obtain reim- bursement privileges at a higher price? The an- swer probably depends on the modality and the risk-benefit ratio. In a practice such as acupuncture, potential risks (such as infected needles) to a patient are higher, so regulation is justifiable; whereas with meditation, the risks are minimal, an institutionalized credentialing process may be counterproductive. Health insurance coverage also reflects the level of acceptance within mainstream medi- cine and among the U.S. public. This accep- tance is achieved in part through basic science and clinical research. Coverage for acupunc- ture seems to have been driven by a large foun- dation of clinical studies showing the effec- tiveness of acupuncture in chronic pain (Smith, 1997; Rosted, 1998). A National Institutes of Health (NIH) panel reported that acupuncture may be as useful as an adjunct treatment or an acceptable alternative for a variety of condi- tions including postoperative and chemother- apy-induced nausea and vomiting, and pain management (NIH Consensus Development Panel on Acupuncture, 1998). Chiropractic treatment and acupuncture have received the highest number of referrals among five com- mon CAM modalities in a recent survey (Astin et al., 1998). What can one expect in health insurance cov- erage for CAM in the future? A survey con- ducted by Landmark HealthCare from No- vember 1998 to January 1999 found that 85% of the health maintenance organizations (HMOs) believe that the relationship between alterna- tive and allopathic medical care will continue to grow. Three-quarters of the HMOs also felt that consumer demand will be moderate to strong (Landmark Report II, 1999). Because some health conditions such as chronic pain, disabilities of various etiologies, and stress may be adequately treated with CAM modalities, consumers will demand greater CAM coverage within their health insurance plans. Recent surveys suggest that consumers are willing to pay out of pocket for CAM and other services that enhance their quality of life (Eisen- berg et al., 1998), making reimbursement by health insurance less critical. However, there is a general perception that a therapy is legit- imized by its inclusion in health insurance poli- cies. Reimbursement puts a stamp of approval on a service (Goch, 1997) and may significantly increase revenue. Because of the high expenditure for health care in the United States, an unavoidable issue is the additional cost incurred in covering CAM CLEARY-GUIDA ET AL. 272services. Employers and employees may be un- willing to pay for the additional cost of CAM services in addition to an already costly cover- age of conventional medical services. Three things may be necessary to overcome this ob- stacle: CAM utilization is shown to reduce the utilization of medical services, CAM is legisla- tively mandated, or an exceptional em- ployer/employee group with a special affinity toward CAM services. The consequences of including CAM services in health insurance plans are unknown and re- quire careful consideration. Will CAM cover- age be used simply as a marketing tool for the recruitment of customers while the actual CAM services provided are minimal? Is CAM being used to drive down medical costs? Herbs are less expensive than prescription drugs and acupuncture is less costly than orthopedic surgery. However, the autonomy of the CAM practitioner may be constrained as many allo- pathic physicians can attest to in the current managed care environment. Some agree that patients use CAM because they find these health care alternatives to be more congruent with their values, beliefs and philosophical orientation toward health and life (Astin et al., 1998). An individual may fa- vor CAM for the spiritual benefits and the at- tention paid to emotional states and behavior patterns. Will these qualities change if CAM services are covered by health insurance and under the jurisdiction of managed care organi- zations?
