Also known as meth, ice or chalk, meth affects the central nervous system and it can be administered to the body using a variety of methods. If you are in the grips of meth addiction, you may feel like there is no way out of the vicious cycle of dependence. Despite what you may feel and what others may think, recovery is possible. The first step in your recovery is undergoing crystal meth detox. What are the Withdrawal Symptoms of Crystal Meth? The severity of withdrawal symptoms from crystal methamphetamine depend on the length of time the drug is used, the amount of the drug used, the presence of other drugs in your body, and any underlying medical conditions. When you are withdrawing from methamphetamine, there are specific physical and psychological symptoms that you need to take into account. The most common physical withdrawal symptoms with meth include the following: - Lack of appetite - Hyperactivity - Increased Heart Rate - Diarrhea or Constipation - Itchiness - Poor Vision - Acne Low or High Blood Pressure - Rapid Breathing The physical symptoms of withdrawal can be extremely uncomfortable and painful. However, the psychological withdrawal symptoms cause the most problems with users. These psychological withdrawal symptoms can include the following: - Anxiety - Confusion - Insomnia - Mood Disturbances - Violent Behavior The psychological withdrawal from crystal meth can be very traumatic. Users may experience hallucinations which are both auditory and visual. Additionally, users coming off the drug may suffer from intense or may even experience intense delusions. Methamphetamine significantly alters brain chemistry and severely impacts brain functioning. That is why undergoing treatment at an Orange County crystal meth detox center is necessary in order to truly recover. The Importance of Properly Detoxing From Crystal Meth As stated earlier, detoxing from methamphetamine can be an excruciating process both physically and mentally. Even though the withdrawal process presents many challenges, there are those who feel they can quit meth \"cold turkey\" or they may use self-detoxification methods using homemade remedies or over-the-counter products. These methods of detoxification can be extremely dangerous and can pose tremendous risks to your health\u2014and even your life. Chronic meth use depletes neurotransmitters such as dopamine in the brain and reduces the number of receptors for these neurotransmitters. If you abruptly quit taking meth, both your body and brain will be thrown into chaos and you can experience serious health issues. Without the proper care and supervision that is provided by a crystal meth detox center, the withdrawal symptoms a chronic meth user can experience can lead to cardiac arrest, stroke, and even death. Additionally, meth users experience extreme psychological effects and can lash out violently at others and experience prolonged states of psychosis. By making the commitment to treatment at a crystal meth detox center, you will get the care and around the clock supervision you need in order to the make withdrawal as comfortable and tolerable as possible.
