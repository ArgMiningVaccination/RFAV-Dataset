ALAMEDA COUNTY HEALTH CARE SERVICES AGENCY STAFF Alex Briscoe Agency Dir ector Rebecca Gebhart Financ e Director Ryan Admini strative Services Officer2 3EXECUTIVE SUMMAR Y One of the provisions of Measure A required the establishment of a Citizen Oversight Committee. The Committee's role is to annually review Measure A expenditures for each fiscal year and report to the Alameda County Board of Supervisors (Board) on whether such expenditures conform to the purposes set forth in the Measure. The Measure states: \"The citizen oversight committee shall annually review the expenditure of the essential health care services tax fund for the prior year and shall report to the board of supervisors on the conformity of such expenditures. \" This report is based on a number of sources: self-reported inf ormation pr easure A f unds a pr esentation by t he Al ameda H ealth S ystem (A HS, db a Al ameda Coun ty M edical Cen ter) t he Al ameda Coun ty H ealth C are S ervices Agenc y (H CSA), whic h monit ors t he c ontracts w ith r ecipients of Me asure A funds\u2014including negotiating scope of work and payment schedule, developing contracts, preparing letters to the Board for approval, authorizing payments, and tracking expenditures. Measure A, the Essential Health Care Services Initiative, was passed by 71% of Alameda County voters in March 2004. It authorized the County of Alameda to raise its sales tax by one-half cent to provide additional financial support for emergency medical, hospital inpatient, outpatient, public health, mental health, and substance abuse services to indigent, low-income, and uninsured adults, children, families, seniors, and other residents of Alameda County. These services faced sharply increasing costs with inadequate resources to meet the needs of County residents. Measure A funds substantially eased the countywide crisis in health care; however, the economic downturn and slow recovery experienced both county- and nationwide since the passage of the measure have threatened some of the gains achieved. The initiative generated $112,540,504 in FY 11/12. AHS received 75% of these funds, and the Board distributed the remainder of the funds to other health care providers, including: initiatives f unded by t he Al ameda Coun ty Public H ealth D epartment and B ehavioral H ealth C are S ervices primary c are c linics C hildren's and S t. Ro se H ospitals s chool he alth s ervices. In addition to he lping AHS stabilize its budget and expand its health care services, Measure A has helped enable serious long-term planning to meet future health care needs for County residents. For example, the Public Health Department has used Measure A funds to examine and address health inequities within the client population and to develop a strategic plan. These initiatives will continue to bear fruit over time. MAJOR CONCLUSION The Oversight Committee found that AHS and other recipients of the sales tax revenue spent the funds in 4compliance with the strictures of Measure A. In addition, the Committee found that in FY 11/12 Measure A enabled expansions in services and facilities, which reflects the stated primary goal of the measure. HIGHLIGHTS Even in light of recent and ongoing federal health care reform, according to American Community Survey data for 2012, 12.6% of County residents, about 193,976 people, are uninsured. Thus, Measure A revenues continue to play a critical role in helping indigent, uninsured, and low-income residents of Alameda County\u2014who depend on the County's health care safety net\u2014maintain access to medical services. With regard to Measure A recipient reporting, the Committee recognizes an ongoing trend of improvement in the quality and level of detail in the reporting compared to prior years. This is due in part to the ongoing effort of the Committee to revise and refine the reporting form to solicit more specific information from fund recipients. The sales tax revenue received through Measure A enabled the following positive developments in the delivery of health care services: In t he f ace of a s luggish e conomic r ecovery, M easure A ena bled a l arge n umber of pr oviders t o c ontinue exi sting programs and maintain the service levels offered by these programs. For example, the Alameda Health System achieved almost 15,000 discharges and almost 300,000 outpatient visits, while the Public Health Prevention Initiative served over 68,000 Measure A clients. Most pr oviders pr esented c lear, qu antified inf ormation t hat s howed inc reases in he n umber of c lients s erved, incr eases in desired outcomes, or decreases in harmful behavior as a result of Measure A-funded services. For example: - The City of San L eandro Senior Services saw year-to-year increases of 182% for health checks, 167% for fall prevention classes, and 182% for health education classes. - Yout h receiving Alameda County Asthma Start case management services reported a 5% hospitalization and 18% emergency room admittance rate, compared to 31% and 53% pre case management. Measure A f unds inc reased ac cess t o he alth c are s ervices b oth ge ographically and t hrough pr ovision of a gr eater number and variety of services. For example, Youth and Family Opportunity Initiative operators opened new locations in West Alameda and in the unincorporated Ashland area to reach underserved populations, while AHS opened or expanded service facilities and programs including the HOPE Center at Highland Hospital and the Prosthetic-Orthotic clinic at Fairmont Hospital. Compared t o pr ior ye ars, in F Y 11/12 a r ecord n umber of r ecipients u sed M easure A f unds a s le verage t o draw dow n matching funds, including both federal and foundation grants. These organizations include Behavioral Health and Alcohol and Other Drug Community-Based Providers, School Health Services, Children's and St. Rose Hospitals, the Public Health Prevention Initiative, and many smaller providers. Many or ganizations and de partments, inc luding t he Public H ealth D epartment, M ulticultural Instit ute, and Pre ventive Care Pathways, used Measure A funds to increase health outreach and education efforts, with a focus on prevention. Measure A also allowed for the continuation and expansion of mental health services among many providers. Measure A g ives t he Coun ty fle xibility t o addr ess unme t ne eds and unan ticipated c osts. S pecifically, t he $678,773 di scretionary Board allocation gives the Supervisors the flexibility to respond to unanticipated needs in their districts. Each memb er of t he B oard of S upervisors r ecommended allo cations f or a pproval by t he B oard a s a whole. In FY 11/12, t he budgeted allocation per district was $150,000. Over the period of this report, there were 22 contracts for services for youth, children, seniors, and the general population from the allocations. During this period, the Committee noted an increased focus on healthy living, wellness, and prevention initiatives. 5CONCERNS In developing this report, the Oversight Committee has identified several concerns regarding the state of health care funding both during the years of Measure A implementation (2004-2012) and in the foreseeable future. These general concerns stem from a slow economic recovery rate, health care funding cuts, and an increase in the number of uninsured Alameda County residents. The Committee is concerned that ongoing sluggish economic growth\u2014in the County, the region, and the country\u2014will potentially increase the number of indigent, uninsured, and low-income Alameda County residents who might seek Measure A-funded services. If history is any guide, this may result in increased health disparities in the communities that Measure A addresses. The economic recession has exacerbated persistent inequalities, and the reality of multi-generational poverty has created dramatic challenges to improving health care outcomes for the communities Measure A was passed to support. At the same time, the Committee is paying close attention to the recent and ongoing state and federal health care reform initiatives, which promise to expand coverage and increase access to care to more than 150,000 County residents who are currently uninsured. By the end of 2013, Alameda County, through HCSA, will have successfully transitioned more than 38,000 currently uninsured residents from the Low-Income Health Program to the California MEDS system to receive Medi-Cal services starting on January 1, 2014. In addition, approximately 5,600 newly eligible residents will be able to seek coverage through Covered California, the statewide health insurance exchange program. While these accomplishments represent tremendous feats of social justice for many children, adults, and families, more than 45,000 individuals in Alameda County are expected to be uninsured in 2014. Moreover, funding cuts from the previous five years, Medi-Cal rate reductions, and potential state and federal funding cuts have deteriorated the County's safety net, decreased the ability of health providers to offer services to the Medi-Cal and uninsured populations, and challenged health care expansion efforts. Realizing the full promise of these reforms presents a significant challenge as the health care delivery system remains fragmented, eligibility systems are cumbersome and difficult to negotiate, and access to care continues to be compromised by low rates and a shortage of providers\u2014particularly in primary and preventative care. Measure A will continue to serve as an essential revenue stream to develop creative and innovative ways to improve access to care, lower the cost of care, and improve the patient experience. This in turn helps promote equity in health care services delivery by addressing the root causes of poor health outcomes. Outside the area of health care funding, the Committee recognizes that the composition of the Committee has improved in terms of reflecting the diverse make-up of the population served by Measure A. The Committee notes that this should be an area of ongoing focus as Committee member selections are made moving forward. Regarding Measure A funding, the Committee raises the following concerns:: Note: The Committee believes it is important to present any concerns it noticed while reviewing Measure A recipient reports. At the same time, the Committee wants to make clear that raising a concern does not necessarily mean that a problem exists with a recipient's use of Measure A funds. For example, the concern may arise because of incomplete or inaccurate reporting, not because of any inappropriate use of funds. 6General funding concerns The Committee recommends that HCSA create a process for Measure A recipients to certify that they are using Measure A funds to serve the populations listed in the measure. This process can include HCSA staff providing training to Measure A recipients on how to effectively collect demographic data to report on the diverse populations of indigent, uninsured, and low-income clients they serve by race, ethnicity, geography, and language. The Committee further advocates that HCSA be sufficiently staffed to successfully implement such a process. Reporting and Review Concerns The Committee expresses an ongoing concern that the County Counsel's interpretation of the Measure A ordinanc e limits the Committee's ability to review program efficacy and cost-effectiveness. In addition, the Committee does not have the capacity to review the HCSA's process of controls and review of how the money is spent\u2014via audit or other method. The Committee recommends that the Board authorize the HCSA to include evaluations of Measure A programs as part of its initiative to improve oversight and outcomes in all its programs. This includes identifying an additional resource to ensure that Measure A contracts are included in the initiative. Both H CSA and t he O versight Commit tee b elieve t hat t he in terpretation of t he st atute m ust b e r evised t o ex pand the role of the Committee and appropriately allocate Measure A funds for administrative staff to oversee the contracts and ensure the effective use of public funds to community-based organizations. Although r eporting c ontinues t o im prove, t he Commit tee e xpresses t he ongoing c oncern t hat it s r eview is im pacted by the varying level of detail provided in fund recipient reports, as well as varying levels of responsiveness to specific questions posed by the Committee to specific recipients. This makes it difficult for the Committee to determine whether money is being spent on the Measure A target population. For example:- Multiple pr ovider reports listed objectives that are not measurable and/or stated positive outcomes without quantifying the statements. For example, Behavioral Health Care Services at Juvenile Justice Center makes assertions of \"increased coping skills\" and \"a great benefit\" from court-ordered evaluations without quantifying these statements. - For s ome reports, it is unclear whether the target population falls within one of the categories listed in the Measure A statute: \"indigent, low-income, and uninsured adults, children, families, seniors, and other residents of Alameda County. \" For example, the information presented by providers such as Service Opportunities for Seniors and the Teleosis Institute does not track whether the population served falls within the requirements of Measure A. - In other r eports, the provider's description of the services offered raises questions as to their relevance to the wording of the Measure A statute. For example, while the Committee recognizes the value of the California Product Stewardship Council (drug disposal), Hill & Company (organizational restructuring), and Urban Strategies Council (program support services) programs, it is unclear whether these activities and their target populations fall within the wording of Measure A. In light of some of these reporting concerns, the Committee recommends that the recipient reporting form include a question about service delivery in multiple languages, as language barriers can potentially impede access to services for members of the Measure A target population.7Detoxification/Sobering Center The Center's 100% reliance on Measure A funds makes it vulnerable should the measure not win reauthorization in the future. Tri-City Health Center, Inc. Based on the provider's report, it is unclear whether Measure A funding was or was not used to provide any mental health services or care for seniors. Board of Supervisors Discretionary Allocations As noted in the reporting concerns above, some Board allocations are for direct services, while others are infor mational, preventive, or long-term focused and therefore more difficult to quantify. It would be helpful as part of the Oversight Committee's role to ensure that these Board allocations are aligned with the intent of the ordinance. The Commit tee e xpresses t he b elief t hat a f air and e quitable pr ocess s hould e xist f or pr oviders t o a pply f or Bo ard discretionary funds. This ensures transparency in the process of awarding Board allocations. Continuing an ongoing tr end, t he F Y 11/12 allo cations inc luded a l di scretionary B oard alloc ations, which require the use of additional HCSA administrative time. When the allocation is a small amount and a small percentage of the program budget, it is less meaningful than when it is substantial enough in dollars or in percentage of the program budget to make a difference in whether services can be provided. For example, the Board allocation to one provider represented only 2% of the agency's total budget. The Committee recommends that the Board consider setting a minimum amount of $25,000 for discretionary grants. Follow-Up to pRIoR YEAR C oNCERNS Alameda Health S ystem For FY 11/12, AHS clarified that Measure A funds were used to support programs and services instead of paying debt obligations, which had been a concern noted by the Oversight Committee in previous reports.

The Al ameda B oard of S t he r emaining 25% of f unds. On December 14, 2004, after initial passage of the ordinance, the Board approved the first funding allocations of its 25% share of Measure A funds. The Board has since reviewed and allocated funds approximately every three years. In FY 11/12, the Board approved a total of $27,117,701 in Measure A funding to the following providers, organizations, and allocations: N ot e: The tota l amount approved by the Board reflects base and one-time funding for FY 11/12 and does not include unspent funds from previous years that carry over into the reporting year.

For its most recent report, the Committee developed a review form and revised the reporting form to solicit more specific information from fund recipients. While modifying the form to improve the quality of the responses is an ongoing effort, these revisions seem to have improved the quality of reports returned. For the FY 11/12 report, the Committee received presentations on several allocations, including the Alameda Health System, Criminal Justice Mental Health Services, Public Health Prevention Initiative, Primary Care Community-Based Organizations, and Youth and Family Opportunity Initiative. The Committee used the report forms returned by most Measure A fund recipients, along with information from the presentations, to review all funding allocations. As in prior years, varying levels of detail provided in the reports, as well as varying levels of responsiveness to specific questions posed by the Committee to certain recipients, made it difficult for the Committee to evaluate the reports consistently and thoroughly. However, as noted, the revised form seems to have resulted in improved reporting from the providers. 11HOW THE MONEY WAS SPENT The Alameda Health System (dba Alameda County Medical Center) receives 75% of Measure A funds through a specific designation. The Alameda Health System (AHS) Board of Trustees allocates these funds within AHS. The Alameda County Board of Supervisors (Board) allocates the remaining 25% of Measure A funds. The Alameda County Health Care Services Agency (HCSA) manages these funds. Figure 1 DISTRIBUTION OF MEASURE A FUNDS 25% 75%Alameda County Board of Supervisors Alameda Health System Board of Trustees In FY 11/12, Measure A generated $112,540,504 (not including interest earned). The funds were allocated as follows: Alameda Health System (75%) $84,405,378 Alame da County $28,135,126 TO TAL $112,540,504 In F Y 11/12, the Alameda County budget totaled $2,482,548,960. The HCSA budget totaled $639,722,048, or 25.8% of the total County budget. Measure A funds not specifically designated for AHS accounted for 4.4% of the HCSA budget. The following sections provide more detail on the allocation and expenditure of Measure A funds.2SECTION12REVIEW OF FY 11/12 EXPENDITURES: 75% of Measure A Funds Allocated to the Alameda Health System (dba Alameda County Medical Center) FY 11/12 allocation: $84,405,378 Amount 0 FY 11/12 savings transferred to reserve: 0 types of services pr ovided: Emergency Medical, Hospital Inpatient, Hospital Outpatient, Mental Health, Public Health, Substance AbuseIndividuals served: Adults, Children, Seniors, Families, /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND The Alameda Health System (AHS) provides the majority of indigent, uncompensated, and charity care in Alameda County. Measure A revenue helps fill the funding gap left after Medi-Cal, Medicare, and other payer sources fail to satisfy the full cost of services provided to County residents. AHS receives 75% of all Measure A revenue to support its network of three hospitals - Highland, Fairmont, and John George Psychiatric Pavilion - and its three satellite clinics: Eastmont Wellness, Winton Wellness, and Newark Health Center. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Unlike most community clinic and private hospital recipients, AHS does not use Measure A money to fund specific programs. Instead, Measure A funding is critical to AHS's ability to serve as the medical safety net for the County. Measure A funds provide AHS with more flexibility in absorbing annual health care cost increases when other payer sources, such as Medi-Cal and Medicare, don't pay the full cost of service. HIGHLIGHTS As a supplemental revenue source, Measure A funds helped AHS achieve the following client results:Measure A Helps ALAMEDA HEALTH SYSTEM Ms. H is in her early 50s and previously had no access to vision care.

These providers envision communities where all individuals and their families can successfully realize their potential and pursue their dreams, and where stigma and discrimination against those with mental health and/or alcohol and drug issues are remnants of the past.18MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y The Behavioral Health and AOD Community-Based Providers used Measure A funds to help mitigate budget cuts and lack of cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) that would have resulted in program cuts. Measure A funds helped offset the impact of reductions in funding, thus contributing to system stability. HIGHLIGHTS The use of Measure A funds to mitigate budget cuts allowed providers to serve approximately the same number of County residents in AOD programs compared to the prior year, despite unavoidable cost increases for insurance, utilities, and other non-service-related operational expenses. Providers saw only about a 2% year-to-year decline in the number of service users (about 36,000 unique persons), as well as a 2% decline in the total number of services delivered to that population. These minimal declines are even more significant in light of County General Fund reductions of about 10% and a Bay Area cost of living increase of about 2.4% for that same period. Furthermore, the Measure A allocation allowed the Behavioral Health and AOD providers to generate $28,960 in additional funding from Medi-Cal. CONCERNS The provider's report contains no measurable results, making it difficult for the Committee to accurately evaluate compliance with the Measure A ordinance.

In its work at the Alameda County Juvenile Justice Center (JJC), BHCS tries to mitigate the negative emotional impact of detention. Many of the youth are faced with extreme trauma in their lives and 19communities. The BHCS mental health staff work with these youth to monitor their behavior and intervene when their behavior negatively impacts their ability to function in the institution. BHCS clinicians also provide court-ordered psychological evaluations. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y BHCS used its Measure A allocation to provide services including individual therapy, case management, court-ordered evaluations, and crisis intervention to youth detained in the JJC. The funds also helped support consultation between County jail mental health staff and JJC staff, probation officers, and the Juvenile court regarding management of inmate behavioral problems. HIGHLIGHTS BHCS services supported by Measure A funding helped achieve the following for 338 youth detained in the JJC: Increased c oping s kills f or manag ing anxie ty, depr ession, and trauma symptoms due to being detained. Court-ordered e valuations t o he lp t he c ourts det ermine placement options.

While detained in the JJC, the youth received mental health services from the Guidance Clinic. The psychologist identified traumatic events in the minor's life, including being physically abused by his father and having his home burglarized and vandalized, and helped identify services to address the minor's mental health needs after his release from custody. A Guidance Clinic social worker helped the minor's mother access Victims of Crime funding, which paid for moving expenses to a safer location. These services helped to stabilize the youth, access community-based services, and build a bridge between detention and the community.20CRIMINAL JUS TICE SCREENING /IN-CUS TODY SER VICES Note: Starting in the FY 11/12 Measure A Report, the previous allocations for \"Criminal Justice Screening/In- Custody Services at Santa Rita Jail\" and \"Glenn E. Dyer Jail in Oakland\" have been combined and changed to this new name to accurately reflect the current service delivery. Mental health services are no longer provided at either the Oakland City Jail or Glenn E. Dyer Jail. Inmates residing in these facilities are transferred to Santa Rita Jail to receive mental health services. FY 11/12 allocation: $4,056,000 Amount 0 FY 11/12 savings transferred to reserve: 0 types of services pr ovided: Mental Health Individuals served: Adults, Seniors, Indigent, Low-Income, Countywide AGENCY /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services (BHCS) works to maximize the recovery, resilience, and wellness of all eligible Alameda County residents who develop or experience serious mental health, alcohol, or drug concerns. By placing mental health staff in the county jails (Oakland, Glenn E. Dyer, Santa Rita), BHCS is able to provide timely assessments and deliver mental health services to individuals with mental illnesses who are in the custody of the Alameda County Sheriff's Office. County jail mental health (CJMH) staff work in the intake section of the jails as well as other areas such as the inmate housing units, where inmates with mental illnesses can be assessed, monitored, and provided with ongoing treatment as well as crisis intervention. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Measure A funding enabled BHCS to maintain staffing levels necessary to provide a range of mental health services, including the following: Mental he alth s creening Crisis in tervention Management of inma te b ehavioral pr oblems Suicide pr evention Ongoing tr eatment ervices alth on-c all/emergency s ervice Discharge pl anning/continuity of c are T raining Administration of p sychotropic me dications21HIGHLIGHTS Prior to Measure A funding, there were too few mental health staff working in the jails to accommodate the high volume of inmates needing mental health assessments, services, and medications. Many had to wait up to two months to be seen, if at all. CJMH did not have the capacity to assign staff to the special housing units, which house the most impaired inmates; thus, they were unable to serve some of the most vulnerable. Thanks to Measure A, CJMH now has mental health teams assigned to all five high-risk housing units. There are now 15.87 staff serving 1,200 inmates, for a ratio of one staff per 75 inmates. The suicide rate has dropped by 50-100% over the past several years, from four in 2004 to zero in 2007, 2009, and 2011 (one in 2012). This decrease is due to the collaboration with, and cross-training of, custody staff in prevention efforts. Likewise, the adequate staffing provided by Measure A allows acutely mentally ill and suicidal inmates to be identified and sent out to psychiatric hospitals in a timely manner. DETOXIFICATION /SOBERIN G CENTER FY 11/12 allocation: $2,000,000 transferred to reserve: services pr ovided: Substance Abuse Countywide *Note: On June 5, 2012, the Board of Supervisors reallocated $1,000,000 from prior years' allocations for the Detoxification/Sobering Center to the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Housing Trust. AGENCY /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND The Cherry Hill Detoxification/Sobering Center offers a welcoming, nonjudgmental, trauma-informed approach that uses motivational interviewing as an assessment and engagement method to allow each individual to safely withdraw and stabilize from the effects of alcohol and/or substance overuse. All services are available to the community 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. The Sobering Center is designed to assist those needing immediate sobering services from alcohol and/or drugs. The center offers clients brief visits of 23 hours or less with continual monitoring for safe withdrawal. The Sobering Center includes a Health Center staffed with nurse coordinators who have obtained at least a licensed vocational nurse (LVN) state license. Nurse coordinators monitor withdrawal and assist with medical triage and assessment. The Health Center provides TB tests to individuals who are seeking further treatment and makes referrals to medical and psychiatric services as needed.22The Detoxification Center is a social model, non-medical center specifically designed for individuals requiring 24-hour, 7-day-a-week monitoring. Van transport is available for individuals needing transportation to and from medical, psychiatric, treatment, housing, or any other ancillary service. These services allow clients to fulfill all admission requirements for their next level of treatment. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y The Cherry Hill Detoxification/Sobering Center is 100% funded through Measure A. It receives no other funding. HIGHLIGHTS In FY 11/12, the Sobering Center provided 6,281 services; the Detoxification Center provided 2,379 services; and the Health Center provided 3,118 services to existing clients. During this period, Cherry Hill collaborated with Dr. Garrick from the Alameda County Medical Center emergency department to determine the impact of Cherry Hill services on the department. Thanks to the services provided at Cherry Hill, the number of individuals entering the emergency department with a diagnosis of intoxication was reduced by 52%, and the length of stay for these individuals was reduced by an average of four hours. Cherry Hill expanded its collaboration with law enforcement, which resulted in more residents being offered a treatment approach to public intoxication rather than incarceration and/or hospitalization. In addition, Cherry Hill offered training, education, and orientation groups for 25-30 law enforcement leaders and officers every other month. CONCERNS The Center's 100% reliance on Measure A funds makes it vulnerable should the measure not win reauthorization in the future. Also, because of transportation barriers, outreach for the Center is limited to the north and south ends of the County.23HORIZON SERVICES, INC.

MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMARY With the assistance of Measure A funding, Horizon Services established a total of five permanent medication disposal sites in Alameda County. CONCERNS It is not entirely clear that the use of Measure A funds for prescription drug disposal services and education meets the criteria of providing financial support for emergency medical, hospital inpatient, outpatient, public health, mental health, and substance abuse services for indigent, lowincome, uninsured, and underinsured adults, children, families, and seniors in Alameda County.24LAS POSITAS 0 FY 11/12 savings transferred to reserve: 0 types of services pr ovided: Mental Health Individuals served: Adults, UninsuredMeasure A clients served: 396 (Total clients: 546) Service area: Information not requested from provider AGENCY /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND The Las Positas Student Health and Wellness Center works to strengthen student learning, retention, and success.

This program provides mental health crisis counseling and helps accommodate the growing need for mental health support services on campus. HIGHLIGHTS Over a five-year period (2007 to 2012), the number of individual students served by the Health and Wellness Center increased by 384, from 162 to 546 students. Student surveys over this same period reported a significant improvement in symptoms of emotional distress.

Jen attended weekly counseling sessions at the health center, revealing that her home life growing up was chaotic. She had cut herself in high school and had suicidal thoughts. The next day, Jen reappeared for counseling with her mother, who agreed to drive Jen to a nearby hospital to be voluntarily admitted. Jen returned after spring break and continued counseling.

The primary goal of New Bridge programs is to provide adults and adolescents with the education, support, and skills necessary to live productive and healthy lives without the use of drugs or alcohol. The New Bridge ASPIRE program provides services to low-income, high-risk youth in the lower socioeconomic areas of East and West Oakland. The youth come from homes and communities with high rates of violence, alcohol and drug use, incarceration, single-family homes, uninsured residents, and unemployment. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y The ASPIRE program used its Measure A allocation as a bridge fund to provide alcohol and other drug school-based services. ASPIRE counselors conducted interactive alcohol, tobacco, and other drug prevention programs for low-income high-risk minority youth in Oakland. Participants received psycho-educational prevention and intervention services. Each student attended a four-week series covering the following topics: Being an Adolescent; Alcohol, Tobacco, and Other Drugs; Family Pressures and Problems; and Skills. The services were conducted in a small group setting, with students receiving additional individual counseling.Measure A Helps NEW BRIDGE FOUNDATION Violet, a 14-year-old African-American female, had been a victim of molestation. She was mandated for the ASPIRE program for alcohol abuse after violating the school's policy for the second time. Violet initially presented with denial, which masked her confusion about self-image and family culture. As she became more involved in the program, she took ownership of her decision to drink. Violet formed a positive and consistent attachment with her program counselor, who was able to support Violet by identifying resources at the school campus. Now in the 10th grade, Violet is maintaining a 3.0+ GPA and is abstaining from alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs.26As part of the program, ASPIRE trained faculty and staff about alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs with the goal of increasing understanding of how drugs affect students in the school environment. The program administered the evidence-based Project SUCCESS survey to measure participants' attitudes about alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs both prior to and after receiving services.

SAVE support groups provide a safe place for domestic violence victims to talk about their issues with other women and receive the support of a trained facilitator, while individual counseling services provide clients with a private setting to discuss the violence they have experienced. Clients are able to attend counseling for as many sessions as they desire, free of charge.27The scope of SAVE services meets the Measure A funding criteria in several areas: 92% of c lients who r eceive c ounseling s ervices mee t the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) definition of low-income.

MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y SAVE used its Measure A funds to provide group and individual counseling services to domestic violence victims and their children, specifically to support the clinical staff and interns who provide these services. HIGHLIGHTS Thanks in part to its Measure A allocation, the SAVE counseling program conducted 175 sessions of individual counseling and 50 sessions of group counseling, seeing 284 domestic violence clients overall. The agency thus surpassed its target of 160 individual sessions and 40 group sessions.

In partnership with school districts and service providers, and by leveraging and blending local, state, and federal resources, the Initiative invests over $24 million annually toward delivering a continuum of school-based behavioral health supports to students in schools in Alameda County. The Initiative has implemented school-based behavioral health supports throughout the county with the Our Kids Our Families Program as one of its core programs.

The 1,563 students served by BHCs includes early intervention and treatment services, as well as prevention services targeting a specific group of students (such as in a classroom or specialized school program). It does not include prevention supports that go toward every student in a given school, or supports such as mental health consultation that are designed to strengthen teacher and staff skills in interacting effectively with students and parents. Further, without Measure A funding, the Center for Healthy Schools and Communities would not be able to conduct Medi-Cal Administrative Activities (MAA) billing, make use of the contributions from the Mental Health Services Act, or apply restricted foundation funds toward this effort. So in fact Measure A is the primary resource for serving all students.

The Committee notes that in recording these accomplishments, the program used quantitative metrics to track program effectiveness and strengthened the use of evidence- based practices along a continuum of behavioral health supports. In addition to these accomplishments, the Our Kids Our Families Program leveraged its Measure A allocation to obtain the following matching funds: Early P eriodic S creening, Di agnosis, and f unding: $160,000 City of O akland, M easure Y : $219,514 Grants f rom f oundations: $85,447 Mental H ealth S ervices A and E arly ogram (Di strict S tart-up F unds): $84,631 CONCERNS As perhaps more an observation than an outright concern, the Committee notes the challenge of serving indigent, uninsured, or low-income students countywide rather than in a limited and targeted number of school districts. In addition, it appears that approximately 20% of students served are not indigent or uninsured; however, since funds are received from other sources, this is not necessarily a conflict with Measure A. 31SENIOR SUPPOR T PR OGRAM OF 0 FY 11/12 savings transferred to reserve: 0 types of services pr ovided: Mental Health Individuals served: Seniors, Low-IncomeMeasure A clients served: 59 (Total clients: 59) Service area: Dublin, Livermore, Pleasanton AGENCY /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND Senior Support Program of the Tri-Valley provides services and assistance to seniors that foster independence, promote safety and well-being, preserve dignity, and improve quality of life.

The Senior Support Program is often the only human contact its clients have during the week. Although many seniors do not want to ask for help, when the Senior Support Program counselor presents options and referrals, the clients are likelier to talk about their needs and often agree to receive additional support. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y During FY 11/12, Senior Support Program of the Tri-Valley used Measure A funding to accomplish the following: Develop and im plement f orms and training man uals for t he intern and volunteer program Recruit eig ht t o t en in terns and eig ht volun teers t o assi st in the counseling program Provide men tal he alth c ounseling t o over 50 s eniors liv ing in t he T ri-Valley ar ea Conduct c ommunity outr each and e ducation a t s enior c enters, s enior liv ing c ommunities, lo cal c lubs/service org anizations, and local colleges.Measure A Helps SENIoR SUppo Rt pRoGRAM oF tHE tRI-VAllEY Vera, a 67-year-old woman, has had major back surgery; suffers from heart disease, high blood pressure, depression, and anxiety; and could not walk for any distance. When the Senior Support Program counselor first started seeing Vera, she was isolated in her apartment and did not have any friends. Vera received weekly sessions with her counselor with support from a volunteer. Vera began feeling better and taking short walks. She attended a Senior Support Program party and took up needlepoint, a hobby she had not enjoyed for years. Vera is now healthier and feels more joy. She has not needed emergency services for over eight months.32Senior Support Program is actively trying to find additional funding for its in-home counseling service. To date, the service receives 100% of its funding from Measure A. HIGHLIGHTS The Senior Support Program in-home counseling program has resulted in many observable changes in the older adults it serves, including the following: Over 40% of c lients di splay a de crease in de pression s ymptoms and an inc rease in s ociability.

The Committee notes that the Senior Support Program uses a meticulous pre- and post-counseling assessment to validate its program. The Committee also notes that the Senior Support Program served 59 clients at a total cost of only $12,000, or $203 per client. Given the outcomes, this is an impressive investment, and shows excellent leveraging of funds to engage volunteers and expand capacity.

This often spans the entire continuum of care: educating women about the need for timely screening, helping them access health insurance or low cost-screenings, finding transportation to treatment, guiding them through the maze of information about treatment options, and connecting them to a support group.34Because its services and programming are available at no cost, WCRC is able to reach nearly 5,000 clients every year, primarily low- and moderate-income women in Alameda and Contra Costa Counties. Without access to these resources, low-income communities would continue to suffer from higher incidence and mortality rates, and lower quality of life. WCRC staff are committed to addressing the societal inequities and cultural barriers that lead to disparities in cancer outcomes and access to care. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y WCRC used its Measure A allocation to recruit, train, and manage/supervise Community Health Advocate (CHA) volunteers, who conduct targeted outreach/education in Latino and African-American communities. CHAs assist underserved women in accessing free or low-cost cancer services and screening, and provide information about cancer risk including family history, cancer risk management, and resources for cancer screening. CHAs staff WCRC informational tables at health fairs and community events, lead workshops and support groups, and help alleviate myths about cancer that are still prevalent in both the African-American and Latino communities. HIGHLIGHTS WCRC's 31 multicultural CHA volunteers conducted targeted outreach and education in Latino and African-American communities, reaching 1,049 women through 29 community events. Of these, 384 women were provided with a referral to a free or low-cost breast cancer screening (178 women under 40 and 206 women over the age of 40). Of the total number of clients served, Measure A funding specifically served 25 clients. Educational workshops and cancer talks were done at churches and schools in communities targeting women who are isolated and would otherwise forfeit screening.

See \"Review of FY 11/12 Expenditures: 75% of Measure A Funds Allocated to the Alameda Health System\" for a breakdown of Alameda Health System Measure A funding and expenditures.

MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Measure A supports multiple services at CHRCO. The programs are consistent with the intent of Measure A to \"provide for additional financial support for emergency medical, hospital inpatient, outpatient, public health, mental health, and substance abuse services to indigent, low-income, and uninsured adults, children, families, seniors, and other residents of Alameda County. \" Emergency Department The CHRCO emergency department provides highly specialized pediatric emergency services for the children of Alameda County, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. CHRCO's emergency department sees a broad array of pediatric disease and injury from the basic to the most complex. CHRCO is the leading provider for Alameda County children in need of acute care. Children with Medi-Cal rely nearly exclusively on CHRCO for emergency 36services since the public hospitals in the area do not provide specialized pediatric care and do not have any beds for children in the event a child needs to stay overnight. Over 76% of patients seen in the CHRCO emergency department receive Medi-Cal. This number is higher than almost any other hospital\u2014child or adult\u2014in California. With a 3:1 public-to-private payer ratio, CHRCO relies on supplemental funding from Alameda County via Measure A in order to sustain these vital services for Alameda County's children. Center for Child protection Measure A support of CHRCO's Center for Child Protection (CCP) provides a critical safety net for hundreds of children and youth in Alameda County impacted by child abuse and violence. As the designated site for forensic medical services in Alameda County, child victims enter the medical system at CHRCO through numerous avenues to access services from CCP . CCP maintains staffing 24 hours per day to respond to acute and non-acute forensic examinations. In addition to these examinations, which are largely physical in nature, CCP provides services to address the short- and long-term psychological impacts on children and families of trauma and witnessing violence. Clinical case management is provided to children and adolescents who present to the emergency department and/or child abuse management clinic following diagnosis or disclosure of abuse. Clinical case management assists families with navigating the criminal justice system, arranging necessary medical follow-up, and assisting with community resource referrals. Comprehensive evidence-based mental health services are provided to children, adolescents, and their families. For most of these families, there are no alternatives in Alameda County for many of the services provided by CCP . As with comparable programs across the nation, CCP's operating budget relies heavily on hospital and governmental subsidies to offset revenue loss associated with this sub-population. Because many services are funded by external sources such as Measure A, there is no charge for eligible clients. This feature is very important, as many caregivers would not step forward to divulge sensitive information if there would be a record of this information with their insurance company. Furthermore, two unique aspects of child abuse medicine contribute greatly to the economic burden of a hospital housing a child protection team: poor reimbursement and the amount of time ensuring the health and safety needs of every child are met. Charging crime victims for medical service has unique complexities; as a result, reimbursements, if any, are substantially below cost. Additional strain is placed on the child abuse program since no source of reimbursement exists for services integral to caring for a child who is a suspected victim of abuse, such as case review and consultation with child welfare and law enforcement. HIGHLIGHTS In FY 11/12, a total of 46,000 visits took place to the CHRCO emergency department, 675 of which were trauma cases where the child faced a life-threatening situation. Measure A monies allow the CHRCO emergency department to provide faster and more efficient care for children in Alameda County: The total average time children spend at the CHRCO emergency department has shrunk to 3.1 hours, compared to 4.1 hours for CHRCO's peer group, according to studies conducted by McKesson. Measure A funding has also helped the emergency department to upgrade its space to be more kid-friendly and to purchase state-of-the-art equipment, such as new monitors and imaging equipment. Without the CHRCO emergency department, children would need to travel further and/or receive care that 37is not specialized to children. With little doubt, more children would die without the CHRCO emergency department. In FY 11/12, the CCP served more than 1,000 children. CCP performed 85 forensic evidentiary examinations and 65 inpatient medical consultations, and provided clinical and psychotherapy services to 951 children. In addition to these accomplishments, CHCRO leveraged its Measure A allocation to receive $750,000 in matching funds from the California Medical Assistance Commission.

St. Rose works in partnership with its highly valued physicians and employees to heal and comfort all those it serves. In accordance with its mission to serve the community, St. Rose Hospital is a safety-net, independent hospital that provides critical access to emergency medical, hospital inpatient, and outpatient services for indigent, low-income, underinsured populations in central and southern Alameda County.38MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y During FY 11/12, St. Rose Hospital used Measure A funds to support the following objectives: Provide c are f or emer gency r oom v isits and a ssist w ith t he S t.

Specific services that St. Rose provided using Measure A funding include the following: Critical access. St. Rose Hospital serves as a critical access point for Alameda County and is the only Medi-Cal-contracted facility between Oakland and Fremont. Additionally, St. Rose serves as a safety-net hospital and provides health care access to many low-income residents who do not have adequate transportation to Alameda County Medical Center. Hospitalists program. St. Rose hospitalists (doctors who specialize in the care of patients in the hospital) assume care of indigent and uninsured patients admitted to St. Rose. This alleviates the financial impact of private physicians requesting compensation for lack of reimbursement. Women's services. St. Rose operates the Women's Center to meet the growing demand for OB/GYN (obstetrics and gynecology) services in our community, because many OB/GYN practitioners do not accept Medi-Cal rates. The program provides immediate and emergency care for pregnant women who present to the emergency room, often with no history of prenatal care. Silva Pediatric Clinic. For FY 11/12, St. Rose continued its operation and full subsidization of the Silva Pediatric Clinic. The clinic provides medical and mobile services for Medi-Cal and uninsured children. Cardiac care. St. Rose is the only facility contracted by Medi-Cal to provide elective cardiac and PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention, commonly known as angioplasty) services in central Alameda County. St. Rose routinely accepts hospital transfers for emergency and elective cardiac care from non-Medi-Cal providers. HIGHLIGHTS Most significantly, Measure A funds have helped St. Rose Hospital avoid bankruptcy and/or closure during FY 11/12, part of a longer period of extreme financial distress for St. Rose. Specific highlights for St. Rose programs funded by Measure A include the following: Among emer gency r oom edi-Cal and 21% ar e uninsur ed. Among t he S t.

This represents almost a doubling of St. Rose's initial allocation of $2,500,000, allowing St. Rose to provide far more services than those that would have been possible by Measure A funds alone.

ADSNAC provides leadership and a focal point for advancing the awareness, availability, and quality of these critical community-based programs that help prevent and offer an alternative to institutional care. Adult Day Health Care (ADHC) and its replacement Medi-Cal benefit, Community-Based Adult Services (CBAS), treat the health and supportive needs of seniors and adults with disabilities who are living with chronic health conditions such as Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia, post-stroke complications, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health challenges, and developmental disabilities. Individual services include nursing supervision and assistance; medication monitoring; physical, occupational, and speech therapy; and assistance with personal needs such as eating and walking. Group activities provide opportunities for meaningful engagement and social interaction. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y The State of California has established new CBAS programs to replace the existing ADHC programs.

Experiencing chronic health conditions and disabilities, Mr. Edwards relies on the ADHC for nursing care, medication management, socialization, and more. Mr. Edwards was found ineligible for the new CBAS benefit in early 2012. Without the program, his health conditions would have spiraled out of control. The Measure A bridge funds allowed Mr. Edwards to attend Berkeley ADHC two days per week while awaiting his hearing results. In Fall 2012, Mr. Edwards won his appeal and was enrolled into the CBAS program. The Measure A funds helped Mr. Edwards continue living in the community. 42CBAS programs. These individuals have appealed their ineligibility determinations and are awaiting the results of the appeal hearings.

Additional activities and services will be provided through the Measure A funds during FY 12/13 depending on the outcome of the eligibility hearings and the needs emerging from the new managed care environment. HIGHLIGHTS Measure A funds covered the cost of 3,716 days of ADHC services for 205 participants as they awaited the results of their appeals for program eligibility. The individuals covered by the bridge fund maintained participation in their ADHC programs, indicating the project was successful in allowing very vulnerable adults to continue living in the community. In addition, all but one of the ADHCs that received bridge funds remained opened, an indicator that the bridge fund helped to preserve the viability of the centers. The ADHC that closed did so because of a reimbursement rate reduction by the state that was not viable for their particular operations. 43ALAMEDA COUNTY DENTAL HEALTH FY 11/12 allocation: $150,000 11/12 savings transferred to reserve: $23,160 types of services pr ovided: Public Health Individuals Children, Families, clients: 3,142) Service area: Alameda, Castro Valley, Fremont, Hayward, Newark, Oakland, San Leandro, San Lorenzo, Union City AGENCY /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND A branch of the Alameda County Public Health Department, the Community Health Services Office of Dental Health sponsors the WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) Oral Health Collective program.

The onsite Public Health nurse called Alex's father, who was home with a broken leg and had no transportation. The nurse made an emergency appointment at the dental clinic where Alex was already a patient. However, Alex did not attend the appointment, since he had no Medi-Cal coverage, and the family owed the clinic for earlier treatments. The Community Health Outreach Worker made Alex another appointment at a Healthy Smiles provider near his home. This time, the family took Alex to his appointment, and his dental problems were treated in a few visits. 44The service focuses on families of children who participate in WIC at the Eastmont, Hayward, or Telegraph site and have a child between the ages of 9 and 15 months. Since siblings often accompany the caregiver at the visit, children who are older than the target group are also afforded the services.

Many DLC workers have not had access to primary health care services even from their countries of origin. The DLC staff works closely with these individuals to navigate a complicated health care system and ensure that their health care needs are met. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Measure A funds provide approximately half of the support needed to sustain the DLC health program. Services provided through this program include the following: DLC Healthcare Portal Project. The DLC partnered with St. Rose Hospital, Davis Street Health Clinic, and Samuel Merritt University to provide primary health care services, including episodic visits and emergency care, to hundreds of under- and unemployed, mostly migrant, workers. To reduce health care costs, the partner organizations share best practices to deliver efficient health care services, coordinate services among agencies, have developed universal forms that these partners can share, and have developed a database that allows more comprehensive, streamlined information-sharing to improve diagnosis and care of DLC clientele.

The DLC regularly provides workers with literature to educate them about the effects of alcohol and drug use and abuse. Hospital and inpatient services. The DLC Healthcare Portal uses hospital services for the most extreme and/or emergency cases only. The DLC uses some lab and other specialty services to help diagnose workers' ailments. Public health prevention programs. The DLC has developed Zumba classes to address the health needs of women workers. Participants receive individual health plans and monitoring to help reduce the worker's weight and/or decrease the chance of getting diabetes. In addition, the DLC partners with Tri-City Health in Fremont to provide HIV prevention and education and screening. Outpatient services. In addition to ancillary services provided by the Davis Street Clinic and St. Rose Hospital sites, the County provides DLC workers with dental services three months out of the year. DLC staff refers more complicated and/or extreme dental care cases to Onsite Health, a San Carlos company that provides mobile dental services. Youth and community services. The DLC opens its job skills training and community volunteer service opportunities to the public for participation. The DLC is currently partnering with the Alameda County Apprenticeship Collaboration to develop a more systematic approach to provide youth with job training, skills, and employment.

The health centers provide enhanced chronic disease management for patients with conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, asthma, congestive heart failure, and behavioral health conditions. For patients with diabetes, a team of primary care providers, counselors, case managers, dieticians, and medical assistants have personalized treatments by providing education about healthy eating, exercising, keeping food journals, and using medications. The health centers have also expanded the provisions of behavioral health to treat patients with mild to severe chronic symptoms of depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and other conditions. In addition, the health centers host events such as community health fairs, which provide outreach and enrollment services and free screenings, as well as walks/runs to promote community wellness. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Measure A funds allow the consortium health centers to provide comprehensive primary care services to uninsured patients in Alameda County. Measure A funds were used to provide comprehensive primary care to about 25% of the 36,000 uninsured, low-income patients who qualified for Alameda County's HealthPAC program. The health centers provide comprehensive, integrated services including mental health and chronic disease management for conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and substance abuse. Clinical leadership has established uniform quality measures and developed a uniform drug formulary to ensure quality and enable patient access to prescribed medications. HIGHLIGHTS In FY 11/12, Alameda Health Consortium member health centers provided a total of 119,895 reimbursable visits to over 36,000 HealthPAC patients, exceeding contracted targets by 3,000 visits. The total HealthPAC visit count increased by over 11,000 visits from FY 10/11. The health centers also enrolled 3,000 more patients into HealthPAC, about a 9% increase, from the previous fiscal year.

The consortium as a whole met the contracted target, ending the fiscal year at 101% contracted visits provided, resulting in more Alameda County residents with access to health care. Additionally, regarding diabetic patients ages 18 to 75 who have their blood sugar under control (defined as HbA1c under 9%), all of the health centers exceeded the national average (71%) by at least 6% or more. (This figure does not include Native American Health Center. This center reports to the Indian Health Services, which does not ask for this information.) Finally, the consortium leveraged its Measure A allocation to receive $2,505,802 in matching funds from the 1115 Medicaid Waiver through HealthPAC by the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency.

A program of the Center for Healthy Schools and Communities, the School Health Centers (SHCs) play a vital role in creating universal access to health services by providing a continuum of age-appropriate and integrated health and wellness services for youth in a safe, youth-friendly environment at or near schools. SHCs provide the following: Mental health and substance abuse services. The SHCs offer a variety of school-based counseling and mental health services. Behavioral health group counseling includes groups that focus on conflict resolution and/or restorative justice. The SHCs offer crisis intervention, family therapy, and referrals as needed, as well as school-based counseling on alcohol and drugs including individual counseling, prevention and early intervention, substance abuse assessments, and relapse prevention. Public health prevention and outpatient services. The SHCs provide public health prevention and outpatient services through medical visits with providers and health education/outreach activities. Medical 65visits include sports physicals, disease screening, chronic disease management (e.g. obesity, diabetes, and asthma counseling), medicine management, and other primary care services. The SHCs also provide sexual/reproductive health services, and four SHCs offer dental services. Youth and community services. The SHCs conduct education and outreach activities to students, families, school staff, and community members. These activities range from health fairs and other school-wide events to workshops on parenting or healthy relationships. The SHCs also offer a wide range of nutrition and physical education activities including sports, tutoring, dance, arts, media, and gardening during lunch or after school. SHC services are available at no cost to clients, regardless of their insurance status, thus filling a gap for students who are uninsured or underinsured. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Measure A funds supported 14 SHCs in providing a continuum of health and wellness services at or near schools, including first aid, medical, and health education services; behavioral health services; dental health services; and referrals as needed. In addition, Measure A funds allowed SHCs to offer non-billable services such as youth development through peer health education programs and youth advisory boards.

The organization works to ensure this human right through quality service, advocacy, and community empowerment. Tiburcio Vasquez operates school health centers out of Logan High School in Union City and Tennyson High School in Hayward. Students are often referred to the school health centers because a teacher or counselor recognizes risk factors such as high rates of truancy, drug and alcohol use, or lack of social skills. After meeting with a trained Health Educator/Case Manager, the students are connected to additional services as needed, which may include health care services, referrals for mental health care, or placement in an after-school/alternatives to suspension program. Providing case management and youth leadership development services helps to ensure that youth receive comprehensive intervention and support. Specific programs offered through the school health centers include the following: Young Men & Women's Programs. These programs aim to foster leadership and empowerment in young men and women, specifically youth from disenfranchised communities. Deep discussions address racism, sexism, education inequality, and homophobia. These groups also explore topics Measure A Helps TIBURCIO VASqUE Z HE ALTH CENTER , INC. Coming to Tennyson High School after being expelled from his former school, Christopher struggled with poor school attendance, poor grades, misconduct, and defiance at school and at home. The Young Men's Program facilitator recruited Christopher into the program and connected him to the health center for health services, case management, and education. Christopher took a leadership role by contributing ideas for the curriculum and weekly activities and recruiting young men participants. Over time, his school attendance, grades, and behavior improved. Christopher is considering college and still works to recruit other men to the program and promote the health center services. 69around personal responsibility and professional development. After-School Youth Empowerment Programs. These programs include hip-hop dance, step dance, and a Youth Advisory group for the health centers. The Youth Advisory group serves as a forum for youth to give input into health center policy and function, and allows youth to actively promote health to the high school campus by developing school-wide \"health tips, \" hosting workshops, and organizing an annual health fair. In addition, the Hip-Hop Elements Program is a forum for any Logan student interested in creative expression through hip-hop. The program focuses on the art of being a Disc Jockey (DJ), Graffiti Art, Break Dancing, Master of Ceremony (MC)/Spoken Word, Poetry, and so on. The members create a safe space for any student to participate, learn, and teach new skills while developing the confidence to perform at various school and community events. CAF\u00c9 Parent Engagement Program. At CAF\u00c9 (Club de Aprendizaje Para Una Familia Estable), parents learn about nutrition and healthy cooking and about health effects like diabetes and high blood pressure. Parents also learn about breast cancer prevention and menopause. Health Education/Case Management/Family Planning. The school-based health centers provide one-on-one health education visits to youth. Students receive individual counseling regarding family planning education, pregnancy prevention options, and STI/HIV education. Students are given information on the benefits of delayed sexual activity, the importance of using condoms and/or birth control to prevent teen pregnancy, how to access the health center for sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, and additional free and confidential family planning services. In addition, through the case management services, every student referred is screened and provided with a needs assessment, to identify wraparound services and care. This case management ensures that no student goes unserved and that community agencies and partners maintain active case loads. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Tiburcio Vasquez used its Measure A funds to support its school health center case management and youth leadership development programs.

TCHC provides a wide spectrum of health education, health care, and social services to everyone, without regard to financial position, ethnicity, language, culture, sexual orientation, or any other criteria. TCHC is a fiscally responsible, independent, not-for-profit community health center and a key member of the community's health safety net. TCHC's HOPE mobile unit provides services to homeless patients who are unable to navigate regular clinic services. Having HOPE staff available to assist homeless patients increases the likelihood that patients obtain and stay on their medications, receive regular medical care, and avoid hospitalization. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y TCHC used its Measure A allocation to hire an MA/Registration clerk and a Benefits Coordinator for HOPE mobile unit patients. Both the MA and Benefits Coordinator screened HOPE clients to determine eligibility for programs such as HealthPAC, Medi-Cal, and Family PACT. HOPE staff helped patients obtain DMV cards, birth certificates, or other identification required for enrollment in a health benefit program. Staff also screened and counseled patients on chronic disease, specialty care referrals, medication management and prescriptions, flu shots, and blood draws for lab testing. TCHC also used its Measure A funding to purchase computer equipment for the HOPE mobile unit that enabled staff both to enroll clients in One-E-App and TCHC's practice management system as well as to verify patient enrollment in Medi-Cal or HealthPAC. HIGHLIGHTS During FY 11/12, TCHC provided 1,257 visits to 629 unduplicated clients. These included 276 HealthPAC visits, 219 Medi-Cal visits, 632 self-pay visits, and 131 other visits. The Committee notes that the 71HOPE mobile unit is a good example of a program that used Measure A funding to focus on serving one of its priority populations. In addition, TCHC leveraged its Measure A allocation to receive a total of $35,000 in matching funds: $5,000 from the City of Livermore Medical Activities and $30,000 from Boston Scientific Targeted Case Management.

HIGHLIGHTS Measure A funding enabled Urojas to provide medical and mental health services to 60 clients; medical services only to 30 clients; and medical and secondary care for mental health services to 10 clients with chronic mental illness. The progress of the client population improved both their medical and mental health services because they were able to do follow-up and return visits concerning their overall medical, mental, and physical health. Over the past 15 years, Urojas has achieved an 80% success rate for its clients. Measure A Helps UROJAS COMMUNITY SERVICES Brenda, a recipient of Urojas services, writes: Connecting with Urojas Community Services improved my life tremendously. Through the mental health assessment interview, I was identified as needing new mental health medications. Through the health and mental health screening the doctor advised me that the drugs I had been taking were too old and ineffective for my current condition. That information saved my life through follow-up appointments and medication adjustment. The clinical case manager who worked with me and the doctor identified me as having a manic depression disorder.

CONCERNS CPSC used its Measure A funding to implement a County ordinance promoting the safe disposal of medications for all residents. The Committee questions whether this meets the letter or spirit of the Measure A statute. CPSC used these funds as part of a public awareness campaign that was not limited to \"indigent, low-income, and uninsured adults, children, families, and seniors of Alameda County. \" While the Committee does not question the usefulness of the safe medication disposal ordinance, the use of Measure A funds for this purpose appears to fall outside the scope of the statute. In addition, the provider included no specific measurements or statistics to indicate the effectiveness of the public awareness campaign.

CEID's full-service audiology clinic is the \"go-to\" service for newborn hearing screenings, with Alameda County hospitals referring patients on a routine basis to CEID. CEID is a necessary and vital component of Alameda County's medical services infrastructure for County residents and, in particular, County children. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Measure A funding helped CEID to serve Alameda County residents through hearing screenings for newborns 79and Head Start students, audiological evaluations, and fitting/providing ear molds and hearing aids. The funding also enabled CEID to provide specialized training for pediatric residents from Alameda County hospitals including Children's Hospital Oakland and Kaiser. Services were available five days per week by appointment and through referrals from medical providers. Without the availability of CEID's audiological services, many of these children could have gone undiagnosed and without proper hearing devices. HIGHLIGHTS Thanks in part to its Measure A allocation, CEID provided the following services in FY 11/12: 135 ne wborn he aring s creenings 393 a udiological e valuations 230 e ar mold s and he aring aid s 122 H ead S tart he aring s creenings 78 p ediatric r esidents traine d In addition, CEID leveraged its Measure A allocation to generate $33,800 in matching funds from Medi-Cal Administrative Activities (MAA).Measure A Helps CENTER FOR EARLY INTERVENTION ON DEAFNESS A young family arrived at CEID for a newborn hearing screening for their one-week-old baby boy. The Coordinator explained the entire process about to take place. In the Audiology Clinic, the screener placed small earphones and three electrodes on the baby, and connected them to the Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) machine. The test sends clicks through the earphones, and the machine records electrical activity in the baby's hearing nerve. Based on these measurements, the baby passed the test and was shown to have normal hearing in both ears. The family also received clear instructions about how to continue measuring their child's hearing development.80CITY OF SAN LEANDRO SENIOR SERVICES FY 0 FY 11/12 savings transferred to reserve: 0 types of services pr ovided: Public Health Individuals served: SeniorsMeasure A Leandro, San AGENCY /PR OGRAM BACkGROUND The City of San Leandro offers a wide range of activities, services, and resources for seniors. Programs are designed to foster healthy independent living, enhance quality of life, and build a sense of belonging and community among older adults, caregivers, and families. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Measure A funding supported the City of San Leandro in offering programs, services, and education aimed at prevention and improving health outcomes. Although the city's Senior Community Center has been thriving since opening in April, it has been a challenge to operate the facility and grow programs with limited staff. The additional part-time staff provided by the Measure A grant allowed the Recreation and Human Services Department to maintain quality senior services, grow programs, and continue to offer critical health and wellness services to San Leandro seniors. By helping maintain required staffing levels, Measure A funds supported the following services, community education presentations, and exercise programs for the senior population.

Through its 9-acre urban agriculture Deep Farms and Produce (DDF&P) program, DSAL provides job opportunities for ex-offenders living in and around the Ashland and Cherryland communities, a population estimated at around 8,000. These individuals are in turn growing and selling fresh, healthy produce to members of their community who suffer from significant health disparities. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y DSAL used its Measure A funds in support of the DDF&P program. Specifically, these funds helped cover the costs of production, including the personnel required to grow, harvest, pack, and deliver the fresh food boxes; personnel time to market and enroll customers for the food boxes; and the purchase of organic vegetables from the DDF&P supplier when DDF&P needed supplementation from other local organic farms. HIGHLIGHTS Measure A funds supported the employment of 11 local at-risk young adults as urban farmers for DDF&P . In addition, the funds covered the costs of production for 150 boxes of fresh produce that were distributed to residents of Ashland and Cherryland over a one-month period in November 2011. Beyond these accomplishments, DSAL used its Measure A allocation to leverage $60,000 from the Kresge Foundation; $60,000 from the Department of Agriculture; and $200,000 from a Community Development Block Grant.83CONCERNS The Committee notes that Measure A funds represented only 2% of the agency's total budget. This raises the some Committee members' ongoing concern that the Board might consider focusing on larger allocations that have a more significant impact on the recipient's budget.

The scope of work under its Measure A allocation focused on providing technical assistance, assistance with planning, and restructuring to enable the Ashland Cherryland Violence Prevention Collaborative (ACVPC) to become more effective in building healthy communities. ACVPC is a coalition of more than 30 organizations that provide public health, health care, mental health, criminal justice, social service, and education services to residents in the unincorporated Ashland and Cherryland communities. Hill & Company played a major role in providing organization development leadership to ACVPC members that provide services in mental health, alcohol and drug programs, inpatient and outpatient hospital services, and youth and community services.

HEPPAC strives to reduce the impact of harm by addressing external barriers and increasing access to basic needs services. HEPPAC's scope of services meets the Measure A funding criteria by providing emergency medical services to indigent, uninsured adults in Alameda County through abscess/wound care. HEPPAC is able to save Alameda County funds by relieving the Alameda County Health System emergency department from providing abscess/wound care services to people who inject drugs. HEPPAC's sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment services for youth and young adults, primarily in East Oakland, is conducted at our Casa Segura Drop-in Center. This service meets the Measure A funding criteria of providing outpatient public health services to low-income youth residents of Alameda County. MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y Measure A funding assisted HEPPAC in providing services to increased-risk populations in Oakland, including youth and young adults, people who inject drugs who are homeless, residents who have low to no existing income, and residents who are at least 45 years of age.

MEASURE A FUNDING SUMMAR Y SOI used its Measure A funding to procure and install a technology infrastructure (network, computers, cameras, and other audio/visual equipment) that allows remote observation of children in therapy or classroom settings. This system allows physicians, clinicians, and families to view treatment, therapy, and other activities without needing to be in the room. Through these observations, clinicians and physicians assess the children 96and help define treatment plans, and families can watch and learn therapeutic techniques to apply at home. Parents who are unable to leave work can use this infrastructure to watch a therapist in action with their child while still at the office. Physicians or other clinicians who need to observe their patients can do so from the privacy of their office, saving time and money. This infrastructure also allows SOI to reach beyond the local community and offer much-needed services to clients outside of the Bay Area. When not being used for remote observation services, therapists and teachers have leveraged this technology for therapeutic and educational purposes. In therapy sessions, children use specialized applications that help in the treatment of speech-language and developmental disorders. Teachers and students also use the computers and audio/visual equipment for classroom activities and projects. HIGHLIGHTS During FY 11/12, the equipment provided by Measure A facilitated a total of 17,508 pediatric educational and therapy sessions. These included 9,114 individual therapy services addressing childhood developmental delays and disabilities, as well as 8,394 group therapy and inclusion educational opportunities.
