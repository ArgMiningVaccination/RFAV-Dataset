Here's a little back story. For over a decade I've been suffering from sinus problems that don't seem to be caused by allergies (non-allergic rhinitis). Due to my expat lifestyle, I've seen experts all of the world and had MRIs, acupuncture, homeopathic remedies, lymphatic drainage, medications and more. I also could not breathe through my nose for the entire nine months of pregnancy. At our January, I attended an event at [Place360](http://www.place360healthspa.com) where part of my wellness program included a consultation with a homeopath, Willow Tipton. She's lovely, and we had a fantastic conversation. I exited the appointment with my bag of remedies, not expecting them to work. I took my remedies and then forgot for a few weeks. My symptoms peak when it rains, so bad weather prompted me to take them again. I woke up without the usual post rain sinus headache. A few days later, as I'm prone to doing, I forgot to refill my sinus prescription on time. I took the remedy, sans nasal sprays, and woke up fine. I felt brave and went without medicine for the next few days. I'm now free of the prescription medication that I've been taking for over ten years. I take 3 of these little pills called Nux Vomica. Willow says it's good for, \"Stress, tension and sinus issues, like rhinitis - with congestion, sometimes headaches or pressure headaches, especially if medications have been used and if the congestion affects sleep. Now, keep in mind homeopathy is very individualized, so the remedy I chose for you is very specific to your total symptom picture.\" You put the little pellets under your tongue and let them dissolve. I never understood why under the tongue, until I asked Willow. She said, \"One of the easiest and fastest ways to get the benefits of your homeopathic medicines is to take it sublingually - so that your salivary glands pick it up, much less invasive than injecting it and easier and quicker than going through normal digestion. Which makes the remedies easier and gentler on your stomach, intestines, liver, and kidneys and also much quicker and than waiting for the medicine to make it through all those systems.\" They taste like little mini candies. The bottom line is that they work for me, but you need someone experienced enough to diagnose your symptoms and prescribe the appropriate remedy. If you live in the [San Diego](https://lajollamom.com/san-diego/) area, see Willow at Place360. If not, find a good homeopath near you. More About Place360 I will also tell you that my coaching session with Kim served as a reminder to check in with myself. Or at least that's what I took away from it. If I'm feeling down, I need to think about one thing in my power to improve my mood. Tracy also gave me one of the best massages ever, which reminds me, I need to schedule an appointment with her. Place360 is a wellness center that incorporates Eastern and Western philosophies. The 360 part of their name is relevant because they can help your entire well being from mental to the physical.
