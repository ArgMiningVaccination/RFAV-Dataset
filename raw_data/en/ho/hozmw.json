If you had told me 102 days ago that I would be where I am now, I would not have believed a bit of it. I was terrified at first. However, I am so glad I chose this path. Coming to California from East Texas was the best decision of my life. I love y'all with my whole heart because you taught me how to love myself again.\" -Katherine [\"Solution-based treatment and detox is a wonderful facility! They helped me commit to my recovery. My first contact was with Ryan in 2018. And I still speak with him to this day! Everyone I met at the facility was so nice. The staff made a huge difference in my recovery. I recommend this rehab center to anyone who wants to get sober.\" ](https://sbtdstg.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/5-Stars-.png) -Lauren Detox & Addiction Treatment Programs Managing withdrawal without help is nearly impossible, but our medical team can help. Detox isn't a walk in the park. However, we are committed to making it manageable. A safe transition into residential treatment starts in detox. We offer the best rehab experience because we value honesty, human connection, progress, and mindfulness. Research shows that having meaningful programs improves treatment results. Thus, we encourage our patients to participate in many programs. For example, a few of these include Rock to Recovery and faith-based treatment. Dual Diagnosis Treatment Our inpatient and [outpatient treatment](/addiction-treatment-programs/intensive-outpatient-program/) programs provide individual and group therapy. Still, some of our patients require additional dual diagnosis treatment. If you are struggling with depression, anxiety, or other mental health concerns, our team can help. There is no reason to detox on your own. Our medical team makes your safety our top priority. Our home becomes yours. Daily group and individual therapy sessions encourage healing, mindfulness, and community. Get help for mental health issues and addiction from the people who understand them best. Some clients benefit from transitioning to an FDA-approved opioid with fewer side-effects. There is no reason to detox on your own. Our medical team makes your safety our top priority.
