Population immunity of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection or of COVID-19 vaccination are defined, respectively, as the overall protection against reinfection or against breakthrough infection at a given point in time in a given population. Methods We estimated these population immunities in Qatar's population between July 1, 2020 and November 30, 2022, to discern generic features of the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. Effectiveness of previous infection, mRNA primary-series vaccination, and mRNA booster (third-dose) vaccination in preventing infection were estimated, month by month, using matched, test-negative, case-control studies. Findings Previous-infection effectiveness against reinfection was strong before emergence of Omicron, but declined with time after a wave and rebounded after a new wave. Effectiveness dropped immediately after Omicron emergence from 88.3% (95% CI: 84.8-91.0%) in November 2021 to 51.0% (95% CI: 48.3-53.6%) in December 2021. Primary-series effectiveness against infection was 84.0% (95% CI: 83.0-85.0%) in April 2021, soon after introduction of vaccination, before waning gradually to 52.7% (95% CI: 46.5-58.2%) by November of 2021. Effectiveness declined linearly by 1 percentage point every 5 days. After Omicron emergence, effectiveness dropped suddenly from 52.7% (95% CI: 46.5-58.2%) in November 2021 to negligible levels in December 2021. Booster effectiveness dropped immediately after Omicron emergence from 83.0% (95% CI: 65.6 -91.6%) in November 2021 to 32.9% (95% CI: 26.7-38.5%) in December 2021, and continued to decline thereafter. Effectiveness of previous infection and vaccination against severe, critical, or fatal COVID-19 were generally >80% throughout the study duration. Interpretation High population immunity may not be sustained beyond a year. This creates fertile grounds for repeated waves of infection to occur, but these waves may increasingly exhibit a benign pattern of infection.

Evidence before this study SARS-CoV-2 infection induces protection against reinfection, but this protection wanes with time since last infection. Similarly, COVID-19 primary-series and booster vaccination induce protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, but this protection also wanes with time since last dose. These immunity patterns demonstrate the need for the concept of population immunity to track evolution of overall immune protection over time in a given population. Previous-infection and vaccine population immunities in a specific country can be defined as the overall protection against infection at a given point in time in the full national population. A search of PubMed, Google Scholar, and the International Vaccine Access Center's VIEW-hub databases up to April 21, 2023 using the keywords \"vaccination\", \"infection\", \"immunity\", \"protection\", \"SARS-CoV-2\", and \"COVID-19\" did not identify studies that investigated this epidemiological concept for a national population throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Added value of this study This study analyzed the national federated databases for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination in Qatar, a country that experienced SARS-CoV-2 waves dominated by different pre-Omicron variants and Omicron subvariants. Using a matched, test-negative study design, population immunity against infection of each of previous infection, primary-series vaccination, and booster vaccination were characterized at the national level month by month for two calendar years to discern generic features of the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. The three forms of population immunity showed rapid variation over time driven by waning of protection. Vaccine-derived population immunity declined by 1 absolute percentage point every 5 days. Omicron introduction immensely reduced the three forms of population immunity within one month by about 50 absolute percentage points. Meanwhile, previous-infection and vaccine population immunities against severe COVID-19 were durable with slow waning even after Omicron emergence. Implications of all available evidence Both previous-infection and vaccine population immunities vary rapidly at a national level creating fertile grounds for repeated waves of infection to occur even within months of each other. High levels of population immunity may not be sustained for more than a year or so. Preventing infection/reinfection, transmission, or future waves of infection cannot sustainably be done with current vaccines nor by the entire population being infected. Timely administration of boosters for those vulnerable to severe COVID-19 may remain essential for years to come. Repeated waves of infection may also facilitate further evolution of the virus and continual immune evasion. Emergence of a new variant that is substantially different from circulating variants can suddenly and immensely reduce population immunity leading to large epidemic waves. However, the durability of population immunity against severe COVID-19 will likely curtail the severity of future waves. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest. ### Funding Statement The authors are grateful for institutional salary support from the Biomedical Research Program and the Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Biomathematics Research Core, both at Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar, as well as for institutional salary support provided by the Ministry of Public Health, Hamad Medical Corporation, and Sidra Medicine.
