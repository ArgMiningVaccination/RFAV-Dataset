It is important to speak with a doctor before beginning any alternative treatments. Arthritis is a general term that describes a family of medical conditions that have the symptoms of joint inflammation, pain, and stiffness. As well as natural remedies, medical treatments, regular exercise, and proper [nutrition](/articles/160774.php) can also help people manage their [arthritis](/articles/7621.php) symptoms. According to the [Arthritis Foundation](https://www.arthritis.org/about-arthritis/understanding-arthritis/what-is-arthritis.php), the condition affects over 50 million adults and 300,000 children in the United States. Natural remedies, such as herbs and supplements, may be safe, effective treatment options with few significant side effects. However, there is limited research in the field of natural remedies. Scientific studies often use animal models or cell lines to test plant compounds. Very few clinical trials involving natural remedies exist. The existing research shows promising results, and further research will reveal even more vital information for the medical community. Continue reading this article to discover the nine best herbs for arthritis. The seeds of the Borago officinalis plant, or starflower, contain (GLA). Borage seed oil also contains linolenic acid, which the body converts to GLA. GLA helps maintain the cell structure and healthy functioning of joints. The body also converts GLA into prostaglandins, which act like hormones to support the immune system. GLA helps stop joint inflammation and may also prevent some of the body's inflammatory responses. According to [2017 research](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5408004/) [Learn more about using borage seed oil for rheumatoid arthritis here.](/articles/borage-seed-oil-rheumatoid-arthritis) [Turmeric](/articles/306981) is a yellow spice and medicinal herb that originated in India. The orange pulp inside the stem contains the potent plant compound curcumin. One [2018 article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6073415/) [inflammation](/articles/248423.php) from RA. This may be due to curcumin reducing pro-inflammatory cells and increasing cells that help to regulate inflammation. However, the body cannot absorb large quantities of curcumin, which may limit its use as a therapy for [joint pain](/articles/joint-pain). According to a [2018 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0955286317309026?via%3Dihub), the compound piperine, found in black pepper, can also help reduce inflammation and improve curcumin absorption. [Learn more about using Uncaria tomentosa, or \"cat's claw,\" is a vine plant native to South and Central America. A [2020 study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78075-x?crsi=662497590&cicada_org_src=healthwebmagazine.com&cicada_org_mdm=direct) [hip osteoarthritis](/articles/327023). The researchers concluded that they require further evidence from future studies to support these findings. A [2019 study](http://www.informaticsjournals.com/index.php/jnr/article/view/22867) found that although U. tomentosa is probably safe, it does not have anti-inflammatory properties. Cat's claw appears safe when a person takes it in small quantities. However, the [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health ](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/catclaw) According to a [2021 study](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/21/9818/pdf), the oil from [eucalyptus](/articles/266580) leaves has antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. The flavonoids in eucalyptus leaves also have [antioxidant](/articles/301506.php) properties that can help to protect against oxidative stress. A [2016 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5416627/) People can purchase eucalyptus extract as an essential oil in many stores. They can add it to a warm bath or inhale it. A person may need to take care when using this herb as it can cause an allergic reaction in some people. A person should not ingest essential oils orally. Boswellia serrata, or [frankincense](/articles/326599), is the resin from the bark of the boswellia tree. This resin has a strong aromatic quality, making it a popular ingredient in perfumes, incense, and essential oils. Frankincense may also offer benefits for people with chronic inflammation. According to the [Arthritis Foundation](https://www.arthritis.org/living-with-arthritis/treatments/natural/supplements-herbs/guide/indian-frankincense.php), the active compounds in frankincense possess anti-inflammatory properties that could help relieve arthritis symptoms. A [2016 review article](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-41334-1_13) of several small-scale clinical trials found evidence to support the use of frankincense and other Boswellian resin products for managing arthritis symptoms. The authors state that although frankincense is not a cure for arthritis, 60-70% of people saw significant improvements in their symptoms when using it. [Aloe vera](/articles/318591) is a succulent plant popular for its health benefits. According to a [2018 review article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6163315/) The compounds in aloe vera produce anti-inflammatory effects similar to those of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The research also shows that compounds in aloe vera help remove free radicals from the body, much like antioxidants. These antioxidant functions also help reduce inflammation by preventing the production of inflammatory enzymes. A person may use the sticky \"gel\" found inside aloe vera leaves topically, where they apply it directly to the skin. People can also ingest aloe vera orally by taking supplements or drinking aloe vera juice. According to a [2020 review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229920307068), [cinnamon](/articles/266069) has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The review found that cinnamon supplementation significantly impacted inflammation and oxidative stress biomarkers. This means that supplementing with cinnamon may help reduce inflammation and oxidative stress levels, which can positively impact joint pain. A small-scale [2018 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29722610/) Thunder god vine is a plant common in southeast China. According to the [NCCIH](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/thunder-god-vine) The combination of thunder god vine and medical treatments may be as effective or more effective than medical treatment alone in improving joint tenderness and swelling symptoms. However, the NCCIH advises that thunder god vine may have side effects, some of which can be [serious](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/thunder-god-vine) A person should speak with a medical professional or licensed [naturopathic physician](/articles/naturopathy#seeing-a-naturopath). Naturopathy combines modern treatment with traditional methods. According to a [2019 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378111919301313?via%3Dihub), inflammation and oxidative stress have close links with the pain and severity of joint conditions such as RA. [Ginger](/articles/265990) contains anti-inflammatory compounds and is a traditional remedy for easing pain and stiffness in people with osteoarthritis. The study found that ginger may alter gene expression and reduce symptoms of RA. There are many different ways that people can use herbs for joint pain. According to the [Arthritis Foundation](https://www.arthritis.org/health-wellness/treatment/complementary-therapies/supplements-and-vitamins/5-ways-to-take-herbs-and-supplements-for-arthritis), people can use herbs in the following forms: Capsules or pills People can take herbal supplements orally by using capsules or pills. Herbal remedies in this form may also have more accurate dosage information, including the dosage of active ingredients in the supplement. Herbal capsules are available to buy in health food stores or pharmacies. People who cannot swallow pills and capsules can try herbal supplement sachets, which can dissolve in liquids, as an alternative. Teas or infusions A person can pour boiling water onto herbal teabags or loose dried herbs to create a tea to drink. People can leave the tea to steep for around 15-20 minutes before drinking or follow the product instructions. People may want to consult a medical professional or herbalist to determine the correct dosage if using loose herbs.

To help increase the absorption of turmeric, a person may cook it with fat such as olive oil. Although including herbs in cooking can have health benefits and add to the taste of dishes, people are unlikely to get enough of the active ingredients to make a significant difference to joint pain through this form. It is much safer to use herbs under the guidance of a licensed healthcare practitioner whose scope of practice includes herbal medicine.
