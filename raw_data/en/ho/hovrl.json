Not everyone can tolerate these medicines, and some of their side effects include ulcers, bleeding of the stomach, heartburn, rash, and hepatitis. Additionally, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) has recently issued health advisories on several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications that are known to increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes and many parents prefer to avoid them altogether. Depending on the injury, your child may also be given crutches, a splint, and a cast. In general, young children are amazingly resilient and often impervious to minor injuries. However, as your child moves into adolescence, she may experience and complain about more various symptoms following an accident or injury, such as stiffness, sore muscles, and pain. Chronic or persistent injuries are a danger in adolescence, so be sure that your busy teenager properly rests and recuperates following a trauma. Homeopathic Medicines Homeopathic remedies can be used following an accident to minimize injury and speed the healing process, and are effective both before an accident (as preventative medicine) and following, working months and even years after the initial injury. Chiropractic, osteopathy, physical therapy, massage and other hands-on treatments also offer a significant amount of relief, especially for adolescents and adults who may not bounce back as quickly as a child. [Aconitum napellus](index.php?page=shop&action=browseProducts&categoryID=3) is useful for the feeling of anxiety and panic resulting from an accident or from frightening or shocking events. This child is nervous, agitated, and can't sit still. Aconite can be used during an S.O.S. (emergency), which is why I keep Aconite 30C in my purse along with Arnica. [Arnica montana](index.php?page=shop&action=browseProducts&categoryID=3) is the first medicine to think of for all trauma and injuries. Arnica is indicated for bruises, swelling, muscle soreness, sprains and strains, falls and blows, overexertion from lifting, or everyday activities such as biking, sports or skateboarding. In addition, Arnica helps reduce after-surgery swelling, and may be administered following dental procedures and surgery. I keep Arnica 30C in my purse, because you never know when someone will need it. And it is not always the kids! In addition to the pellets taken by mouth, Arnica can be used simultaneously as a rub over the injury. Arnica is available as a cream, gel, ointment, and oil. Do not use Arnica on open wounds. [Bellis perennis](index.php?page=shop&action=browseProducts&categoryID=3) is used for trauma similarly to Arnica. Both alleviate soreness, swelling, and bruising in cases where the injury feels better with movement and rubbing. Bellis is also particularly indicated for deep tissue injuries following surgery, or bruising after having blood taken. If Arnica is not providing relief for bruising, give Bellis. [Bryonia alba](index.php?page=shop&action=browseProducts&categoryID=3) is useful for sprains, dislocations, injuries to tendons, and fractured ribs. The pain feels worse from the slightest movement, including being jarred or bumped, and also grows worse with cold. The injured child feels better keeping still and when pressure is applied to the area. Bryonia keynotes also include irritability, desire to be alone, and dry mouth. [Calendula officinalis](index.php?page=shop&action=browseProducts&categoryID=3) is a remarkable healing agent recommended for open wounds, scrapes, minor burns, and sunburns. Calendula can be used as a cream, gel, tincture, spray, and ointment. [Hypericum perforatum](index.php?page=shop&action=browseProducts&categoryID=3) is excellent for injury to nerves, especially in the neck, back, fingers, toes, nails, and brain. The characteristic pains are shooting and sharp, and the injury is very sensitive to the touch. Hypericum is also indicated for puncture wounds (including at the site of an injection). For severe back injuries, I often begin with Hypericum, alternating with Arnica. [Ledum palustre](index.php?page=shop&action=browseProducts&categoryID=3) is the primary remedy for puncture wounds (e.g., stepping on a rusty nail), as well as for insect bites and stings. The person feels better from ice cold applications. Often, the wound appears purplish and swollen, which also makes this a good remedy for a black eye. I like to use Ledum before any procedure that requires an injection\u00e2\u20ac\"for example, amniocentesis, epidural, vaccination, or needle biopsy (i.e. liver, breast). [Rhus toxicodendron](index.php?page=shop&action=browseProducts&categoryID=3) works well for injuries associated with stiffness that feel better with movement. Often the child is fidgety, and improves with heat therapy, such as taking a hot bath. Rhus is a good remedy for sprains, tendonitis, whiplash, and ligament injuries. [Ruta graveolens](index.php?page=shop&action=browseProducts&categoryID=3) is used for injuries and bruises to flexor tendons and the periosteum (the covering of the bone), and is also indicated in the overuse of tendons (including tennis elbow), sprained ankle, bursitis, and nodular growths in the wrists. There may also be weakness and stiffness. Ruta works well after Arnica. [Symphytum officinale](index.php?page=shop&action=browseProducts&categoryID=3), known as knitbone, is used to speed the healing of broken bones and bone bruises. For fractures, use after the bone has been set or is in a cast. Symphytum is also good for injuries to the eye, along with Arnica. Bach Flower Remedies Rescue Remedy contains five flower essences useful for emergencies and crises following an accident. Place 2 drops in a glass of water and sip as needed. "}
