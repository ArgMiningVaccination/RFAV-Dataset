Problem Statement : Inconsistent HPV Vaccination rates in our primary care patients ranging ages 12-26 years. Primary care patients do not complete their series. Gap: In December 2017 approximately 10/51 (20%) of PCP patient due for HPV vaccine during visit actually received a HPV vaccine. Gap: Prior to initiating this project, 20% of PCP patients due for HPV vaccine during a visit received the HPV vaccine. Effect on Patient Care as it relates to True North: CDC recommends to provide all patients starting at age 9-11 years with the HPV vaccine series to decrease risk of HPV infection leading to HPV-related genital warts, cervical cancer, penile cancer, and head and neck cancers. Target: Increase HPV vaccine administration to eligible primary care patients from 20% (as of December 2017) to 30% each month by June 2019.Next Steps:Ongoing monthly report utilization to track HPV doses provided to primary care patients. Determining ability track in ApEX if patients require a 2 dose v s 3 dose series at each encounter Dissemination: Utilization of ApEx report created for this initiative in other primary care clinic settings in which HPV vaccines are provided Lessons Learned: Challenges remain surrounding misinformation of the HPV vaccine , ability to easily track in ApEX the age in which HPV vaccine was initiated, and difficulty in obtai ning complete vaccine records Despite these barriers, our team structure allowed us to have a n open dialogue leading to increased vaccine series completion and improvement in patient health out comes. Monthly HPV Vaccination Tracking Initiative Barriers: Trainees (medical students, residents, fellows, and nurse pract itioners) rotating monthly Incomplete historical vaccine records available for review with in ApEX and CA Immunization Registry Lack of clarity on how to administer HPV Vaccination Recommenda tions due to change in recommendations: Prior to 2017 HPV Schedule Dose Recommendations: dosed at 0, 1- 2 months, and 6 months for 3 dose series regardless of age. Recommendations as of 2017: Recommendations are dependent upon age at first vaccine. If first vaccine prior to 15thbirthday may receive only 2 doses at 0 and 6 months. If first vaccine after 15thbirthday 3-dose vaccination schedule recommended. Initiatives: Monthly Evaluation of PCP HPV Vaccination Rates: Create new ApEX Reports generating monthly information on PCP pa tient's seen during the month, HPV vaccine doses documented, ag e at vaccination, and time betw een doses (in days) Nurses and MAs review vaccination records and place pended vacc ine orders in visit encounter Create Vaccine Record specific Release of Information documents to better obtain prior vaccine records at previous PCPs Target goal of 30% r eached in February 2019 Percentage of patients eligible for a vaccine whop received a vaccine increased over time From 2017 to 2018, noted increase in overall number of PCP patients completing 2 or 3 doses with 88.6% ever receiving at least a single doseFactors Contributing to Administration of Non-BL Antibiotics in Patients with Reported BLA Planned Areas for Intervention : UCSF Resident and Clinical Fellow Quality Improvement Incentive Program in partnership with the 2019 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Implementation of a Fellow-Driven Beta-Lactam Allergy De-Labeling Initiative at UCSF Jennifer S. Mulliken, Karen Anstey*, Rachel Bystritsky, Iris Otani, & Sarah B. Doernberg Infectious Diseases & Allergy/Immunology Fellowship Programs * Co-first authors * Co - first authorsBackground Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Approximately 10% of pati ents in the US report a penicillin (PCN) allergy, but more than 90% can safely receive beta-lact am (BL) antibiotics. Having a reported BL alle rgy (BLA) is associated with increased length of stay, cost of care, and mortality. The administration of non-BL antibiotics for conditions that are prefer entially treated with BLs promotes the development of antibiotic resistance and leads to adverse events. PROBLEM STATEMENT : Most patients with BLA are not PCN allergic, which leads to inappropriate use of non-BL antibiotics and an increase d risk of associated adverse events. Our current system for evaluating and removing BLA is ineffective. Among patients with BLA seen by the Infectious Diseases (ID) consult service between July 1, 2018 and June 30 th2019, we sought to achieve 70% compliance with regards to BLA de- labeling. Composite Numerator (any one of the following) 1. Patient received BL during hospitalization 2. Inpatient Allergy consult placed in Apex3. Outpatient Allergy referral placed in Apex4. BLA present on day of initial ID consultation, absent on day of hospital discharge Denominator : All patients seen by the ID consult service with a BLA listed in the medical recordNext Steps:The Adult Inpatient BLA Guidelin e and Test Dose Order set was l aunched on May 8, 2019. In the context of ongoing protocol-driven evaluation of BLA by the ID consult ser vice, we anticipate this formal guideline will accelerate our progress with regards to inpatient BLA de-labeli ng. Dissemination: Based on the success of this project, investigators from Pediat ric ID and Pediatric Allergy/Immunology plan to implement a similar BLA de-labeling protocol this upcoming year at UCSF Mission Bay. Lessons Learned: Collaboration between Divisions leads to more impactful and sus tainable outcomes. The implementation of a BLA de-labeling initiative is an effective way to empower train ees to incorporate BLA de-labeling into their practice.Patient with BLA admitted to the hospital with infectionBL antibiotic is indicated, but patient receives non-BL antibioticIncreased risk of drug- resistant organisms, C. diff infection, longer length of stay, and higher medical costsDevelopment of a protocol-driven approach to BLA evaluation by ID consult serviceDevelopment of an Adult Inpatient BLA Gu ideline and Test Dose Order Set at UCSF Average Compliance Quarter 1 - Quarter 3 = 81% (p=0.003) Goals: Direct goal : Increase use of the delirium risk PACU orderset in patients at high risk of POD Indirect goal: Improve perioperative patient care practices for patients at high risk of delirium through education and awareness to ultimately decrease the incidence of POD. Baseline compliance for Delirium Prevention PACU order-set : 3-23% Goal Compliance: annual cumulative 50% Next Steps: Continue nursing, anesthesia, and surgery education on best pra ctice delirium reduction practices Measure reduction in use of Beers list medications Quantifying changes to incidence of postoperative delirium Continue to measure and report compliance with the Delirium Ris k PACU orderset Improve predictive ability of AWOL-S or other delirium risk scr eening tools Dissemination: Collaboration with other institutions and national patient safe ty organizations to implement similar perioperative initiatives is in progress Increased adherence to guidelines can be achieved by implementi ng EMR-based reminders and checklists Lessons Learned: Despite strong efforts to improve compliance via pages, e-mails , and departmental education, implementing a checklist reminder in the EMR ultimately improved compliance the mostPost-operative delirium (POD) Occurs in up to 50% of surgical patients Is preventable in many cases Important because POD is associated with: Short term patient morbidity: falls, prolonged hospitalizations, increased rate of discharge to institutions Long term patient morbidity: functional decline, cognitive decline, and mortality Increased economic burden Evidence based guidelines exist to prevent, manage, and treat delirium Between 2016-2019, several interventions intended to decrease POD in high-risk surgical patients have been introduced in the perioperative setting. One of these is a delirium risk PACU order-set, which removes delirium-inducing medications and adds a non-pharmacologic nursing intervention to the standard PACU order-set. After order-set implementation in 2017, use of the order-set in appropriate patients was low, with baseline compliance around 15-20%. PROBLEM STATEMENT : The delirium risk PACU order-set, which is designed to reduce exposure to potentially deliriogenicconditions, is not efficiently utilized. This could potentially contribute to increased patient morbidity and mortality, as well as higher patient care costs. Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Primary Outcome Frequency of delirium risk PACU order-set use in high risk patients Inclusion CriteriaAge >/= 18 years old Elective surgery with planned hospital admission Interventions to improve complianceDepartmental education at conferences Reminders: pages, e-mails EMR enhancements li li f D li i Figure 1. Compliance trends over time. Baseline compliance was <25% for the Delirium Risk PACU order-set for patients at high risk for delirium. In November 2018, an intraoperative reminder to complete the delirium risk PACU order-set in high-risk patients wa s implemented as a part of a new best practice advisory checklist in the intraoperative record. This measure significantly improved our compli ance and project sustainability. Figure 2. Anesthesia Caution Banner. At the launch of the project we created an alert banner, which displayed this orange banner at the top of Epic screen, alerting prov iders that a patient is high risk for delirium. Utilizing an alert banner as a reminder for anesthesia providers improved compliance, but the rate remained below our goal.Figure 3. Best Practice Advisories Checklist. Depiction of the AWOL-S orders as a check-list item on the Best Practice Advisories checklist. This was implemented in November 2018 and remains active as a reminder to providers throughout the intraoperative period.

Robinowitz Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Care UCSF Resident and Clinical Fellow Quality Improvement Incentive Program in partnership with the 2019 UCSF Health Improvement SymposiumAim 1 : RN satisfaction with the CCU team delivery of care as measured by surveys quarterly will reach a target goal of < 40% dissatisfaction from 60% dissatisfied or very dissatisfied. This goal will be achieved and sustained through 2019. Aim 2 : Communication satisfaction among the nursing staff will improve such that > 50% of the nursing staff are somewhat satisfied or very satisfied with the communication between cardiology and the RN staff as measured by nursing staff surveys. Next Steps: Implementation and adoption has been variable. Adoption of this rounding system into the 2019-20 academic year where there will be a dedicated CCU fellow, attending and team. Dissemination: We will be including this rounding structure in a more formally closed cardiac intensive care system where there will only be a single CCU attending and team . This type of rounding structure can easily be adopted by other divisions utilizing the shared ICC. Lessons Learned: Implementation of a structure change can be difficult with many players, moving pieces and a changing cardiology fellowship structure. Volume of patients in the 10 ICC led to slower uptake and a cha nge in fellowship structure took fellows from ICU rounding role. The 10 intensive cardiac care (ICC) is used by several teams including cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery and advanced heart failure. The rounding structure for general cardiology lacks consistent MD-RN integration. As a result communication between the cardiology teams and RNs is deficient. 2018 survey data of RN staff: 60% somewhat or very dissatisfied with current delivery of care in CCU. 46% felt dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with communication. Represented gap in the UCSF \"our people\" or work environment True North pillar. Communication not only essential to work environment, but when lacking is felt to contribute to both to poor patient outcomes & poor patient experience.

Residents play a large role in this, writing the majority of discharge prescriptions at our institution. Education on post-operative analgesia was often ad-hoc, peer-to-peer. Non-opioid pain medications are powerful tools for improving post operative pain and reducing opioid use. On discharge following common general surgery operations:25% of patients received acetaminophen Rx 5% of patients received ibuprofen Rx On average, patients received twice the # of opioid pills recommended by prior studies PROBLEM STATEMENT : For common general surgery operations at UCSF, providers are routinely over-prescribing opioid pain medications and underutilizing non-opioid adjuncts. Establish non opioid analgesia as the first line approach for common general surgery operations with >60% of patients prescribed acetaminophen and methods for sustainabilit y (reliable feedback mechanism s, regular educational refreshers, education planning for incoming residents) \u0083Expand to additional surgery services (colorectal surgery, vasc ular surgery) Dissemination: \u0083Tailored program at Surgical Education Week Lessons Learned: \u0083Sustainability requires persistent monitoring and re-evaluation \u0083Support from leadership is critical Problem Identification Targeted Needs Assessment Goals and Objectives Educational Strategies Implementation Evaluation and Feedback Needs Assessment: \u0083Resident-led transdisciplinary rates from 25% pre-intervention to 74% in quarter 3 \u0083Ibuprofen prescription rates increased from 5% pre-intervention to 51% in quarter 3 Opioid Discharge Prescriptions: \u0083Reached goal opioid prescription quantities in quarter 2 for all included operations \u0083Increase in opioid prescription quantities in quarter 3 for EUA, inguinal hernia, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy1.

Slow return to bowel function has a significant impact on patient comfort, satisfaction, and length of hospital stay. (https://www.sciencedire ct.com/science/articl e/pii/S02615614 15000382) The rate of postoperative ileus antagonist (PAMORA) that is FDA approved for accelerating time to upper and lower gastrointestinal recovery following surgeries including partial bowel resection with primary anastomosis. For proper indicated use, it must be given preoperatively and is continued postoperatively for up to 7 days. The issue : Approximately 30-40% of our patients undergo bowel surgery at the time of their cancer surgery, however these cases are not always anticipated preoperatively. As such, we are missing a portion of patients who undergo bowel resection at the time of surgery who might benefit from alvimopan. The target: We wanted to improve the use of alvimopan for ovarian cancer patients with anticipated bowel surgery. Our goal was for at least 50% of eligible patients to receive alvimopan from July 2018-July 2019 with an ultimate goal of all ovarian cancer patients undergoing bowel surgery to receive alvimopan preoperatively. Measurable outcome: Whether or not alvimopan was ordered and received preoperatively among ovarian cancer women undergoing a debulking surgery (primary, interval, or secondary) with anticipated bowel resection was the primary measureable outcome. Length of stay was the secondary measurable outcome. Next Steps: We will continue with data collection for Quarter 4 (April 2019-June 2019). Additionally, we would like to analyze time to return of bowel function, comp lications, and cost analysis of alvimopan use in all gynecologic oncology surgical patients with bowel resection. Dissemination: Patients from other departments, such as General Su rgery and Colorectal Surgery, could also benefit from alvimopan administration when bowel surgery is anticipated. The incorporation of PAMORAs in ERAS pathways can help accelerate gastrointestinal recovery and decrease hospital length of stay. Lessons Learned: Preoperative administration of alvimopan can help reduce length of hospital stay and potentially reduce hospital cost. Targeted education of team members is an avenue to help improve drug administration and workflow.24% of total ovarian cancer debulking surgeries had bowel resections for Quarters 1-3. Every quarter there was an improvement in the perc entage of the ovarian cancer debulking surgeries with bowel resections who received alvimopan. Median length of stay for patients in this cohort who underwent bowel surgery and received alvimopa n vs those that did not receive alvimopan was 3 days vs 4 days respectively. Quarter 1 (July 2018 - September 2018): 50% of ovarian cancer debulking patients with bowel surgery received alvimopan preoperatively. 2 pa tients who did not have bowel surgery received alvimopan.Quarter 2 (October 2018 - December 2018): 80% of ovarian cancer debulking patients with bowel surgery received alvimopan preoperatively. 3 pa tients who did not have bowel surgery received alvimopan. Quarter 3 (January 2019 - March 2019): 100% of ovarian cancer debulking patients with bowel surgery received alvimopan preoperatively. 5 pati ents who did not have bowel surgery received alvimopan.WHAT : Our project goal was to ensure ovarian cancer patients undergoing bowel resection during their debulking surgery receive alvimopan preoperatively. WHERE : The target population was patients from UCS F Mission Bay hospital gynecologic oncology service. WHEN : Weekly, a gynecologic oncology fellow would revi ew the surgery schedule, individual cases, and send out alvimopan reminders of elig ible patients to clinical team members. Quarterly, the fellow would review all gynecologic oncology surgeries to determine the number of ovarian cancer patients undergoing debulking surgery who had a bowel resection and received alvimopan. HOW : Our intervention included a) targeted educat ion of fellows, residents, NPs and preoperative nurses b) development of a work flow preoperativel y for anticipated bowel surgeries (utilization of ERAS pathway; dot phrase for H&P; team reminders) c) identification of patients who received alvimopan but did not undergo bowel surgery.

Among inpatient palliative care consults at Parnassus, we sought to increase spiritual screening documentation by 10 percentage points from 69% to 79% averaged over the months of 09/2018-05/2019.Next Steps: Continue to monitor our progress with spiritual screening throu gh June 30, 2019. Brainstorm with program leadership about ways to continue the p roject with next year's fellows. Dissemination:Preparing and abstract and poster presentation for American Aca demy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM) Annual Assembly for March 2020. Considering manuscript preparation and submission to Journal of Palliative Medicine. Lessons Learned: Within palliative care quality improvement initiatives, it is c ritical to have buy-in and participation of the entire interdisciplinary team.50% of patients in palliative care units experience spiritual distress . Spiritual distress is associated with pain and depression . When medical teams explore spiritual concerns, patients make different decisions about goals of care, compared to peers whose medical teams do not discussion spirituality. PROBLEM STATEMENT : Spiritual screening was documented in only 67% and 69% of patients seen by the Parnassus inpatient palliative care consult team in 2016 and 2017. National guidelines include spiritual screening as an essential component of assessment for all patients seen by a palliative care team.

PROBLEM STATEMENT : In 2017-2018, 35 babies (~3.5% of ICN admissions) were discharged home from the ICN last year without an echo or CCHD screening, which should be performed on all babies prior to discharge home. TARGET: Through a fellow-led education and QI project in the ICN, we aimed to reduce the number of babies who are discharged without an echo or congenital cardiac heart disease screening by 80% by July 2019. Next Steps: Evaluation of project interventions with new residency class in July 2019 Refining Apex generated report to improve efficiency with asses sing potential CCHD screen misses Dissemination: Similar targeting of order bundling and nursing discharge check lists through a multidisciplinary approach could address multiple issues throughout UCSF Health Lessons Learned: Collaboration with Apex/IT can be instrumental to improved effi ciency and work flow Difficult to ensure all residents receive similar education on a rotation given fluctuating schedulesWhat barriers are preventing us from meeting our target? Lack of awareness of both residents and nursing for the need of CCHD screening prior to discharge Separate orders for CCHD screening and hearing screen, which ar e both required prior to discharge Lack of CCHD screen as part of discharge checklist for both nur sing and physicians What are the barriers in order of importance? 1. Education of resident providers regarding the importance and expectation of CCHD screening prior to discharge home 2. Lack of discharge order set to bundle hearing screening with CCHD screen 3.

Our goal was to increase the percentage of labs drawn on dialysis among first-shift non-ICU hemodialysis patients from 30% to 70% by end of June 2019. Rationale: First-shift dialysis patients were chosen in order for results of lab testing to return prior to morning rounds ICU patients were excluded as they often have alternate access for phlebotomy, and are high acuity, so lab testing should not be delayed Reducing unnecessary venipuncture on dialysis may improve patient experience and sleep, decrease pain and bruising, and better preserve vascular accessNext Steps:Continue to work with floor and hemodialysis unit leadership to establish protocol for communication of dialysis shift schedule, including more effect ive and consistent use of APeX field Develop regular monitoring plan to facilitate data collection a nd monitoring Dissemination: Project was presented at hemodialysis unit, fellow, and departm ental meetings Lessons Learned: Effective and ineffective strategies for asynchronous communica tion and preferred timing of blood tests may be applied to other UCSF settingsStakeholder interviews:Stakeholder interviews with hemodialysis unit leadership and nu rsing, floor unit nursing leadership, phlebotomy, and primary service teams were conducte d to understand workflows of laboratory ordering and testing Interventions: Communication between hemodialysis unit to bedside nurse to hol d phlebotomy on patients scheduled for next day 1st shift hemodialysis EHR integration - APeX Field for dialysis shift to facilitate com munication Barriers: Unpredictability of hemodialysis schedule (emergencies, add-ons ) No staff in hemodialysis unit after hours until 6AM, whereas ph lebotomy starts work at 4am (need for asynchronous communication) Newly implemented APeX field to indicate dialysis shift is a phy sician order, but physicians do not primarily make the dialysis schedule APeX Order: APeX Lists: UCSF Resident and Clinical Fellow Quality Improvement Incentive Program in partnership with the 2019 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Preventing Delirium in Neurosurgical Patients Department of Neurological Surgery Residency Program Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Delirium is increasingly being recognized as a major post-surgical complication that has significant impact on recovery and postoperative morbidity for patients. Neurosurgical patients may be at increased risk of post-operative delirium given that these patients often have prolonged ICU care, require frequent neurological checks with interruption of sleep, possess neurological or metabolic derangements associated with neurosurgical disease, and have neurological deficits that may impair communication or mental status. If a patient screens positive for the CAM-ICU, AWOL, or NuDESC score, the nurse documents the positive score and should notify the resident on call, although we are not tracking the frequency with which nurses are paging the resident on call. Currently, neurosurgery is underperforming relative to other hospital services will ordering the delirium order set. PROBLEM STATEMENT : Neurosurgical patients, who may be at a higher risk for delirium than o ther patients in the hospital, are not receivi ng the delirium order set when they In an attempt to lower d elirium rates in patients on the neurosurgery service, we set the following goal: Targeting 75% delirium order set compliance for patients who screen positive for delirium. We set this target because we felt that setting a higher target for neurosurgical patients, who may screen falsely positive or who may require more frequent neurochecks than the delirium order set offers, was not feasible.Next Steps:The primary next step is to determine what effect the delirium order set had on delirium rates, delirium days, and complications of delirium for neurosurgical patients. We hy pothesize that this order set may not prevent delirium but reduce the amount of time patients are delirious a nd accelerate their safe discharge. Additionally, we want to work with the nursing staff to identif y areas in the order set that are difficult to implement or hard to measure that may be diminishing the effect iveness of the intervention. Dissemination/Continuation: Prior to disseminating or continui ng our initiative into subseq uent years, it is critical to determine to impact this order set has for neurosurgical patients specifically. Lessons Learned: Enacting any change to clinical practice requires a team effort , including the nurses, nurse practioners, therapists, and physicians. Apex IT has remarkable potential for tracking metrics and ident ifying areas where ordering providers can improve patient care if it is utilized appropriately. To begin, we collected and publis hed our current delirium rates : Fifty-two (22.1%) patients experienced delirium during their ho spital stay. In order to enact our project, we: 1) We implemented a column into our work list to indicate if a patient has screened positive for delirium by the nurses. 2) Started addressing delirium risk and screening at multidisci plinary rounds between the case managers, primary and charge nurses, nurse practitioners, and resident pr oviders 3) Encouraged nurses to alert the team when they are concerned about a patient becoming delirious We hypothesized that enacting th e order set would not prevent d elirium References Morshed, R.

The AMA Opioid Task Force recommendations included a call for providers to discuss safe storage and disposal of expired, unwanted, or unused opioid medications with their patients.1Therefore, the problem we are targeting in this project will be the development and distribution of standardized storage and disposal instructions of opiate medication for postoperative patients in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. It is estimated that over 70% of individuals who abuse opioid medications obtain them from friends or family in the community.2 In turn, the majority of these medications were obtained from a single doctor (Figure 2).2,3While overprescribing remains a common pattern associated with high numbers of leftover tablets, studies have also shown low rates of patient education efforts focusing on safe storage and disposal.6,7 PROBLEM STATEMENT: There are no standardized instructions provided to patients who receive opiate prescriptions with regards to safe storage or disposal of unused medications. In a survey of 6 nurses with experience conducting either OB postpartum or GYN/ONC postoperative discharges, 2/6 reported routinely advising patients to safely store opiates away from children, and only 2/6 reported advising patients of methods to safely dispose of unused prescriptions or unused medications. In a review of over 15 templated discharge instructions routinely used after postpartum hospitalization, sameday GYN/ONC surgery, or after inpatient GYN/ONC hospitalization, a word search for \"disposal\" and \"storage\" returned 1 result. We aimed to provide standardized recommendations for safe storage of opiate medication, and a list of locations that accept and safely dispose of unused opiate medications, at the time of discharge from the Benign Gynecology or Gynecologic Oncology services. We wanted to achieve a 20% distribution rate in Q1 and steadily rise to 40% of eligible cases in Q2, and 60% in Q3 and Q4. Next Steps: Increasing consistent use of instructions on safe storage and disposal of medication by linking instructions to case and surgeon specific discharge instructions. Including instructions in the outpatient setting at the preoperative or postoperative appointments Dissemination: A similar initiative has already been adopted across the UCSF Health System providing patient safety information about use of opiates in all After Visit Summaries. Information on safe storage and disposal could be standardized and added to this existing patient information document. Lessons Learned: Data collection is a critical step in evaluating and thereby further disseminating quality improvement efforts.

However, the awareness of the impact smoking can have on vision is low. In a survey performed in the UK, only 9.5% of patients believed smoking was a cause of blindness, whereas 70.6-92.2% believed it was a cause of stroke, heart disease, or lung cancer. The survey also suggested that the fear of blindness was as compelling a motivation to quit as the fear of lung cancer, heart disease, and stroke. Ophthalmologists and optometrists are in a unique position to educate and help patients connect to smoking cessation resources since we are often the first department with which patients come in contact within the health system. PROBLEM STATEMENT : Patients who come to the ophthalmology department and report that they are current smokers are often not given further resources. Currently, technicians ask whether or not patients are smokers during their intake for their ophthalmology appointment. According to a recent survey of eye care providers within an academic ophthalmology department, only 85% of providers reported \"seldom\" or \"never\" discussing potential methods and resources for smoking cessation. In our clinics between 7/2018 and 10/2018, out of 299 ophthalmology encounters where patients reported \"yes\" to current smoker, 0% of these patients had a smoking cessation counseling documented or resources referred by the ophthalmology department. The problem exists because many eye care providers are not aware of the smoking cessation referrals and education materials that are available at UCSF. Also eye-care providers may not be looking at the response of the current smoking status for patients since the intake is performed by the technicians. The target goal is to have ophthalmology providers use a Tobacco Cessation smartest and documenting and providing counseling and referrals to resources in at least 20% of the patients that report being a \"current smoker.\"Next Steps:Have physical and visible reminders around the clinic to help s taff remember to look at smoking status of patients and implement the action plan.Update staff on progress with Apex report statistics and remind staff of project. Coordinate with the UCSF Fontana Tobacco Treatment Center. Dissemination: Implement similar smoking cessation initiatives in other outpat ient clinics. Lessons Learned: Challenges associated with creating an effective and accurate A pex report. Incorporating changes into clinic workflow. Reminding staff of quality improvement project.A multidisciplinary and team approach was taken by holding meet ings to educate all members of the ophthalmology department including the faculty, residents, tech nicians, and optometrists. Technicians were asked to flag patient charts if they reported being \"curre nt smokers.\" Meetings educated staff on how to see the smoking status of their patients on Epic and on how to use the smoking cessation smart set on Epic. We discussed and developed the p roject at the department Qualit y Improvement meeting. A department wide initiative was implemented to use the smart s et for patients who report being a \"current smoker\" to help ensure patients are being referred to smoking cessation resources if they are interested. We developed an Apex report to track the number of patient enco unters where patients report being a \"current smoker\" and whether the smoking cessation smart set wa s used. The report also looks at whether or not these patients had a PCP encounter within the pa st 12 months prior to the ophthalmology encounter and whether elements of the smoking ces sation smart set was used at their PCP visit. 1/2019-3/2019 Patients reporting \"current smoker\"Referred to smoking cessation counseling Ophthalmology 4 PCP encounter 12 months within ophtho encounter56 51UCSF Resident and Clinical Fellow Quality Improvement Incentive Program in partnership with the 2019 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Reducing Time to Surgery for Hip Fragility Fracture Patients Trevor Grace; Will Rubenstein; Matt Callahan; Bobby Tay; Derek Ward Orthopedic Surgery Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Between July 1, 2014 and March 31, 2018, 49.0% of all hip fragility fracture patients admitted to UCSF underwent surgery greater than 24-hours after admission The median time between admission and surgery (the \"Time to OR\" or TOR) increased progressively with increasing American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grades, likely reflecting a greater amount of time needed for clearance of complex patients Problem Statement : For hip fracture patients with ASA grade 2 or less, 35.3% underwent surgery greater than 24-hours after admission at UCSF in the same time period Project Goal : To take over 75% of hip fragility fracture patients with ASA grade 2 or less to surgery within 24-hours (TOR <24-hours) Interventions in the UCSF Hip Fracture Protocol pertinent to ou r resident incentive goal included improvements in Emergency Department care (e.g. fascia iliaca b locks for improved pain control), Pre- operative optimization guidelines (e.g. strict criteria for nee ding a preoperative echocardiogram), Pre- operative anticoagulation management/reversal, Anesthesia proto cols, and Surgical protocols (e.g. having designated operating room for hip fracture surgeries) So far for the 2018-2019 academic year, the orthopedic surgery department has improved the percentage of ALL hip fragility fracture patients taken to surgery within 24 hours to 58.0% from 44.7% at baseline (see figure below left) So far for the 2018-2019 academic year, the orthopedic surgery department has improved the percentage of ASA grade 2 or less hip fragility fracture patients taken to surgery within 24 hours to 83.3% (Q1), 81.8% (Q2), and 81.25% (Q3) from 62.7% at baseline (see figure below right); this is above our goal of 75%The 2018-2019 Resident Incentive Goal for the Orthopedic Surger y Department was chosen to parallel resident incentives with an institutional initiative called the UCSF Hip Fracture Protocol This initiative is an interdisciplinary effort between the orth opedic surgery, anesthesia, hospital medicine, cardiology, emergency, and geriatric medicine departments to co mprehensively improve the care of hip fragility fracture patients admitted to UCSF The protocol is meant to address many root causes of inefficien t and delayed management of these patients, which includes: Limited operating room availability Limited staff surgeon availability Excessive preoperative clearance protocols The Hip Fracture Protocol involved aggressive interdisciplinary cooperation to address these issues, with a particular emphasis on reducing the time to surgery for these hip fragility fracture patients (see figure above right), as th is has been associated with improved survival rates and outcomes after these injuries; please see https://hipfracture.ucsf.edu for more information By setting the orthopedic incentive goal as taking over 75% of hip fragility fracture patients with ASA grade 2 or less to surgery within 24-hours, orthopedic residents were incentivized to be front-line advocates for this broader institutional initiative and to be lead coordinato rs amongst servicesThe US population is rapidly aging An increased incidence of hip fragility fractures is expected with the growing elderly population Effective and timely management of these injuries is necessary to optimize patient independence, function, and outcome Studies have shown that surgical management of hip fractures within 24 hours of presentation has a direct impact on mortality Next Steps:We plan to continue this initiative as part of the broader UCSF Hip Fracture Protocol. Continued focus of the project includes the following:Increased emphasis on OR availability on holidays and weekends where many of the delays occur Increased improvements in postoperative care of patients includ ing increased referral to skeletal health Dissemination:A similar project is in place at the Zuckerberg San Francisco G eneral campus - best practices will continue to be shared across sites, keeping in mind that there are certain challenges specific to the ZSFG as a county hospital that may not be directly translatable and applicableLessons Learned: Project buy in and focus from the orthopedic attendings and res idents was perhaps the single most important factor in our demonstrated improvementThe multi-disciplinary nature of this initiative and the involv ement of residents through the incentive program helped to facilitate its success UCSF Resident and Clinical Fellow Quality Improvement Incentive Program in partnership with the 2019 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium Opioid Reduction in Head and Neck Cancer Patients Names Philip L. Perez Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery Residency Background Project Plan and Interventions Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned Since 1999, the number of opioid prescriptions written in the U.S. has quadrupled, and deaths attributed to opioid overuse have become the most common cause of death (Rudd et al, 2016). 80% of prescribed-opioid abusers are not the person for whom the prescription was written (Manchikanti et al 2012). PROBLEM STATEMENT : Opioid prescription patterns within the OHNS Department following common head and neck surgeries vary significantly, without standard recommendations or protocols. Furthermore, patient education on proper use and disposal of opioids on discharge was lacking. For >90% of patients undergoing surgery within the Head and Neck Oncology Division of OHNS, discharge instructions will include information on appropriate use of narcotic medication and strategies for transitioning to non-opioid medications. Data from patient usage of opioids - measured by need for additional prescriptions - will be used to standardize and reduce opioid prescription patterns for >80% of patients undergoing thyroidectomy, parathyroidectomy, parotidectomy, glossectomy, and wide local excision who do not undergo a neck dissection. Next Steps: We are standardizing discharge instructions across other subspe cialties within our department to include this educational information. We are decreasing our standard prescri ption of opioids even further for this subset of head and neck cancer patients based on current usage. Dissemination: We have found setting up individua l order sets within Apex to b e a very helpful mechanism for providers to standardize prescriptions - this could be broadly applicable acr oss surgical and medical specialties Lessons Learned: This project has been a lesson in the need to constantly evalua te practices that have become ingrained based on historical convention rather than data. Objective informatio n can support openness to enacting change in these practices, which can decrease risk for our patients. Providing greater information to patients on appropriate use of opioid medications and transitioning to non- opioid medications fit into a larger project of standardization of a discharge instruction template for Head and Neck Cancer patients. By establishing this template and the exp ectation that all discha rges start with this outline, we were able to incorporate this additional educationa l information and ensure its dissemination. As this protocol has won buy in from all residents and advanced pr actice providers within our department who engage in the discharge process, we are now at nearly 100% pene trance. Establishing standardized prescription patterns was more challe nging. No protocol or order set within Apex was set up for our discharge process. Based on a survey of resi dents, most prescription patterns were based on suggestions from senior residents learned during junior resi dent years. Setting up individual order sets for standard head and neck discharges enabled us to create a defaul t, low-resistance option based on actual patient medication usage. We also identified a concern among residents about under-prescr ibing opioid medications, and the difficulties patients could face in the outpa tient setting obtaining additio nal medication without a physical paper prescription. This sentiment changed significantly this year wi th the advent of electronic prescribing of opioids by faculty within the OHNS Department.

Early Mobility Practices in the PICU Lindsay Braun, Neelima Marupudi, Deborah Franzon Pediatric Critical Care Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned The changing spectrum of pediatric disease and technological advances has translated to improved survival for children with critical illness. Unfortunately, this decrease in morta lity is often offset by an increase in morbidity for these young patients. Evidence suggests there is significant and persistent physical, cognitive, and psychiatric morbidities among adult and pediatric survivors of critical illness, leading to functional impairments and reduced quality of life. Recent data supports supporting early mobilization in adult intensive care units; however the culture in pediatric intensive care units is frequently that of immobility due to safety concerns leading to heavy sedation and restraints. PROBLEM STATEMENT : Early evidence has shown that heavy sedation and decreased mobility can lead to impaired circadian rhythm cycles, increased level and duration of delirium and other psychiatric problems, and neuropathy and muscle weakness. ICU acquired weakness exis ts in children and the pediatric ICU population is at high risk for prolonged deficits as they are often admitted with pre-existing rehabilitation needs. Point prevalence check: 50% of patients in PICU had order for therapies and 50% of those had been seen in past 72 hours. Therapies often get skipped due to patient illness but not always resumed when patient more stable and would benefit from therapies. Our goal is to ultimately create a culture within our PICU that values and prioritizes early rehabilitation and mobility practices for as many of our patients as possible. Through this project, we aim to raise awareness and educate the healthcare team. For this year, we will monitor progress by measuring the number of patients in the PICU with active physical and occupational therapy orders. We aim to increase the number of patients with active PT orders by 50%. We also aim to increase ambulation and early mobility documented in the nursing assessments.Next Steps: Continued efforts to increase awareness an d understanding of the importance of early rehabilitation practices in the pediatric intens ive care unit. Working closely with nursing leadership, respiratory therapists, physical and occupational therapists, residents, families, and patients to create a receptive envi ronment through education and collaboration. Dissemination: Mobilization and rehabilitation is an integral component of recovery for any patient in a hospitalization setting. Aspects of our bundle an d our collaborative interdisciplinary efforts can be applied in any inpatient unit at UCSF. Lessons Learned: Changes to the traditionally limite d rehabilitation and activity cult ure for critically ill children takes time and education. Our ICU-Move rollout was welcomed with enthusiasm and interest; though the reality is that much of the physical l egwork (literally!) was on nurses, therapists, and families. This taught us how important coll aboration and education would be to make quality improvements. We will carry on with us in the next phases of the project.Intervention 1: Education of nursing staff, resp iratory therapists, PICU attendings, fellows, and rotating residents and medical students about the project and goals by attending leadership meetings, conferences, huddles, and on rounds. Intervention 2: Development of a PICU bundl e which will encourage the caregiving team to screen each patient daily to determine readines s for early mobility (PT/OT/SLP/Child Life, lightening of sedation, mobility exer cises with nurses/family/friends). Intervention 3: Daily reminder to daytime IC U fellow via nursing rounding tool to discuss mobility bundle. Intervention 4: Daily reminder to nighttime ICU fellow to discuss PT/OT orders on midnight rounds. Intervention 5: Prior to activity, patients' clinical st atus should be optimized, i.e. changing diaper/ensuring they have urinated, secu re all lines and tubes, have all necessary equipment/support staff.

(ESPGHAN, 2014). Recommendations include: 2) Encourage oral rehydration with ORS3) Medical management with Zofran4) Do not use loperamide5) Encourage rapid return to full diet6) Do not obtain workup for etiology unless severely ill or diarrhea >14 days. 3) Adult literature shows proper management can decrease hospitalizations and days of illness (30-55%) 4) Pediatric literature shows substantial decline in need for IV rehydration 5) Zofran has been in usage for over 25 years (almost 30), with ZERO cases of mortality. Two total cases of pediatric morbidity, both overdose, and both recovered within 12 hours 6) Retrospective analysis of Zofran usage at Mt. Zion showed exceedingly rare use of Zofran (<2%) from 2016- 2017. PROBLEM STATEMENT : US pediatric providers are poorly informed of treatment options for acute gastroenteritis, and thus are not treating according to guidelines, likely worsening the burden of disease on our patient population 1) Improve education and awareness of the utility and safety of Zofran usage in AGE Target: 1) Improve Zofran usage by 25% per quarter, to goal of ~100% of eligible patients receiving the option of antiemetic therapy Next Steps:1) Focus additional education on research demonstrating Zofran's inability to mask more serious pathology such as a surgical abdomen or intestinal obstruction 2) Develop improved workflow for guiding patients in oral rehydr ation Dissemination: This project can easily be expanded to all UCSF outpatient faci lities, and prior research and our results suggest that this is a desirable goalLessons Learned: Key to understand the current workflow and provider thoughts fo r management of a disease in an outpatient context before trying to alter practice. Initial education eff orts focused on the wrong topics to reassure providers of intervention safety, and initial efforts to alter discharge paperwork me t poor success given incompatibility with previous workflow. Core Problems: 1) Awareness: a) perception that AGE is a minor ailment (typically true) with nothing that can be done (false) b) lack of awareness of successful treatment strategies 2) Prevalence of Concerns: a) widespread belief that Zofran has significant side effect pro file b) lack of familiarity with probiotics and the associated data Hypothesis: Poor compliance with AGE recommendations is an art ifact of lack of awareness, and can be remedied through educational methods Interventions: 1) Targeted educational session for attending pediatricians at M t. Zion w/ supporting reference information 2) Education sessions for resident population at large via UCSF- MB noon conference 3) Utilizing resident led teaching at Mt. Zion to reinforce and support efficacy and safety of Indicated Cases of Acute Gastroenteritis Monthly Averages Median Goals Linear (Monthly Averages)Initiation of resident led sessions Initial education sessionInitiation of resident led sessionsSurvey of provider opinions to target interventions During the academic year 2018-2019, we target that 75% of our patients will receive at least one non-opioid analgesic, either Acetaminophen, Gabapentin or Celecoxib, any time in the pre-operative holding area. Prior to this academic year, plastic surgeons at UCSF have not routinely focused on possible preoperative interventions to attempt to reduce postoperative narcotic requirements. The treatment of post-operative pain was only addressed in the post-operative period. Any pre-operative pain medications have been at the discretion of the anesthesiologist and vary widely from provider to provider. Next Steps:Determining whether the PSOAR protocol results in postoperative and outpatient opioid reduction Dissemination: PSOAR can all surg ical subspecialities and distri bution of the protocol to other services can forward the opioid reduction movement and put the resonsibility in the hands of the surgeons. Lessons Learned: Because there are several steps in determining PSOAR eligibilit y and ordering the multimodal medication treatment, a dedicated team member should be assigned the sole task of assigning and prescribing patients to the PSOAR protocol at each site. Additionally, APEX has helpful tools and order sets. Once we were able to create a PSOAR order set for the three medications, it became m uch easier and quicker to order the medications.Opioid abuse and overdose has become a national epidemic.Surgeons routinely prescribe opioids for postoperative pain control, which can be substantial.Preopeative administration of analgesics can reduce postoperative and intra-operative opioid requirements. These measures can reduce length of stay, post- operative opioid use, and unplanned re-admissions. In the field of plastic surgery, this is beginning to be studied in cases such as autologous breast reconstruction with preliminary data suggesting improvement in post-operative opioid use and reduced length of stay. Prior to our project, there was no routine, standardized preoperative analgesic plan implemented by the plastic surgery team at UCSF despite the data that suggests this reduces hospital length of stay, post-operative opioid use, and unplanned re-admissions and ED visits. Plastic Surgery patients were not routinely getting pre-operative non-opiate analgesic medications despite evidence that this may reduced post-op opiate consumption.

However, these guidelines are often not followed consistently, with significant negative impact on patient health outcomes. Second-generation antipsychotics are associated with an elevated risk of developing obesity, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia (1,2), which are well-established risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Patients with psychosis are also less likely to be treated for cardiovascular risk factors once they occur (3) and face barriers to accessing primary care (4) to receive this treatment. Consistent monitoring can increase early recognition of metabolic abnormalities and prudent referrals to primary care, and prompt interventions to reduce metabolic syndrome and morbidity in patients using atypical antipsychotics (4). PROBLEM STATEMENT : Patients on atypical antipsychotics often do not receive evidence-based metabolic monitoring for cardiovascular risk factors. BASELINE CONDITION: According to data pulled from April 2017 to April 2018, only 9.3% of patients at Langley Porter clinics were in full compliance with metabolic monitoring as defined by having a body mass index (BMI) and labs (lipid panel, plus fasting glucose or HbA1c) on record in the last year. GOAL: Increase the number of patients in full compliance with metabolic monitoring to 50% or greater by June 30, 2019. REFERENCES: 1. Alvarez-jim\u00e9nez M, et al.

Next Steps: Revising report to improve accuracy: make sure patients on the list are actually active on the medication, think of ways to capture labs outside of UCSF. Both are adding to a falsely low compliance rate. Dissemination: Strategic hiring of MAs and leveraging EMR to assist with adher ence to lab monitoring guidelines could be deployed in other settings at UCSF Health. Lessons Learned: Using other supports (like MAs) is very helpful to providers, w ho already have a lot to cover in a short appointment time Getting an accurate report is challenging but it shouldn't hind er pursuit of progress Analysis based on a 12 month lookback lends itself to slower ch anges over time, as in this project. Implementation of interventions need to happen early on and we need to think creatively about how to intervene with patients who are not physically in the office . Providers : Distribution of guidelines to MDs and reminders to obtain metab olic monitoring for atypical antipsychotics regardless of indicationTargeted emails with individualized statistics for % pts in com pliance with metabolic monitoring Medical Assistants (MAs) to obta in vitals with BMI on all patie nts, as well as performing medication reconciliations and pending labs if out of date Patients : Distribution of pamphlets regarding metabolic risk of atypical antipsychotics, though this was not implemented because it was thought to be difficult to obtain a consensus am ong providers with regards to messaging to patients. Instead, MAs were cueing patients to talk to their doctor about metabolic monitoring before appointments Allow non-fasting lipid panel and Hemoglobin A1c for patients w ith previous normal results, rather than all fasting labs EMR : Implement reminder system with dot phrase incorporating date an d results of last labs and BMI Label high riskpatients in provider schedules Facilities/systems : Determination of LPPI-wide lab monitoring guidelines Purchase additional scales Dedicate space to obtain vitals/BMI Hiring of MAs KEY MILESTONES: October 2018: MAs hired and started to collect vitals on patien ts for BMI monitoring. November 2018: MAs started to do medication reviews with patien ts, pend orders for lipids and HbA1c, and prompt patients to discuss with MD. February 2019: Individual providers notified of their panel com pliance rates via email. Mid-April 2019: Rolled out new dot phrase to be used in the pro vider notes to help with tracking and flagging labs and reminding when next values are due.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) id entified on computed tomography (CT) is considered diagnostic of calcific coronary artery disea se (CAD). CAC can be assessed on routine (no n-ECG gated) non-contrast che st CT, and trials have shown good agreement between visual assessm ent and Agatston score on ECG-gated chest CT. Recent multi-society guidelines have recommended the adoption of CAC description in non-gated chest CT examinations, and CAC is a modifying risk fa ctor in the most recent ACC/AHA preventative care guidelines. Aligning with the True North pillar of Quality and Safety, pati ents receiving non-contrast chest CTs for any indication would benef it from CAC screening on non-contrast chest CT scans. Describing the presence, extent, and/or absence of coronary artery calcium may alter management as providers can use the information to help guide patient care and consider initiation or modification of prevent ative measures or therapies. PROBLEM STATEMENT : Radiologists currently underreport CAC on non-cardiac chest CTs , and at UCSF there is no standard requirement to describe the presen ce or absence of CAC on routine non-contrast chest CTs. CAC reporting for 2018 From 7/1/18-6/30/19, include description of presence, \u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0012\u0004\u0012\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003non-gated, non-contrast chest CTs performed in patients \u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003intervention.Next Steps: Revised guidance statement and references to maximize clinical utility and streamline management considerations for patients and providers: \"Coronary artery calcification may correlate with coronary arte ry disease.

UCSF Resident and Clinical Fellow Quality Improvement Incentive Program in partnership with the 2019 UCSF Health Improvement Symposium TRIGGER INJECTION ONLINE VIDEOS IMPROVE WORKFLOW EFFICIENCY & NURSING SATISFACTION Viji Sundaram MD, Katrina Cruz, MSN, Maria Farinha, BSN, Amanda Adeleye MD, Eleni Greenwood MD, Kaitlyn Wald MD, Amy Kaing, MD, Diana Zhou, MD, Martha Noel, MD, Marcelle Cedars, MD, Heather Huddleston MD Reproductive Endocrinology & Infertility Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned One of the main responsibilities of the In-Cycle team of nurses is performing trigger injection counseling during in vitro fertilization. Trigger counseling occurs in 2 parts: (1) In-person prior to rounding, when generic instructional documents are reviewed with the patient broadly without details of dates or dosages (~30-45mins/patient). (2) By phone following rounds, when more specific instructions are then confirmed including dates/times/dosages (~10-15mins/patient). Assuming 3-10 triggers in one day, the In-Cycle RNs cumulatively spend between 2-10 hours/day counseling patients on very similar material. Baseline data reported a mean of 29 minutes spent overall by the In-Cycle team per patient counseling on trigger medications. PROBLEM STATEMENT : If the trigger preparation process was streamlined with improved efficiency, this would enable the In-Cycle nu rses to conduct a more focused counseling session and utilize the gained time to take on other necessary nursing responsibilities. The goal of this Quality Improvement project was to develop standardized ovulation trigger injection videos for the patient to view independently online, as an adjunct to counseling provided by the nurse, in order to: (1) Reduce average nursing time spent counseling a patient for ovulation trigger by 20% over the course of 12 months (2) Increase average In-Cycle nursing and patient satisfaction scores to >80% over a 3-month period (3) Decrease overall ca lls made to the after- hours physician regarding trigger instructions. Next Steps: We hope to continue to disseminate the trigger videos to all pa tients, new and returning. Some of our In-Cycle nursing staff has already been relocated to other nursing duties due to the improved efficiency. It will be interesting to further elucidate why patients undergoing repeat trigger injections are less satisfied following video implementation. Dissemination: Our results indicate that creation and implementation of proced ural videos improves overall nursing time spent counseling patients with fewer ca lls to the on-call physicians. This improved efficiency is associated with improved nursing satisfaction and stable p atient satisfaction and confid ence. Practices seeking efficiency gains should consider utilization of video-based instruction. Lessons Learned: We created a team of multiple stakeholders including In-Cycle n urses, nursing managers, nurse practitioners, and physicians to assist in the implementation of the plan, such th at everyone was invested in the ultimate goal.Time spent counseling patients by staff was on averag e 29 minutes prior to video implementation. This decreased by 40% to 17.5 minutes by Quarter 1 and 44% to 16.2 minutes by Quarter 2. All five In-Cycle nurses completed the satisfaction su rvey with improved average scores from 20% pre-video to 84% post-video. 148 patients were sent a survey 1 month before and afte r video implementation with a response rate of 38.5% pre-video and 25% post-video. Following vide o implementation, 86.5% of respondents reported watching the videos. Overall trends revealed that pati ents completing a trigger injection for the first time reported improved scores on information received, satisfaction, and confidence, though none of these values approached significance. Patients undergoing repeat trigger injection reported significantly lower satisfaction scores following video implementation (9.44/10 to 8.38/10, p=0.028). There was a reduction in overall calls made to the on -call physician with 10.5% calling prior to the video and 8.1% post-video.Hypothesis: The creation and implementation of tailored online ovulation tr igger injection instruction videos would achieve the stated goals of the project. Intervention : Ten total videos were created to instruct patients on how to mix and inject specified doses of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG): 1500 units (u), 2500u, 3300 u, 5000u vial of h CG; and lupron. Nurses logged total time spent counseling patients on trigger i nstructions over a 2-week period in June 2018, prior to video implementation. Videos were emailed to all patie nts on the day of planned trigger starting mid- November 2018. Nurses logged time spent counseling per patient on a quarterly basis throughout the year: 1 month following video implementation over a 2-week period and a gain 3 months later. Nursing satisfaction surveys were sent following video initiati on and compared to pre-video scores. Patient surveys were sent retrospectively to gauge adequacy of informat ion received, satisfaction, confidence, and need to page on-call physician prior to and following video imp lementation. Means were compared using a paired t-test for each of the measured outcomes on the Steps: Additional data points can be added relating to other improveme nt work i.e. surgical site infection, C. difficile infection, length of stay and antibiotic choice. Dissemination: Quarterly reports are sent to Department of Urology as they con tinue their improvement work. This process can be adapted by other surgical categories if the y are not well represented in NSQIP and/or NHSN. Lessons Learned: Meaningful quality improvement initiative require collaboration across various disciplines. Successful improvement efforts and ongoing monitoring must be s upported by accurate data. Antibiotics play a vital role in medicine and when used properly, can save lives from once untreatable infections. Antibiotic misuse has contributed to the emergence of multiple drug resistant organisms, negative patient outcomes and increased health costs. Antibiotic use as surgical prophylaxis is intended to reduce the risk of post-procedural infections but can lead to inappropriate administrations. National guidelines suggest stopping antimicrobials before closure of surgical incision for clean and clean-contaminated cases (Berrios-Torres SI et al. JAMA Surg . 2017 Aug 1;152(8):784-791). The proportion of patients receiving antibiotics beyond 24 hours post Urological procedures was unknown. Identification of these surgical patients without manual chart review has not been explored. We were able to establish a consistent way to identify Urology' s surgical patients by using an ICD10 codes set developed from CPT procedure codes. This mappi ng was used to build the report consisting of Urology's targeted surgical patient popula tion and their post-operative antibiotic usage. This report compliments the Department of Ur ology's quality improvements efforts by providing a method for monitoring outco me. The percentage of cases receiving post-operative IV antibiotic is 8.1% for CY2018, compared to 73.6% for May 2016-April 2017. Background Project Plan and Intervention(s) Project Goals Project Evaluation & Impact Next Steps, Dissemination & Lessons Learned To identify Urology patients undergoing common clean or clean-contaminated procedures in order to assess and provide feedback regarding whether antibiotics were stopped prior to incision closure. Use surgical categorization process from an established nation al program: National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) uses ICD10 codes but has not defined a comprehensive urological surgery category American College National Surgical Qualify Improvement Program (NSQIP) uses CPT codes but CPT codes not read ily available through Infection Control's (IC) database Obtain list of NSQIP Urology patients from Oct 2016 - Sept 2017 and CPT codes NSQIP captured 100% of cases during this time periodHow to correctly identify urological procedures? IC's database only captures ICD10 codes for surgical site infe ction surveillance In order to utilize IC's database for ongoing monitoring and c ustom surgical categorization, CPT codes were mapped to ICD10 codes Compare CPT codes to ICD10 codes Review ICD10 code descriptions Review ICD10 codes and sequenc es assigned by hospital billing Group ICD10 codes into surgical categories of interest: cystectomy, nephrectomy and radical prostatectomy Which ICD10 codes should be used for which urological procedure?
