Influenza derives its public health importance from the epidemic potential of the virus and the associated morbidity and seriousness of complications . Immunization is widely recognized as the most effective means to reduc e the morbidity and mortality associated with influenza. Each year in Canada, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) publishes a statement with recommendations identify ing the groups that should be targeted by seasonal immunization programs (1). Previously, influenza publically funded immunization w as based o n these NACI target groups, however, in 2010 the Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness (DHW) made publicly funded influenza vaccine available to all individuals 6 months of age or older . This report review s the epidemiology of laboratory -confirmed influenza and trends in influenza -like illness (ILI) for the 201 3-2014 season. It also reports seasonal influenza vaccine coverage rates for Nova Scotia overall and select groups, including children aged 6 months to 59 months , residents and staff of long -term care facilities and staff of acute care facilities . Respiratory pathogen activity across the province is summarized in the Respiratory Watch report . This report is produced weekly or biweekly, according to level of respiratory pathogen activity. Method s The 2013-2014 influenza s eason was defined using the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) influenza surveillance weeks; it began August 2 5, 2013 and ended August 2 3, 201 4. Data on influenza cases, ILI, and vaccine coverage used in this report were obtained from several sources, a s described below. Further information on surveillance case definitions, reporting procedures, and forms can be found in the Respiratory Response Plan for Nova Scotia . Influenza Case s and Outbreaks Influenza is a notifiable disease in Nova Scotia under the Health Protection Act . Influenza cases are classified based on standardized case definitions and are reported to the Department of Health and Wellne ss (DHW) through the Application for Notifiable Disease Surveillance (ANDS) . The influenza surveillance case definition is: Confirmed Case: Clinical illness with laboratory confirmation of infection: Isolation of influenza virus from an appropriate cli nical specimen. OR Demonstration of influenza virus antigen in an appropriate clinical specimen. OR Significant rise (e.g. fourfold or greater) influenza lgG titre between acute and convalescent sera. OR Detection of influenza RNA. Influenza Surveillance Report 2013 -2014 Season v1.0 Page 5 of 16 Page5 Clinical Evidence : Influenza -like illness (ILI) is defined as: Acute onset of respiratory illness with fever AND Cough AND One or more of sore throat, arthralgia, myalgia or prostration. Other symptoms may include: headache, chills, loss of appetite, runny nose, sneezing and watery eyes. Fever may not be prominent in the elderly and children under five. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are uncommon but can occur, especially in children under 5. Most people will recover within 5 -7 days. Respiratory Response Plan for Nova Scotia . Respiratory pathogen testing including influenza testing is available for the acute care setting and long term care / adult residential care settings. Community testing (physician offices, walk -in clinics, etc...) is only conducted under special circumstances and requires approval of a Capital District Health Authority (CDHA) Microbiologist. Laboratory testing consists of a multiplex nucleic acid amplification assay (NAAT) for a broad range of respiratory viral pathogens or a streamlined nucleic acid amplification assay for the detection of Influenza A, Influenza B, Respiratory Syncytial Viru s only. Public health surveillance subtyping of influenza virus type A positive samples is performed. Testing during the season determine s the strains which are circulating . Outbreaks of influenza must also be reported to public health in accordance wi th the Health Protection Act. Outbreaks are reported to DHW through a secure web -based application ( CNPHI Outbreak Summaries), allowing users to monitor trends in outbreaks. These o utbreak summaries facilitate standardized and systematic documentation of outbreak data and allows users to query, summarize, and generate reports. Influenza -Like Illness (ILI) An Emergency Room (ER) surveillance system was implemented in Nova Scotia in April 2009. Emergency departments at 41 hospitals across the province began monitoring for trends in ILI in the community in order to determine disease activity levels and to detect waning , re-emergence, and severity of illness. Infection control practitioners report the total number of patients seen in the ER and the total number meeting the ILI case definition on a weekly basis to DHW . The ILI surveillance case definition is : Acute onset* of respiratory illness with: Fever AND Cough AND One or more of the following: sore throat, joint pain, muscle pain, malaise or extrem e weakness which could be due to influenza virus. Note: In children under 5, gastrointestinal symptoms may also be present. In patients under 5 or 65 and older, fever may not be prominent. *Distinct change from normal status to respiratory illness ov er 1-3 days, based on clinical judg ment. Influenza Surveillance Report 2013 -2014 Season v1.0 Page 6 of 16 Page6 Vaccine Coverage In the fall of 2013, pharmacists partnered with Public Health and the DHW to provide influenza vaccine to the community . The 201 3-2014 influenza season was the fourth non-pandemic influenza season for which the influenza vaccine was publicly funded for all Nova Scotians 6 months of age and older. In the fall of each year, DHW provides a supply of vaccine to the district Public Health offices that in turn distribute th e vaccine to physician practices , pharmacies and other health care provider s. Data on the number of individuals who received the influenza vaccine is available from two sources: the provincial Medical Services Insurance (MSI) physician -billing database (provides data on individuals who received influenza vaccine at physician offices and pharmacies ); and the DHW data collection tools used by district PHS . These data collection tools capture aggregate summaries of immunization data from clinics, healthcar e facilities and other community agencies (e.g., Victorian Order of Nurses (VON) ). In order to calculate complete coverage rates for healthcare facilities, the total number of staff, volunteers and residents/patients who received influenza vaccine, either at the facility or by another provider is reported. The c overage rate for pregnant women is calculated using the total number of live birth s and stillbirt hs reported to Nova Scotia Vital Statistics for 201 3. Vaccine coverage rates are determined by calculating the number of individuals who received the vaccine as a proportion of the total number of individuals eligible to receive the vaccine. Denominator data for the population vaccine coverage rates are obtained from Statistics Cana da and are estimates based on the 20 11 Census (estimates as of July 2014) . Denominator data for vaccine coverage rates in acute and long -term care facilities are obtained through the DHW data collection tools . It is of note that influenza vaccine administration processes and collection of vaccine coverage data during the 2009 -2010 pandemic influenza season were unique to that year, and as such, data will not be compared to the 2009 -2010 season in this report. Limitations Influenza Testing Testing of c linical specimens for influenza varied according to testing algorithms at t he Provincial Public Health Laboratory Network (PPHLN) , Cape Breton Regional Hospital Laboratory and the IWK Health Centre Laboratory . Respiratory virus testing at the PPHLN and Cape Breton Regional Hospital Laboratory was only offered for acute care inpatients, long -term care and adult residential care facility residents , and public health certified sentinel ER testing requests. Influenza t esting at the IWK Health Centre was offered for IWK inpatients, emergency patients and other clients as appropriate for clinical purposes . Testing of patients was completed under the guidance of the Chief of IWK Laboratories and at the discretion of IWK H ealth physicians. Vaccine Coverage A number of limitations should be considered when interpreting the vaccination coverage rates presented in this report. With the exception of the computerized MSI physician -billing database, surveillance data were collected in a paper -based format from the sources described above . There may Influenza Surveillance Report 2013 -2014 Season v1.0 Page 7 of 16 Page7 be under reporting in f acilities as some do not report staff and residents/patients immunized by other providers, so coverage rates of facilities may not be accurate. There is also the potential for duplicate reporting if a staff member of a facility who received vaccine from a physician would be captured in the MSI database and may al so have been reported by the facility in which the individual was employed. Coverage rates among health care workers in acute care facilities cannot be compared over time. Historically, health care workers were distinguished as direct contact and support staff , but these categories were never clearly defined, which may have caused inconsistencies in report ing. Further, during the 2009 -2010 influenza pandemic, health care worker denominator data w as not available and as a result, coverage rates could not b e calculated. Data for this target group were not collected for the 2010 -2011 influenza season and so rates were not available for this season. Health care worker immunization data collection resumed for the 2011 -2012 influenza season. Children less than nine years of age receiving seasonal influenza vaccine for the first time require two doses administered at least four weeks apart. Due to limitations in data extraction, it is difficult to determine the number of doses administered to a specific individu al. Each dose is counted as someone being fully immunized and the numbers presented in this age group may overestimate true vaccine coverage rates. Results Influenza Cases Cases of Influenza A (seasonal H3 and pandemic strain pH1N1 ) and influenza B were reported in Nova Scotia during the 201 3-2014 season. The number of laboratory -confirmed cases of each type is shown in Figure 1. The predominant strain circulating in the province was Influenza A, accounting for 76.1 % of all laboratory -confirmed . There were 160 hospitalized cases of influenza and 13 deaths reported. Deaths include individuals with a positive influenza test result. For some individuals with pre -existing conditions, influenza may not have been the major contributing cause of death o r hospitalization.

Of the 52 outbreaks in LTC facilities this year, enhanced respiratory virus testing was able to identify an agent in 79% of outbreaks. Causative agents for more than one infectious agent was identified (2.4%) . Two respiratory outbreaks (1 influenza and 1 parainfluenza) were reported in acute care facilities and an agent was identified in 100% of the outbreaks . Schools/daycares reported increased absenteeism due to respiratory illness on 12 instances during the 201 3-2014 influenza season . Influenza -Like Illness The proportion s of patient visits with influenza -like illness over time, monitored at emergency rooms across the pr ovince , are presented in Figure 4 . The proportion of e mergency room visits with ILI was consistent ly at or below 2.2% of visits throughout the season , with activity increas ing in late December . This was followed by a gradual decrease in ER visits with ILI after February 8.

Of these, PHS distributed a total o f 445,163 doses (9 9.9%) of influenza vaccine to vaccine providers. The overall vaccine coverage rate for Nova Scotia was 41.8% (Table 1). The coverage rate by DHA ranged from 35.3 % (DHA 5) to 45.5% (DHA 4 ). Table 1: Influenza vaccine coverage by provider type for those 6 months of age and older by DHA, Nova Scotia, 2013-2014 Influenza Season Influenza Vaccine Coverage Estimates for specified populations Children 6 to 59 Months of Age While all Nova Scotians are encouraged to be immunized, the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) emphasizes that certain groups remain the top priority for influenza immunization . Children aged 6 to 59 months are one of the identified target groups that are a priority for influenza immunization. Pharmacists do not provide immunizations to children under the age of five years. The influenza vaccine coverage rate for children aged 6 to 59 months was 45.4%. The majority ( 50.8%) of children aged 6 to 59 months were vaccinated by primary care physicians (Table 2).
