The authors investigated this duality in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), which, with other gastrointestinal cancers, exhibits frequent inactivation of the TGF - mediator Smad4. Their work demonstrates that TGF- tumor suppression functions through an epithelial -mesenchymal transition (EMT) -mediated disruption of a lineage -specific transcriptional network . See preview article below. EMT: Matter of Life or Death? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26919422 Journal : Cell Institution(s) : UT MD : Anirban Maitra, MBBS: recipient, 2014 Robert Aronson - Innovative Grant and 2004 Career Development Award and member, Scientific and Medical Advisory Board Major finding : Preview of article above. TGF- is long considered a \"protean\" cytokine in cancer, changing its role from anti - to pro -tumorigenic in a context -dependent manner. In this issue of Cell, David et al. use mouse models of pancreatic cancer to shed light on the mechanistic basis of how TGF--induced EMT is coupled to either apoptosis or tumor progression . Genetics and Biology of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26883357 Journal : Genes & Development Institution(s) : University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, T X, and others Corresponding author(s) : Ronald DePinho or Haoqiang Ying Pancr eatic Cancer Network -affiliated author s: o Alec Kimmelman, MD, PhD: recipient, 2010 Career Development Award o Giulio Draetta, MD, PhD: PI, 2014 Skip Viragh - Research Acceleration Network Grant o Anirban Maitra, MBBS: recipient, 2014 Robert Aronson - Innovative Grant and 2004 Career Development Award and member, Scientific and Medical Advisory Board Major finding : A deeper understanding of cancer cell biology, particularly altered cancer cell metabolism and impaired DNA repair processes, is providing nov el therapeutic strategies that show strong preclinical activity. Elucidation of tumor biology principles, most notably a deeper understanding of the complexity of immune regulation in the tumor microenvironment, has provided an exciting framework to reawak en the immune system to attack pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cancer cells. While the long road of translation lies ahead, the path to meaningful clinical progress has never been clearer to improve PDAC patient survival . 8 Tumor Microenvironment Derived Exosomes Pleiotropically Modulate Cancer Cell Metabolism http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26920219 Journal : eLIFE Institution(s) : Rice University, Houston, TX , and others Corresponding author(s) : Deepak Na grath Cancer Action Network -affiliated author : Anirban Maitra, MBBS: recipient, 2014 Robert Aronson - Innovative Grant and 2004 Career Development Award and member, Scientific and Medical Advisory Board Major finding : Using intra -exosomal metabolomics, the authors provide compelling evidence that ( CAF)-derived exosomes (CDEs) lipids, and TCA -cycle intermediates that are avidly utilized by cancer cells for central carbon metabolism and promoting tum or growth under nutrient deprivation or nutrient stressed conditions .

Thes e findings designate cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP3A5) as a predictor of therapy response and as a tumor cell - autonomous detoxification mechanism that must be overcome to prevent drug resistance . Multiplexed Pancreatic Genome Enginee ring and Mice Munich, Germany , and others Corresponding author(s) : Roland Rad Major finding : Here the authors show transfection -based multiplexed delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 to the pancreas of adult mice, allowing simultaneous editing of multiple gene sets in individ ual cells. The low-frequency mosa ic pattern of transfection -based CRISPR/Cas9 delivery faithfully recapitulates the stochastic nature of human tumorigenesis, supporting wide applicability for biological/preclinical research . miR-137 Modulates a Tumor Suppressor Network -Inducing Senescence in Pancreatic Cancer Cells http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26904954 Journal : Cell Reports Institution(s) : Sir Mortimer B. Davis Jewish General Hospital, Montr\u00e9al, Canada, and others Correspon ding author(s) : Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Mallette or St\u00e9phane Richard Major finding : The authors show that miR -137 targets KDM4A mRNA during Ras -induced senescence and activates both p53 and retinoblastoma (pRb) tumor suppressor pathways. These results suggest that modu lating levels of miR -137 may be important for triggering tumor suppressor networks in pancreatic cancer. 9 KRAS Engages AGO2 to Enhance Cellular Transformation http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/268 54235 Journal : Cell Reports Institution(s) : University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, and others Corresponding author(s) : Arul Chinnaiyan Major finding : Overall, the functional interaction with Argonaute 2 (AGO2) extends KRAS function beyond its canonical r ole in signaling .

The strong inverse association observed in case -control studies may be affected by biases (eg, recall and selection biases) that particularly affect case -control studies and/or potential publication bias. Future prospective studies of vitamin C intake and pancreatic cancer are needed . PlGF/VEGFR -1 Signaling Promotes Macrophage Polarization an d Accelerated Tumor Progression in Obesity http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26861455 Journal : Clinical Cancer Research Institution(s) : Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Bo ston, MA, and others Corresponding author(s) : Rakesh K. Jain or Dai Fukumura Major finding : Obesity promotes pancreatic and breast cancer progression via mechanisms that are poorly understood. Although obesity is associated with increased systemic levels o f placental growth factor (PlGF), the role of PlGF in obesity -induced tumor progression is not known. Targeting PlGF/VEGFR -1 signaling reprograms the tumor immune microenvironment and inhibits obesity - induced acceleration of tumor progression. 11 EARLY DETE CTION, DIAGNOSIS, AND PROGNOSIS Using Quantitative Seroproteomics to Identify Antibody Biomarkers in Pancreatic Cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26842750 Journal : Cancer Immunology Research Institution(s) : Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, and others Corresponding author(s) : Robert Anders or Elizabeth Jaffee Pancreatic Cancer Action Network -affiliated author s: o Dung Le, MD: PI, 2014 Fredman Family Foundation - Research Acceleration Network Grant o Elizabeth Jaffee , MD: member, Emeritus Scientific and Medical Advisory Board Major finding : The authors ' laboratory has developed an allogeneic, granulocyte -macrophage colony - stimulating factor (GM -CSF) -secreting pancreatic cancer vaccine (GVAX) that has been tested in phase II clinica l trials. Here, they employed a serum antibodies -based SILAC immunoprecipitation (SASI) approach to identify proteins that elicit an antibody response after vaccination. The authors show that the novel SASI approach can identify antibody targets specifically expressed in patients with improved disease -free survival after cancer vaccine therapy. These targets need further validation to be considered as pos sible pancreatic cancer biomarkers .

Adjuvant chemotherapy provided an overall survival (OS) advantage likely related to its effect on reducing both local recurrence (LR) and distant recurrence ( DR). Adjuvant chemoradiation therapy appears to decrease LR, but not DR, and therefore has less impact on OS. Future investigations and treatment protocols should consider additional adjuvant chemotherapy rather than adjuvant chemoradiation therapy in the treatment of PDAC . Minimally Invasive Versus Open Pancreatoduodenectomy: Systematic Review and Meta -analysis of Comparative Cohort and Registry Studies http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26863398 Journal : Annals of Surgery Institution(s) : Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands , and others Corresponding author(s) : Marc Besselink Major finding : This study aimed to appraise and to evaluate the curren t evidence on minimally invasive pancreatoduodenectomy (MIPD) versus open pancreatoduodenectomy only in comparative cohort and registry studies. Outcomes after MIPD seem promising in comparative cohort studies, despite the presence of bias, whereas registr y studies report higher mortality in low -volume centers. The introduction of MIPD should be closely monitored and probably done only within structured training programs in high -volume centers .

CD40 activation can disrupt these barriers by inducing macrophages, originating from peripheral blood monocytes, to deplete fibrosis. The authors' findings demonstrate that fibrosis in PDAC is a bidirectional process that can be rapidly altered by manipulating a subset of tumor -infiltrating monocytes leading to enhanced chemotherapy Autophagy I nhibition http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26876211 Journal : Oncogene Institution(s) : The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX Corresponding author(s) : Jason Fleming 13 Pancreatic Cancer Action Network -affiliated author : Jason Fleming, MD: co -PI, 2015 Research Acceleration Network Grant and member, Scientific and Medical Advisory Board Major finding : Lumican , an extracellular cells (PDACs), drives the formation of a tumor - specific microenvironment. Here the author s investigated the role of extracellular lumican in chemotherapy -mediated cancer therapy. Together, their findings demonstrate that extracellular lumican augments cytotoxicity of Ductal Adenocarcinoma http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26858448 Journal : PNAS Institution(s) : University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC , and others Corresponding author(s) : Joseph DeSimone and Jen Jen Yeh Major finding : The authors have fabricated implantable iontophoretic devices and tested the local iontophoretic delivery of FOLFIRINOX for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in an orthotopic patient - derived xenograft model. Local iontophoretic delivery of cytotoxic agents should be considered for the treatment of patients with unresectable nonmetastatic disease and for patients with the need for palliation of local symptoms, and may be considered as a neoadjuvant approach to improve resection rates and outc ome in patients with localized and locally advanced pancreatic cancer . Irinotecan Delivery by Lipid -Coated Mesoporous Silica Shows Efficacy and Safety over for Pancreatic Cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26835979 Journal : ACS NANO Institution(s) : University of California, Los Angeles, CA Corresponding author(s) : Andre Nel or Huan Meng Major finding : Since irinotecan contributes significantly to FOLFIRINOX toxicity (bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract), the authors' aim was to reduce the toxicity of this drug by a custom -designed mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSNP) platform, which uses a proton gradient for high -dose irinotecan loading across a coated lipid bilayer (LB). They propose that the combination of high efficacy and reduced toxicity by the LB -MSNP carrier could facilitate the use of irinotecan as a first - line therapeutic to improve pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma surviva l. Pooled Screening fo r Antiproliferative Inhibitors of Protein -Protein Interactions http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26900867 Journal : Nature Chemical Biology Institution(s) : University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario , Canada , and others Corresponding author(s) : Philip Kim Major finding : Protein -protein interactions (PPIs) are emerging as a promising new class of drug targets. Here, the authors present a novel high -throughput approach to screen inhibitors of PPIs in a pancreatic cancer cell line. The authors' screen reveals new drug targets and peptide drug leads, and it provides a rich data set covering phenotypes for the inhibition of thousands of interactions . Clinical Trials: New Drug for Pancreatic Cancer Highlights the Dual Effect of Regulatory Approvals http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26902963 Review of: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2661 5328 Journal : Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology Institution(s) : Columbia University Medical Center , New York, NY Corresponding author(s) : Susan Bates 14 Major finding : The recent FDA approval of MM -398 as a second -line treatment of metastatic pancreatic canc er, based on a 1.9 -month overall survival benefit observed in the NAPOLI -1 trial, adds a new therapeutic option for this notoriously difficult -to-treat disease; however, by discouraging clinical trial enrol lment, this approval might have negative consequen ces for the development of novel agents, which remain an essential unmet need . Current Standards and New Innovative Approaches for Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed /26851397 Journal : European Journal of Cancer Institution(s) : Institut de Canc\u00e9rologie de Lorraine and Lorraine University, Vandoeuvre -l\u00e8s-Nancy, France , and others Corresponding author(s) : Thierry Conroy Major finding : This article reviews the state -of-the-art in the management of this disease and the new innovative approaches that may help to accelerate progress in treating its victims. Industry news: Incyte Announces Decision to Discontinue JANUS Studies of Ruxolitinib plus Capecitabine in Patients with Advanced Metastatic http://phx.corporate -ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=69764&p=irol -newsArticle_print&ID=2137479 Company : Incyte Corporation , Wilmington, DE Major finding : Incyte Corporation announced its decision to discontinue the Phase 3 study (JANUS 1) of ruxolitinib or placebo in combination with capecitabine for the second -line treatment of patients with advanced or met astatic pancreatic cancer. The decision to stop the study was made after a planned interim analysis of JANUS 1 demonstrated that ruxolitinib plus capecitabine did not show a sufficient level of efficacy to warrant continuation. Ruxolitinib (Jakafi) is a fi rst-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor .
