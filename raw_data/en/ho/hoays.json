GBM is a highly immunosuppressivetumor and there are limitations to a safe immune response in the central nervous system.To date, there have been several failures of phase 3 immune therapy clinical trials in GBM.These trials have targeted single components of an antitumor immune response. Learningfrom these failures, the future of immunotherapy for GBM appears most hopeful forcombination of immune therapies to overcome the profound immunosuppression of this disease. Understanding biomarkers for appropriate patient selection as well as tumor progression are necessary for implementation of immunotherapy for GBM Introduction Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and most aggressive primary malignant brain tumor in adults. Clin- ical trials in GBM have led to incremental improvedmedian overall survival (mOS) that have improved sur-vival in the general GBM population [ 1\u0081]. While the mostrecent positive phase 3 clinical trial of tumor treating fields (TTF) had a mOS of 20.5 months [ 2\u0081\u0081], it is the tail of long-term survivors that continues to provide hope to patients and neuro-oncologists. TTF gained acceptancenot just because of a significant improvement in survival,but an increase in 5-year survival to 13% compared to 5% in the standard of care (SOC) arm [ 2\u0081\u0081]. Durable re- sponses to immunotherapy, seen in many cancers, havere-invigorated the study of immunotherapy in GBM. The brain is not as immuno-privileged as once thought, yet obstacles remain for immunotherapy intreating GBM. Malignant gliomas are one of the mostimmunosuppressive solid tumors due in part to lym-phopenia driven by bone marrow suppression [ 3]. GBM is also an immunologically quiet tumor, with low tumormutational burden (TMB), few tumor infiltrating T cells(TILS), and low PD-1/PD-L1 expression, especiallywhen compared to other cancers where immunotherapy has been the most successful [ 4,5]. GBM is also a profoundly heterogeneous tumor which facilitates im- mune evasion [ 6]. The SOC for newly diagnosed GBM, the combination of radiation therapy (RT) andalkylating chemotherapy, confounds this immunosup-pression. Often steroids are necessary for managementof peritumoral edema but they decrease the efficacy ofimmunotherapies [ 7,8]. In addition to hurdles for stim- ulating an effective immune response against GBM, ro-bust immune activation within the intracranial spaceposes clinical safety risks including complications ofcytokine release syndrome and autoimmune encephali-tis [9-11]. Despite these challenges, long-term re- sponders to immunotherapy have been reported in clin-ical trials of GBM, but no predictive biomarkers exist atthis time [ 12\u0081]. Immunotherapy in GBM has a long history, includ- ing immune stimulation, antibody-mediated immuno-therapies, adoptive cellular immunotherapies, and vac-cines [ 13]. At this time, phase 3 clinical trials have not demonstrated efficacy for immunotherapy in GBM andno FDA-approved immunotherapy immunotherapy for GBM, a com-bination approach will likely be required. Additionally, identification of biomarkers for patient selection and disease surveillance are essential. Given the risks of re-current tumor sampling, there is a search for serum, CSF,and imaging biomarkers for GBM. Here, we discuss recent findings and ongoing clinical research into immunotherapy for GBM, includingcheckpoint inhibitors, vaccines, CAR-T therapy, and viraltherapy. We will also discuss our current understanding of biomarkers in GBM that influence candidacy for clin- ical trials and may explain the response and failures todifferent immune therapies. Checkpoints Checkpoint inhibition has revolutionized treatment of several advanced ma-lignancies providing hope for cancer treatment and resulting in a well-deservedNobel Prize. Inhibitors of immune checkpoints such as PD-1, PD-L1, andCTLA-4 promote a shift from the normal balance of the adaptive immunesystem to increased immune activation [ 14]. In preclinical data, checkpoint inhibitors showed promise for treatment of GBM; however, translation of thispreclinical work to patients was complicated by CNS toxicity when used to treatother malignancies [ 11,15]. An early phase 1 study of nivolumab (nivo) alone or in combination with ipilimumab (ipi) for treatment of recurrent GBM (rGBM) found higher toxicitywith the combination PD-1 and comparable mOS (12-month mOS 40% v. 30%) [ 16]. Based on the tolerance of nivo monotherapy and promising mOS compared to historical controls, a large phase 3 trial wasdeveloped. CheckMate-143 randomized patients with rGBM to treatment withnivo (BEV). The genotoxic stress of radiation and chemother-apy used in SOC treatment for newly diagnosed GBM were predicted to increase the TMB in rGBM and favor response to checkpoint inhibition. Unfortunately, at interim analysis of 369 patients, nivo did not demonstrate a mOS benefitover BEV (9.8 m nivo v. 10 m BEV) [ 17]. It should be noted however that for patients who did respond, those responses were more durable in the nivo arm24 Page 2 of 15 Curr. Treat. Options in Oncol. (2019) 20: 24(11.1 m nivo v 5.3 BEV), again raising enthusiasm for a tail of long term survivors [ 16]. A single center retrospective of the use of pembrolizumab (pembro) in rGBM also found no benefit [ 18]. Randomized controlled clinical trials examining the use of nivo in the setting of newly diagnosed GBM(CheckMate 498 and 548) are ongoing. Checkpoint inhibition for GBM was recently reviewed in this journal [ 19]. Promising data from NSCLC, head and neck cancer, and bladder cancer has stimulated interest in neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibition in GBM [ 20,21]. Reported at Society for NeuroOnclogy 2018, patients receiving two doses of pembro prior to re-resection of rGBM had improved mOS (13.7 m neoadju-vant v. 7.5 m adjuvant only) compared to those starting pembro after re-resection [ 22]. While a small study, this work raises hope that the combination of pembro with surgery may help increase antigen exposure as well as TIL infiltration into rGBM. Several other phase 1 and 2 clinical trials are currently examining the role of checkpoint inhibitors in combination with other therapies (Table 1). There is great interest in the combination of radiation with checkpoint inhibition, based partly on the idea that radiation may increase antigen presentation as well aspromote the abscopal effect. These clinical trials are examining use in bothnewly diagnosed GBM with standard fractionated chemoradiation, as well as inthe rGBM with radiosurgery and hypo-fractioned radiation. There is also a phase 1 study examining use of pembro with MRI-guided laser ablation for rGBM. Addition of pembro to the SOC including TTF is also being studied inthe 2-THE-TOP phase 2 clinical trial (NCT03405792). Checkpoint inhibitionwith combination vaccines and oncolytic viruses will be discussed below. Preclinical research suggested that low-dose VEGF inhibition promotes the switch in the tumor microenvironment immunosuppressive (M2-like) toa more of BEV found disease control rate of 67.4% in 46 patients treated [ 24]. Aside from the change in the tumor microenvironment, BEV may play another important role in GBM patients as a steroid substitute [ 25,26]. A recent retrospective study of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients demonstrated a greater than10% reduction in overall response rate (complete and partial responses) inpatients who were on any dose of steroid greater than 10 mg of prednisone aday (= 1.6 mg of dexamethasone) prior to starting treatment with a checkpointinhibitor. This baseline steroid use was significantly associated with decreased PFS and mOS [ 8]. This raises concern that necessary management of peritumoral edema in GBM patients, even with the minimal effective dose of dexamethasone needed to control symptoms, may be sufficient to dampenresponse to checkpoint inhibition and possibly other immunotherapy. In GBM,BEV can be used as a steroid substitute and the safety of the combination of BEVwith checkpoint inhibition may provide an opportunity to treat peritumoraledema without the immunosuppressive effects of steroids. For rGBM, there areseveral ongoing clinical trials examining PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors in combi- nation with BEV. Preliminary results from these studies support the safety of this combination; however, among rGBM patients, the combination of pembrowith BEV does not improve survival [ 27]. At this point, there is no role for checkpoint inhibition monotherapy in the treatment of most patients with GBM; however, the combination of checkpointCurr. Treat. Options in Oncol. (2019) 20: 24 Page 3 of 15 24inhibition with other immune stimulating therapies may be considered. Seri- ous, and even fatal, CNS immune adverse events have been reported withcheckpoint inhibition [ 11]. Given this risk with checkpoint inhibitor mono- therapy, as therapies seek to increase immune activation against GBM, thereTable 1. Combination Checkpoint Inhibition Trials in GBM Checkpoint inhibitorAdditional therapy Phase Clinical trials Page 4 Treat. Options in Oncol. (2019) 20: 24remains concern for complications for over activation of the immune system within the brain. Checkpoint biomarkers In parallel with these therapeutic trials, there are several ongoing studies to helpbetter understand biomarkers to predict response to checkpoint inhibition. A number of biomarkers are thought to predict response to PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors in other malignancies. Specifically in NSCLC, it has become increas-ingly clear that response to PD-1 inhibitors correlates with the level of PD-L1expression in tumor. In Keynote-042, a study of pembro compared receiving pembro had a 20.0-month mOS compared to 12.2 months in the chemotherapy group (HR 0.69). In contrast, patientswith expression between 1 and 49% receiving pembro had a mOS 13.4 months versus 12.1 months with chemotherapy (HR 0.92) [ 28]. The CheckMate-057 study of nivo monotherapy versus docetaxel demonstrated no benefit for checkpoint inhibition in tumors with G1% PD-L1 expression [ 29]. A study of 94 patients with GBM found median PD-L1 expressional 2.77% and that PD-L1expression correlated with worse outcome [ 30] while an earlier study did not find PD-L1 to be a negative prognostic factor [ 31]. The role of PD-L1 expression on GBM tumor cell in response to checkpoint inhibition is unclear. To better understand changes in the tumor microenvironment with PD-1 inhibition, pembro was given prior to re-resection in patients with GBM(NCT02337686). Analysis of the resected tumor demonstrated low T cellinfiltrate that was not modulated by PD-1 inhibition [ 32]. Of note, while use of pembro did not improve survival, all patients required steroids after pembro.Studies of neoadjuvant checkpoint inhibition have found a trend toward in-creased TIL fractions as well as changes in several immune markers [ 22]. Two tests which reflect the overall gene tic stability of tumors, TMB and micro- satellite instability (MSI), also play a role in predicting which patients will have meaningful respon ses to PD-1 axis drugs. In 2017, pembro was approved for patients with MSI or mismatch repair defic iencies for all solid tumors regardless of histology. Higher TMB and MSI correlate with longer mOS [ 33]. In glioma patients, favorable status across all three of these biomarkers (PD-L1, MSI, TMB) appears to be rare and suggest that only a minority of patients will respond to checkpointmonotherapy [ 34]. Low frequency of these markers in GBM may be contributing to the disappointing results of PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapies to date [ 35]. Vaccines Cancer vaccine therapy in GBM is not preventative, but rather is designed toinduce an immune response against the tumor. For GBM, vaccines encompass arange of therapies including direct exposure to antigens (peptide or DNA) in combination with immune-stimulating molecules as well as stimulated patient-derived antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells (DC)). GBM antigentargets are most often tumor-associated antigens given GBM-specific antigensare rare. Some of these antigens are restricted by HLA types, limiting the patientpopulation in which these vaccines may be considered. Use of whole tumorCurr. Treat. Options in Oncol. (2019) 20: 24 Page 5 of 15 24lysate as an antigen was lethal when studied in animal models [ 36]; however, modifications to GBM tumor lysate, such as heat shock proteins (HSP) and DC vaccines, have been well tolerated with promising early results. Tumor antigenvaccines and customized vaccines will be discussed separately below. Tumor antigen vaccines Cancer tumor antigens may be tumor-specific or tumor-associated antigens. Atthis time, the studied tumor-specific of epidermal growth reported in 25 -30% of GBM and was thought to be an independent negative prognostic factor [ 37]. Several forms of EGFRvIII vaccines were studied in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials with promising results. This leads to the development ofrindopepimut, a conjugated EGFRvIII-specific peptide (also known as CDX-110and PEPvIII), by Celldex therapeutics. Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials demonstrated promising mOS compared to historical controls leading to an international phase 3, ACT IV, clinical trial in newly diagnosed GBM patients with EGFRvIIImutation. This randomized study of rindopepimut versus control (KLH), addedto the SOC adjuvant temozolomide, showed an impressive mOS of20.1 months in the vaccine arm. However, the control of KLH alone had 20-month mOS, far exceeding the historical controls of 15.2 months. This calledinto question EGFRvIII as a negative prognostic biomarker. Interestingly, loss ofantigen was seen in both the treatment and control arms [ 38\u0081\u0081]. A phase 2 study of rindopepimut in rGBM in combination with BEV does favor treatmentwith mOS of 12 months in the vaccine group compared to 8.8 months in theKLH group. This finding suggests that combination of vaccine with anti-VEGFtherapy may be necessary for a single antigen vaccine to demonstrate survivalbenefit. At this point, the future of studies of rindopepimut is unclear; however,there are ongoing CAR-T studies antigen (discussedbelow). A number of tumor-associated antigens are being studied in GBM, and while not specific to tumor cells, limited expression elsewhere makes these safe targetsfor study [ 39]. Another single antigen vaccine with early promise is SurVaxM, a peptide mimic of survivin conjugated to KLH. While survivin is expressed in themajority of GBM, the vaccine is HLA-restricted, limiting patient inclusion [ 40]. Phase 2 results of this vaccine added to the SOC adjuvant temozolomide innewly diagnosed GBM were presented at SNO 2018. While immature, mOS inthis single arm phase 2 study was a promising 26 months [ 41]. A randomized phase 2 for new diagnosis GBM of the combination of SurVaxM with PD1 blockade is planned. There are several other peptide vaccines targeting multiple antigens. Another recently p resented vaccine, SL701, consists of short synthetic pep- tides targeting IL-13Ra2, ephrin A2, and survivin. This is also an HLA-A2- restricted vaccine that has been studi ed in the first recurrence of GBM, and was found to have a mOS of 12 months in the second phase of this study.Target-specific CD8 response seen in 8/28 patients was associated withlonger survival [ 42]. A six synthetic peptide stimulated DC vaccine with initial promise was ICT- 107. In a phase 1 trial, it was found to be safe with a suggestion of benefit topatients who were HLA-A2 positive. STING (NCT 02546102) was a phase 324 Page 6 of 15 Curr. Treat. Options in Oncol. (2019) 20: 24clinical trial that opened in 2016, but later suspended in 2017 due to funding. There are many other ongoing studies of vaccines targeting tumor-associatedantigens in GBM using peptide, DNA with immune stimulants as well asstimulated DC cells. A review of completed vaccine trials in GBM was recentlypublished this year by Michael Lim [ 39]. Customized vaccines For patients who have surgically accessible disease, custom vaccines are apromising area of clinical research. These vaccines require a minimum volumeof resectable tumor to generate a custom vaccine, which limits the populationof eligible patients. DC-Vax-L uses whole tumor lysate to pulse patient-derived DCs. Currently over 10 years from diagnosis, some of the patients enrolled in the original phase 1 study of this vaccine are still alive [ 43]. The phase 3 of DC-Vax-L in newly diagnosed GBM results is still blinded; however, recent reports described a mOS of 23.1 months for all partic-ipants (90% of whom received the DC- Vax-L treatment due to crossover design). While the data remains blinded, there are concerns that thismay only be interpreted as a single-arm study of 331 patients due tocross over as a result of pseudo-progression and not true progression[44\u0081]. Again promising are reports of durable responders in the phase 3 with survival exceeding 7 years. This vaccine is also being studied in aphase 2 clinical trial in combinat ion with the PD-1 inhibitor, nivo (NCT03014804). Another promising custom vaccine being studied for new diagnosis GBM is HSPPC-96 (Prophage). In a single-arm phase 2 trial, mOS was 23.8 months;however, when patients were separated by PD-L1 expression on myeloid cells,mOS for those with low expression was an impressive 44.7 months [ 45]. HSPPC-96 is currently being studied in combination with pembro for newly diagnosed GBM. HSPPC-96 was also studied in 41 patients with rGBM with a mOS of 42.6 weeks [ 46]. A summary of key vaccine clinical trials in GBM is provided in Table 2. Vaccine biomarkers At this time, tumor-associated and tumo r-specific antigen vaccines require confirmation that the tumor expresses the targeted antigen. Additionally,many tumor antigens are restricted to sp ecific HLA types (class I restricted cytotoxic T cell or class II restricted helper T cell epitopes), for exampleHER-2, IL13Ra2, MAGE-1, and survivin. For these gen vaccines, effective vaccines requi re tumor antigens that are presented o nt h e s er e s t r i c t e dH L Aa l l e l e st og e n e r a t ea ni m m u n er e s p o n s e[ 47]. This narrows the generalizability of these vaccines and clinical trials restrictenrollment to patients with the specif ic HLA alleles of interest, or stratify results based on HLA type. Outside of antigen expression and HLA subtyping, there are not prospective biomarkers for response to GBM vaccines. All vaccine clinical trials are lookingfor correlates to predict immune response and hopefully survival response.Some of those that have been examined include IL-12 production [ 48], myeloidCurr.

Additionally, as the DC-Vax-L clinical trial has demonstrated, our current imaging markers have undergone dramatic revolution in the past 10 years limiting the use of MRI for determining progression-free survival as a clinical trial outcome [ 53\u0081]. CAR-T CAR-T cell therapy is a newer therapy in oncology, currently approved in B cell lymphoma and leukemia [ 54]. In brief, CAR-T cells are autologous or allogeneic T cells modified such that the extracellular domains recognizes a unique tumor- associated antigen and the intracellular domain contains a T cell activation signal [ 55\u0081]. These modified T cells are then administered into the patient, where they can initiate targeted lysis of cells bearing the associated tumorantigen [ 56]. CAR-T cell therapy has the advantage of bypassing the need for MHC presentation of antigen and development of adaptive immune responseas well as bypassing the need for co-stimulatory signals. Given the success with B cell lymphomas and leukemias, the potential of CAR-T cell therapy for solid tumors, including GBM, has been undergoing investigation [ 57]. To date, GBM patients treated with CAR-T cell therapy have not had unmanageable CNS effects, a concern given the side effect of elevated intracranial pressure and associated encephalopathy seen in CAR-T cell therapyin B cell lymphoma [ 58]. The tumor antigens that have been most investigated for CAR targets in GBM to date are IL-13Ra2, EGFRvIII, and Her2. Interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2 (IL- 13Ra2) modulates activation along the rapamycin pathway, and is typically asso ciated with worsened prognosis in GBM [59,60]. A safety and efficacy trial of CAR T cell therapy in GBM with IL-13Ra2 as the tumor marker was performed on a group of three patients who had a post-resectionintracranial infusion, followed by a trial o f post-resection direct intratumoral infusion followed intraventricular infusion [ 61,62\u0081]. One patient had a dramatic response with clinical and radiographic response that lasted for 7.5 months; however, hisdisease ultimately did recur [ 62\u0081]. This CAR-T target is continuing to be studied in intratumoral, intraventricular, and dual delivery systems. EGFRvIII, as described above in the vaccine section, has also been used a CAR-T cell therapy target. A study regarding tumor infiltration of CAR-T cell performed on ten patients who were given a single peripheral CAR-T cell infusion [ 63]. Brain specimens in the two patients who underwent post- infusion resection showed increased intratumoral EGFRvIIICAR-T DNA com-pared to peripheral blood after 2 weeks, and most patients showed decreasedexpression of EGFRvIII in tumors resected after infusion, suggesting infiltrationof the CAR-T cells into the tumor. Patients did not experience tumor regression,although it is notable that this was a particularly poor prognostic group (MGMTnegative and most with multifocal disease). Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), a tyrosine kinase receptor with high expression in some forms of GBM, has also been used as apotential target [ infusion of virus-specific (CMV seroposi- tive) HER-2 CAR-T cells demonstrated relative this method as well aspersistence of HER-2 CAR-T cells over time (measured for 1 year) [ 66\u0081]. Seven24 Page 10 of 15 Curr. Treat. Options in Oncol. (2019) 20: 24of the 17 patients did have a period of 8 weeks to 29 months of stable disease and one patient had partial response [ 66\u0081]. There are currently several active trials investigating the range of intracavitary, intraventricular, and intravenous modes o f administration of CAR-T cells for the antigens above as well as EphA2 (NCT02575 261). Current studies suggest encour- aging results regarding safety and penetrance of CAR-T cells into GBM, althoughfindings regarding effect on tumor growt h and recurrence are less conclusive. No clear biomarkers for treatment response have been established for CAR-T in GBM. In other malignancies, mechanisms of response and resistance have beenstudied. It is reasonable to consider that similar biomarkers will be found for CAR- Tf o rG B M[ 67-69]. Given at this time, CAR-T cell therapy is targeting single antigens, antigen escape will likely lim it effectiveness of CAR-T monotherapy. Viral therapy Viral therapy, while initially designed as a mechanism of gene delivery to providetumor cells with susceptibility to chem otherapy, is now recognized as a form of immunotherapy. Infection of tumor cells with virus attracts the innate immune system leading to cytokine release and tumor cell lysis. This promotes generation ofan adaptive immune response to new tumor antigens and potentially development of a long-term immunotherapy effect [ 70]. While no proven survival benefit has been shown, the excitement about this th erapy is largely driven by the population of long-term survivors which was recently reviewed [ 12\u0081]. Two of these therapies have made it to phase 3 clinical trials, ASPECT and Toca5. The first, ASPECT, studied a replication defective aden ovirus, sitimagene ceradenovec, in newly diagnosed GBM [ 71]. This clinical trial enrolled during early 2000s when the neuro-oncology community w as transitioning to the current SOC of adjuvant TMZ. As a result, not all patient s within the trial were treated with what is now considered SOC. While there was prolonged time to death or re-intervention in the patients treated wi th virus, there was no difference in mOS. The Toca5 clinical trial is comparing Toca-511 (a non-lytic retrovirus ex- pressing cytosine deaminase) to standard therapies for recurrent high gradegliomas. This trial recently completed enrollment; however, phase 3 data is notyet available. If the patients in the phase 1 study were narrowed to patients whowould have been eligible for the phase 3, there were 5 patients out of 23 whohad durable responses (defined as greater than 24 weeks) and as of August2017, all of those patients were still alive, one over 4 years [ 72]. Several other viral therapies have reported GBM patients with durable responses [ 12\u0081]. These include in another adenovirus that functions as means ofgene delivery to allow local delivery of IL-12 [ 73]. Ongoing study of most of these viruses is now including safety for the combination of viral delivery with checkpoint inhibition. Conclusion The success of immunotherapy in GBM faces several obstacles including thehighly immunosuppressive nature of GBM and the limitations of the immuneCurr. Treat. Options in Oncol.

Learning from phase 3 clinical trial failures, the future of immunotherapy for GBM appears most hopeful forcombination therapies driven by biomarkers for appropriate patient selection.Given the extreme need for improved survival in GBM, current clinical trials areevaluating checkpoint inhibition in combination with novel therapies includ- ing vaccines, CAR-T cell therapy, and viral therapy.
