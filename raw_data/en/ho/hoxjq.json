Although much pro- gress has been made in the understanding of macro- phage activation, polarization, and function, the transcriptional programs regulating these pro- cesses remain poorly characterized. We stimulated human macrophages with diverse activation signals, acquiring a data set of 299 macrophage trans- criptomes. Analysis of this data set revealed a spec- trum of macrophage activation states extending the current M1 versus M2-polarization model. Network analyses identied central transcriptional regulators associated with all macrophage activation comple- mented by regulators related to stimulus-specic programs. Applying these transcriptional programs to human alveolar macrophages from smokers and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) revealed an unexpected loss of inflammatory signatures in COPD patients. Finally, by integrating murine data from the ImmGen project we propose a rened, activation-independent core signature for human and murine macrophages. This resource serves as a framework for future research into regulation of macrophage activation in health and disease. INTRODUCTION During the last two decades, a conceptual framework for the description of macrophage activation has been developed. According to this framework, macrophages can be polarized into classically (M1) or alternatively (M2) activated cells repre- senting two polar extremes of signals ( Biswas and Mantovani, 2010 ). The M1 versus M2 model has been very helpful in describing immune responses duringacute infections, allergies, asthma, and obesity ( Chinetti- Gbaguidi and Staels, 2011 ). However, observations obtained from macrophages involved in chronic inflammation, chronic infection, or cancer strongly suggest that the myeloid compart- ment has a much broader transcriptional repertoire depending on the different environmental signals received ( Boorsma et al., 2013; Chow et al., 2011; Edin et al., 2012; Hodge et al., 2011; Lawrence and Natoli, 2011; Martinez et al., 2009; Mosser and Edwards, 2008; Murray and Wynn, 2011; Reinartz et al., 2013 ). Despite a number of genomic studies analyzing macrophage activation in response to bacteria, TLR ligands, and M1 or M2 stimuli, to date there have been no attempts to reconcile these observations by building new and integrative models of macrophage activation ( Martinez et al., 2006; McDermott et al., 2011; Nau et al., 2002; Ramsey et al., 2008 ). Transcriptomics has considerably contributed to a better understanding of immune cell function and regulation. Large consortia such as the ImmGen consortium ( Best et al., 2013; Bezman et al., 2012; Cohen et al., 2013; Gautier et al., 2012; Miller et al., 2012 ) or the Human Immunology Project Consortium (Poland et al., 2013 ) compiled extensive data sets and dened a core transcriptional program for murine tissue steady-state conditions Gautier et al., 2012; Miller et al., 2012 ). A complementary approach has been introduced by InnateDB ( Breuer et al., 2013 ). Data on molecular interactions between proteins of the innate immune system derived from smaller data sets have been compiled and can be used to reveal mechanistic insights into immune cell function ( Hume et al., 2010; Mabbott et al., 2010 ). Unfortu- nately, meta-analysis of small data sets has been hampered by several challenges, including differences in the genetic back- ground of mice and in stimulation conditions and the combina- tion of in vitro and in vivo data limit or even bias model generation of incongruous data sets ( Mabbott et al., 2010 ). Moreover, comparative studies have identied substantial differences in immune-cell gene expression between mice and humans (Schroder et al., 2012; Shay et al., 2013 ). Therefore, it remains to be fully elucidated, how immune cell activation\u2014particularly in human macrophages\u2014is transcriptionally controlled and to which degree these pathways are conserved across species 274 Immunity 40, 274-288, February 20, 2014 \u00aa2014 Elsevier Inc.Open access under CC BY license.(legend on next page)Immunity Spectrum Model of Human Macrophage Activation Immunity 40, 274-288, February 20, 2014 \u00aa2014 Elsevier Inc. 275(Murray and Wynn, 2011 ). Standardizing data acquisition and assembling larger data sets, such as by the ImmGen con- sortium ( Heng and Painter, 2008 ), is necessary to answer such questions. Several elegant studies have demonstrated the value of analyzing networks based on expression proling in macro- phages ( Martinez et al., 2006; Nau et al., 2002; Ramsey et al., 2008 ) or T helper 17 (Th17) cells ( Ciofani et al., 2012; Yosef et al., 2013 ). These studies show how technological and analytical advances can reveal network structures in immune cells, e.g., by using algorithms that integrate transcriptomedata with database-stored information. Other approaches that require large data sets, such as reverse network engineering (RNE), have previously been used to characterize B cell activa-tion ( Basso et al., 2005 ) and have been further rened during the last few years ( Marbach et al., 2012 ). However, so far, RNE has not been applied to other immune cells most likely due tothe lack of large enough data sets. In this study, we generated a resource data set to assess tran- scriptional regulation during human macrophage activation by comparing a diverse set of stimuli on a single microarray platformunder highly standardized conditions. Network modeling of this data set led us to extend the current M1 versus M2 polarization model to a ''spectrum model'' with at least nine distinctmacrophage activation programs. Further characterization of individual programs identied transcription factors associated with particular phenotypes, such as STAT4, which was associ-ated with stimuli chronic inflammation prosta- Marino al., 2002; Shay and Celeste Simon, 2012 ). Furthermore, we applied this resource data set to dene activation states of human alveolar tissue macrophages in vivo. Finally, we used our resource data set to rene the previously suggested core macro-phage signature to encompass species differences and account for the spectrum of macrophage activation. RESULTS Extending the Current Model of Macrophage Polarization We generated macrophages from human monocytes by differ-entiation with GM-CSF or M-CSF ( Figure 1 A) and compared their transcriptomes with DCs and T, B, and natural killer (NK) cells (see Figure S1 A,Table S1 , and Supplemental Information available online). With coregulation analysis (CRA) to assessoverall sample-to-sample relationships, macrophages were clearly DCs ( Fig-ures S1 B-S1E), which was flow cytometry ( Figures S1 F and S1G). To better understand the complexity of transcriptional regulation after macrophage acti- vation, we next analyzed the transcriptional programs of macro-phages activated with 28 different stimuli including pattern recognition receptor ligands, cytokines, and metabolic cues (Figure 1 A). To determine the overall relationship of these activa- tion states within the data set, we rst applied CRA ( Figures 1 B- 1G). In agreement with the existing model, a virtual axis was formed, where macrophages at baseline (M b) were placed in between macrophages stimulated with interferon- g(IFN- g) (M1) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) (M2) ( Figure 1 B;Movie S1 ). Adding other conditions (IL-13) polariza- tion ( Biswas and Mantovani, 2010 )(Figure 1 C) did not change the overall M1 and M2 axis ( Figure 1 B). Including further M1- and M2-associated stimuli (IFN- g+TNF, IL-10) increased the vari- ance in the correlation matrix but the overall bipolar structurewas maintained ( Figure 1 D). However, when adding stimuli not linked to either M1 or M2 polarization, such as free fatty acids, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or combinations of stimuli associ- ated with chronic inflammation ( Table S1 ), a spectrum of macro- phage-activation signatures beyond the initial bipolar axis became apparent ( Figures 1 E and 1F). Furthermore, when sam- ples generated at earlier time points of stimulation were added,the spectrum of macrophage activation was shown to consist of a dense network of individual signatures ( Figure 1 G). To bio- informatically validate these ndings, we applied Self-Organizing-Map (SOM) 1 H) and correlation coefcient (CCM) ( Figure 1 I). Performing SOM clus- tering on the conditions shown by CRA in Figure 1 E revealed that every stimulus was characterized by a specic cluster struc-ture ( Figure 1 H) further supporting the spectrum model. Similarly, we did not identify a bipolar structure within the CCM, but rather a condition-specic spectrum of correlation coefcients in 10major clusters ( Figure 1 I). By using the coordinates of the sam- ples dened by CRA within the 10 clusters dened by CCM to build sum vectors in three-dimensional space, we propose amodel of macrophage activation best described by a spectrum of transcriptional programs ( Figure 1 J). Taken together, these data clearly extend the current model of M1 versus M2 polariza-tion to a spectrum model of macrophage activation. Identication of Genes Specically Associated with Distinct Stimuli We next determined whether the different stimuli could be distin- guished on the gene level within the complete spectrum of themodel. From all macrophage samples included in the analysis, we identied 9,498 genes that were expressed in at least one Figure 1.

We used these genes for SOM clustering, allowing us to select genes specically regulated and enriched for individual stimuli ( Figure 2 A). In fact, by using this approach we could identify genes that were selectively elevated in onlyone of the stimulation conditions included in our data set. For example, IFN- bselectively induced ZNF77 S2 ). However, we also found stimuli where a single gene was insufcient to distinguish between closely related conditions, e.g., SERINC2 was induced by PGE 2but also by PGE 2+P3C, suggesting that gene combina-tions are necessary to distinguish complex input signals at the transcriptional level. Overall, although some input signals might be associated with the induction of single genes, future studieswill require the assessment of a substantial number of markersas surrogates for distinct activation programs of macrophages. Network Analysis Denes Stimulus-Associated Programs of Macrophage Activation To investigate stimulus-specic gene sets associated with the respective macrophage activation programs, we applied Figure 2.

We identied 49 distinct coexpression modules containing 27 to 884 genes per module. The expression data from different genes within each calculated module were usedto determine the module eigengenes (ME, the rst principlecomponent of the respective module), which were correlated to the 29 experimental conditions. As examples, we visualized the expression of the eigengenes of modules 8, 15, and 30 ( Fig- ure S3 A). The resulting ME-to-condition correlation was then visualized as a heatmap ( Figure 3 B, summarized in Tables S2 A and S2B). Whereas the classical M1 and M2 stimuli showedprominent ME patterns (modules 8 and 15, respectively), other stimuli clearly displayed divergent patterns further supporting a spectrum model of macrophage activation. For instance, stimu-lation with TNF, PGE 2, and P3C (TPP, MTPP) induced a strong signal in modules 30, 32, and 33, which were not present in IFN-gor IL-4 stimulated cells. TNF, PGE 2, and TLR activation have been linked to chronic granulomatous inflammation suchas in tuberculosis or granulomatous listeriosis and 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) are expressed in macrophages in human granulomatous structures and are induced in human macrophages after stimu- lation with the combination of al., 2008 ). This suggests that these host factors shape the transcriptional program during chronic inflammation. As a next step, we used the modules correlated with the specic stimulation conditions IFN- g, IL-4, and TPP to link respective module genes to biological information. We com- bined Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis (GOEA) based onthe module genes followed by network visualization of enriched GO-terms using BiNGO and EnrichmentMap ( Figure 3 C;Fig- ure S3 B). This analysis conrmed the major functional differ- ences between IFN- gand IL-4 differentiated macrophages, e.g., that an M1 response was associated with induction of inflammatory response genes, while these genes were depletedin the M2 response ( Figure S3 B). More importantly, TPP signaling induced a gene-expression pattern associated with chronic inflammation, including GO terms such as ''chronic inflammatory response.'' We conrmed our approaches by inter-rogating these gene sets with the GO analysis, pathway analysis, and transcription factor (TF) binding prediction tools provided by InnateDB, with the same outcome ( Tables S2 C-S2K). As a next step, we determined TFs within the IFN- g, IL-4, and TPP-associ- ated visualized them as corre- lation networks ( Figure 3 D). This analysis revealed STAT1 as a central hub in the IFN- g-condition and STAT6 as a hub in the IL-4-condition. We also identied additional TFs that are linked to these activation programs, e.g., STAT2 ,IRF7 , and IRF9s proteins FOXQ1 andFOXD2 , which were not previously associated with the IL-4 activation network. For macrophages stimulated with TPP, the TF network also included STAT4 , as well as TFs et al., 2008 ), TFs at the interface between inflammation and metabolism(HIF1A ;Shay and Celeste Simon, 2012 ). Other TFs identied in this network have not yet been linked to macrophage activation as determined by pubatlas.org -based literature mining (data not shown). WGCNA revealed activation-associated gene setsresponsible for important biological functions of different macro- phage populations. These gene sets harbor specic TF networks including well-established TFs associated with major activationprograms but also TFs not previously associated with macro- phage activation programs. Taken together, this large data set of macrophage activation forms the basis for the establishmentof transcriptional networks that are linked to specic activationsignals in human macrophages. Distinct Phenotype and Function Activated by TNF, PGE 2, and TLR2 Ligand We the stimulation condition TPP (MTPP), which is associ- ated with chronic inflammation, to demonstrate phenotypicand functional differences to macrophages stimulated with IFN-gor IL-4. As demonstrated by CCM ( Figure 1 I) and WGCNA (Figure 3 ), M TPPdiffered considerably in their genomic signature from M1 or M2 macrophages. By using differentially expressed genes (FC > 2, FDR adjusted p value < 0.05) between MTPP (TPP), M1 (IFN- g), M2 (IL-4), and Mbwe identied cell surface markers expressed selectively on MTPP. A total of 51 cell surface markers were elevated in MTPPbut not M1, M2, or Mb. By using flow cytometry, we conrmed signicantly elevated on MTPP(p value < 0.05), while CD86 was elevated on both M1 and MTPP(Figure 4 A). We also identied a set of TFs induced in MTPPbut not in M1 or M2, among them STAT4. Analysis of STAT4 protein expressionclearly conrmed that STAT4 is only induced in M TPP(Figure 4 B). Further differences between MTPPand macrophages stimulated with IFN- g(M1) or IL-4 (M2) were observed for soluble effector molecules where, e.g., CXCL5 secretion was signicantly induced by MTPPand to a lesser extent by M1 (p value < 0.05), but not M2, and IL-1 awas only secreted by MTPP(Figure 4 C). No difference in CD3- and CD28-stimulated T cell proliferationwas observed in the presence of M1- or M2-activated macro- phages, whereas M breduced T cell proliferation although not statistically signicantly (p value < 0.05) ( Figure 4 D). However, MTPPshowed a strong inhibitory effect, clearly demonstrating that macrophage activation by TPP induced an effector program distinct from M1 and M2 macrophages. Because transcriptionalprograms are further modulated on posttranscriptional level we assessed the global spectrum of miRNA expression by miRNA-Seq ( Figure 4 E). Again, M TPPclearly differed from M1 (C) Network visualization of GOEA of modules 30, 32-33 (positively correlated), respectively, 12, 13, and 20 (negatively correlated) for TPP-stimu lation using BiNGO and EnrichmentMap.

Therefore, macrophages differing in their global transcriptional program from M1 or M2, such as MTPPmacro- phages, are also phenotypically and functionally distinct, furthersupporting the spectrum model of macrophage activation. Macrophage Activation Model Can Be Used to Predict Macrophage Programs In Vivo To address whether specic activation programs such as those described in Figure 3 can be found in human tissue macro- phages, we compiled two data sets of obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage 2009; Woodruff et al., 2005 ) consisting of samples from non- smokers, smokers, and COPD patients. Following ltering steps, data structure analysis, and data visualization, gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed ( Figure 5 A). Three major clusters reflecting the three patient groups were revealedby CRA ( Figure 5 B) supporting distinct transcriptional programs in macrophages from the three groups. Next, stimulus-specic gene modules identied by WGCNA ( Figure 3 ) were utilized as 49 gene sets from in vitro conditions for enrichment analysis. As positive controls, we applied GSEA to the comparison of IFN-g-, calculated normal- ized enrichment scores (NES), which were plotted against enrichment p values in a Volcano plot ( Figure 5 C). As expected, the highest positive NES and lowest p values were observed forthose gene sets (gene modules) that were most signicantly en- riched (NES > 1, p value < 0.05) in the WGCNA analysis for the respective stimuli (IFN- g, IL-4, TPP, and PA). We then applied GSEA to the patient sample groups (smoker, COPD) in compar- ison to nonsmokers ( Figure 5 D). Unexpectedly, in smokers a glucocorticoide (GC)-associated gene module (41, WGCNA)was most signicantly enriched (p value < 0.05) followed by several gene modules associated with free fatty acid but also IL-4 and TPP stimulation, suggesting a complex network ofstimuli acting on alveolar macrophages in smokers. In contrast to previous literature ( Shaykhiev et al., 2009 ), we did not see an enrichment of IL-4-IL-13-associated signatures in COPDpatients with our data-driven approach ( Figure 5 D). Rather we found a complete loss of the profound signature of enriched modules observed in smokers. Concurrently, the most signi- cantly depleted (NES < /C01, p value < 0.05) WGCNA module in COPD patients was module 8 (linked to IFN- gstimulation), which was also signicantly depleted in smokers ( Figure 5 D). Network visualization of GOEA further supported complex and profoundtranscriptional changes in alveolar macrophages from smokers while cells from COPD patients were rather characterized by loss of antigen processing, inflammatory response, and regula-tion of immune response, consistent with a depletion in the IFN-glinked module ( Figure 5 E). Applying the WGCNA- and GSEA-dened macrophage differentiation programs to human ex vivo tissue macrophages, we have uncovered a hithertounexplored biology in alveolar macrophages from smokers and COPD patients. Common Denominators of Macrophage Activation While we clearly extended the concept of macrophage polariza- tion (M1 versus M2) to a spectrum model, our large data set also allowed us to dene common denominators of macrophageactivation. To dene these common macrophage activators, we used reverse network engineering (RNE) utilizing ARACNe (Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks,Figure 6 A) (Margolin et al., 2006 ). We used the 9498 genes pre- sent in at least one stimulation condition ( Table S1 D) to generate a so-called all-versus-all network (Bonferroni corrected p value10 /C07) by predicting interactions based on mutual information between each gene pair computed from the expression proles (Figure S4 A;Table S3 A; for further technical details see Supple- mental Information ). We identied 66,744 interactions resulting in an average degree of connectivity of 14.7, meaning one gene is involved in 15 transcriptional interactions on average (Figure 6 B;Table S3 B;Figure S4 B). We conrmed these ndings with a second RNE approach (TINGe, Tool for Inferring Network of Genes) ( Aluru et al., 2013 ), which demonstrated high similarity in the number of interactions, the average degree of connectivityand the rank of hubs based on degrees of connectivity as deter- mined by ARACNe ( Table S3 C;Figure S4 C). We summarized the network statistical properties ( Figures S4 D-S4F), since the entire network is too complex to be displayed. The top 10% of hubgenes inferred in the network (n = 869 most interconnected genes) collectively participated in 30,431 interactions ( Figure 6 B). In the ten most highly interconnected genes, we identiedFABP5 , which has recently been implicated in lipid metabolism and inflammation crosstalk ( Furuhashi et al., 2011 ), and TNFAIP6 feedback regulator of myeloid cell activa- tion ( Choi et al., 2011 ). However, according to a pubatlas.org search ( Table S3 D), little is known about the role of the other most highly interconnected genes during macrophage activa-tion, suggesting that RNE approaches reveal unknown aspects of macrophage activation. To further understand the biological processes of the top 10% of hub genes, we performed GOEAwith visualization of GO enrichment networks by using BiNGO(Figure 6 C;Table S3 E). This GO-term network subdivided into ve major clusters, one of which was related to immune response processes (especially terms associated with ''regula-tion of activation''). However, other clusters were associated with cell death, biosynthetic processes of small molecules, and metabolic and catabolic processes, which also constitute majorbut underappreciated aspects of macrophage activation. By using the TFCat database ( Fulton et al., 2009 ), we identied 27 TFs in the top 10% hub genes (TFs, Figure 6 B). We reasoned (D) Volcano plots of normalized enrichment scores (NES) and enrichment p values of the same gene sets applied to data from alveolar macrophages derive d from smokers and COPD patients.

Roles in macrophage activation have been established for all of these TFs, except for the zinc nger protein HIVEP1: JUNB (part of the AP1 complex), NF- kB (global activator), and CREB1 (inducing survival signals) ( Wen et al., 2010 ). HBP1 has been linked to differentiation of malignant myeloid cells and to the regulation of other important TFs including PU.1, RUNX1, JUNB, or CEBP 2005 ). By using position-weight matrices, we predicted binding of the 27 TFs to the gene loci of the top 10% hub genes ( Table S3 G). Twenty-six out of 27 of these TFs showed signicantly enriched binding prediction(p value < 0.05). As a complementary approach, we also applied two gene pri- oritization tools, ToppGene ( Chen et al., 2009 ) and Endeavour (Tranchevent et al., 2008 ) to rank the potential association and closeness of the top 10% hub genes with macrophage cellular programs using the macrophage lineage TFs RUNX1 andSPI1 (PU.1) as test genes. Of note, the top 11 ranked genes wereTFs and in total, 20 of the 30 top ranked genes are associated with transcriptional regulation ( Figure 6 E). In addition to , and CREB1 , ( STAT3 ), as well as other [M-CSF]) were also strongly linked to macrophage activation in this analysis. Furthermore, a strong enrichment of PU.1 bindingand permissive histone marks H3K4me3 at the loci of the 869major hub genes indicate that these genes are likely to be highly transcribed during macrophage activation ( Figure S5 ;Supple- mental Information ). Together, this RNE analysis identied ve distinct clusters of biological processes as part of the macro- phage activation process, conrmed the involvement of known transcriptional regulators such as NFKB1, and identied unex-pected yet unexplored candidate regulators. Renement of Core Genes of Murine Tissue Macrophages using Human Macrophage Activation Signatures Comparative transcriptomics of immune cells between humanand mouse provides a framework for the use of model systemsin the context of human biology and disease ( Shay et al., 2013 ). We therefore propose a general strategy for how our resource of human macrophage transcriptomes can be linkedto murine data ( Figure 7 A). First, we visualized the expression of the human orthologs of the ImmGen dened core macrophage (Figure 7 B) and DC ( Figure 7 C) genes in human macrophages and monocyte-derived DCs under the different stimulation con- ditions. We visualized the expression values as heatmaps of genes ranked by overall differential expression between humanmacrophages and DCs ( Figures 7 dening we identi- ed three groups of genes ( Figure 7 B). The rst group of genes (1) had high conservation of differential expression between hu- man macrophages and DCs irrespective of macrophage activa-tion, whereas the second group of genes (2) was characterized by loss of differential expression after activation with certain stimuli. The third group of genes (3) was either not differentiallyexpressed between human macrophages and DCs or showedeven opposite regulation ( Figure 7 B). A similar grouping was found for the core signature genes of DCs ( Figure 7 C). This approach by flow cytometric analysis ( Figure 7 D). We propose that this set of cell surface markers should be used for the discrimination between macrophages and DCs in both species. Overall, this comparative transcriptomics approach has renedthe core signatures for macrophages and DCs determined inmice to make them also applicable to human macrophages. This will further improve the interpretation of data obtained in species other than human and will guide animal model designto better reflect relevant human biology. DISCUSSIONThe generation of this large and unique transcriptomic data set of human macrophage activation represents an important stepforward in understanding how macrophages integrate and compute signals from their local microenvironment under inflam- matory conditions. The extension of macrophage activation fromM1 versus M2 polarization to a spectrum model opens newavenues to study macrophage activation in the context of human diseases. For example, network-based description of global but also input signal-specic transcriptional programming couldform the basis for further studies linking dened activation pro- grams with in vivo human macrophage biology. In fact, the lack of any major inflammatory signals in human alveolar macro-phages derived from COPD patients was an unexpected\u2014but from a clinical perspective, highly important\u2014result. This result might actually reflect clinical observations demonstrating inef-ciency of anti-inflammatory treatment regimens in COPD patients making it necessary to search for alternative strategies (Barnes, 2013 ). A better understanding of the transcriptional regulation of human macrophages could help to selectivelytarget specic macrophage subsets therapeutically and thereby could spare other cell types. Integrating human and murine transcriptome data sets will aid to prioritize and focus future work in animal models. In this respect, overlaying our human data onto the ImmGen-derived core signa- tures of DCs and macrophages classied several genes to beconserved in expression regulation, whereas others clearly are not conserved. In the future, these studies have to be extended comparing macrophages from the same tissues in bothspecies in homeostasis and pathophysiology.

Beyond aspects comparing murine and human macrophages, this resource data set can help to answer open questions con- cerning differential activation of human macrophages with closely related stimuli, e.g., ultrapure and standard LPS, whichhave been often used synonymously in prior studies. Similarly,while free fatty acids seem to induce closely related transcrip- tional programs when compared to the remaining stimulation conditions, we have clear evidence that saturated and unsatu-rated fatty acids induce distinct transcriptional responses in human macrophages (S.V.S., data not shown). We anticipate this data set of human macrophage activation to serve as a starting point for future studies into human macro- phage biology. In addition to expanding our understanding of human macrophage biology, this resource will contribute to abetter understanding of general mechanisms of transcriptionalcontrol, as well as the development of new mathematical models for signal integration and new therapeutic strategies in human disease. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Detailed description of all experimental procedures and links to analytical tools and databases used are provided in Supplemental Information . Abbreviations and description of bioinformatics tools are summarized in Table S5 . Isolation, In Vitro Culture, and Functional Assessment of Cells under StudyBuffy coats from healthy donors were obtained according to protocolsaccepted by the institutional review board at the University of Bonn (local ethics votes no. 288/13). Human monocytes, B cells, T cells, and NK cells (Table S1 ) were puried from peripheral blood mononuclear cells by MACS in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Macrophages (M b, base- line) were generated from monocytes by stimulation with GM-CSF or M-CSFfor 72 hr and further activated with 28 stimulation conditions ( Table S1 ). DCs were generated by GM-CSF in presence of IL-4 for 72 hr followed by furtherstimulation with uLPS, TNF+PGE 2,o raCD40 mAbs+TNF. Cells were pheno- typically assessed by flow cytometry using cell lineage and activation markers.Expression of STAT4 was measured by immunoblotting. CXCL5 and IL-1 ain cell culture supernatants were assessed by ELISA following the manufac-turer's instructions. The influence of macrophages on T cell activation wasmeasured in an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction where CD3 +T cells were stimulated with CD3+CD28 mAbs in presence or absence of differentiallyactivated macrophages. T cell proliferation was assessed 72 hr later using thecarboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester dilution method. RNA Isolation, Gene Expression Proling, AnalysisBiotin-labeled cRNA was generated with the TargetAmp Nano-g Biotin-aRNALabeling Kit for the Illumina System (Epicenter) hybridized to HumanHT-12V3 and Human WG-6V3 Beadchips (Illumina) and scanned an iScan or HiScanSQ system. Exported from Genome Studio (Illumina),all array data (n = 384) were imported into Partek Genomics Suite (PGS) prior to quantile normalization. For all analyses with macrophages only (n = 299),background signals were calculated resulting in 9,498 unique genes to bepresent in at least one macrophage stimulation condition. miRNA- and chro-matin immunoprecipitation sequencing describedin Supplemental Information . Coregulation Networks and Comparative Bioinformatics To describe the structure within the data set, we primarily performed coregu-lation analysis (CRA) based on Pearson's correlation coefcients by using BioLayout Express 3D(Theocharidis et al., 2009 )(Figures 1 B-G; Table S1 B). We determined ANOVA model-dened variable or differentially expressedgenes. To corroborate a stimulus-specic structure in the data set ( Figure 1 H) or to determine genes that are elevated only in one of the tested conditions(Figure 2 ), we determined self-organizing maps (SOM) and visualized them after hierarchical clustering (HC) (SOM-clustering). On the basis of the 1,000most variable genes within the data set, we calculated Pearson's correlationcoefcient for all stimulation conditions and visualized the matrices (CCM) after HC as a heatmap ( Figure 1 I). The spectrum model of macrophage activation was established by grouping the samplesaccording to the clusters obtained by the CCM analysis, utilizing the 3D coor-dinates of the individual macrophage samples determined by CRA, calculatingmean vectors for the clusters and plotting the information in a 3D graph usingthe coordinates of the baseline macrophages (M b) as the origin ( Figure 1 J). Biological Processes Based on Weighted Gene Coexpression Network AnalysisTo determine biological processes either enriched or depleted in the 28 macrophage stimulation conditions, we rst dissected the data set (n = 160 macrophage samples, 72 hr time point) into 49 gene modules by applyingWGCNA The module eigengene (ME) corresponding to the rst principal component was calculatedfor each module and a ME-to-condition correlation visualized as heatmap ( Fig- ure 3 ). conditions g, IL-4, and TPP (TNF+PGE 2+P3C), the gene modules with highest respective lowest correlation scores were usedto generate and visualize networks based on GO-enrichment analysis (GOEA)by using BiNGO, EnrichmentMap, and Word Clouding in Visualiza-tion of coregulation of TFs of the same modules was performed by BioLayoutExpress 3D. Combining WGCNA and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis To utilize the information from the macrophage activation data set to assessin vivo biology of macrophages, we developed an approach utilizing theWGCNA-based gene modules as gene sets for gene-set enrichment analysis(GSEA, see schema in Figure 5 ). Two sets of human alveolar macro- phages (GSE13896 [ Shaykhiev et al., 2009 ] and GSE2125 [ Woodruff et al., 2005 ]) comprising samples from 39 nonsmokers, 49 smokers, and 12 COPD patients were combined. GSEA was performed on 49 WGCNA modules ( Fig- ure 3 ) in 10,000 permutations by using PGS. Normalized enrichment scores (NES) together with p values of GSEA were plotted by Volcano plots comparingthe stimulation conditions IFN- g, IL-4, TPP, and PA with M b(as positive control analyses of the overall approach). Similarly, the comparison of nonsmokerswith smokers or COPD patients was visualized by Volcano plots. Enrichedmodules (p value < 0.01) were selected to perform GOEA. Reverse Engineering of the Core Macrophage Activation Network To determine the central hubs of all stimulation conditions reflecting thecore macrophage-activation network, we applied two information-theoretic Figure 7.

Linking Human Macrophage Activation to ImmGen Core Signatures Human macrophage samples (n = 166), DCs (n = 33), and monocytes (n = 22)were compiled and expression values of the human orthologs of the previouslydescribed murine macrophage ( Gautier et al., ), and DC ( Miller et al., 2012 ) core signatures were plotted as a heatmap of standardized and scaled log 2 values ( Figure 7 ;Table S4 ).
