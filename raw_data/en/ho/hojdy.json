Resolution of the Board of Health of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene of the City of New York At a meeting of the Board of Health of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene held on April 17, 2019, the following resolution was adopted: WHEREAS , there is an active outbreak of measles among people residing in the neighborhood of Williamsburg in Brooklyn, NY who live within zip codes 11205, 11206, 11211 and 11249 (the \"affected zip codes\"); and WHEREAS , on April 9, 2019 the Commissioner of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene determined that an urgent public health action was necessary to protect the public from the measles outbreak occurring in the neighborhood of Williamsburg and declared a public health emergency; and WHEREAS , pursuant to her authority under Health Code \u00a73.01, the Commissioner ordered that anyone who lives, works or resides in the affected zip codes and any child older than six months of age living, residing, or working in any of the affected zip codes be immunized against measles; and WHEREAS , the Order subjects a person to a civil fine, unless such person or, for a child, such person's parent or guardian, can demonstrate that such person has immunity to the disease or document to the satisfaction of the Department that such person should be medically exempt from this requirement; and WHEREAS , pursuant to Health Code \u00a73.01, the Order issued by the Commissioner is only in effect until the Board of Health convenes and either continues or rescinds the Commissioner's exercise of authority; and WHEREAS , the Board of Health has taken and filed among its records and reports that since September 2018 more than 300 cases of measles have been documented in the City of New York with the vast majority occurring among people residing in the affected zip codes and that new cases of measles are still occurring at an alarming rate; and WHEREAS , measles is a highly contagious viral disease that can result in serious health complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis (swelling of the brain) and death. About a third of reported measles cases have at least one complication. Measles can be serious in all age groups. However, infants, young children, pregnant persons, people whose immune systems are weak and adults are more likely to suffer from measles complications; and WHEREAS , measles is easily transmitted from a sickened person to others who lack immunity to the disease. The virus can live for up to two hours in the air or on surfaces where an infected person coughed or sneezed and people who lack immunity are highly likely to become sick if they are in contact with an infectious person or near where an infectious person recently has been; and WHEREAS , although measles is highly contagious, the Measles- Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine is a proven safe and effective vaccine that will prevent its transmission. While measles remains one of the leading causes of death among young children in parts of the world where the vaccination is not available, the disease until this outbreak was eliminated in the United States; and WHEREAS , because a high rate of people living within the affected zip codes in Williamsburg have not been vaccinated against measles, the measles outbreak persists in Williamsburg despite other efforts taken by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to stop WEDNESDAY, APRIL 24, 2019 THE CITY RECORD 2033 it, including orders excluding unvaccinated children from attending preschools and daycare programs; and WHEREAS , the Board of Health regards the aforesaid reports of over 300 cases of measles as sufficient proof to authorize the declaration that an outbreak of measles is occurring in Williamsburg that threatens the health and safety of New Yorkers and is immediately dangerous to human life and health and constitutes a public nuisance; and WHEREAS , the outbreak is occurring because a large number of people residing in the affected zip codes have not been vaccinated against measles; and WHEREAS , the only way to end the outbreak is to require that people residing, working or attending school in any of the affected zip codes be vaccinated against or otherwise have immunity against measles; and WHEREAS , personal service or service, pursuant to subdivisions (a) or (b) of \u00a717-148 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York of orders requiring the abatement of such nuisances and conditions in effect dangerous to life and health upon each of the persons who, pursuant to the provisions of Title 17 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, has a duty or liability to abate such nuisances and conditions, would result in a delay prejudicial to the public health, welfare, and safety; now, therefore, be it RESOLVED , that the Board of Health hereby declares that an outbreak of measles is ongoing in the neighborhood of Williamsburg and that the outbreak poses a public nuisance because it is immediately dangerous to life and health; and be it further RESOLVED , that the Board of Health hereby declares that any person who lives or works within the affected zip codes shall be vaccinated against measles unless such person can demonstrate immunity to the disease or document to the satisfaction of the Department that such person should be medically exempt from this requirement; and be it further RESOLVED , that the parent or guardian of any child six months of age or older who lives or attends school, preschool or child care within the affected zip codes and who has not received the MMR vaccine shall cause such child to be vaccinated against measles unless such parent or guardian can demonstrate that the child has immunity to the disease or document to the satisfaction of the Department that such child should be medically exempt from this requirement; and be it further RESOLVED , that any person required by this declaration to be immunized against measles, or any parent or guardian required by it to immunize his or her child, shall be violating this order and be subject to the fines authorized by applicable law, rule and regulations each day that he, she, or such child continues to reside, work or attend school, preschool or child care in any of the affected zip codes without having been vaccinated against measles until such time that this outbreak is declared to be over by the Commissioner of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. RESOLVED further, that this resolution shall take effect immediately and publication shall be in accordance with New York City Administrative Code \u00a717-148. (As adopted by the Board of Health unanimously on April 17, 2019) a22-24 BOARD OF HEALTH NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND MENTAL HYGIENE Notice of Adoption of the Repeal and Reenactment of Article 175 of the New York City Health Code concerning radiation control. In accordance with \u00a71043(b) of the New York City Charter (\"Charter\") and pursuant to the authority granted to the Board of Health (\"Board\") by Charter \u00a7558, a notice of public hearing and opportunity to comment on the repeal and reenactment of Article 175 of the New York City Health Code (\"Health Code\") was published in the City Record on June 12, 2018 and a public hearing was held on July 16, 2018. The Department received 16 written comments from individuals or organizations1 and 4 individuals spoke at the public hearing. There was considerable overlap between the issues raised in the written comments and the public testimony. The vast majority of these comments were from the regulated stakeholder communities of hospital radiological personnel and medical physicist 1 Attached to the comment letter from the Radiological and Medical Physics Society of New York was a spreadsheet containing over 200 detailed bullet points identifying specific proposed Code sections suggesting text changes and clarifications. In the Department's working group meetings with the stakeholders following the public hearing, these bullet points were agreed to serve as the basis of discussion.organizations, including the Greater New York Hospital Association, the Radiological and Medical Physics Society of New York, the New York State Radiological Society and the Greater New York Chapter of the Health Physics Society. In order to effectively address the range of concerns posed by their comments, the Department held a series of working group meetings with representatives from these stakeholder organizations following the public hearing. Upon further review and assessment of the public comments and the stakeholder working group meetings, as well as on its own initiative, the Department has revised the adopted Article as summarized below: Medical Physicists : Commenters indicated that several provisions of the adopted Article were inconsistent with New York State licensure requirements concerning medical physicists. For example, the proposed Article could have been interpreted to allow non-licensed physicists to perform tasks that are within the scope of practice for licensed medical physicists, such as acceptance testing. The Department agreed with these comments and revised the proposal in response. The adopted Article now provides an updated definition for a Qualified Medical Physicist (QMP) and more accurately aligns with their scope of practice activities. Shielding Plan Review : Commenters objected to the proposed requirement for prior Department review of all shielding plans for radiation equipment installations (\u00a7175.45), stating it would unnecessarily hamper and delay facility construction and be impractical to administer. Also, a number of comments objected to a specific provision in \u00a7175.45 requiring x-ray installations to be located in a room with no windows. The Department agreed with the commenters on these points and deleted these provisions from the adopted Article. The Department also revised (but did not remove) the shielding plan review requirement for therapeutic radiation machines (\u00a7175.67). Protective Garment Thickness : Commenters objected to the proposed requirement for a protective garment thickness of 0.5 mm lead equivalent, rather than the typical 0.25 mm (see, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7175.48 and 175.53). The comments argued that the extra weight of the lead garments would cause practical difficulties for both patients and staff than could be justified by any extra protection afforded. The Department agreed with these comments and revised the adopted Article to require 0.25 mm lead equivalent protective garments. Reliance on Guidelines : A number of comments suggested that Article 175 utilize external agency guidance documents instead of delineating highly-prescriptive and detailed performance and quality assurance requirements for radiation-producing equipment. Generally, the Department did not agree with these comments and has maintained in the adopted Article the original level of detail for radiological equipment performance and quality assurance requirements. However, the Department has deleted certain detailed performance and operator requirements for mammography equipment (\u00a7175.54), as many of these requirements are promulgated by and enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration pursuant to 21 CFR Subchapter I (Part 900). A number of comments objected to specific technical requirements, such as the parameters of a quality assurance test or equipment performance standard, stating that in practice such requirement was not realistic or achievable to comply with, or to verify compliance with the requirement as written. The Department agreed with many of these comments and revised certain of the adopted Article requirements accordingly. Many of the comments requested a change to a single narrow issue with the wording or regulation, for example, to fix a typographical error, add a definition, clarify the meaning of a requirement, or to reference updated standards documents. The Department agreed with many of these comments and revised the adopted Article accordingly. A number of comments noted that some definition or requirement was either redundant or possibly inconsistent between the equipment requirements and the radioactive materials requirements. In some instances, the Department agreed. For example, occupational dose limit requirements in \u00a7175.13 in Part II were revised to be consistent with occupational dose limits in the radioactive materials section in Part III. However, in many of these instances, the Department believed these comments reflected a misunderstanding of the structure of Article 175, i.e., that the radiation-producing equipment provisions (Part II) and the radioactive materials requirements (Part III) are generally structured and intended to be self-contained and independent of each other. To make this conceptual structure clearer to the regulated community, the Department added language to \u00a7175.01(a) in adopted Article 175 clarifying which requirements applied to equipment registrants (Part II) and which applied to materials licensees (Part III). At its meeting on April 17, the Board adopted the following resolution. THE CITY RECORD WEDNESDAY, APRIL 24 , 2019 2034 Statement of Basis and Purpose Section 274 of the federal Atomic Energy Act of 1954 [42 USC \u00a72021 et to regulate byproduct material, source material and special nuclear material in quantities not sufficient to form a critical mass. New York State is an \"Agreement State\" within the meaning of the Atomic Energy Act, and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (\"Department\" or \"DOHMH\") operates a component of the New York State Agreement. Under this Agreement State structure, the DOHMH, through its Office of Radiological Health (\"ORH\"), regulates radioactive material for medical, research and academic purposes within the five boroughs of New York City. The New York State (NYS) Public Health Law \u00a7\u00a7225(5)(p) and (q) allows the NYS Commissioner of Health and the NYS Public Health and Planning Council to establish regulations with respect to ionizing radiation and nonionizing electromagnetic radiation and to authorize appropriate officers or agencies to register radiation installations, issue licenses for the transfer, receipt, possession and use of radioactive materials, other than special nuclear materials in quantities sufficient to form a critical mass, and render such inspection and other radiation protection services as may be necessary in the interest of public health, safety and welfare. The NYS regulations are set out in Part 16 of the NYS Sanitary Code. The Sanitary Code, in 10 NYCRR \u00a716.1(b)(3), allows New York City to establish its own radiation licensure requirements in place of State regulations, so long as the local requirements are consistent with Sanitary Code requirements. The New York City Charter (\"Charter\") Section 556(c)(11) authorizes the Department to supervise and regulate the public health aspects of ionizing radiation, the handling and disposal of radioactive wastes, and the activities within the city affecting radioactive material. Background Article 175 of the New York City Health Code (\"Health Code\") applies to all radiation-producing equipment and radioactive material within NYC. The Article contains general provisions applicable to both radiation equipment registrants and radioactive materials licensees, and specific requirements for such equipment and materials. The purpose of Article 175 is to protect the public, as well as workers in radiation installation facilities, from the potential hazards of ionizing radiation. The Article's requirements for radiation control reflects the coordination of radiation control activities among the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (\"NRC\"), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the NYS Department of Health and the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation, and other relevant city, state and federal agencies. This reenacted Article 175 of the Health Code incorporates federal requirements contained in Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (\"CFR\") and reflects and is consistent with state regulations contained in the NYS Sanitary Code [10 NYCRR Part 16], and sets forth ORH- specific best practices requirements. By law, the City must maintain compatibility with applicable federal requirements, as well as consistency with applicable state regulations. The Health Code may, and Article 175 does, in certain instances, mandate more stringent requirements as to health and safety radiation control measures than those required by federal and state authorities, for example, requiring greater documentation of radioactive materials licensees' quality assurance activities. In NYC, there are about 6500 registered facilities with radiation- producing machines and 375 licensed sites with radioactive material for medical, academic and research purposes. Of the registered facilities, approximately 6440 are diagnostic X-ray facilities and 60 are therapeutic X-ray facilities. ORH inspects these facilities at varying frequencies depending on the type of usage. Current inspection fees are unchanged under the adopted Article. Radiation equipment Prior to this rulemaking, Article 175 of the Health Code had not been significantly revised, particularly as to its radiation equipment requirements, since it was last reenacted in 1994. Similar to that last reenactment, the Board has based much of this reenacted text on the model code maintained by the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors (CRCPD). The CRCPD is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit professional organization whose primary membership is made up of radiation professionals in state and local government that regulate the use of radiation sources in their jurisdictions. CRCPD's mission is \"to promote consistency in addressing and resolving radiation protection issues, to encourage high standards of quality in radiation protection programs, and to provide leadership in radiation safety and education \".2 Since the reenactment of Article 175 in 1994, improved best practices have been developed and implemented for radiation 2 See, http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.crcpd.org/resource/collection/665D6792- 2EB4-4AF6-8134-1173A394FE28/Constitution10-25-04.pdf (describing the goals of the CRCPD to, among other things, promote radiological health in all aspects and phases and to promote and foster uniformity of radiation control laws and regulations).control measures. Many of these measures are reflected in the current CRCPD model code, which has provided the basis for much of the text related to radiation equipment in the adopted Article 175. Radioactive materials As noted above, Article 175 of the Health Code incorporates federal requirements from Title 10 of the CFR. New York State is an Agreement State with the U.S. NRC which means that the NRC has delegated authority to NYS to regulate radioactive material at non- reactor sites within its jurisdiction. The New York State Agreement is comprised of the regulatory programs of three agencies: 1. the New York State Department of Health, 2. the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, and 3. the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Under the NYS Agreement and \u00a7 16.1 of the State Sanitary Code, the Department, through its Office of Radiological Health (ORH), regulates radioactive material for medical, research and academic purposes within the five boroughs of New York City. Each Agreement State program is required to maintain compatibility with the NRC regulatory program. The NRC regulatory program utilizes Compatibility Categories to specify the type of wording to be used in the corresponding State program regulations.3 As noted above, the last significant revision of Article 175 requirements occurred over 20 years ago. Since then, NRC has made numerous updates of its requirements contained in Title 10 of the CFR. In order for the Department to maintain its compatibility status with the NRC regulatory program, each time the NRC has updated its regulations in Title 10 of the CFR, the Board has had to make corresponding updates to Article 175, which has been an inefficient and time-consuming process. In many instances, and because of the compatibility designations, the Board updated Article 175 by reproducing the actual CFR text directly into its requirements. The Board believes that continuing to update the Health Code rules this way is redundant and unnecessary and that it makes more sense to incorporate by reference the relevant CFR regulations, which will still provide the same legal force and effect as if the Board had actually reproduced such requirements in their entirety directly into Article 175. This incorporation by reference process avoids duplication and provides uniform, accurate guidance to the regulated community, as well as making makes Article 175 more manageable and user-friendly Article. Accordingly, the Board has repealed and reenacted Article 175 primarily to: update the quality assurance requirements to reflect industry-wide best practices for the installation, operation and maintenance of both diagnostic and therapeutic radiation equipment required to be registered with the Department, and which is used for medical, academic and research purposes, and more efficiently adopt and enforce NRC requirements for the possession and use of radioactive materials required to be licensed by the Department by incorporating by reference applicable federal regulations contained in Title 10 of the CFR. Statutory Authority This repeal and reenactment of Article 175 of the Health Code is promulgated pursuant to Charter Section 558. Sections 558(b) and (c) of the Charter empower the Board of Health to amend the Health Code and to include in the Health Code all matters to which the Department's authority extends. Section 1043 of the Charter grants rule-making powers to the Department. The adopted Article reads as follows: \"Shall\" and \"must\" denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably. RESOLVED , that Article 175 of the New York City Health Code, concerning the regulation and control of radiation producing equipment and radioactive materials used for medical, academic and research purposes, as set forth in Title 24 of the Rules of the City of New York, is hereby REPEALED and a new Article 175 is REENACTED to read as follows: ARTICLE 175 - RADIATION CONTROL PART I GENERAL PROVISIONS \u00a7175.01 Applicability and communications.

(2) All protective garments must be checked annually for defects such as holes (not including pinholes that do not affect the performance of the protective garment), cracks, and tears by using one or more of the following methods: visual investigation, tactile investigation, or x-ray imaging. Protective garments that are used by operators conducting fluoroscopic procedures must be checked using all three methods listed. If a defect is found, the lead protective garment must be removed from service and either replaced or repaired as needed to conform to the manufacturers' specifications. (k) Radiation exposure control (1) Exposure initiation. Means must be provided to initiate the radiation exposure by a deliberate action on the part of the operator, such as the depression of a switch. Radiation exposure must not be initiated without such an action. In addition, it must not be possible to initiate an exposure when the timer is set to a \"zero\" or \"off\" position if either position is provided. (2) Exposure indication. Means must be provided for visual indication observable at or from the operator's protected position whenever x-rays are produced. In addition, an audible signal to the operator must indicate that the exposure has terminated. (l) Operator and ancillary personnel protection for veterinary systems. All stationary, mobile or portable x-ray systems used for veterinary work must be provided with either a 2 meter (6.5 feet) high protective barrier for operator protection during exposures, or must allow the operator to be at least 2 meters (6.5 feet) from the tube housing assembly during exposures. Otherwise, in cases where animals are held, the operator and ancillary personnel must be protected by a minimum of 0.25 mm lead equivalent from scatter radiation and 0.5 mm from the useful beam. \u00a7175.47 General requirements for all radiation equipment. (a) All x-ray equipment must be installed and operated in accordance with the equipment manufacturer's specifications. If the registrant is required to have a QA program pursuant to \u00a7175.12(b)(1), and if the manufacturer's specifications are not available, the registrant's QMP or RSO must establish specifications for equipment use and document the specifications in the registrant's QA Manual. If the Department finds that the specifications present unacceptable tolerances, the Department shall require the registrant to utilize new specifications and shall notify the registrant of such in writing. (b) All functional x-ray units registered by the Department shall be subject to inspection by Department staff, or by individuals directed by the Department to inspect such units, such as CRESOs. (c) Radiation safety requirements. The registrant shall be responsible for directing the operation of the x-ray system under their administrative control and must assure that the requirements of this Article are met in the operation of the x-ray system. (d) A current copy of NYC Health Code Article 175 must be maintained and readily accessible by the registrant either in hard copy or electronic format. (e) Registrants required to have a QA program pursuant to \u00a7175.12(b)(1) must have a written radiation safety program as part of their QA program. The radiation safety program must include, but not be limited to, the following: (1) that the use of ionizing radiation within its purview is performed in accordance with existing laws and regulations. (2) that all persons are protected as required by this Article. (3) that upon discovery of a medical event (as defined in this Article), the registrant must follow the applicable requirements of \u00a7175.25 concerning notification to the Department. (f) If an x-ray system does not meet the provisions of this Article, then the registrant must correct such non-compliance, or initiate necessary corrective action, within 30 days of such discovery. (g) Individuals operating the x-ray systems must meet all licensure, training and experience qualifications required by the Department. (h) A sufficient number of protective apparel (e.g., aprons, gloves, collars) and shields must be available to provide the necessary radiation protection for all patients and personnel who are involved with x-ray operations. (i) The registrant must use auxiliary equipment designed to minimize patient and personnel exposure commensurate with the needed diagnostic information.(j) Neither the x-ray tube housing nor the collimating device shall be held during an exposure. Exceptions may be allowed for Department-approved devices specifically designed to be hand- held in the area of patient dental exams. The Department shall maintain a list of hand-held dental units that are approved for clinical exams in New York City, or may accept the list of such hand-held dental units as approved by New York State Department of Health, at the Department's discretion. (k) The useful x-ray beam must be limited to the area of clinical interest. For x-ray units not utilizing PBL systems for clinical imaging and not using cones or diaphragms for beam restriction, the clinical x-ray field must be less than size of the image receptor on four of four sides of the image receptor. For all digital image receptors, the size of the clinical image must not be digitally manipulated as to render its original dimensions different from the clinical image size when the image is archived. (l) Consideration must be given to selecting the appropriate technique and employing available dose reduction methods and technologies across all patient sizes and clinical indications. For registrants utilizing manual selection of technique settings for clinical x-ray exams, this means a technique chart that employs technique settings for thin, average and heavy patient sizes. In the case where children less than 18 years of age are radiographed, the minimal technique setting should correspond to patients of 1-years old, 5-years old and 10-years old for exams most likely to be administered, e.g., AP chest and abdomen exams. In all such cases, the Entrance Skin Exposure (ESE) must be directly or indirectly determined for all clinical techniques set. At a minimum, these technique charts along with ESEs must include: (1) patient's (adult and pediatric, if appropriate) body part and anatomical size; (2) technique factors; (3) type of image receptor used; (4) source to image receptor distance used (except for dental intraoral radiography), and (5) position of the grid for the x-ray exam, i.e., the grid is either removed from the x-ray beam or is in the x-ray beam. (m) A facility must have a documented procedure in place for verification of patient identity and exam to be performed, including identification of the appropriate body part. (n) The registrant must create and make available to x-ray operators written safety procedures, including instructions for patient holding and any restrictions of the operating technique required for the safe operation of the particular x-ray system. The operator must be able to demonstrate familiarity with these procedures. Patient holding must be restricted to radiographic examinations with the exception that holding of patients shall be prohibited for all fluoroscopic exams and patient CT exams with the exception of hospital emergency rooms and hospital trauma centers. (o) The registrant must restrict the presence of individuals in the x-ray room of the patient being examined to those required or in training for the medical procedure, or the parent or guardian of a patient while the x-ray tube is energized. Other than the patient being examined, the following applies to all individuals in the x-ray room: (1) all persons must be positioned such that no part of the body will be struck by the useful beam unless protected by not less than 0.25 millimeter lead equivalent material; (2) If the procedure results in secondary or scatter radiation in excess of 0.02 mSv (2 mrem) in any one hour at the position of these persons, they must be protected from the direct scatter radiation by whole body protective barriers of not less than 0.25 millimeter lead equivalent material or must be positioned so that the 0.02 mSv (2 mrem) in any one hour limit is met. (p) Individuals must not be exposed to the useful beam except for healing arts purposes and unless such exposure has been authorized by a professional practitioner of the healing arts. This provision specifically prohibits deliberate exposure for the following purposes: (1) exposure of an individual for training, demonstration, or other non-healing arts purposes; and (2) exposure of an individual for the purpose of healing arts screening except as authorized by the Department. (q) X-ray patient logbook. Each facility must maintain a written or electronic record containing the patient's name, the type of examinations, and the dates the examinations were performed for all radiographic (except dental, podiatric and veterinary exams) and fluoroscopic patient exams. The administration of contrast agents as part of the patient exam must be noted in the patient logbook to state that IV contrast was administered. All adverse effects to injected contrast agents must be reported to the NY State Health Department, as required by law. (r) Sealing x-ray equipment. Sealing of x-ray units must be done only by the Department for x-ray units, of any type, that poses a hazard to the patient or the operator. No x-ray units sealed by the Department shall be put in use for clinical exams without the approval of the Department.WEDNESDAY, APRIL 24, 2019 THE CITY RECORD 2053 (s) Leakage radiation from the diagnostic source assembly. The leakage radiation from the diagnostic source assembly measured at a distance of 1 meter in any direction from the source must not exceed 0.88 milligray (mGy) air kerma (vice 100 milliroentgen (mR) exposure) in 1 hour when the x-ray tube is operated at its leakage technique factors. If the maximum rated peak tube potential of the tube housing assembly is greater than the maximum rated peak tube potential for the diagnostic source assembly, positive means must be provided to limit the maximum x-ray tube potential to that of the diagnostic source assembly. (t) Technique indicators. (1) For x-ray equipment capable of displaying technique factors, the technique factors to be used during an exposure must be indicated before the exposure begins. If automatic exposure controls are used, the technique factors which are set prior to the exposure must be indicated. (2) The requirement of paragraph (1) of this subdivision may be met by permanent markings on equipment having fixed technique factors. Indication of technique factors must be visible from the operator's position except in the case of spot films made by the fluoroscopist. (3) The accuracy of the technique factors for the x-ray unit (e.g., indicated kilovoltage peak (kVp), timer accuracy) must meet manufacturer specifications. In the absence of a manufacturer specification, the technique factor accuracy must be within \u00b110 percent. (u) Beam quality. (1) The half value layer (HVL) of the useful beam for a given x-ray tube potential shall not be less than the values shown in Table 1 of this subdivision. If it is necessary to determine such half-value layer at an x-ray tube potential which is not listed in Table 1, linear interpolation or extrapolation may be made. Positive means must be provided to ensure that at least the minimum filtration needed to achieve beam quality requirements is in the useful beam during each exposure. In the case of a system which is to be operated with more than one thickness of filtration, this requirement can be met by a filter interlocked with the kilovoltage selector which will prevent x-ray emissions if the minimum required filtration is not in place. In no case shall an x-ray unit failing to meet the minimum filtration standards in Table 1 conduct clinical patient exams until the x-ray unit is in compliance with Table 1.

(2) The owner who causes such modification must record the date and the details of the modification in the system records and maintain this information, and the modification of the x-ray system must not result in a failure to comply with this Article. (x) Multiple tubes. Where two or more radiographic tubes are controlled by one exposure switch, the tube which has been selected must be clearly indicated prior to initiation of the exposure. Only the selected tube can be energized. This indication must be both on the x-ray control panel and at or near the tube housing assembly which has been selected. (y) Mechanical support of tube head. The tube housing assembly supports must be adjusted such that the tube housing assembly will remain stable during an exposure unless tube housing movement is a designed function of the x-ray system. (z) Locks. All position locking, holding, and centering devices on x-ray system components and systems must function as intended. (aa) Maintaining compliance. Diagnostic x-ray systems and their associated components used on humans and certified pursuant to the Federal Performance Standard for Diagnostic X-Ray Systems (21 CFR \u00a71020.30) must be maintained in compliance with applicable requirements of that standard. \u00a7175.48 Specific requirements for radiographic x-ray equipment. The requirements of this section apply to all non-dental registrants using diagnostic x-ray equipment. (a) Acceptance testing. Each registrant must have acceptance testing conducted on all radiographic x-ray units with the exception of dental, podiatric, and bone densitometer units, prior to clinical patient exams being conducted with the designated x-ray units. The acceptance testing must be conducted by a QMP and the report must be provided to the registrant. All non-compliance issues noted in this report must be corrected prior to clinical use of the unit. The acceptance testing report must verify the stated manufacturer's tolerances for all machine testing. If manufacturer tolerances are absent, the registrant's QMP must develop tolerances that must be used in subsequent QA testing by the registrant and must be so noted in the quality assurance manual. (b) Control and indication of technique factors. (1) Timers. Means must be provided to terminate the exposure at a preset time interval, a preset product of current and time, a preset number of pulses, or a preset radiation exposure to the image receptor. (i) Except during serial radiography, the operator must be able to terminate the exposure at any time during an exposure of greater than one-half second. Except during panoramic dental radiography, termination of exposure must cause automatic resetting of the timer to its initial setting or to zero. It must not be possible to make an exposure when the timer is set to a zero or off position if either position is provided. (ii) During serial radiography, the operator must be able to terminate the x-ray exposure at any time, but means may be provided to permit completion of any single exposure of the series in process. (2) Automatic exposure controls. When an automatic exposure control is provided: (i) indication must be made on the control panel when this mode of operation is selected; (ii) when the x-ray tube potential is equal to or greater than 51 kilovolts peak (kVp), the minimum exposure time for field emission equipment rated for pulse operation must be equal to or less than a time interval equivalent to two pulses and the minimum exposure time for all other equipment must be equal to or less than 1/60 second or a time interval required to deliver 5 milliampere-seconds (mAs), whichever is greater; (iii) either the product of peak x-ray tube potential, current, and exposure time must be limited to not more than 60 kilowatt-seconds (kWs) per exposure or the product of x-ray tube current and exposure time must be limited to not more than 600 mAs per exposure, except when the x-ray tube potential is less than 51 kVp, in which case the product of x-ray tube current and exposure time must be limited to not more than 2,000 mAs per exposure; and (iv) a visible signal must indicate when an exposure has been terminated at the limits described in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, and manual resetting must be required before further automatically timed exposures can be made. (c) Reproducibility. THE CITY RECORD WEDNESDAY, APRIL 24 , 2019 2054 (1) Coefficient of variation. For any specific combination of selected technique factors, the estimated coefficient of variation of the air kerma must be no greater than 0.05. (2) Measuring compliance. Determination of compliance must be based on 10 consecutive measurements taken within a time period of 1 hour. Equipment manufactured after September 5, 1978, must also have all variable controls for technique factors adjusted to alternate settings and reset to the test setting after each measurement. For equipment having automatic exposure controls, compliance shall be determined with a sufficient thickness of attenuating material in the useful beam such that the technique factors can be adjusted to provide individual exposures of a minimum of 12 pulses on field emission equipment rated for pulsed operation or no less than one-tenth second per exposure on all other equipment. (3) Alternatively, the reproducibility of any technique value may be determined by taking 5 consecutive measurements and utilizing the formula given below: Reproducibility = (maximum measured value - minimum measured value) Average of the measured five values The calculated reproducibility shall be equal to \u00b1 10 percent for compliance (d) Linearity. The following requirements apply for any fixed x-ray tube potential within the range of 40 percent to 100 percent of the maximum rated. In regard to paragraphs (1) through (3) in this subdivision below, measurements can be made in mR instead of mGy. (1) Equipment having independent selection of x-ray tube current (mA). The average ratios of air kerma to the indicated milliampere-seconds product (mGy/mAs) obtained at any two consecutive tube current settings must not differ by more than 0.10 times their sum. This is: |X1 - X2 | 0.10(X1 + X2); where X1 and X2 are the average mGy/mAs values obtained at each of two consecutive mAs selector settings or at two settings differing by no more than a factor of 2 where the mAs selector provides continuous selection. (2) Equipment having selection of x-ray tube current-exposure time product (mAs). For equipment manufactured after May 3, 1994, the average ratios of air kerma to the indicated milliampere-seconds product (mGy/mAs) obtained at any two consecutive mAs selector settings must not differ by more than 0.10 times their sum. This is: |X1 - X20.10 |(X1 + X2); where X1 and X2 are the average mGy/mAs values obtained at each of two consecutive mAs selector settings or at two settings differing by no more than a factor of 2 where the mAs selector provides continuous selection. (3) Measuring compliance. Determination of compliance will be based on at least 3 exposures, made within 1 hour, at each of the two settings. These two settings may include any two focal spot sizes except where one is equal to or less than 0.45 mm and the other is greater than 0.45 mm. For purposes of this requirement, focal spot size is the focal spot size specified by the x-ray tube manufacturer. (e) Field limitation and alignment for mobile, portable, and stationary general purpose x-ray systems. Except when spot-film devices are in service, mobile, portable, and stationary general purpose radiographic x-ray systems must meet the following requirements: (1) Variable x-ray field limitation.

(ii) When a light localizer is used to define the x-ray field, it must provide an average illuminance of not less than 160 lux (15 footcandles) at 100 cm or at the maximum SID, whichever is less. The average illuminance shall be based on measurements made in the approximate center of each quadrant of the light field. Radiation therapy simulation systems are exempt from this requirement. (iii) The edge of the light field at 100 cm or at the maximum SID, whichever is less, must have a contrast ratio, corrected for ambient lighting, of not less than 4 in the case of beam-limiting devices designed for use on stationary equipment, and a contrast ratio of not less than 3 in the case of beam-limiting devices designed for use on mobile and portable equipment. The contrast ratio is defined as I1/I2, where I1 is the illuminance 3 mm from the edge of the light field toward the center of the field; and I2 is the illuminance 3 mm from the edge of the light field away from the center of the field.. (f) Field indication and alignment on stationary general purpose x-ray equipment. Except when spot-film devices are in service, stationary general purpose x-ray systems must meet the following requirements, in addition to those prescribed in subdivision (e) of this section: (1) Means must be provided to indicate when the axis of the x-ray beam is perpendicular to the plane of the image receptor, to align the center of the x-ray field with respect to the center of the image receptor to within 2 percent of the SID, and to indicate the SID to within 2 percent; (2) The beam-limiting device must numerically indicate the field size in the plane of the image receptor to which it is adjusted; (3) Indication of field size dimensions and SIDs must be specified in centimeters or inches and must be such that aperture adjustments result in x-ray field dimensions in the plane of the image receptor which correspond to those indicated by the beam-limiting device to within 2 percent of the SID when the beam axis is indicated to be perpendicular to the plane of the image receptor; and (4) Compliance measurements will be made at each SID in common clinical use (such as SIDs of 100, 150, and 200 cm or 36, 40, 48, 72 inches) and with at least one of the commonly used image receptor dimensions (such as nominal image receptor dimensions of 13, 18, 24, 30, 35, 40, and 43 cm or 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 17 inches), or at any other specific dimensions at which the beam-limiting device or its associated diagnostic x-ray system is uniquely designed to operate.

Compliance shall be determined no sooner than 5 seconds after insertion of the image receptor. (4) Operator initiated undersizing. The PBL system must be capable of operating such that, at the discretion of the operator, the size of the field may be made smaller than the size of the image receptor through stepless adjustment of the field size. Each dimension of the minimum field size at an SID of 100 cm must be equal to or less than 5 cm. Return to PBL function as described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision must occur automatically upon any change of image receptor size or SID. (5) Override of PBL. A capability may be provided for overriding PBL in case of system failure and for servicing the system. This override may be for all SIDs and image receptor sizes. A key must be required for any override capability that is accessible to the operator. It must not be possible to remove the key while PBL is overridden. Each such key switch or key must be clearly and durably labeled as follows: \"For X-Ray Field Limitation System Failure\". The override capability is considered accessible to the operator if it is referenced in the operator's manual or in other material intended for the operator or if its location is such that the operator would consider it part of the operational controls. (6) Disabling of PBL. A facility has the option to permanently functionally disable a PBL system. When this option is chosen, the standards for manual collimation apply. (i) Source-skin distance. The minimum source-skin distance must not be less than 30 cm, except intraoral dental equipment regardless of clinical or veterinary use. (j) Radiation from capacitor energy storage equipment.

Compliance shall be determined by measurements of the maximum air kerma per discharge multiplied by the total number of discharges in 1 hour (duty cycle). (k) Tube stands for portable x-ray systems. Except during veterinary field operations where it is impractical to do so, a tube stand or other mechanical support must be used for portable x-ray systems, so that the x-ray tube housing assembly need not be hand-held during an exposure. (l) Conditions of use. (1) The x-ray image receptor used as recording medium during the x-ray examination must show visual evidence of cut-off (beam delineation) on all four sides of the x-ray image. This applies to all x-ray units using manual collimation and where no positive means are used to contain the x-ray field to the size of the image receptor. The x-ray image receptor can be film or digital image receptors. (2) Personnel monitoring must be required for all persons operating mobile or portable x-ray equipment, except hand- held dental x-ray units. (3) No person shall be regularly employed to hold patients during exposures nor shall such duty be performed by an individual occupationally exposed to radiation in the course of that individual's other duties. When it is necessary to immobilize the patient, mechanical supporting or immobilizing devices should be used.

The HPD rules are in Title 28 of the Rules of the City of New York.WEDNESDAY, APRIL 24, 2019 THE CITY RECORD 2083 What rules govern the rulemaking process? HPD must meet the requirements of Section 1043 of the City Charter when creating or changing rules. This notice is made according to the requirements of Section 1043(b) of the City Charter. Statement of Basis and Purpose of Proposed Rule The Mandatory Inclusionary Housing (\"MIH\") program requires new housing developments, enlargements, or conversions of more than 10 dwelling units or more than 12,500 square feet of residential floor area constructed in areas designated for MIH in the Zoning Resolution of the City of New York (\"Zoning Resolution\") to provide permanently affordable housing to qualified households. MIH areas are designated through the land use review process as part of zoning actions that increase housing capacity. The MIH program allows developments, enlargements or conversions that increase the number of dwelling units by no more than 25 and increase the residential floor area on the zoning lot by less than 25,000 square feet of residential floor area to instead make a contribution to the Affordable Housing Fund, which is defined in Section 23-911 of the Zoning Resolution. The contribution amount must approximate the cost of providing affordable floor area in the community district where the MIH Development is located. HPD established a schedule setting forth the Affordable Housing Fund contribution amounts in Section 41-24 of Chapter 41 of Title 28 of the Rules of the City of New York. The Zoning Resolution requires this schedule to be updated annually. HPD rules provide that, for purposes of this schedule, HPD must group together Community Districts with similar market characteristics into \"Fee Tiers,\" using Department of Finance sales data for residential condominium units and, where necessary, for one- to four-unit residential buildings. Each Fee Tier is associated with a different Affordable Housing Fund contribution amount. The proposed rule amendments would update the schedule for the coming fiscal year (July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020). New material is underlined. [Deleted material is in brackets.] \"Shall\" and \"must\" denote mandatory requirements and may be used interchangeably in the rules of this department, unless otherwise specified or unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Section 1. The schedule of Affordable Housing Fund contribution amounts set forth in Paragraph one of Subdivision c of Section 41-24 of Chapter 41 of Title 28 of the Rules of the City of New York is amended to read as follows: Fee Tier Community DistrictAmount of Affordable Housing Fund Contribution Per Square Foot 1101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108[$1,075] $1,100 2 301 302 306 402 [$660] 303 304 307 308 401[$555] $575 4112 208 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 403 404 405 406 407 408 409 411[$300] $320 5201 202 203 204 205 206 207 209 210 211 212 305 316 317 318 410 412 413 414 501 502 503[$265] $270 Commissioner Eric Enderlin April 24, 2019 NEW YORK CITY MAYOR'S OFFICE OF OPERATIONS 253 BROADWAY, 10th FLOOR NEW YORK, NY 10007 (212) 788-1400 CERTIFICATION/ANALYSIS PURSUANT TO CHARTER SECTION 1043(d) RULE TITLE: Amendment of Affordable Housing Fund Contribution Schedule REFERENCE NUMBER: HPD-60 RULEMAKING AGENCY: Department of Housing Preservation and DevelopmentI certify that this office has analyzed the proposed rule referenced above as required by Section 1043(d) of the New York City Charter, and that the proposed rule referenced above: (i) Is understandable and written in plain language for the discrete regulated community or communities; (ii) Minimizes compliance costs for the discrete regulated community or communities consistent with achieving the stated purpose of the rule; and (iii) Does not provide a cure period because it does not establish a violation, modification of a violation, or modification of the penalties associated with a violation. /s/ Fiona Peach April 15, 2019 Mayor's Office of Operations Date NEW YORK CITY LAW DEPARTMENT DIVISION OF LEGAL COUNSEL 100 CHURCH STREET NEW YORK, NY 10007 (212) 356-4028 CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO CHARTER \u00a71043(d) RULE TITLE: Amendment of Affordable Housing Fund Contribution Schedule REFERENCE NUMBER: 2019 RG 018 RULEMAKING AGENCY: Department of Housing Preservation and Development I certify that this office has reviewed the above-referenced proposed rule as required by Section 1043(d) of the New York City Charter, and that the above-referenced proposed rule: (i) is drafted so as to accomplish the purpose of the authorizing provisions of law; (ii) is not in conflict with other applicable rules; (iii) to the extent practicable and appropriate, is narrowly drawn to achieve its stated purpose; and (iv) to the extent practicable and appropriate, contains a statement of basis and purpose that provides a clear explanation of the rule and the requirements imposed by the rule. /s/ STEVEN GOULDEN Date: April 15, 2019 Acting Corporation Counsel Accessibility questions: accessibility@hpd.nyc.gov, by: Friday, May 17, 2019, 5:00 P.M.
