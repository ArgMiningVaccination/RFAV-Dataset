In holistic psychotherapy, the mind, body and spirit are viewed as one unit, working in harmony and seeking integration and balance. However, stressful life events can bring about disharmony and disconnection, creating symptoms of emotional and even physical discomfort. At Cleveland Clinic, holistic psychotherapy is delivered by licensed independent clinical social workers or licensed professional clinical counselors with training in therapeutic approaches focused on the mind-body connection. Traditional talk therapy Talk psychotherapy is used for patients who are not ready for nontraditional treatments. This method includes psychodynamic, behavioral, cognitive and other well-known approaches used in modern mental healthcare. Non-traditional therapies Nontraditional therapies tap into various levels of mind-bodyspirit healing. They have a strong spiritual component that complements elements of transpersonal psychology, energy medicine and other traditions of healing. - Eye movement desensitization reprocessing therapy (EMDR) is a modality that involves a form of bilateral stimulation (e.g., eyes moving back and forth) that is performed while the patient processes a traumatic memory. The goal of EMDR is to heal from distressing experiences that are still affecting the patient in the present day. - Mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy combines mindfulness strategies and cognitive approaches to help individuals better understand the interplay between our thoughts, feelings and behaviors. - Guided imagery is widely used to change a patient's overall health by actively creating images of well-being. The technique can be used to help reduce the effects of certain medical and emotional conditions. [What We Treat](#what-we-treat-tab) What We Treat What conditions can be treated by holistic psychotherapy? Our holistic psychotherapists specialize in the treatment of physical illness and disease, emotional issues, difficult family dynamics, stage-of-life issues, work-related problems, sexual abuse, trauma, addiction (substances, food and unwanted behaviors), depression, stress and anxiety. Holistic psychotherapy does not take the place of traditional medicine; it simply works in concert with other treatment methods to help the healing process. Holistic psychotherapy, which primarily looks at specific areas of the body from an emotional, spiritual and energetic perspective, is designed to help heal trauma and restore balance. Who can benefit from holistic psychotherapy? Each patient responds differently to holistic psychotherapy. We recommend that patients approach each session with an open mind to receive the full benefits of the process. Even patients who are under the care of a psychiatrist or are currently taking psychotropic medications can benefit from holistic psychotherapy. However, patients who present with active psychotic processes or pose a danger to themselves or others will be referred to an appropriate facility until they are more able to benefit from this process. Holistic psychotherapy at Cleveland Clinic provides short-term support that can help patients learn therapeutic coping skills that can be incorporated into their lives. If more long-term therapy is needed, referral options will be discussed. Interested in learning more about Holistic Psychotherapy?

During the first session, the clinician will go through a comprehensive assessment with the patient, which includes elements of a traditional bio-psycho-social assessment along with various holistic traditions. This session last between 45 to 50 minutes which allows for the patient and clinician to set goals for treatment. During all sessions, the clinician will best address the patient's specific needs, allowing for greater flexibility between the different therapies as treatment progresses. Behavioral health: making positive, lifelong changes Behavioral health is the connection between our thoughts and emotions, and how they drive our choices on a daily level. In our clinical work with individual patients healthy lifestyle changes, effective stress relief practices including coping skills, and environmental factors affecting health may be addressed. While many of us know this information logically, on a day to day level it is often difficult to make the best choices. Our reactions, to the daily pressures of work, family, and life's challenges can overwhelm our best intentions and keep us stuck in old, unhealthy ways of coping. It is generally helpful to have the support of family and friends as you work to make significant lifestyle changes. However, that isn't always the case. Our behavioral health professionals are there to guide and support your efforts to make positive lifestyle changes, on a gradual and steady course of action. You will learn effective ways to strengthen your ability to support yourself in achieving your healthy lifestyle goals. Our behavioral health professionals are available for a consultation and private appointments to help you address issues more directly and privately.
