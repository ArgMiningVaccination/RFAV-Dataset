NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT COMIRNATYTM COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (BNT162b2) concentrate for dispersion for injection 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION This is a multidose vial with a purple cap and must be diluted before use. One vial (0.45 mL) contains 6 doses of 0.3mL after dilution, see sections 4.2 and 6.6. 1 dose (0.3 mL) contains 30 micrograms of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine (embedded in lipid nanoparticles). Single-stranded, 5'-capped messenger RNA (mRNA) produced using a cell-free in vitro transcription from the corresponding DNA templates, encoding the viral spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Concentrate for dispersion for injection (sterile concentrate). The vaccine is a white to off-white frozen dispersion (pH: 6.9-7.9). 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications COMIRNATY 30 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, in individuals 12 years of age and older. The use of this vaccine should be in accordance with official recommendations. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology Primary vaccination course Individuals 12 years of age and older COMIRNATY is administered intramuscularly after dilution as a primary course of 2 doses (0.3 mL each). It is recommended to administer the second dose 3 weeks after the first dose (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). Severely immunocompromised aged 12 years and older A third primary course dose may be administered intramuscularly at least 28 days after the second dose to individuals who are severely immunocompromised (see section 4.4). _________________________________ Comirnaty 30 mcg 2022) Interchangeability The interchangeability of COMIRNATY with COVID-19 vaccines from other manufacturers to complete the primary course has not been established. Individuals who have received a dose of COMIRNATY should continue to receive COMIRNATY to complete the primary course. Third dose Third dose in individuals 12 years of age and older A third dose of COMIRNATY may be administered intramuscularly at least 6 months after the second dose in individuals 12 years of age and older. The decision when and for whom to implement a third dose of COMIRNATY should be made based on available vaccine effectiveness data and safety data (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). Paediatric population There are paediatric formulations available for children 5 to 11 years of age (i.e., 5 to less than 12 years of age) and for young children 6 months to 4 years of age. For details, please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics for Comirnaty 10 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection, and Comirnaty 3 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection, respectively. Elderly population No dosage adjustment is required in elderly individuals 65 years of age. Method of administration COMIRNATY 30 micrograms/dose concentrate for dispersion for injection should be administered intramuscularly after dilution (see section 6.6). After dilution, vials of COMIRNATY contain six doses of 0.3 mL of vaccine. In order to extract six doses from a single vial, low dead-volume syringes and/or needles should be used. The low dead-volume syringe and needle combination should have a dead volume of no more than 35 microlitres. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract a sixth dose from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: Each dose must contain 0.3 mL of vaccine. If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.3 mL, discard the vial and any excess volume. Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. The preferred site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly, subcutaneously or intradermally. The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. For instructions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. _________________________________ Comirnaty 30 mcg EU SmPC last update: 02 Feb 2022) 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. General recommendations Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis Events of anaphylaxis have been reported. Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the administration of the vaccine. Close observation for at least 15 minutes is recommended following vaccination. No further dose of the vaccine should be given to those who have experienced anaphylaxis after a prior dose of COMIRNATY. Myocarditis and pericarditis There is an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with COMIRNATY. These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination, and have primarily occurred within 14 days. They have been observed more often after the second vaccination, and more often in younger males. Available data suggest that the course of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination is not different from myocarditis or pericarditis in general (see section 4.8). Healthcare professionals should be alert to the signs and symptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis. Vaccinees (including parents or caregivers) should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop symptoms indicative of myocarditis or pericarditis such as (acute and persisting) chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations following vaccination. Healthcare professionals should consult guidance and/or specialists to diagnose and treat this condition. Anxiety-related reactions Anxiety-related reactions, including vasovagal reactions (syncope), hyperventilation or stress-related reactions (e.g. dizziness, palpitations, increases in heart rate, alterations in blood pressure, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia and sweating) may occur in association with the vaccination process itself. Stress-related reactions are temporary and resolve on their own. Individuals should be advised to bring symptoms to the attention of the vaccination provider for evaluation. It is important that precautions are in place to avoid injury from fainting. Concurrent illness Vaccination should be postponed in individuals suffering from acute severe febrile illness or acute infection. The presence of a minor infection and/or low-grade fever should not delay vaccination. Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders As with other intramuscular injections, the vaccine should be given with caution in individuals receiving anticoagulant therapy or those with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder (such as haemophilia) because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these individuals. Immunocompromised individuals The efficacy and safety of the vaccine has not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals, including those receiving immunosuppressant therapy. The efficacy of COMIRNATY may be lower in immunocompromised individuals. The recommendation to consider a booster dose in severely immunocompromised individuals is based on limited serological evidence from a case-series in the literature from the clinical management of patients with iatrogenic immunocompromisation after solid organ transplantation (see section 4.2). _________________________________ Comirnaty 30 mcg PBS HK EU SmPC last update: 02 Feb 2022) Duration of protection The duration of protection afforded by the vaccine is unknown as it is still being determined by ongoing clinical trials. Limitations of vaccine effectiveness As with any vaccine, vaccination with COMIRNATY may not protect all vaccine recipients. Individuals may not be fully protected until 7 days after their second dose of vaccine. Excipients: This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol potassium (39 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'potassium-free'. This vaccine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed. Concomitant administration of COMIRNATY with other vaccines has not been studied. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy A large amount of observational data from pregnant women vaccinated with COMIRNATY during the second and third trimester have not shown an increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes. While data on pregnancy outcomes following vaccination during the first trimester are presently limited, no increased risk for miscarriage has been seen. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition or post-natal development (see section 5.3). COMIRNATY can be used during pregnancy. Breast-feeding No effects on the breast fed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of breast feeding woman to COMIRNATY is negligible. Observational data from women who were breast feeding after vaccination have not shown a risk for adverse effects in breast fed newborns/infants. COMIRNATY can be used during breast feeding. Fertility Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines COMIRNATY has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, some of the effects mentioned under section 4.8 may temporarily affect the ability to drive or use machines. 4.8 Undesirable effects _________________________________ Comirnaty 30 mcg PBS HK EU SmPC last update: 02 Feb 2022) Summary of safety profile Participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In Study 2, a total of 22,026 participants 16 years of age or older received at least 1 dose of COMIRNATY and a total of 22,021 participants 16 years of age or older received placebo (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). A total of 20,519 participants 16 years of age or older received 2 doses of COMIRNATY. At the time of the analysis of Study 2 with a data cut-off of 13 March 2021 for the placebo-controlled blinded follow-up period up to the participants' unblinding dates, total of 25,651 (58.2%) participants (13,031 COMIRNATY and 12,620 placebo) 16 years of age or older were followed up for 4 months after the second dose. This included a total of 15,111 (7,704 COMIRNATY and 7,407 placebo) participants 16 to 55 years of age and a total of 10,540 (5,327 COMIRNATY and 5,213 placebo) participants 56 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 16 years of age and older that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 50%), myalgia (> 40%), chills (> 30%), arthralgia (> 20%), pyrexia and injection site swelling (> 10%) and were usually mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within a few days after vaccination. A slightly lower frequency of reactogenicity events was associated with greater age. The safety profile in 545 participants 16 years of age and older receiving COMIRNATY, that were seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, was similar to that seen in the general population. Adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an analysis of long-term safety follow-up in Study 2, 2,260 adolescents (1,131 COMIRNATY and 1,129 placebo) were 12 to 15 years of age. Of these, 1,559 adolescents (786 COMIRNATY and 773 placebo) have been followed for at least 4 months after the second dose of COMIRNATY. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. The overall safety profile of Comirnaty in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age was similar to that seen in participants 16 years of age and older. The most frequent adverse reactions in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age that received 2 doses were injection site pain (> 90%), fatigue and headache (> 70%), myalgia and chills (> 40%), arthralgia and pyrexia (> 20%). Participants 12 years of age and older - after booster dose The safety of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 12 years of age and older is inferred from safety data from studies of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 16 years of age and older. A subset from Study 2 Phase 2/3 participants of 306 adults 18 to 55 years of age who completed the original Comirnaty 2-dose course, received a booster dose of Comirnaty approximately 6 months (range of 4.8 to 8.0 months) after receiving Dose 2. The overall safety profile for the booster dose was similar to that seen after 2 doses. The most frequent adverse reactions in participants 18 to 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 80%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia (> 30%), chills and arthralgia (> 20%). In Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study, participants 16 years of age and older recruited from Study 2 received a booster dose of Comirnaty (5,081 participants), or placebo (5,044 participants) at least 6 months after the second dose of Comirnaty. Overall, participants who received a booster dose, had a median follow-up time of 2.5 months after the booster dose to the cut-off date (5 October 2021). No new adverse reactions of Comirnaty were identified. Participants 12 years of age and older - after subsequent booster doses The safety of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 12 years of age and older is inferred from safety data _________________________________ Comirnaty 30 mcg PBS HK EU SmPC last update: 02 Feb 2022) from studies of a booster dose of Comirnaty in participants 18 years of age and older. A subset of 325 adults 18 to 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 90 to 180 days after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty had a median follow-up time of 1.4 months up to a data cut-off date of 11 March 2022. The most frequent adverse reactions in these participants were injection site pain (> 70%), fatigue (> 60%), headache (> 40%), myalgia and chills (> 20%), and arthralgia (> 10%). In a subset from Study 4 (Phase 3), 305 adults > 55 years of age who had completed 3 doses of Comirnaty, received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty 5 to 12 months after receiving Dose 3. Participants who received a booster (fourth dose) of Comirnaty had a median follow-up time of at least 1.7 months up to a data cut-off date of 16 May 2022. The overall safety profile for the Comirnaty booster (fourth dose) was similar to that seen after the Comirnaty booster (third dose). The most frequent adverse reactions in participants > 55 years of age were injection site pain (> 60%), fatigue (> 40%), headache (> 20%), myalgia and chills (> 10%). Booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine In 5 independent studies on the use of a Comirnaty booster dose in individuals who had completed primary vaccination with another authorized COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose), no new safety issues were identified (see section 5.1). Tabulated list of adverse reactions from clinical studies and post-authorisation experience in individuals 12 years of age and older Adverse reactions observed during clinical studies are listed below according to the following frequency categories: Very common ( 1/10), Common ( ( 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), Very rare (< 1/10,000), Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Most cases appeared to be non-serious and temporary in nature. Description of selected adverse reactions _________________________________ Comirnaty 30 mcg PBS HK 02 2022) Myocarditis and pericarditis The increased risk of myocarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty is highest in younger males (see section 4.4). Two large European pharmacoepidemiological studies have estimated the excess risk in younger males following the second dose of Comirnaty. One study showed that in a period of 7 days after the second dose there were about 0.265 (95% CI 0.255 - 0.275) extra cases of myocarditis in 12-29 year old males per 10,000 compared to unexposed persons. In another study, in a period of 28 days after the second dose there were 0.56 [95% CI 0.37 - 0.74] extra cases of myocarditis in 16-24 year old males per 10,000 compared to unexposed persons. Limited data indicate that the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination with Comirnaty in children aged 5 to 11 years seems lower than in ages 12 to 17 years. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions to local regulatory authorities per local requirements and include Batch/Lot number, if available. Alternatively, healthcare professionals can also contact respective company representatives of local suppliers/distributors for assistance in such reporting. 4.9 Overdose Overdose data is available from 52 study participants included in the clinical trial that due to an error in dilution received 58 micrograms of COMIRNATY. The vaccine recipients did not report an increase in reactogenicity or adverse reactions. In the event of overdose, monitoring of vital functions and possible symptomatic treatment is recommended. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: vaccines, other viral vaccines, ATC code: J07BX03 Mechanism of action The nucleoside-modified messenger RNA in COMIRNATY is formulated in lipid nanoparticles, which enable delivery of the non-replicating RNA into host cells to direct transient expression of the SARS- CoV-2 S antigen. The mRNA codes for membrane-anchored, full-length S with two point mutations within the central helix. Mutation of these two amino acids to proline locks S in an antigenically preferred prefusion conformation. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses to the spike (S) antigen, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19. Efficacy Study 2 is a multicentre, multinational, Phase 1/2/3 randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blind dose- finding, vaccine candidate selection and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomisation was stratified by age: 12 to 15 years of age, 16 to 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the 56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19. _________________________________ Comirnaty 30 mcg EU SmPC last update: 02 Feb 2022) Participants with pre-existing stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrolment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV). Efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after 2 doses In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through 14 November 2020, approximately 44,000 participants were randomised equally and were to receive 2 doses of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine or placebo. The efficacy analyses included participants that received their second vaccination within 19 to 42 days after their first vaccination. The majority (93.1%) of vaccine recipients received the second dose 19 days to 23 days after Dose 1. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months after Dose 2, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 14 days before and after administration of an influenza vaccine in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. In the clinical study, participants were required to observe a minimum interval of 60 days before or after receipt of blood/plasma products or immunoglobulins within through conclusion of the study in order to receive either placebo or COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine. The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included, 36,621 participants 12 years of age and older (18,242 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 18,379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. In addition, 134 participants were between the ages of 16 to 17 years of age (66 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 68 in the placebo group) and 1,616 participants 75 years of age and older (804 in the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine group and 812 in the placebo group). At the time of the primary efficacy analysis, participants had been followed for symptomatic COVID-19 for in total 2,214 person-years for the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and in total 2,222 person-years in the placebo group. There were no meaningful clinical differences in overall vaccine efficacy in participants who were at risk of severe COVID-19 including those with 1 or more comorbidities that increase the risk of severe COVID-19 (e.g. asthma, body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m2, chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension). The vaccine efficacy information is presented in Table 2.

In the updated efficacy analysis, efficacy of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing first COVID-19 occurrence from 7 days after Dose 2 compared to placebo was 91.1% (95% CI of 88.8% to 93.0%) in participants in the evaluable efficacy population with or without evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV- 2. Additionally, the updated efficacy analyses by subgroup showed similar efficacy point estimates across sexes, ethnic groups, geography and participants with medical comorbidities and obesity associated with high risk of severe COVID-19. Efficacy against severe COVID-19 Updated efficacy analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints supported benefit of the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine in preventing severe COVID19. As of 13 March 2021, vaccine efficacy against severe COVID-19 is presented only for participants with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection (Table 4) as the COVID-19 case counts in participants without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection were the same as those in participants with or without prior SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine and placebo groups.

Efficacy and immunogenicity in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age - after 2 doses In an initial analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (representing a median follow-up duration of >2 months after Dose 2) without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1,005 participants who received the vaccine and 16 cases out of 978 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 75.3, 100.0). In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1,119 who received vaccine and 18 cases in 1,110 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 78.1, 100.0). Updated efficacy analyses were performed with additional confirmed COVID-19 cases accrued during blinded placebo-controlled follow-up, representing up to 6 months after Dose 2 in the efficacy population. In the updated efficacy analysis of Study 2 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age without evidence of prior infection, there were no cases in 1,057 participants who received the vaccine and 28 cases out of 1,030 who received placebo. The point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 86.8, 100.0). In participants with or without evidence of prior infection there were 0 cases in the 1,119 who received vaccine and 30 cases in 1,109 participants who received placebo. This also indicates the point estimate for efficacy is 100% (95% confidence interval 87.5, 100.0). In Study 2, an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 neutralising titres 1 month after Dose 2 was conducted in a randomly selected subset of participants who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after Dose 2, comparing the response in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age (n = 190) to participants 16 to 25 years of age (n = 170). The ratio of the geometric mean titres (GMT) in the 12 to 15 years of age group to the 16 to 25 years of age group was 1.76, with a 2-sided 95% CI of 1.47 to 2.10. Therefore, the 1.5-fold non-inferiority criterion was met as the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio [GMR] was > 0.67. Immunogenicity in participants 18 years of age and older - after booster (third) dose Effectiveness of a booster dose of COMIRNATY was based on an assessment of 50% neutralizing antibody titers (NT50) against SARS-CoV-2 (USA_WA1/2020) in Study 2. In this study, the booster dose was administered 5 to 8 months (median 7 months) after the second dose. In Study 2, analyses of NT50 1 month after the booster dose compared to 1 month after the primary series in individuals 18 through 55 years of age who had no serological or virological evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 1 month after the booster dose vaccination demonstrated noninferiority for both geometric mean ratio (GMR) and difference in seroresponse rates. Seroresponse for a participant was defined as achieving a 4-fold rise in NT50 from baseline (before primary series). These analyses are summarized in Table 5. _________________________________ Comirnaty 30 mcg PBS HK - GMT and seroresponse rate comparison of 1 month after booster dose to 1 month after primary series - participants 18 through 55 years of age without evidence of infection up to 1 month after booster dose* - booster dose evaluable immunogenicity population\u00b1 n 1 month after booster dose (95% CI) 1 month after primary series (95% CI) 1 month after booster dose/- 1 month after primary series (97.5% CI) Met noninferiority mean ratio; GMT = geometric mean Assay. The assay uses a fluorescent reporter virus derived from the USA_WA1/2020 strain and virus neutralization is read on Vero cell monolayers.

Relative vaccine efficacy in participants 16 years of age and older - after booster (third) dose An interim efficacy analysis of Study 4, a placebo-controlled booster study performed in approximately 10,000 participants 16 years of age and older who were recruited from Study 2, evaluated confirmed COVID- 19 cases accrued from at least 7 days after booster vaccination up to a data cut-off date of 5 October 2021, _________________________________ Comirnaty 30 EU SmPC last update: 02 Feb 2022) which represents a median of 2.5 months post-booster follow-up. The booster dose was administered 5 to 13 months (median 11 months) after the second dose. Vaccine efficacy of the COMIRNATY booster dose after the primary series relative to the placebo booster group who only received the primary series dose was assessed. The relative vaccine efficacy information for participants 16 years of age and older without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is presented in Table 6. Relative vaccine efficacy in participants with or without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was 94.6% (95% confidence interval of 88.5% to 97.9%), similar to that seen in those participants without evidence of prior infection. Primary COVID-19 cases observed from 7 days after booster vaccination were 7 primary cases in the COMIRNATY group, and 124 primary cases in the placebo group.

Immunogenicity of a booster dose following primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine Effectiveness of a Comirnaty booster dose (30 mcg) in individuals who completed primary vaccination with another authorised COVID-19 vaccine (heterologous booster dose) is inferred from immunogenicity data from an independent National Institutes of Health (NIH) study phase 1/2 open label clinical trial (NCT04889209) conducted in the United States. In this study, adults (range 19 to 80 years of age) who had completed primary vaccination with Moderna 100 mcg 2 dose series (N = 51, mean age 54\u00b117), Janssen single dose (N = 53, mean age 48\u00b114), or Comirnaty 30 mcg 2 dose series (N = 50, mean age 50\u00b118) at least 12 weeks prior to enrolment and who reported no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection received a booster dose of Comirnaty (30 mcg). The boost with Comirnaty induced a 36, 12, and 20 GMR fold rise in neutralising titres following the Janssen, Moderna, and Comirnaty primary doses, respectively. Heterologous boosting with Comirnaty was also evaluated in the CoV-BOOST study (EudraCT 2021 002175- 19), a multicentre, randomised, controlled, phase 2 trial of third dose booster vaccination against COVID-19, _________________________________ Comirnaty 30 mcg PBS HK EU SmPC last update: 02 Feb 2022) in which 107 adult participants (median age 71 years of age, interquartile range 54 to 77 years of age) were randomised at least 70 days post 2 doses of AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine. After the AstraZeneca COVID19 Vaccine primary series, pseudovirus (wild-type), neutralising change increased 21.6 fold with heterologous Comirnaty booster (n = 95). Paediatric population See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeat dose toxicity and reproductive and developmental toxicity. General toxicity Rats intramuscularly administered COMIRNATY (receiving 3 full human doses once weekly, generating relatively higher levels in rats due to body weight differences) demonstrated some injection site oedema and erythema and increases in white blood cells (including basophils and eosinophils) consistent with an inflammatory response as well as vacuolation of portal hepatocytes without evidence of liver injury. All effects were reversible. Genotoxicity/Carcinogenicity Neither genotoxicity nor carcinogenicity studies were performed. The components of the vaccine (lipids and mRNA) are not expected to have genotoxic potential. Reproductive toxicity Reproductive and developmental toxicity were investigated in rats in a combined fertility and developmental toxicity study where female rats were intramuscularly administered COMIRNATY prior to mating and during gestation (receiving 4 full human doses that generate relatively higher levels in rat due to body weight differences, spanning between pre-mating day 21 and gestational day 20). SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody responses were present in maternal animals from prior to mating to the end of the study on postnatal day 21 as well as in foetuses and offspring. There were no vaccine-related effects on female fertility, pregnancy, or embryo-foetal or offspring development. No COMIRNATY data are available on vaccine placental transfer or excretion in milk. 6.
