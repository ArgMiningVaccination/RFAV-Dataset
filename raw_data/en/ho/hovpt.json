DEFINITIONS AND DIFFERENTIATION A. DEFINITIONS OF LIFESTYLE MEDICINE There doesn't seem to be a standard definition, but the available definitions are really saying basically the same thing: The use of lifestyle interventions within conventional medicine to lower the risk for a number of lifestyle-related chronic diseases or, if such conditions are already present, to serve as an adjunct to the management plan. Current definitions include: Egger, 2008: T h e t h e r a p e u t i c u s e o f l i f e s t y l e i n t e r v e n t i o n s i n the management of disease at all levels to help manage the growing number of cases presenting to doctors now with a lifestyle-based cause of disease such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.

CURRENT STATUS OF LIFESTYLE MEDICINE An enormous body of evidence supports the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions for lowering the risk of developing chronic disease, as well as for assisting in the management of existing disease. As a result of the accumulating evidence, national guidelines emphasize lifestyle interventions for general health, as well as most disease or high risk conditions. [1-10] The general consensus of these recommendations includes: G e t a b o u t 3 0 m i n u t e s o f m o d e r a t e l y i n t e n s e p h y s i c al activity at least 5 days a week, preferably every day, Q u i t s m o k i n g , i f a s m o k e r , U s e a l c o h o l o n l y i n m o d e r a t i o n , i f a t a l l - l i m i t to 2 servings/day for men, 1 for women, L o s e 5 % t o 1 0 % o f b o d y w e i g h t , i f o v e r w e i g h t o r o bese, A c h i e v e w e i g h t l o s s b y r e d u c i n g k c a l i n t a k e b y a b out 500 kcal per day and gradually increase physical activity to 60 minutes per day, C o n s u m e a d i e t r i c h i n v e g e t a b l e s a n d f r u i t s , a t least 2 fruits, 3 vegetables per day, C h o o s e whole-grain, high-fiber foods (at least half of grains as whole grains), L i m i t i n t a k e o f s a t u r a t e d f a t t o <10% of energy, trans fat to <1% of energy, and cholesterol to <300 mg/day by choosing lean meats and vegetable alternatives, fat-free (skim) or low-fat (1% fat) dairy products and minimize intake of partially hydrogenated fats, C o n s u m e f i s h , e s p e c i a l l y o i l y fish, at least twice a week, M i n i m i z e i n t a k e o f b e v e r a g e s and foods with added sugars. Other recommendations, or some variations of these, are made for specific medical conditions, but there are two key points: Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 9 1) Healthy lifestyle behaviors are included in virtually every practice guideline for chronic disease prevention or management, and 2) Relatively small lifestyle improvements (e.g., 30 min of moderate exercise a day, 100 kcal reduction in daily intake, a weight loss of 5%) if maintained over time can reduce the risk of developing, as well as the progression of, chronic disease. [see evidence section] The USPSTF recommends that clinicians screen all adult patients for obesity, tobacco use and alcohol use, and offer cessation interventions for smokers, and intensive counseling and behavioral interventions to promote sustained weight loss for obese, reduced alcohol consumption in excessive users, and diet changes for all who have hyperlipidemia or other known risk factors for cardiovascular and diet-related chronic disease. http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/pocketgd08/pocketgd08.pdf U S P S T F r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s a r e n o t a b l e i n t h e i r l a c k of endorsement of behavioral counseling in primary care for physical activity or for dietary improvements in otherwise healthy people. T h e y n o t e t h e b e n e f i t s o f a c t i v i t y a n d a h e a l t h y diet, but the lack of RCT evidence precludes recommendations. The Challenge According to Greenstone, the challenge is no longer proving that lifestyle interventions work, but rather in enhancing clinicians' and the health care system's commitment to learning how to incorporate the interventions into their practices and to deliver specific and compelling messages and strategies to patients. The risks of not changing must be clearly articulated, and a specific plan outlined. [11] Physician Responsibility According to the AMA Council on Scientific Affairs, health professionals have a key responsibility to: p r o m o t e p r e v e n t i v e m e a s u r e s a n d e n c o u r a g e p o s i t i v e lifestyle behaviors relating to obesity, c o u n s e l p a t i e n t s a b o u t s a f e a n d e f f e c t i v e w e i g h t loss and weight maintenance programs, and i d e n t i f y a n d t r e a t o b e s i t y - r e l a t e d c o - m o r b i d i t i e s . [12] Several studies have demonstrated the enormous potential of physician recommendations to influence patients' lifestyle behaviors, such as stopping smoking and improving diet. [13-18] The primary care setting is a natural fit for lifestyle medicine. [19-21] P C P s m a n a g e t h e m a j o r i t y o f p a t i e n t s w i t h c h r o n i c conditions; see 3 out of 4 adults at least once a year; average is 2-3 times per year.

[23,24] Advice from a physician has consistently been shown to lead to attempts to improve lifestyle.

[34-40] Furthermore, some evidence suggests an association between physicians' personal health behaviors and their counseling of lifestyle interventions W o m e n P h y s i c i a n s ' H e a l t h S t u d y w a s a C r o s s - s e c t i o nal survey of 4501 female doctors A n e a r l y p u b l i c a t i o n s h o w e d c o r r e l a t i o n s b e t w e e n a physician's personal health behaviors and her likelihood of counseling patients on lifestyle interventions related to that behavior. This held true, when controlling for other variables, for low fat consumption and cholesterol counseling, physical activity and exercise counseling, alcohol moderation and alcohol counseling and not smoking and smoking cessation counseling. Authors did not report odds ratios.

IMPACT OF HEALTHY LIFESTYLE AND LOW RISK FACTOR LEVELS Four main causes - excess weight, poor diet, physical inactivity, and smoking - account for most of the mortality and morbidity of the major diseases of modern society, including heart disease and stroke, diabetes, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, colorectal cancer, depression, and kidney disease. [Egger, 2008, p 13] A n u m b e r o f s t u d i e s h a v e s h o w n t h e b e n e f i t s o f a healthy lifestyle and lower CVD risk factor burden on CVD outcomes and longevity. The Interheart Study, which analyzed more than 11,000 myocardial infarctions, showed that 8 factors -- abnormal lipids, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity, inactivity, lack of consumption of fruits and vegetables, and alcohol -- accounted for more than 80% of the risk for an MI. [101] The Chicago Heart Association Detection Project in Industry has followed people from a young age (18-39 yrs) for over 30 years. Key findings include: I n c i d e n c e o f C H D a n d C V D w a s r a r e i n t h o s e w i t h f avorable levels of 5 major risk factors (BP, cholesterol, BMI, diabetes, and smoking) at a young age. [102] M o r t a l i t y r a t e s w e r e m u c h h i g h e r i n t h o s e w h o h a d elevated risk factors in early adulthood. [103] C o m p a r e d w i t h p a r t i c i p a n t s w i t h 3 risk factors, those with favorable profiles had substantially lower lifetime risks for CVD death (20% vs. 35% in men, 7% vs. 32% in women) and markedly longer median survival at middle age (>35 vs. 26 years in men, >35 vs. 28 years in women). [104] A f t e r a g e 6 0 , t h e i m p a c t o f t h e r i s k f a c t o r b u r d e n increases rapidly both men and women. [104] L o w e r r i s k f a c t o r b u r d e n i n m i d d l e a g e w a s a s s o c i ated with better QOL at older ages, along with lower Medicare costs. [105] H a v i n g m o r e r i s k f a c t o r s a t m i d d l e a g e w a s a s s o c i ated with poorer social functioning, mental health, walking ability, and health perception at older ages. [106] A k e y f i n d i n g w a s t h a t t h e C V D r i s k f a c t o r b u r d e n was an important prognostic indicator for other major diseases besides CVD; remaining lifetime risk for non-CVD death increased dramatically with increasing risk factor burden. [107] The Framingham Heart Study has also shown that the lifetime risk for CVD, as well as longevity, is highly associated with risk factor burden at age 50. [108] R e m a i n i n g l i f e t i m e r i s k f o r a t h e r o s c l e r o t i c C V D e vents was 5 % in men and 8% in women with optimal risk factors at age 50, compared with 69% in men and 50% in women with 2 major risk factors at age 50.

[109] The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study showed that >90% of CVD events in black subjects, and > 70% in white subjects, were explained by elevated risk factors. [110] The Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) Study and Chicago Heart Association Detection Project cohorts found that those with low risk factor status had a 73- 85% lower risk for CVD mortality, a 40-60% lower total mortality rate, and 6 to 10 years' greater life expectancy than those who were not low risk status. [111] Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 13The Nurses' Health Study showed that with 3 of 5 healthy lifestyle factors, risk for CHD over a 14-year period was reduced by 57%; with 4, risk was reduced 66%; and with all 5 factors, risk was reduced by 83%. [112] In the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, low risk was defined as (1) absence of smoking, (2) BMI <25 kg/m2, (3) physical activity 30 min/d, (4) moderate alcohol consumption (5 to 30 g/d), and (5) top 40% of a healthy diet score. O v e r 1 6 y e a r s , m e n w h o m e t a l l 5 l i f e s t y l e f a c t o r s had only 87% lower risk for CHD as men whose lifestyle achieved no lifestyle factors. 6 2 % o f c o r o n a r y e v e n t s i n t h i s c o h o r t m a y h a v e b e en prevented with better adherence to these 5 healthy lifestyle practices.

C o m p a r e d w i t h m e n w h o d i d n o t m a k e l i f e s t y l e c h a n ges during follow-up, those who adopted 2 additional low-risk lifestyle factors had a 27% lower risk of CHD.

[113] The NHANES II Mortality Follow-Up Study showed that, over 17 years, the risk for CHD mortality was 51% lower for men and 71% lower for women with none of 3 major risk factors (hypertension, smoking, and elevated total cholesterol) than for those with 1 or more risk factors. [114] T h e y e s t i m a t e d t h a t 6 4 % o f a l l C H D d e a t h s a m o n g w omen and 45% of CHD deaths in men could have been avoided if these 3 risk factors were not present.

[115] D. BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE METHODS TO CHANGE RISK FACTORS Physician discussion of healthy behaviors can be associated with behavior change. F o r i n s t a n c e , a c r o s s s e c t i o n a l s t u d y r e v e a l e d t h at patients whose doctors asked about diet were more likely to have changed fat or fiber intake (64% vs 48%). [121] Improving patient care will likely require better patient education and use of behavioral science methods to influence patient behavior. [122] Behavioral methods for lifestyle interventions may involve: patient assessment, setting goals, raising awareness, confronting barriers, managing stress, cognitive restructuring, Preventing relapse, providing support, contracting, and adding pharmacotherapy as appropriate. The 5A protocol is one such counseling framework: [123] 1. Assess current practices and related risk factors. 2. Advise what to change. 3. Agree on individual change goals. 4. Assist change strategies and motivational barriers. 5. Arrange regular follow-up and support or refer to specialists if needed. Because patients could be in different stages of readiness [124], these counseling frameworks can help the clinician assess their readiness and adjust the sounseling appropriately. Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 14 IV. EVIDENCE FOR LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS - TREATING CHRONIC DISEASE Lifestyle interventions have the potential to improve the entire risk factor profile and most underlying causes of chronic conditions. For many, the diagnosed condition is only the tip of the iceberg. This is the great advantage of lifestyle medicine over conventional medical therapy. Exercise and increasing physical activity are the foundation of lifestyle medicine based on supporting evidence. A s y s t e m a t i c r e v i e w o f t h e b e n e f i t s o f e x e r c i s e t herapy in the treatment/rehabilitation of specific chronic disease found the most consistent finding to be that aerobic capacity and muscular strength can be improved without causing detrimental effects on disease progression. Severe complications are rare. [1] U n f o r t u n a t e l y , t r e a t m e n t p e r i o d s a n d f o l l o w - u p t i mes are often not long enough to document group differences in disease progression.

OBESITY It is well established that obesity results from a chronic imbalance between caloric intake and expenditure. Reducing stored energy in fat cells requires creating a deficit by cutting calories consumed and increasing calories expended. Consumption is the key because it is much easier to cut calories than to expend calories. Lifestyle Modification A review of the evidence base of weight loss strategies showed that treatments with good evidence include counseling and behavioral approaches, exercise based programs, pre-prepared low energy Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 15meals, meal replacement, and bariatric surgery (the most effective for long term weight loss in morbid obesity).

The most effective treatments involve combining and matching strategies to the characteristics of the patient. Lifestyle Modification - All Intensive counseling can promote modest sustained weight loss. A C o c h r a n e r e v i e w o f 3 2 l o n g i t u d i n a l a n a l y s e s a n d 17 RCTs showed that intensive counseling strategies incorporating behavioral, dietary, and exercise components resulted in a weight loss of 3 to 4 kg over 1 to 3.3 years.

Another systematic review of the long-term effects of obesity treatments showed that low-fat diets were associated with continuing weight loss for 3 years and improvements in risk factors, as well as prevention of type 2 diabetes and improved control of hypertension. [4] T h e a d d i t i o n o f a n e x e r c i s e o r b e h a v i o r p r o g r a m t o diet was associated with improved weight loss and risk factors for at least 1 year. T h e c o m b i n a t i o n o f l o w - f a t d i e t s , e x e r c i s e a n d b e havior therapy reduced the risk of developing hypertension and CVD. A third systematic review of RCTs of interventions for weight loss in obese found that adding exercise to diet, or to diet and behavior therapy, was associated with improved weight loss for up to 36 months and improvements in HDL, TGs and blood pressure. [5] A d d i n g b e h a v i o r t h e r a p y t o d i e t , o r t o d i e t a n d s ibutramine together, was associated with improved weight loss for up to 18 months. A d d i n g d r u g s , e x e r c i s e o r b e h a v i o r t h e r a p y t o d i e tary advice was each associated with similar weight change. Lifestyle Modification - Women A 6-month lifestyle change intervention in obese, sedentary, postmenopausal women showed that women significantly increased their physical activity (+39.6%) and cardiorespiratory fitness (+13.5%) and reduced their body weight (-6.5%), fat (-7.4%), body fat (-2.4%), lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (9.1%) and improved their diet (p < 0.05). [6] Diet: A meta-analysis of 32 RCTs involving obese patients showed that moderate and well-balanced calorie restriction is more effective than any other diet, resulting in an average weight loss of about 5 kg after one year. [7] A c a l o r i c d e f i c i t o f a b o u t 5 0 0 k c a l s p e r d a y i s t he optimal goal for most. [8] Strategies to reduce energy intake: R e d u c e P o r t i o n S i z e s : S e v e r a l w e l l - c o n t r o l l e d , l a boratory-based studies have shown that larger food portions leads to increases in energy intake. Large portion sizes have been shown to override hunger and satiety signals. [9] A L o w e r E n e r g y D e n s i t y D i e t : S t u d i e s s h o w t h a t w e eat a fairly consistent volume of food day-to-day, rather than a consistent number of calories; the number of calories in a particular volume or weight of food is its energy density; a higher energy density means more calories consumed. [10] S e v e r a l s t u d i e s h a v e d e m o n s t r a t e d t h a t e a t i n g l o w -energy-dense foods (e.g., fruits, vegetables, and soups) maintains satiety while reducing energy intake.

[11] P r o v i d i n g c a l o r i e r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s , f r e q u e n c y o f s upport meetings, and inclusion of exercise were independent predictors of weight change. C o m p a r e d w i t h u s u a l c a r e , d i e t a r y c o u n s e l i n g i n t e rventions produce modest weight losses that diminish over time. Mediterranean Diet: A 3-year prospective study showed that the adoption of a Mediterranean diet pattern reduced the likelihood of overweight people becoming obese.

[13,14] Whole Grains: A significant inverse relation between whole grain intake and BMI has been consistently observed in NHANES outcomes. [15] T h e r e i s s t r o n g e v i d e n c e t h a t r e p l a c i n g r e f i n e d g rains with whole grains helps reduce weight gain and can lead to significant weight loss.

[17] T h e N u r s e s ' H e a l t h S t u d y s h o w e d t h a t w o m e n i n t h e highest quintile of dietary fiber intake had a 49% lower risk of major weight gain than women in the lowest quintile. Fruit and Vegetables: T h e N u r s e s ' H e a l t h S t u d y a l s o s h o w e d t h a t t h o s e w ith highest fruit and vegetable intake had a 24% lower risk of becoming obese than those with lowest intake, after controlling for other dietary factors. [18] Legumes: NHANES 1999-2002 data showed that greater consumption of legumes (beans) led to higher intakes of dietary fiber, potassium, magnesium, iron, and copper, and a lower body weight and a smaller waist circumference relative to those who did not consume legumes. [19] I t a l s o l e d t o a 2 2 % r e d u c e d r i s k o f b e i n g o b e s e , along with a lower systolic blood pressure. Low Glycemic Load: A Cochrane review of 6 RCTs that compared a low glycemic index or load diet (LGI) with higher glycemic index or load diets or other diets (Cdiet) in overweight or obese people showed that those on LGI diets lost more weight and had more improvement in lipid profiles than those on other diets. [20] B o d y m a s s , t o t a l f a t m a s s , B M I , t o t a l c h o l e s t e r o l and LDL-cholesterol all decreased significantly more in the LGI group. L o w e r i n g t h e g l y c e m i c l o a d o f t h e d i e t a p p e a r s t o be more effective in promoting weight loss and improving lipid profiles in obese than nonobese. Fat intake: Diets high in fat have been proposed as a cause of obesity, primarily because fat is more energy-dense than other macronutrients. In the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial, BMI increased by 0.53 for every 500 kcal of fat consumed daily. [21] M a n y s t u d i e s s u g g e s t t h a t t h e c a p a c i t y o f t h e b o d y to oxidize dietary fat is a major risk factor for a positive energy balance. Most fat consumed is stored before oxidized. [22] Exercise/Physical Activity: Exercise is important when trying to lose weight, but is even more important when it comes to maintaining weight loss. M o s t r e l e v a n t R C T s s h o w o n l y m o d e s t w e i g h t l o s s w ith exercise alone, and slight increases in weight loss when exercise is added to dietary restriction. [23] Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 17 A m e t a - a n a l y s i s o f 4 3 s t u d i e s ( 3 4 7 6 p a r t i c i p a n t s ) found that, compared with no treatment, exercise resulted in small weight losses across studies, but was associated with improved CVD risk factors, even when no weight was lost. [24] I n c r e a s i n g e x e r c i s e i n t e n s i t y i n c r e a s e d t h e m a g n i tude of weight loss (WMD -1.5 kg). E x e r c i s e a s a s o l e w e i g h t l o s s i n t e r v e n t i o n r e s u l ted in significant reductions in diastolic blood pressure (WMD -2 mmHg), triglycerides (WMD -0.2 mmol/L) and fasting glucose (WMD -0.2 mmol/L). Higher intensity exercise resulted in greater reduction in fasting serum glucose than lower intensity exercise (WMD -0.3 mmol/L). The energy deficit produced by exercise is far smaller than that produced by dietary restriction. But, studies consistently show the essential role of physical activity in maintaining weight-loss; prospective trials show a clear dose-response relationship between physical activity and weight maintenance. [23] W e i g h t r e g a i n f o l l o w i n g w e i g h t l o s s i s c l e a r l y a s sociated with not getting the recommended physical activity, and having a more sedentary lifestyle, especially more screen time (i.e., TV and computer). [23] Exercise prevents the loss of muscle tissue with weight loss and increases visceral fat loss. [25] T h e a m o u n t o f t r a i n i n g i s m o r e i m p o r t a n t t h a n t r a ining intensity for reducing fat. A s y s t e m a t i c r e v i e w o f 9 R C T s a n d 7 n o n - R C T s o f t he dose-response relationship between aerobic exercise and visceral fat reduction found that at least 10 METs of aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, light jogging or stationary cycling, is required for visceral fat reduction; there is a dose-response relationship between aerobic exercise and visceral fat reduction in obese subjects without metabolic-related disorders, but not in those with such disorders. [26] The specific amount of physical activity needed to lose weight differs from person to person, but in general the more activity, the greater the weight loss. [27] W h e n 3 d o s e s o f e x e r c i s e w e r e c o m p a r e d t h e d o s e r esponse relation of weight loss was apparent: o < 1 5 0 m i n / w k a t 6 m o s - 7 l b s a t 1 8 m o s - 3 l b s o 1 5 0 - 2 0 0 m i n / w k a t 6 m o s - 1 1 l b s a t 1 8 m o s - 9 l bs o 2 0 0 + m i n / w k a t 6 m o s - 1 3 l b s a t 1 8 m o s - 1 4 l b s 28. Jakicic et al., JAMA 1999 The preferred form of activity for most obese patients is walking, if they can do it, with 30-60 minutes on most, if not all, days the recommended goal to work up to. [29] 6 0 m i n u t e s p e r d a y i s r e c o m m e n d e d f o r w e i g h t l o s s . But, health benefits occur with only 30 minutes of daily moderate activity.

C r o s s - s e c t i o n a l s t u d i e s s h o w t h a t i n d i v i d u a l s w h o walk more are thinner than those who walk less. Pedometer-based walking programs result in a modest amount of weight loss. Longer programs lead to more weight loss than shorter programs. [31] Diet Plus Exercise: Many studies have shown that the best approach involves changes in both eating and activity behaviors to shift the balance in favor of expenditure. A C o c h r a n e r e v i e w c o n c l u d e d t h a t d i e t c o m b i n e d w i th exercise produced a 20% greater initial weight loss than diet alone, and a greater likelihood that the weight loss would be sustained. [32] N u m e r o u s s t u d i e s h a v e s h o w n t h a t r e g u l a r e x e r c i s e in conjunction with diet results in an average weight loss of 5% to 10%. [33] E x e r c i s e w i t h n o c h a n g e i n d i e t r e s u l t s i n a c o n s istent small weight loss across studies, but must be combined with diet to yield satisfactory results. [34,35] Another systematic review of 80 RCTs with 1-year follow-up showed that weight-loss interventions utilizing a reduced-energy diet with exercise are associated with moderate weight loss of 5 to 8.5 kg (5% to 9%) at 6 months. [36] I n s t u d i e s e x t e n d i n g t o 4 y e a r s , a m e a n 3 t o 6 k g (3% to 6%) of weight loss was maintained. Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 18 A d v i c e - o n l y a n d e x e r c i s e - a l o n e g r o u p s e x p e r i e n c e d minimal weight loss at any time point. A meta-analysis of 35 RCTs showed that a combination of dieting and increased exercise is more effective than either measure alone. Increasing physical activity was also shown to help maintain weight loss. [7] Behavior Therapy Behavior therapy is essential for treating obesity because eating and activity habits are behaviors that need to be changed. [10] The most effective behavioral interventions combine nutrition education with diet and exercise counseling involving behavioral strategies to help patients build the skills needed to change eating and activity patterns. U S P S T F r e c o m m e n d s h i g h - i n t e n s i t y c o u n s e l i n g a n d b ehavioral interventions with at least 2 individual or group sessions per month for at least the first 3 months. [37] T h e 5 - A f r a m e w o r k ( A s s e s s , A d v i s e , A g r e e , A s s i s t , and Arrange) may be useful in helping clinicians guide interventions for weight loss. [37] A meta-analysis of 19 RCTs showed that the addition of active support, such as behavioral therapy, increases the effectiveness of weight loss in obese patients.

I n t e r v e n t i o n s t h a t d o n o t i n v o l v e a s s i s t a n c e f r o m healthcare professionals have been shown to be no more effective than dieting alone. A Cochrane review of 32 longitudinal analyses and 17 RCTs showed that intensive counseling strategies incorporating behavioral, dietary, and exercise components promote a weight loss of 3 to 4 kg over 1 to 3.3 years. [38] A meta-analysis of 19 RCTs showed that the addition of active support makes dietary weight loss measures more effective in obese.

The National Weight Control Registry has shown that the following are keys to long-term weight loss success in obese patients: [39,40] 1) A serious, long-term commitment to changes in eating habits and exercise, 2) A low fat diet (around 24% of calories, compared to the generally recommended 30%), 3) Eat breakfast regularly, and eat 5 smaller meals a day, on average 4) Be dedicated to exercise, such as walking 60-90 minutes per day, 5) Do not rely on weight loss drugs, 6) View past failures as learning experiences, 7) Focus on doable, process oriented goals, 8) Monitor body weight regularly (at least weekly) to catch weight gain quickly, 9) Monitor food intake if begin to gain.

HYPERTENSION The relationship of BP to CVD risk is continuous, consistent, and independent of other risk factors. Each increase of 20/10 mmHg doubles risk of CVD across the entire BP range starting from 115/75 mmHg.

The Blood Pressure Lowering Treatment Trialists Collaboration meta-analysis of 29 RCTs showed that lowering BP reduces risk of cardiovascular events and death by around 20%. [43] L a r g e r r e d u c t i o n s i n B P p r o d u c e l a r g e r r e d u c t i o n s in risk Lifestyle Approach: The JNC-7 recommends as the first line treatment for hypertension the following: weight loss in overweight, the DASH diet with limited salt intake, regular physical activity, quitting smoking and moderate, if any, alcohol consumption. [44] The 2008 Canadian Hypertension Education Program Evidence-Based Recommendations Task Force assessed RCTs and systematic reviews of the impact of lifestyle interventions on blood pressure (BP) lowering and concluded that lifestyle modifications to prevent and/or treat hypertension include the following: [45] R e s t r i c t d i e t a r y s o d i u m i n t a k e t o 6 5 m m o l / d a y t o 100 mmol/day; 3 0 t o 6 0 m i n o f a e r o b i c e x e r c i s e 4 - 7 d a y s p e r w e e k; M a i n t a i n a h e a l t h y b o d y w e i g h t ( B M I o f 1 8 . 5 - 2 4 . 9 kg/m2) and waist circumference (< 102 cm for men and < 88 cm for women); L i m i t a l c o h o l c o n s u m p t i o n t o 14 units per week in men or 9 units per week in women; F o l l o w a d i e t r e d u c e d i n s a t u r a t e d f a t a n d c h o l e s terol, that emphasizes fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products, dietary and soluble fiber, whole grains and protein from plant sources; Lifestyle interventions: A substantial body of evidence supports the effectiveness of lifestyle modifications for lowering BP [46]. I n c r e a s i n g p h y s i c a l a c t i v i t y , r e d u c i n g s o d i u m i n t ake, losing weight if overweight, moderating alcohol intake, and following the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, can lower BP at least as well as pharmacologic monotherapy. A meta-analysis 105 RCTs (6805 participants) of lifestyle interventions for hypertension found robust statistically significant effects for: diet (-5.0 mmHg), aerobic exercise (-4.6 mmHg), alcohol restriction (-3.8 mmHg), sodium restriction (- 3.6 mmHg), and fish oil supplements (-2.3 mmHg).

A multifactorial lifestyle modification in treated hypertensive patients over 4 months resulted in a mean 24-h ABP reduction of -4.1/-2.1 mmHg. At 4 months, drug withdrawal improved in men (control 44%; program 66%) but was no different in women (65 and 64%).

At the end of the intervention, mean weight loss in the lifestyle group, net of control, was 4.9 kg. Net reductions in 24-hour ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 9.5 mm Hg and 5.3 mm Hg, respectively. Corresponding changes in daytime systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 12.1 mm Hg and 6.6 mm Hg.

[57] Diet: The DASH eating plan has been shown to be an effective first-line therapy for stage 1 hypertension. It contains < 2 mg of sodium per day, and an overall pattern that is lower in total and saturated fat and higher in fiber. [58] It includes: o l o t s o f f r u i t s a n d v e g e t a b l e s ( 4 - 5 s e r v i n g s o f e a ch), o 2 - 3 s e r v i n g s o f l o w f a t d a i r y , o 7 - 8 s e r v i n g s o f m o s t l y w h o l e g r a i n s , o 1 s e r v i n g o f n u t s , s e e d s , a n d l e g u m e s , a n d o l i m i t i n g m e a t s , p o u l t r y a n d f i s h t o 2 o r f e w e r s e rvings per day. Diet - The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Trial The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension multicenter trial showed that a diet that emphasized fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products with body weight, sodium intake, and physical activity held constant could reduce blood pressure by a net of 11.4 and 5.5 mm Hg systolic and diastolic, respectively in patients with hypertension.

Additionally, the DASH diet is consistent with many of the recommendations made by Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 21organizations in the United States: the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, the National Cholesterol Education Program's Step 2 Diet, and the National Cancer Institute. [61] Most DASH studies have been tightly controlled, with food provided to participants. The only large-scale study in which patients bought and prepared their own food is the PREMIER study. [62] T h e b l o o d pressure changes observed were smaller, largely explained by participants rarely achieving their food intake goals. It points out the challenge of dietary interventions - they work but can people do them on their own.

Diet - Sodium Intake A n e x t e n s i v e a n a l y s i s o f t h e e f f e c t s o n b l o o d p r e ssure (BP) of changes in sodium intake found that a sodium reduction from 100 to 50 mmol/2,100 kcal generally had twice the effect on BP as reduction from 150 to 100 mmol/2,100 kcal.

Another study analyzed the separate effects of the diet and the effects of reducing sodium intake.

Increased potassium intake has also emerged as a strategy to lower BP. [65] O t h e r d i e t a r y f a c t o r s , s u c h a s a g r e a t e r i n t a k e o f protein or monounsaturated fatty acids, may also reduce BP but evidence is inconsistent. Exercise/Physical activity: Moderate intensity endurance type physical activity for 30-45 minutes per day on most days of the week can lower BP in people with hypertension by an average of about 5-10 mm/Hg over several months. [66] A m e t a - a n a l y s e s o f R C T s i n v o l v i n g e i t h e r d y n a m i c aerobic endurance training or resistance training showed that in 30 hypertensive study groups, aerobic training resulted in a net reduction of BP of 7/5 mmHg.

Exercise - Tai Chi and Qigong A s y s t e m a t i c r e v i e w o f t h e e f f e c t o f t a i c h i e x e r cise on blood pressure (BP) yielded 26 studies, of which 22 reported reductions in BP with tai chi (3-32 mm Hg systolic and 2-18 mm Hg diastolic BP reductions).

Moderation of alcohol consumption: Reducing alcohol intake can significantly lower BP in those with hypertension who drink excessively. [70] A m e t a - a n a l y s i s o f 1 5 R C T s s h o w e d t h a t s y s t o l i c a nd diastolic blood pressures can be reduced by an average of 3.3 mm Hg and 2.0 mm Hg, respectively, by reducing excessive alcohol intake to a moderate level. [71] A d o s e - r e s p o n s e r e l a t i o n s h i p was observed between alcohol reduction and blood pressure reduction in this analysis; greater reductions were seen in those with higher baseline blood pressure. Smoking Cessation: Smoking has been consistently shown to increase BP; quitting can help lower it. [72,73] Stress Reduction: Can play an important role if excessive stress and poor response to it are a problem. [74] A Cochrane review evaluated the effects of relaxation therapies on blood pressure in people with hypertension.

In the Women's Health Study, lower levels of physical activity and higher levels of BMI were independently associated with adverse levels of nearly all lipid and inflammatory biomarkers. A high Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 23BMI was more strongly related to adverse cardiovascular biomarker levels than physical inactivity. However, within BMI categories, physical activity was generally associated with more favorable cardiovascular biomarker levels than inactivity. [79] Lifestyle Interventions: A Cochrane review of 31 RCTs of treatments targeting HDL cholesterol showed that currently available therapeutic and lifestyle strategies, when optimized, can increase HDL-C levels by 20% to 30%. [80] Diet: Saturated and trans fatty acid intakes are directly related to LDL cholesterol levels. [81,82] R e p l a c i n g s a t u r a t e d f a t i n t a k e w i t h g o o d f a t s s u c h as omega-3 fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids can lower LDL while raising HDL levels. [82] The DASH diet, developed for blood pressure control, also improves lipid levels. [83] A n 8 w e e k R C T o f p a t i e n t s w i t h e l e v a t e d c h o l e s t e r ol levels, reduced total cholesterol relative to controls by 13.7 mg/dL, LDL by 10.7 mg/dL, and HDL by 3.7 mg/dL (all P < 0.0001), with no change in triglycerides. Weight was maintained. C h a n g e s w e r e g r e a t e r i n m e n t h a n w o m e n , n o d i f f e r ences by race. A RCT of the ATP-III recommended diet (low saturated fat with plant sterols and viscous fibers) against a statin drug and control group in hyperlipidemic adults showed that LDL was reduced by 29% in the diet group vs. 31% with drug therapy and 8% in control. [84] Plant stanols/sterol intakes of 2 g per day can lower LDL cholesterol levels by up to 15% in addition to diet and lifestyle modification. [85] S o l u b l e o r v i s c o u s f i b e r s ( n o t a b l y \u00df - g l u c a n and pectin) modestly reduce LDL cholesterol levels beyond those achieved by a diet low in saturated and trans fatty acids and cholesterol alone. [86] Whole-grain intake has been shown to be inversely associated with total and LDL cholesterol in the Framingham Offspring Study. [87] For High Triglycerides: A meta-analysis showed that low-carbohydrate diets resulted in greater improvements in triglyceride and HDL cholesterol concentrations than low-fat diets; however, LDL cholesterol was significantly higher on the low-carbohydrate diets [88]. R e d u c i n g s i m p l e a n d r e f i n e d s u g a r s a n d a l c o h o l c a n also reduce triglycerides. Weight loss: A meta-analysis of 65 RCTs showed that weight loss resulted in an average reduction in LDL cholesterol level of 15 mg/dL and triglyceride level of 26 mg/dL. [89] A m e t a - a n a l y s i s o f 4 7 R C T s s h o w e d t h a t w e i g h t l o s s resulted in an average increase in HDL cholesterol of 1 mg/dL. F o r e v e r y 7 p o u n d s o f w e i g h t l o s s i n o v e r w e i g h t , an increase in HDL of 1 mg/dL has been shown. [90,91] Exercise -- All Dose-response relationships between exercise volume and blood lipid changes suggest that exercise can favorably alter blood lipids at training volumes of 15 to 20 miles per week of brisk walking or jogging that expend between 1200 to 2200 kcal/wk. This range of weekly energy expenditure is associated with 2 to 3 mg/dl increases in HDL-C and triglyceride reductions of 8 to 20 mg/dl. [92] E v i d e n c e f r o m c r o s s - s e c t i o n a l s t u d i e s i n d i c a t e s t hat greater changes in HDL-C levels can be expected with additional increases in exercise training volume.

Exercise - Type 2 diabetes Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 24A meta-analysis of RCTs that examined the effects of 8 weeks or more of aerobic exercise on lipids and lipoproteins in adults with Type 2 diabetes yielded 7 studies. [93] A s t a t i s t i c a l l y s i g n i f i c a n t r e d u c t i o n o f a b o u t 5 % was found for LDL-C, whereas no statistically significant improvements were found for TC, HDL-C, TC/HDL-C or TG. Exercise - Metabolic Syndrome Systematic review and meta-analysis evidence indicates that long-term, moderate to moderately vigorous intensity exercise training, even in the absence of weight loss, improves the dyslipidemic profile by raising HDL-cholesterol and lowering triglycerides in overweight and obese adults with characteristics of the metabolic syndrome. [94] Exercise - CVD A meta-analysis to examine the effects of aerobic exercise on lipids and lipoproteins in adults with cardiovascular disease (CVD) included 10 studies representing 1,260 subjects (580 exercise, 680 control). [95] T h e r e w a s a s t a t i s t i c a l l y s i g n i f i c a n t i n c r e a s e o f 9% in HDL-C (+3.7 mg/dL) and a statistically significant decrease of 11% in TG (-19.3 mg/dL), but Women meta-analysis of the effects of aerobic exercise on lipids and lipoproteins in women showed significant improvements in all d u c t i o n s o f a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 % , 3 % , a n d 5 % , r e s p e ctively, were observed for TC, LDL-C, and TG, whereas an increase of 3% was observed for HDL-C. Aerobic exercise is efficacious for increasing HDL-C and decreasing TC, LDL-C, and TG in women. Smoking Cessation: Q u i t t i n g s m o k i n g h a s b e e n s h o w n t o r a i s e H D L b y a s much as 7-20 mg/dL. [97,98] D. METABOLIC SYNDROME / IMPAIRED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE The most indisputable fact about the Metabolic Syndrome is the importance of lifestyle changes in managing it. According to the NCEP ATP III - the presence of the syndrome is an indication for intensive lifestyle modification. [99] W e i g h t l o s s , i n c r e a s e d p h y s i c a l a c t i v i t y , a n d a n anti-atherogenic diet can improve all of the metabolic abnormalities without pharmaceutical intervention. [100] Lifestyle Intervention The initial therapeutic approach for the MetS is to reverse the root causes - atherogenic diet, sedentary lifestyle, and overweight or obesity. [101] A r e v i e w o f R C T s w i t h a t l e a s t 6 m o n t h s f o l l o w - u p yielded 3 studies based on lifestyle interventions, 5 studies based on drug therapy, and 3 studies based on laparoscopic weight-reduction surgery. T h e s t r i k i n g r e s o l u t i o n o f t h e m e t a b o l i c s y n d r o m e with weight-reduction surgery (93%) compared with lifestyle (25%) and drugs (19%) strongly suggests that obesity is the driving force. There is abundant evidence that a lifestyle approach can reduce the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes, along with a modest reduction in cardiovascular disease risk factors.

[103] A meta-analysis of lifestyle interventions reduced diabetes by approximately one-half vs. pharmacologic interventions by approximately one-third.

[105] A Cochrane review of the effects of exercise or exercise plus diet for preventing type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients with IGT or MetS included 8 trials of exercise plus diet, and 2 studies of diet only or exercise only. [107] E x e r c i s e p l u s d i e t i n t e r v e n t i o n s r e d u c e d t h e r i s k of diabetes compared with standard recommendations by 37% over a follow-up of one to six years.

N o s i g n i f i c a n t e f f e c t s o n d i a b e t e s i n c i d e n c e w e r e observed with exercise or diet only. Another analysis found that moderate-intensity lifestyle interventions can delay type 2 diabetes by an average of 11 years and reduce the number of new cases by 20%. This is much greater than what can be achieved with pharmacotherapy (delayed onset by 3 years, reduced cases by 8%). [108] There is growing evidence of the impact on the clinical status of patients with the syndrome. A s i g n i f i c a n t r e d u c t i o n i n p r e v a l e n c e o f m e t a b o l i c syndrome (OR 0.6) and abdominal obesity (0.5) were observed in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study. [109] A f o c u s e d l i f e s t y l e i n t e r v e n t i o n c a r r i e d o u t b y t rained professionals was compared to standard unstructured information given by family physicians. The result: after one year, the lifestyle intervention significantly reduced the MetS (OR = 0.3), as well as central obesity (OR = 0.3), hypertriglyceridemia (OR = 0.5), and diabetes (OR = 0.2). [110] T h e c o m b i n a t i o n o f d i e t a n d e x e r c i s e i n t e r v e n t i o n s was significantly more effective than either diet or exercise alone in the treatment of the metabolic syndrome after a one year study. Two out three cases were reversed with the combination vs. only about 1 in 3 in each of the other groups. [111] The power of a lifestyle intervention was seen in a small study from the Pritikin Longevity Center. [112] O b e s e m e n w e r e p l a c e d o n a h i g h l y c o n t r o l l e d l o w - fat (12-15%), high-unrefined carbohydrate, high-fiber, (> 40 gm) diet with daily aerobic exercise (45-60 min) for 3 weeks.

Analysis of published data along with Kaiser Permanente administrative data has shown that, compared with no prevention program, the DPP lifestyle approach can reduce a high-risk person's 30-year likelihood of developing diabetes from about 72% to 61%, the chance of a serious complication from about 38% to 30%, and the chance of dying of a complication of diabetes from about 14% to 11%. [113] M e t f o r m i n w o u l d d e l i v e r a b o u t a t h i r d o f t h e l o n g -term benefits achievable by lifestyle. Exercise, Physical Activity and Fitness Low cardiorespiratory fitness is a strong and independent predictor of incident metabolic syndrome in women and men. Age-adjusted incidence rates were significantly lower (linear trend, P<0.001) across incremental thirds of fitness in men and women -- 1.0, 0.74, and 0.47 in men; and 1.0, 0.80, and 0.37 in women. [114] Exercise has many positive effects in people with MetS - improved insulin action, glucose metabolism, aerobic metabolism, mitochondrial density, and respiratory chain proteins. [115] RCT evidence shows that exercise training in people with the MS or IGT: [116,117] I n c r e a s e s i n s u l i n s e n s i t i v i t y , Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 26 D e c r e a s e s b l o o d p r e s s u r e , i f e l e v a t e d , R e d u c e s t r i g l y c e r i d e s , i n c r e a s e s H D L , R e d u c e s i n f l a m m a t i o n , I m p r o v e s e n d o t h e l i a l f u n c t i o n [ 1 1 7 ] Almost all physical activity has a positive effect on insulin action, but moderate intensity, daily activity seems best. A significant part of the positive effect comes from the last bout of activity. [118] This is because the effect on insulin sensitivity lasts 24 to 48 hours. 3 0 m i n u t e s b r i s k w a l k i n g 3 - 7 t i m e s p e r w e e k o v e r 6 months reversed insulin resistance in sedentary insulin resistant individuals with no change in diet or weight.

[122] Just becoming less sedentary has a positive effect on the syndrome. T h e A u s t r a l i a n D i a b e t e s , O b e s i t y a n d L i f e s t y l e s t udy showed that avoiding prolonged periods of sedentary time, especially sitting, has a favorable effect on waist circumference, BMI, triglycerides, and 2-h plasma glucose.

Sedentary behaviors, especially TV watching, were associated with significantly elevated risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, whereas even light to moderate activity was associated with substantially lower risk. [124] Diet Changes The epidemic of the Metabolic Syndrome has been seen by some as the unwanted result of the dietary low fat crusade that has dominated the past 50 years. [125] F a t i n t a k e h a s d r o p p e d b u t o b e s i t y a n d t h e m e t a b o lic syndrome have risen. T h e p r o b l e m i s t h a t l o w f a t d i e t s t e n d t o b e h i g h in carbohydrates, and there is evidence that such diets may increase triglycerides and reduce HDL in susceptible people. [126] T h e 2 0 0 6 A H A s c i e n t i f i c s t a t e m e n t o n d i e t a n d l i f estyle recommendations recommends a moderate fat intake for the metabolic syndrome. [127] There is no single diet currently recommended for people with the Metabolic Syndrome, BUT there is evidence to support a Mediterranean style diet as the best approach. [101] A s y s t e m a t i c r e v i e w o f 3 5 s t u d i e s o f t h e e f f e c t s of the Mediterranean diet showed favorable effects on lipoprotein levels, endothelial vasodilatation, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, antioxidant capacity, myocardial and cardiovascular mortality, and cancer incidence in obese patients and in those with previous myocardial infarction.

[132] There is growing evidence that the type of fat in the diet plays an important role in the development of insulin resistance.

[135] In middle-aged adults, soft drink consumption is associated with a higher prevalence and incidence of multiple metabolic risk factors. Consumption of 1 soft drink per day was associated with nearly 1.5 times the risk of developing metabolic syndrome. [136] E m e r g i n g e v i d e n c e a l s o s u g g e s t s t h a t i n c r e a s e d c o nsumption of fructose may also be a factor in the growing rates of obesity and the metabolic syndrome. [137] The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study found that long term consumption of a Western dietary pattern, especially including meat, fried foods, and diet soda, increased the risk of developing the Metabolic Syndrome. [138] T h e W h i t e h a l l I I s t u d y c o n f i r m e d t h i s - - a d i e t a r y pattern with high consumption of diet soft drinks, onions, sugar-sweetened beverages, burgers and sausages, crisps and other snacks, and white bread and low consumption of high-fiber breakfast cereals, jam, French dressing/vinaigrette, and whole wheat bread was associated with the development of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. [139] Weight Loss: Weight loss has a huge impact in improving the risk factors of the metabolic syndrome. Several studies have shown that losing just 7% to 10% of initial body weight is sufficient to improve waist circumference, elevated triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol, trunk fat, and plasma glucose. [140] E. TYPE 2 DIABETES A growing body of evidence shows that lifestyle interventions are a critical adjunct to the management of type 2 diabetes - improves glycemic control, slows progression of the disease, and minimizes the risk of developing complications. [141,142] W i t h t h e h i g h r i s k f o r C V D , a g g r e s s i v e m a n a g e m e n t of CVD risk factors is imperative. [143] Lifestyle Intervention: The Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial involved an intensive lifestyle intervention in type 2 diabetics, most also with the MetS.

A short-term (3 wk) lifestyle intervention showed how quickly metabolic changes can occur with lifestyle modifications. [145] H o w e v e r , i t w a s i n a t i g h t l y c o n t r o l l e d e n v i r o n m e nt (the Pritikin Longevity Center). A h i g h - f i b e r ( > 4 0 g m ) , l o w - f a t d i e t w i t h d a i l y a erobic exercise led to significant improvements in total cholesterol (- 40 mg/dL), LDL (- 27 mg/dL), fasting glucose (- 31 mg/dL), fasting insulin (- 10 mcU/ml), insulin resistance, as well as indicators of oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial function in men with type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Exercise, Physical Activity and Fitness: Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 28Low cardiorespiratory fitness has been shown to be a powerful and independent predictor of mortality in people with diabetes. The Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study showed that low fit men with T2DM have twice the mortality risk of moderately fit men. [146] T h e N u r s e ' s H e a l t h S t u d y f o u n d a n i n v e r s e r e l a t i o n between hours per week of moderate to vigorous activity and risk for CVD events in women with T2DM (> 4 hrs/wk, nearly half the risk).

[148] A systematic review of the effects of exercise on fitness in Type 2 diabetics found a 12% increase in VO2max in exercise groups vs. a 1% decrease in control groups. [149] H i g h e r e x e r c i s e i n t e n s i t i e s p r o d u c e d l a r g e r i m p r o vements in VO(2max) and greater improvement in HbA1c compared to interventions that tested larger exercise volume. Effect on Control: A 2001 meta-analysis of 12 aerobic exercise studies with no changes in diet in people with Type 2 diabetes found a modest reduction in A1c of 0.7%, independent of any change in body weight. [150] I n c r e a s i n g e x e r c i s e i n t e n s i t y h a d a g r e a t e r e f f e c t than increasing duration or frequency of exercise. T h i s l e d t h e A D A t o r e c o m m e n d i n c l u d i n g s o m e v i g o rous exercise in interventions for glycemic control in those without contraindications. [151] A d d i n g s o m e r e s i s t a n c e e x e r c i s e t o a n a e r o b i c p r o gram has been shown to significantly improve glucose control and insulin sensitivity over an aerobic program alone. [152] A later meta-analysis (2006) of the effects of different modes of exercise training on glucose control and risk factors for complications in Type 2 diabetics found trivial differences among aerobic, resistance, and combined training on HbA(1c); for training lasting 12 weeks, the overall effect was a modest reduction of 0.8, similar to dietary, drug, and insulin treatment. [153] C o m b i n e d t r a i n i n g w a s g e n e r a l l y s u p e r i o r t o e i t h e r aerobic or resistance training alone. A 2006 Cochrane review of 14 RCTs of the effects of exercise in type 2 diabetes mellitus found that the exercise interventions significantly improved glycemic control (decrease in hemoglobin A1c levels of 0.6%). [154] E x e r c i s e s i g n i f i c a n t l y i n c r e a s e d i n s u l i n r e s p o n s e , and decreased plasma triglycerides. This was associated with a reduction in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue. No adverse effects were reported. A significant correlation has been observed between insulin sensitivity and the average number of steps taken in a day. The improved effectiveness of insulin is attributable, at least in part, to increases in GLUT4 protein, IRS1 and PI3-kinase protein in skeletal muscle. [155] Diet NHANES 1999-2002 data showed that diabetic patients treated by diet alone had the best glycemic control (66% in good control vs. 39% overall). [156] In terms of diet changes: [157] N o s i n g l e d i e t b e s t f o r a l l d i a b e t i c p a t i e n t s . H i g h p r o t e i n d i e t s ( > 2 0 % ) a r e n o t r e c o m m e n d e d . A m o d e r a t e c a r b o h y d r a t e i n t a k e ( 4 5 - 6 5 % o f c a l o r i c intake) is recommended, no less than 130 grams daily. For glucose control, a focus on total carbohydrates, whatever the source, is most effective; however, emphasis should be on carbohydrates from vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and fruits for fiber and nutrient density; foods high in sugar are usually nutritionally weak. [158,159] The strongest evidence supports an increased intake of whole grains and dietary fiber to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of complications.

CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE A systematic review found that 4 lifestyle changes can affect mortality risk in CVD patients: [169] s m o k i n g c e s s a t i o n - - a 3 6 % r e d u c t i o n ( R R , 0.64; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.71), i n c r e a s e d p h y s i c a l a c t i v i t y - - a 2 4 % r e d u c t i o n i n mortality risk (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.98), m o d e r a t e a l c o h o l u s e - - a 2 0 % r e d u c t i o n i n m o r t a l ity risk (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.83), and d i e t a r y c h a n g e s - - a 4 4 % r e d u c t i o n i n m o r t a l i t y r isk (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.74). A Cochrane review of 63 RCT of the effectiveness of secondary cardiac prevention programs with and without exercise components showed that a wide variety of secondary prevention programs improve health outcomes in patients with coronary disease. [170] T h e s u m m a r y r i s k r a t i o f o r a l l - c a u s e m o r t a l i t y w a s 0.97 at 12 months, but 0.53 at 24 months.

E f f e cts were similar for programs that included risk factor education or counseling with or without a structured exercise component, and for programs that were solely exercise-based. A review of literature examining interventions to assist patients in achieving risk factor reductions through lifestyle change after myocardial infarction or coronary artery revascularization found that evidence supports: frequent follow-up, intensive diet changes, individualized and group exercise, coaching, group meetings, education on lifestyle modification and behavior change, and formal cardiac rehabilitation programs. [171] Lifestyle Interventions: The Lifestyle Heart Trial (Ornish) provided conclusive evidence that intensive lifestyle changes can regress coronary atherosclerosis.

Diet Changes: A Mediterranean diet pattern has been shown to be an effective adjunct to pharmacotherapy for secondary prevention. The focus on good fats has been suggested to be more effective than simply reducing total fat intake. [175,176] T h e L y o n D i e t H e a r t S t u d y c o m p a r e d a M e d i t e r r a n e a n-type diet with a \"Western\" diet following an initial MI.

[178] M o d e s t f i s h c o n s u m p t i o n o f 1 - 2 s e r v i n g s p e r w e e k of species rich in omega-3 fatty acids can reduce CHD death by 36% and total mortality by 17%. [179] T h e c o n s u m p t i o n of 2 servings (about 8 oz) per week of fish high in EPA and DHA is associated with a reduced risk of both sudden death and death from coronary artery disease in adults. [180,181] Smoking Cessation: Smoking promotes the progression of CVD and, in CAD patients, is an important predictor of future CV events. [182] Several studies have shown that quitting improves longevity and reduces recurrent events. [183] A s y s t e m a t i c r e v i e w o f c o h o r t s t u d i e s f o u n d t h a t smoking cessation was associated with a 36% reduction in mortality risk in CAD patients.

[186] A systematic review of the effects of individual counseling on smoking cessation showed that individual counseling for 6 months or longer resulted in a 1.6 times greater likelihood of successful cessation. [187] Weight Loss: Although the association between obesity and CVD is well established, there have been no large scale RCTs of the effects of weight loss on cardiovascular outcomes. [188,189] M o s t o f t h e e v i d e n c e o n t h e C V b e n e f i t s o f w e i g h t reduction has been obtained from observational studies where weight loss was a secondary end point. S e v e r a l s t u d i e s s h o w t h a t w e i g h t l o s s i n o v e r w e i g ht or obese reduces CVD risk factors. Caloric reduction of 500 kcal/d or more is recommended for most overweight patients with CVD until they reach their ideal body weight. [190] Exercise: Several systematic reviews have shown the importance of exercise for patients with CVD. [191] A n e n e r g y e x p e n d i t u r e o f a b o u t 1 6 0 0 k c a l s p e r w e e k has been found to be effective in halting the progression of CAD, and 2200 kcals per week has been shown to be associated with plaque reduction in patients with atherosclerotic heart disease. [192,193] A systematic review of 48 RCTs (8940 patients) investigating the effectiveness of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation showed that, compared with usual care, exercise rehab was associated with reduced all-cause mortality (OR = 0.80) and cardiac mortality (OR = 0.74), greater reductions in total cholesterol level (WMD, -14.3 mg/dL), triglyceride level (WMD, -20.4 mg/dL]), and systolic blood (WMD, -3.2 mm Hg); and lower rates of self-reported smoking (OR = 0.64). [194] N o s i g n i f i c a n t d i f f e r e n c e s i n t h e r a t e s o f n o n f a t al myocardial infarction and revascularization, or changes in high- and LDL cholesterol levels and diastolic pressure, or health-related quality of life were observed. Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 31A prospective study of 773 men with known CAD followed for 5 years showed that those who engaged in light and moderate levels of activity had 58% and 53% lower mortality risks than those who engaged in minimal or no activity. [195] A RCT involving 62 patients with angiographically proven CAD randomized to regular physical exercise or usual care showed that after 1 year, atherosclerosis progressed in those who exercised the least (mean energy expended, 1000 kcal/wk), while it modestly regressed in those who exercised the most (mean, 2200 kcal/wk). [196] Exercise Recommendations: [197] A n E x p e r t W o r k i n g G r o u p o f t h e N a t i o n a l H e a r t F o u ndation of Australia reviewed the evidence for exercise with CVD since the US Surgeon General's Report on Physical Activity and Health in 1996. The Expert Working Group recommended that: people with established clinically stable cardiovascular disease should aim to achieve 30 minutes or more of moderate intensity physical activity on most, if not all, days of the week; less intense and even shorter bouts of activity with more rest periods for those with advanced CVD; and regular low-to-moderate level resistance activity, initially under the supervision of an exercise professional, is encouraged. B e n e f i t s f o r p e o p l e w i t h C V D i n c l u d e a u g m e n t e d p h ysiological functioning, lessening of cardiovascular symptoms, enhanced quality of life, improved coronary risk profile, superior muscular fitness and, for survivors of acute MI, lower mortality. T h e g r e a t e s t p o t e n t i a l f o r b e n e f i t i s i n t h o s e p e ople who were least active before beginning regular physical activity, and this benefit may be achieved even at relatively low levels of physical activity. Excessive Alcohol Consumption: A number of studies have shown that reducing excessive alcohol consumption to a moderate level reduces the risk of a variety of vascular diseases, including MI, PVD, and sudden cardiac death. [198] Psychosocial Risk: A number of psychological factors, including chronic hostility, social isolation, and lack of social support have been linked to poorer outcomes in patients with CHD. A m e t a - a n a l y s i s o f 3 7 s m a l l e r s t u d i e s s h o w e d t h a t stress management and health education in patients with CHD may reduce both recurrent MI and cardiac death by up to a third.

STROKE Exercise - Strengthening High-intensity resistance training has traditionally been excluded from stroke rehabilitation programs because of concern that high-exertion activity will increase spasticity. A s y s t e m a t i c r e v i e w o f 1 1 s t u d i e s t h a t m e t t h e c r iteria to determine the effects of resistance training on functional outcomes and spasticity post-stroke found that resistance training can increase strength, gait speed, and functional outcomes and improve quality of life without exacerbating the risk of spasticity. [201] A n o t h e r s y s t e m a t i c r e v i e w o f 1 5 R C T s f o u n d t h a t s trengthening interventions had a small positive effect on both strength and activity in stroke patients with no increase in spasticity. [202] Exercise - Aerobic A Cochrane review of aerobic exercise in stroke patients showed a consistent positive effect on aerobic capacity, regardless of the stage of recovery. [203] P e a k V O 2 , p e a k w o r k l o a d , w a l k i n g v e l o c i t y a n d w a l king endurance were all significantly improved. Authors concluded that aerobic exercise should be an important component of rehabilitation in people with mild and moderate stroke. H. HEART FAILURE Exercise Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 32A systematic review of 69 RCTs of exercise interventions for HF suggested that exercise might slow the progression of HF. [204] Another systematic review of home-based exercise programs for people with chronic heart failure produced 10 RCTs with 648 participants. [205] P r o g r a m s i n c r e a s e d 6 - m i n w a l k i n g d i s t a n c e b y a n a verage of 41 m and peak VO2 by 2.71 ml/kg/min more than usual activity.

A modified Philadelphia Panel rating method to evaluate the evidence supporting exercise interventions in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) used a systematic review of RCTs and CCTs.

Resistance exercise was shown to improve left ventricular function, peak lactate levels, muscle strength, and muscle endurance. A meta-analysis (14 RCTs) of the effect of exercise training on left ventricular (LV) remodeling in heart failure found that aerobic training reverses LV remodeling in clinically stable individuals. [207] E j e c t i o n f r a c t i o n s i g n i f i c a n t l y i m p r o v e d ( W M D = 2 .59%), as did end-diastolic volume (WMD = -11.49 ml) and end-systolic volume (WMD = -12.87 ml).

A 2004 Cochrane review (29 RCTs) investigated the effectiveness of exercise-based interventions compared with usual medical care on the mortality, morbidity, exercise capacity and health related quality of life, of patients with heart failure found that exercise training significantly increased VO2max by 2.16 ml/kg/min, exercise duration increased by 2.38 minutes, work capacity by 15.1 Watts and distance on the six minute walk by 41 meters. [209] H R Q o L i m p r o v e d i n 7 o f 9 t r i a l s t h a t m e a s u r e d t h i s outcome. A larger systematic review of 81 studies (30 RCTs, 9 crossover, 37 longitudinal cohort, and 5 nonrandomized controlled trials) found an average 17% increase in peak oxygen consumption in 40 aerobic training studies, 15% in 13 studies of combined aerobic and strength training, and 16% in the one study of inspiratory training. [210] E x e r c i s e t r a i n i n g w a s s h o w n t o b e s a f e a n d e f f e c t ive in patients with heart failure; there were no reports of deaths directly related to exercise during more than 60,000 patient-hours of exercise training. A meta-analysis of the effect of exercise training on survival in HF patients (9 datasets with 801 patients) found that during a mean follow up of nearly 2 years there was an overall reduction in mortality: 88 (22%) deaths in the exercise arm vs. 105 (26%) in the control arm.

Improvements persisted for up to two years. An earlier Cochrane review (8 trials) of supervised versus non-supervised exercise therapy for people with intermittent claudication found that supervised exercise therapy was more effective, with approximately 150 meters greater increase in walking distance. [213] Lifestyle Modification A systematic review of the effects of life-style modification on mortality and cardiovascular events in patients with PAD found that despite the lack of RCT data, there is sufficient evidence to recommend some life-style modification as part of the overall approach to risk reduction in these patients. [214] T h e r e i s c o m p e l l i n g e v i d e n c e t o s u p p o r t s m o k i n g c essation, increased exercise and improved diet. J.

[215] C o m b i n i n g t a r g e t e d i n s p i r a t o r y m u s c l e t r a i n i n g w i th exercise and/or pulmonary rehabilitation led to greater improvements in inspiratory muscle strength and exercise tolerance than exercise alone. [216] Comprehensive Pulmonary Rehabilitation A systematic review of the effectiveness of disease-management programs for COPD showed that the disease-management programs significantly improved exercise capacity (32.2 m), decreased risk of hospitalization, and moderately improved health-related quality of life. All-cause mortality did not differ. [217] A systematic review of 31 RCTs of the impact of pulmonary rehabilitation programs on health-related quality of life (QoL) and exercise capacity in patients with COPD showed significant improvements in dyspnea and fatigue, emotional function and patients' control over their condition; improvements were moderately large and clinically significant. [218] T h e e f f e c t o n e x e r c i s e c a p a c i t y w a s s m a l l a n d s l i ghtly below the threshold of clinical significance for the six-minute walking distance (WMD: 48 m; n = 16 trials). Another systematic review (6 RCTs) of the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation (with or without education) on anxiety and depression in patients with COPD found that rehab programs with up to three sessions per week of supervised exercise, along with education and psychosocial support, significantly reduced anxiety and depression more than standard care. [219] E d u c a t i o n a l o n e a n d e x e r c i s e t r a i n i n g a l o n e w e r e not associated with significant reductions in either anxiety or depression.

Self Management Self-management of COPD is aimed at teaching skills needed to carry out medical regimens specific to the disease, guide health behavior change, and provide emotional support for patients to control their disease and live functional lives. A C o c h r a n e r e v i e w o f s e l f - m a n a g e m e n t p r o g r a m s f o r COPD combined 14 trials and showed a significant reduction in the probability of at least one hospital admission in patients receiving self-management education compared to usual care (OR 0.64).

A m e t a - a n a l y s i s o f p h y s i c a l a c t i v i t y i n t e r v e n t i o n s in arthritis patients included 28 studies and showed moderate positive effects on physical activity behavior and small positive effects on pain and physical function outcomes. [231] A n o t h e r s y s t e m a t i c r e v i e w o f 6 s c i e n t i f i c r e v i e w s and 10 RCTs on the effect of exercise on OA management concluded that the weight of the evidence supports the effectiveness of structured exercise programs (either strength training or aerobic exercise) in the management of in middle-aged and elderly subjects with OA. [232] Another systematic review of RCTs and CCTs on the long-term effectiveness of exercise therapy for osteoarthritis yielded 5 high-quality and 6 low-quality RCTs.

[236] Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 35 Exercise - Aquatic Group-based water exercise has been shown to result in significant improvement in pain and physical function with knee or hip OA [237] A Cochrane review of the effectiveness and safety of aquatic-exercise in the treatment of knee and hip osteoarthritis yielded only 6 trials (800 participants).

A 1 year RCT found that group-based water exercise can produce significant reduction in pain and improvement in physical function in older adults with lower limb OA, and may be a useful adjunct in the management of hip and/or knee OA. [239] Exercise - Knee OA A Cochrane review and meta-analysis of 32 RCTs examining the effectiveness of land-based exercise (as opposed to water exercise) for OA of the knee found a beneficial effect on both pain and physical function. [240] R e s u l t s w e r e b e t t e r w i t h m o r e d i r e c t s u p e r v i s i o n , but remained significant and clinically relevant at lower levels of supervision; authors concluded that there is platinum level evidence that land-based therapeutic exercise has at least short term benefit in terms of reduced knee pain and improved physical function for people with knee OA. The magnitude of the treatment effect is comparable to estimates for NSAIDs. A review of 23 systematic reviews published between 2000 and 2007 on physical therapy interventions for patients with knee osteoarthritis concluded that there is high-quality evidence that exercise and weight reduction reduce pain and improve physical function in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. [241] A meta-analysis of 16 studies reporting exercise and/or self-management interventions for patients with knee OA found that exercise regimens can improve physical health and lessen the overall impact of OA. [242] S e l f - m a n a g e m e n t p r o g r a m s s i g n i f i c a n t l y i m p r o v e d p sychological outcomes only; the overall effect of OA was not significantly improved. Exercise - Hip OA A systematic review of evidence for the efficacy of exercise for hip OA from 9 RCTs that met the inclusion criteria found a beneficial effect of exercise with an effect size (ES) of -0.38. [243] T h e e x e r c i s e b e n e f i t r e m a i n e d s i g n i f i c a n t w h e n o n ly the better quality studies were included (ES of -0.46).

Diet: No single diet prescription has been shown to be best for OA; however, higher intakes of fruits and vegetables have been associated with reduced risk, thus should be recommended due to multiple other benefits to health. [246] Weight Loss: Weight loss in overweight patients is a key goal; 10 pounds of extra weight increases the force on the knee by 30-60 pounds each step; excess weight has also been associated with higher rates of hand OA (suggesting a systemic factor as well). [221] M e t a - a n a l y s i s f o u n d t h a t a 5 % o r g r e a t e r w e i g h t r eduction is associated with a significant reduction of pain and disability [247] T h e A r t h r i t i s , D i e t , a n d A c t i v i t y P r o m o t i o n T r a i l (ADAPT) showed that modest weight loss (5%) combined with exercise is best approach [248] T h e c o m b i n a t i o n i m p r o v e d f u n c t i o n i n g , p a i n , p e r f o rmance, and endurance relative to either weight loss or exercise alone.

RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS Overall A review of the effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatment modalities for RA found that the evidence of effectiveness varies among the different modalities, with relatively strong support for exercise and self-management interventions, and modest support for joint protection programs, specific orthoses and comprehensive care interventions.

A Cochrane review of RCTs evaluating rehabilitation interventions for people with rheumatoid arthritis found that patient education and joint protection training using behavioral approaches; dynamic exercise therapy, hand exercises and hydrotherapy; and cognitive-behavioral therapy (in people with poorer psychological status) are effective in reducing pain and maintaining function over at least a one-year period. [254] A scientific committee evaluated the evidence from 198 publications, and arrived at four recommendations for nonpharmacological treatment of early RA: [255] Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 37(1) physical exercise and sports can be recommended; muscle strength exercises are advisable; (2) metatarsal pain and/or foot alignment abnormalities should be looked for regularly, and appropriate insoles prescribed if needed; (3) specific dietary measures and nutritional supplements are not indicated for early RA; (4) elimination diets, particularly with low intakes of dairy products, should be discouraged. Exercise -- All A systematic review of the effectiveness of exercise interventions in improving disease-related characteristics in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) included 40 studies and found strong evidence that various types of exercise from low to high intensity are effective in improving disease-related characteristics and functional ability in RA patients. [256] Exercise - Tai Chi The major goals of treatment are to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, slow down or stop joint damage, prevent disability, and preserve or improve the person's sense of well-being and ability to function. T a i C h i h a s b e e n r e c o g n i z e d i n C h i n a a s a n e f f e c t ive arthritis therapy for centuries.

The effect on pain was not reported. [257] M. CANCER - ALL Multi-component programs: Can reduce fatigue and associated symptoms. A s y s t e m a t i c r e v i e w o f 5 7 R C T s i n v e s t i g a t i n g m u l t i-component interventions for cancer-related fatigue and associated symptoms (vigor/vitality) found that exercise and psychological interventions both reduced fatigue, with no significant differences between them. [258] S p e c i f i c a l l y , m u l t i m o d a l e x e r c i s e a n d w a l k i n g p r o grams, restorative approaches, supportive-expressive, and cognitive-behavioral psychosocial interventions were most promising. Some evidence supports the positive effects of self-management programs and self-efficacy enhancing programs on health outcomes, exercise adherence and later exercise behavior in cancer patients. [259] Exercise: Has many benefits for cancer patients. A 2 0 0 7 r e v i e w o f t h e e v i d e n c e o f t h e e f f e c t s o f e xercise on risk factors for adverse outcomes of cancer and its treatment showed that there is mounting evidence that exercise improves fatigue, physical functioning, and cardio-respiratory fitness.

A meta-analysis of exercise interventions for people treated for cancer showed that exercise interventions resulted in small positive effects on health and well-being outcomes, including physical function, for symptoms other than fatigue, and for body composition.

Patients with breast cancer and other selected patients should receive recommendations for moderate exercise programs. A Cochrane review of 28 studies of the effects of physical activity in reducing cancer-related fatigue found that exercise was statistically more effective than control interventions both during and following therapy.

O. OSTEOPOROSIS Greatest known modifiable risk factor is excess weight; weight gain associated with development and progression of OA; can create a vicious cycle of pain, inactivity and weight gain. An update of the evidence-based position statement of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2002 regarding the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women found that: [272] T h e p r i m a r y g o a l o f t h e r a p y i s t o p r e v e n t f r a c t u r es by slowing or stopping bone loss, maintaining bone strength, and minimizing or eliminating factors that contribute to fractures. T h e m o s t c o m m o n r i s k f a c t o r s f o r o s t e o p o r o t i c f r a cture are advanced age, low bone mineral density, and previous fracture as an adult.

Exercise: Resistance exercise can stimulate an increase in bone formation in younger adults and can slow bone loss in middle age. [273] A 6-month RCT showed that exercise training was effective in improving bone density in older women with low bone density.

Exercise - Walking A systematic review of 8 RCTs and non-RCTs of the effects of walking programs on bone mineral density (BMD) at the hip and spine in postmenopausal women found no significant effect on lumbar spine bone density but significant positive effects at femoral neck. [278] Another meta-analysis of walking interventions in postmenopausal women and men and women aged 50 years and older found that walking had a significant positive effect on lumbar BMD but not on the femur or the calcaneus.

Another systematic review of resistance exercise programs in postmenopausal women yielded 20 studies and showed that weight training exercises were effective at increasing BMD of the spine and hip in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. [281] T h e i n c r e a s e s a r e s i t e - s p e c i f i c a n d r e q u i r e h i g h loading with a training intensity of 70% to 90% of 1 RM for 8 to 12 repetitions of 2 to 3 sets performed over one year duration. High Intensity Resistance Training - Premenopausal Women Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 40A similar analysis in premenopausal women found that high-intensity progressive resistance training was effective in increasing absolute BMD at the lumbar spine but not the femoral neck.

[289] Q. FIBROMYLAGIA Multi-Component Lifestyle Therapy There is growing evidence that a combination of interventions (i.e., exercise combined with education and psychologically-based interventions) is the most promising means of managing patients with fibromyalgia (FM). [290] A systematic review of the efficacy of multicomponent treatments (at least 1 educational or other psychological therapy with at least 1 exercise therapy) yielded 9 RCTs (1,119 subjects) and found \"strong\" evidence for beneficial short-term effects on the key symptoms including reducing pain, fatigue, depressive symptoms, and limitations to health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and improved self-efficacy for pain control and physical fitness.

Exercise Most authors report a beneficial effect of aerobic exercise training for fibromyalgia patients with chronic pain or fatigue.

A 2003 systematic review of exercise in patients with fibromyalgia found that low-intensity aerobic exercise, such as walking or pool exercise, can improve function, distress and symptoms.

In 2007 a Cochrane Review Group published a systematic review of 34 studies found \"strong\" evidence for supervised aerobic exercise training on physical capacity and FMS symptoms.

[295] The Ottawa Panel recommends both aerobic and strengthening exercises for the management of fibromyalgia as a result of the emerging evidence from their synthesis of evidence from 13 RCTs/3 CCTs for aerobic exercise and 5 RCTs for strengthening exercises in the management of fibromyalgia. [296,297] R. CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME (CFS) Debate exists among health care professionals and patients about appropriate strategies for managing chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). A systematic review of interventions for the treatment or management of CFS found 44 studies meeting inclusion criteria, including 36 RCTs. [298] S t u d i e s w e r e g r o u p e d i n t o 6 c a t e g o r i e s . G r a d e d e xercise therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy showed the most promising results with high quality evidence. There was insufficient evidence for pharmacological, supplements, immunological, complementary/alternative, and other interventions. Exercise: A Cochrane review of 5 studies that that investigated exercise therapy for CFS found that, at 12 weeks, those receiving exercise therapy were less fatigued than the control participants (SMD -0.77). [299] P h y s i c a l f u n c t i o n i n g w a s a l s o s i g n i f i c a n t l y i m p r o ved with exercise therapy (SMD -0.64), and depression was also improved (although non-significantly) (WMD -0.58). A u t h o r s c o n c l u d e d t h a t t h e r e i s e n c o u r a g i n g e v i d e nce that some patients may benefit from exercise therapy and no evidence that exercise therapy may worsen outcomes. U s i n g e v i d e n c e f r o m b o t h t h e b i o l o g i c a l a n d c l i n i cal sciences, they found that graded exercise therapy is safe in people with CFS with no detrimental effects on the immune system.

DIABETES TYPE 1 Behavior Change Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 42A meta-analysis of interventions designed to improve health behaviors including exercise among adults with type 1 diabetes included data from 1435 subjects showed that behavior change interventions improve metabolic control in type 1 diabetes.

U. MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) Exercise A meta-analysis of the effect of exercise training on quality of life (QOL) among people with MS yielded 13 studies meeting inclusion criteria.

[305] X. CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN Exercise A systematic review of the effectiveness of exercises in decreasing LBP incidence, intensity and impact yielded 15 studies that provided strong evidence that exercise was effective in reducing the severity and activity interference from LBP. [306] A n o t h e r s y s t e m a t i c r e v i e w o f t h e e f f e c t i v e n e s s o f therapeutic aquatic exercise in the treatment of low back pain included 37 studies. There was sufficient evidence to suggest that therapeutic aquatic exercise is potentially beneficial to patients suffering from chronic low back pain and pregnancy-related low back pain. [307] A Cochrane review of the effect of unloaded movement facilitation exercises on outcomes for people with nonspecific chronic low back pain yielded 6 high-quality RCTs. [308] T h e r e w a s s t r o n g e v i d e n c e t h a t u n l o a d e d m o v e m e n t facilitation exercise, compared to no exercise, improves pain and function. Effects are comparable to other types of exercise, including effort-intensive strengthening and time-intensive stabilization exercise.

Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 43 A synthesis of systematic reviews of nonpharmacologic therapies for chronic low back pain concluded that there is good evidence that cognitive-behavioral therapy, exercise, spinal manipulation, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation are all moderately effective for chronic or subacute (>4 weeks' duration) low back pain. [309] V. PRACTICE PATTERNS RELATED TO LIFESTYLE MEDICINE Despite consistent recommendations from the most respected medical associations over the last decade, clinician practices regarding lifestyle medicine have not improved much. [1,2] R e s e a r c h h a s c o n s i s t e n t l y r e p o r t e d t h a t t h e m a j o r ity of clinicians do not routinely screen or assist patients in modifying their health damaging behaviors. [3-13] O n l y 1 i n 8 p r i m a r y c a r e p h y s i c i a n s w a s e v e n a w a r e of the ACSM recommendations for physical activity. [14] ADVICE AND COUNSELING Smoking A b o u t h a l f ( 4 8 % ) o f s m o k e r s r e p o r t e d t h a t h e a l t h c are professionals had advised them to quit in the past 12 months but only about 1 in 4 were offered assistance in quitting. [15] Diet and Exercise O n l y 1 i n 3 p a t i e n t s i n d i c a t e d t h a t t h e y h a d e v e r received even simple advice to increase activity. [16,17] T h e s a m e p r o p o r t i o n o f h y p e r t e n s i v e p a t i e n t s ( 1 i n 3) was counseled about physical activity to help manage their hypertension. [17a] T h e 2 0 0 0 N a t i o n a l H e a l t h I n t e r v i e w S u r v e y ( N H I S ) showed that fewer than 1 in 4 respondents received any physician advice on diet and exercise (21.3% and 24.5% respectively). [18] E v e n i n h i g h e r r i s k , r a t e s a r e l o w - - f r o m 1 9 9 2 - 2 000, diet and physical activity counseling took place in < 45% and 30%, respectively, of primary care visits by adults with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity, or diabetes mellitus. [8] A r e v i e w o f g e n e r a l p r a c t i t i o n e r r e c o r d s f o r m 4 2 practices showed that only half of patients with PAD received advice about exercise or had their body mass index checked. [18a] A c h a r t r e v i e w o f 1 0 5 r a n d o m l y s e l e c t e d p a t i e n t s with knee OA showed that fewer than 3 out of 5 had been advised to do any kind of exercise, only half of overweight had been advised to lose weight, and only 2 in 5 had been told about the benefits of strengthening exercise. [18b] L i k e l i h o o d o f r e c e i v i n g e x e r c i s e c o u n s e l i n g d e c r e ases with age. Of adults > 45 years, men aged 45-54 were most likely to receive exercise counseling from their PCP, but still just over 1 in 5 received such assistance. [19] W o m e n > 7 5 y e a r s w e r e l e a s t l i k e l y - - f e w e r t h a n 1 in 10 received exercise counseling. L o w r a t e s o f c o u n s e l i n g w e r e s u b s t a n t i a t e d b y o b s ervations of patient visits in 38 primary care practices by trained medical students -- physicians counseled on dietary habits in 1 in 4 visits and exercise in 1 in 5 visits; new patients were counseled more often than established ones; counseling was more frequent when there were diet and exercise brochures in the office. [20] 9 i n 1 0 i n t e r n a l m e d i c i n e r e s i d e n t s w e r e c o n f i d e n t in their knowledge of exercise, but only 1 in 4 was confident in counseling patients. [21] P h y s i c i a n s c o u n s e l d i a b e t i c p a t i e n t s m o r e f r e q u e n tly than those in a pre-diabetic state. Among Swiss primary care physicians, 91% of their diabetic patients received counseling for dietary changes and 79% for physicial activity. However, the rates for pre-diabetic patients was 66% and 60%, respectively. [40] Weight Loss O n l y 2 o f e v e r y 5 o b e s e p a t i e n t s a r e a d v i s e d t o l ose weight in regular exams, even when they have chronic conditions made worse by their weight. [22-29] Lifestyle Medicine Review American College of Preventive Medicine 44 E v e n f e w e r ( < 1 i n 4 ) o v e r w e i g h t ( n o t y e t o b e s e ) had discussed weight with their physician. [30] E v e n w h e n t h e y a d v i s e p a t i e n t s t o l o s e w e i g h t , p h ysicians often provide insufficient guidance on weight management strategies, possibly because of inadequate counseling skills and confidence. [31] P a t i e n t s w e r e m o r e l i k e l y t o r e c e i v e i n f o r m a t i o n on the benefits of weight loss, but only 1 in 3 received specific weight control advice, and 1 in 4 were advised to increase physical activity. [32] W o m e n m o r e l i k e l y t h a n m e n t o b e c o u n s e l e d - o n l y 1 in 4 men vs. 2 in 5 women. [33] E v e n w i t h o b e s i t y - r e l a t e d c o - m o r b i d i t i e s , w e i g h t loss counseling occurred in only half of visits. [34] Advice alone is not enough. I t t a k e s m o r e t h a n s i m p l e a d v i c e t o c h a n g e b e h a v i ors. The challenge remains converting awareness into behavior change. [16] S i m p l e a d v i c e t o i n c r e a s e p h y s i c a l a c t i v i t y w a s n ot enough to produce long term changes in activity patterns. [35] Adequacy of Counseling Counseling is most effective when physicians present counseling as a plan or prescription and follow up with the patient on it. O v e r w e i g h t a d u l t s w h o w e r e a d v i s e d t o e x e r c i s e , a nd provided a plan, were nearly 5 times as likely to meet physical activity recommendations. [36] P a t i e n t s w h o r e c a l l e d b e i n g c o u n s e l e d t o l o s e w e i ght were more likely to understand the risks of obesity, the benefits of weight loss, and were at a higher stage of readiness for weight loss. [31] But when counseling is given, it often does not include a specific plan. O n l y 1 t o 5 o f e v e r y 2 0 o b e s e p a t i e n t s w a s g i v e n specific fat loss counseling, especially a plan that includes an increase in physical activity. [31,32,37] Patients want more counseling Most patients (especially overweight or obese) want more help than they are getting. [38] O b e s e w o m e n r e p o r t m u c h l e s s s a t i s f a c t i o n w i t h o b esity care than general health care. A l m o s t h a l f r e p o r t e d t h a t t h e y h a d n o t b e e n g i v e n a weight loss strategy, and 3 out of 4 indicated they expected only a \"slight amount of help\" or \"none at all\" when it came to weight control. [39] VI. THE NEED FOR COMPETENCE IN LIFESTYLE MEDICINE Greater physician competence in lifestyle medicine might carry with it a number of positive downstream effects. It could: Change the image of lifestyle medicine - a central role in managing chronic disease. A c u l t u r a l l y c o m p e t e n t , p a t i e n t - c e n t e r e d a p p r o a c h with interventions tailored to each patient's unique medical, psychological, and socio-cultural situation. C h a n g e t h e o r i e n t a t i o n t o a c h r o n i c c a r e p e r s p e c t ive -- a long term, on-going process; the Chronic Care model presents a guide for making this change. [1] T r e a t m e n t p l a n s f o c u s e d o n e n t i r e r i s k f a c t o r p r o file rather than on isolated risk conditions. T h e u s e o f r e g i s t r i e s , m u l t i d i s c i p l i n a r y t e a m s , c ommunity outreach, interventions that address care transitions, and telephonic outreach have all been shown to improve the quality of care for conditions such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. [2] Enable the practitioner to develop a profitable practice using lifestyle medicine for some or all patients.
