Its taste complements many French and Italian dishes, and various essential oils are stored deep within its leaves. Thus sheltered from the scorching sun of Southern Europe, they provide rosemary's characteristic bitter, tart taste. Modern technology allows scientists to conduct a close examination of the herb. A scanning electron microscope opens the door to an unfamiliar nano-world. The development of a bud, magnified 100,000 times. A fascinating sight, normally hidden from the human eye. Rosemary is excellent for seasoning meat, ratatouille, tomatoes, mushrooms and of course the ever popular rosemary potatoes. And its warm, smokey flavor superbly accentuates cheeses, be it goat's cheese, feta or parmesan. Adding a spoonful of honey will create a delicious parmesan rosemary melt whose bittersweet tang will send gourmets into seventh heaven. For seasoning, both fresh and dry rosemary are equally suitable. Since the leaves are too tough to chew, usually entire sprigs are used. They add their flavor to the food and can then be removed before serving. Rosemary as far as the eye can see - its success as a culinary ingredient has made this native of the Mediterranean an international celebrity. In greenhouses, the next generation of plants await their chance to make an appearance in the world's kitchens. No herbes de Provence spice blend would be complete without the camphor-like aroma of rosemary. But well before it was spicing up dishes, the herb was being used as a remedy for headaches and cardiovascular problems. Medieval monks rediscovered the healing powers of rosemary and introduced the herb to Central Europe from the South. It was also believed that rosemary could ward off evil spirits. Brides wore a wreath or bouquet of rosemary at their wedding ceremonies, hoping it would assure them a long and happy marriage. The herb's true power lies in its essential oils, which aid against migraine and rheumatism. The acid contained in the oils also acts as an anti-inflammatory, intercepts free radicals and combats viruses and fungal infections. Adding a few drops of rosemary oil to your shower gel produces a sensual fragrance, stimulates the cardiovascular system and provides an invigorating start into the day. Anyone keen on having a fresh supply of rosemary at home can easily cultivate the herb in the garden or on the balcony or windowsill. This Mediterranean plant loves warmth and direct sunlight, but also copes well in partial shade. The one thing the sun worshipper doesn't like is frost, so it should be protected from the cold in winter. Rosemary grows rather slowly, but with a little care and patience it can reach a height of up to two meters. The intensely aromatic plant has always been shrouded in folklore. It was said that Mediterranean sailors sometimes smelled the shore before seeing it because of the powerful fragrance of the rosemary bushes. It is thus unsurprising that rosemary was often used as a cheap alternative to incense and thus gained the nickname of frankincense herb.
