V3SWG was renamed to Benefit-Risk Assessment of VAccines by TechnolOgy (BRAVATO) in July of 2020, so as to expand beyond just vaccines using viral vectors. BRAVATO has two major activities: 1. Developing harmonized guidelines for assessing/addressing potential safety issues of concern for vaccines as listed in [Table 1 of this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X14013036?via%3Dihub#tbl0005), and initially identified in [the meeting report from a World Health Organization Informal Consultation on Characterization and Quality Aspect of Vaccines Based on Live Viral Vectors, WHO HQ, Geneva, 4-5 December, 2003](https://brightoncollaboration.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WHO.viral-vectors-report-full.2003.pdf). 2. Completing standardized templates with key considerations for a risk/benefit assessment on new vaccine candidates to: a) facilitate scientific discourse among key stakeholders by increasing the transparency and comparability of information; and b) provide a checklist like tool for managing potential complex risks. The original V3WG and updated BRAVATO viral vector template collects information on the characteristics of: a) the wild type virus from which the vector is derived; b) the vector itself before incorporation of the foreign antigen; and c) the final vaccine in animals and humans, toxicology and potency, with an overall adverse effect and risk assessment. The viral vector template has been used for the standardized risk-assessment of several new viral vector vaccines, including some targeting Ebola ( [1](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.09.035), [5](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.10.004), [6](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.06.071), [7](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvacx.2019.100009), [14](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.08.050), 15). Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS)](https://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/committee/en/) [endorsed the use of the template for other new candidate Ebola vaccines \"as it is a structured approach to vaccine safety\" ](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/330607/WER9504-eng-fre.pdf)( [16](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/325849/WER9428-en-fr.pdf?ua=1), [17](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/330607/WER9504-eng-fre.pdf)). In 2020, the development of vaccines for COVID-19 is occurring with unprecedented speed. The pace and volume of development make a deliberate and systematic approach that is accessible and understandable to a diversity of stakeholders all the more important. Several vaccine platforms other than viral vector are being used (e.g., nucleic acid, protein, inactivated and live-attenuated). The V3SWG has therefore developed new specific templates, and revised its name to BRAVATO given the broader remit. The GACVS ( [18](https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.who.int%2Firis%2Fbitstream%2Fhandle%2F10665%2F333136%2FWER9528-eng-fre.pdf%3Fua%3D1&data=02%7C01%7Cmattdudley%40jhu.edu%7C49a4791f7aa44a1dc05f08d829b94c5e%7C9fa4f438b1e6473b803f86f8aedf0dec%7C0%7C0%7C637305223477584776&sdata=ZlaQf0%2FQr10F5BsRv6NjAOoI%2Be8Zy6HVXbcCHCrgbks%3D&reserved=0)), [ the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)](https://cepi.net/), and other key stakeholders will use these templates to evaluate and communicate the benefit-risk of vaccines using these platforms. Below are links to the latest versions of each template in two forms: 1) the full \"publication version\", including all introductory text and formatted for publication; and 2) the shorter and more easily updatable \"website version\", formatted for easy completion and with extraneous text removed. Templates under development will be added once completed. - Viral vector vaccines template - Publication version [Website Version](https://brightoncollaboration.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/V3SWG_Viral-Vector-Template-v3.0_Website_22JUL20.docx) [Template revisions](https://brightoncollaboration.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Template-revision-250720.docx) - This document provides a summary of the three major version changes.

BRAVATO hopes that eventually all vaccine developers/researchers (especially those likely to be used in humans in the near future) will complete the relevant template and submit it to BRAVATO and BC ( [bc-coordinator@taskforce.org](mailto:bc-coordinator@taskforce.org)) for peer review and potential eventual publication in Vaccine. Following this, to promote transparency, the template will be posted and maintained on the BC website for use/reference by various stakeholders. Furthermore, recognizing the rapid pace of new scientific developments in this domain (relative to case definitions for adverse events following immunization), these completed templates can be updated with the help of each vector vaccine \"community.\" The science and the evidence contained in each published template (see: \"Relevant publications (Activity 2 - Templates)\" below) is constantly evolving. If you have a suggestion for an edit, please provide it using the form found at the bottom of this page. Individuals who are interested in joining BRAVATO or participating in affiliated activities are welcome to contact [bc-coordinator@taskforce.org](mailto:bc-coordinator@taskforce.org) for possible membership.
