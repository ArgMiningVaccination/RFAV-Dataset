Noting that biventricular pacing is a powerful therapy to treat heart failure and has reduced mortality and heart failure hospitalization in patients with electromechanical dyssynchrony, Dr. Vijayaraman said it may also be associated with failure to implant, non-response to therapy and anatomical challenges due to the presence of unwanted/ unacceptable diaphragmatic stimulation. \"Recently, physiologic pacing using HBP or LBBP have been used to achieve normalization of conduction, thereby correcting underlying electromagnetic dyssynchrony in patients with left bundle branch block or right ventricular pacing, \" he said. \"This has been accomplished by placing traditional pacing leads precisely in the region of the conduction system and reversing the abnormal conduction. \"This approach has been shown to be beneficial with high success rates in patients with heart failure, and both left bundle branch block and right bundle branch block. \" Dr. Vijayaraman also points to new approaches using a combination of physiologic pacing and left ventricular (coronary sinus) pacing to achieve greater resynchronization in patients with intraventricular conduction delays and mixed conduction disease. He said they have been backed up Advances may lead to more powerful therapies for arrhythmia ChungNew technologies mean new ways to tackle old problems. Vijayaraman Novel Technologies in Arrhythmia Therapy Sunday, Nov. 6 9:30 a.m. | Main Event IIIUPCOMING SESSION See ARRHYTHMIA THERAPY , page 64 SCIENTIFIC SESSIONS DAILY NEWS | Day 2 Sunday, Nov. 6, 2022 Trials' results compare loop and thiazide diuretics and highlight ineffectiveness of novel fibrate therapy for reducing CV risk Torsemide didn't reduce mortality compared to furosemide Mentz Furosemide is the most commonly used loop diuretic in HF patients. Y et, data suggest a potential advantage with torsemide. In the Comparative Effectiveness of Torsemide Versus Furosemide in Heart Failure: the TRANSFORM- HF Trial, researchers explored whether torsemide is superior to furosemide to treat HF. The trial found no difference in all-cause mortality between patients with HF taking torsemide or furosemide. The large-scale, pragmatic, randomized, unblinded trial enrolled 2,859 patients with heart failure regardless of ejection fraction during a HF hospitalization. Patients were randomized to a loop diuretic of torsemide or furosemide with investigator-selected dosing. After the first hospitalization, a study follow-up was centralized via the Duke Clinical Research Institute Call Center with clinical care from the patients' usual care providers and support in place to continue the randomized therapy. During a median of 17.4 months, deaths occurred in 26.1% of patients in the torsemide group and 26.2% in the furosemide group. \"In this event-driven trial, there was no significant difference in the primary effectiveness outcome of survival between furosemide and torsemide in patients with heart failure, \" said Robert J. Mentz, MD, the study's co-principal investigator and chief of the Heart Failure Section at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina. Results were similar across prespecified subgroups, including among patients with reduced, mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction. \"Given the high-event rate in this patient population, there's a need for implementing current evidence-based therapies that improve outcomes and more well- conducted randomized trials similar to TRANSFORM to provide the evidence base we need to make informed decisions about how to take the best care of our patients, \" Dr. Mentz said. \"We explored a common clinical question and have provided a clear answer, that these two diuretics result in similar clinical outcomes. \"Major multinational trial fails to show lowering triglycerides lowers cardiovascular risk Pradhan Pemafibrate, a novel potent PPAR-alpha modulator, didn't lower the rates of first MI, stroke, cardiovascular death or coronary revascularization in patients with Type 2 diabetes with mixed dyslipidemia, according to A Randomized Trial of Pemafibrate for Triglyceride Reduction in the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease (PROMINENT Trial). The international study in 24 countries enrolled 10,497 patients with Type 2 diabetes, mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-C, and randomized them 1:1 to pemafibrate 0.2 mg tablets BID or placebo with a median follow-up of 3.4 years. \"While pemafibrate reduced triglycerides, VLDL-C, remnant cholesterol and ApoCIII by 20% to 30%, pemafibrate did not reduce cardiovascular event rates in patients with Type 2 diabetes, mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL-C and well-controlled LDL-C, \" said Aruna Pradhan, MD, MPH, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston. \"Roughly 10% had a major heart attack or stroke condition within three years.\" After statins, fibrates are the second-most commonly used drug to lower cholesterol. The majority of study participants were also taking statin medication. \"These data highlight the complexity of lipid mediators of residual risk in statin-treated insulin resistant patients, \" Dr. Pradhan said. \"It is possible that beyond the effects on triglyceride-rich lipoprotein remodeling, enhanced clearance of lipoproteins derived remnant catabolism is also needed to neutralize residual risk in hypertriglyceridemia. \"Ongoing trials of agents that use alternative pathways to lower triglycerides and remnant cholesterol, including ApoCIII and angiopoietin- like protein 3 inhibition, may help to clarify these issues. \" The study will be published in the New England Journal of Medicine following the presentation. Investigators in three trials on Saturday challenged hypotheses and impact of treatment of patients with heart failure, Type 2 diabetes and hypertension during the Late-Breaking Science session \"Changing Clinical Practice.\" They found: A strategy of torsemide wasn't more effective than furose - mide in preventing mortality in heart failure (HF) patients. Pemafibrate, a novel potent peroxisome proliferator-acti - (PPAR)-alpha modulator for reducing tri - glycerides, didn't reduce cardiovascular events in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Chlorthalidone wasn't superior to hydrochlorothiazide, but it may confer a benefit in patients with hypertension and history of myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke.5 #AHA22 ScientificSessions.org hydrochlorothiazide in patients with hypertension Ishani Current blood pressure management guidelines specify that chlorthalidone may be the preferred thiazide diuretic agent for hypertension management, compared to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). Y et, for preventing cardiovascular disease or noncancer death, chlorthalidone wasn't superior to HCTZ at doses commonly used in clinical practice, according to Chlorthalidone Compared to Hydrochlorothiazide for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Hypertension, the DCP Trial. The large pragmatic, randomized control trial enrolled over 13,500 patients with hypertension taking HCTZ (25 mg or 50 mg) at baseline at 537 V A medical centers and community clinics in the U.S. Patients were randomized to stay on their current dose of HCTZ or an equipotent dose of chlorthalidone (12.5 mg or 25 mg). \"We were able to compare the two generic drugs using this low-cost methodology, \" said Areef Ishani, MD, the study's co- principal investigator and director of the Minneapolis Primary Care and Specialty Care Integrated Care Community (ICC) in St. Paul. Most study participants (95%) were taking low-dose hydrochlorothiazide. The majority of the study compared 12.5 mg chlorthalidone to 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide. There was no difference between the two drugs at preventing CV disease or non-cancer death or in the secondary outcomes, which included MI, stroke, heart failure and unstable angina requiring revascularization. There was no difference in mean systolic blood pressure between the two groups, but there was a slight increase in the risk of hospitalization for low potassium in the chlorthalidone versus the hydrochlorothiazide group, which quickly resolved with supplements. A prespecified subgroup analysis, defined by the presence or absence of stroke or MI at baseline, had a significant qualitative interaction (p=0.002). It suggested a nonsignificant increased risk (p=0.051) of a CV event or non- cancer death in study chlorthalidone participants without MI or stroke at baseline. Chlorthalidone was also associated with an increase of hypokalemia. Study participants taking chlorthalidone with a history of MI or stroke had a reduced risk of a CV event or non-cancer death. \"It's difficult to understand that result in the context of an overall negative trial, \" Dr. Ishani said. \"We will need another study specifically looking at these two drugs in patients with a history of MI or stroke to see if this is a true effect. \" When deciding which thiazide diuretic to prescribe, either drug appears to be acceptable for the vast majority of patients with hypertension in these doses. \"But for patients with a history of MI or stroke, you might consider switching them to chlorthalidone until another study comes out to confirm whether you should or shouldn't, \" Dr. Ishani said.

She was joined on stage by two former U.S. Surgeons General, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration and the president of the World Heart Federation for a lively discussion on how the response of science and medicine to crises around the world can inform the path to public education about health issues. Regina Benjamin, MD, MBA, served as Surgeon General from 2009-2013. She said disasters such as hurricanes are getting worse, and compounding health problems. \"Hurricanes, Gulf oil spills, ice storms and power grid failures. These disasters are compounding and multiplying the effects and causes of stress, \" she said. \"With each subsequent disaster, you don't go back to your baseline level of stress. Each time, we start at a higher level. We need to build resilient communities and resilient individuals, because it's not just about disasters, it's about how we live between those disasters. \" Jerome Adams, MD, MPH, a former Indiana State Health Commissioner who served as Surgeon General from 2017- 2021, said we can learn a lot from our national response to the COVID-19 pandemic. \"While we can't let COVID consume us, I do feel like COVID and the legacy of COVID will prove to be one of, if not our biggest, risk factor for cardiovascular negative outcomes moving forward, \" he said. \"The same people who are at high risk for cardiovascular disease, for stroke, for kidney disease, are the ones who are under-boosted in this country right now. Shame on us if every time we see a patient we aren't asking them if they are vaccinated, if they're boosted, if they're up to date on their boosters because that may be the one thing that you all could do for your clinics. \" From a global perspective, Dr. Fausto Pinto, MD, PhD, FESC, FACC, FSCAI, FASE, president of the World Heart Federation, said training and needs assessment are the keys to getting the best people in place to respond. \"I feel that we all have that responsibility, \" he said. \" And it's by working together and also applying the solutions according to the needs. And that's one of the important things is to do needs assessment, because of course there are some universal needs but there are some specific needs that may be more relevant in certain parts of the world \u2014 even within the same country or within the same region. And that's why it's so important that we have some sort of professional way to do proper training of the next generation. \" But all of that won't mean much if we can't combat the growing specter of misinformation, said Robert Califf, MD, U.S. commissioner of the FDA. \"Misinformation is the leading cause of death right now in the U.S., \" he said. \"There is no way to prove that, but I really do believe that it is. \" COVID-19 vaccinations are a perfect example, he said. \" Almost no one should be dying from COVID now because if you're up to date on your vaccination and if you're high risk and you happen to get infected and you take an anti-viral, almost no one is dying from that, \" he said. \"Of the 250 to 300 people a day dying in the U.S., almost 100% of them were not up to date on their vaccinations or did not get treated with an anti-viral. \" OPENING SESSION continued from page 1by promising results in early, small, observational studies with larger, randomized clinical trials underway. \"These new approaches will provide additional and alternative options to treat patients with heart failure using physiologic pacing in patients who fail traditional biventricular pacing, \" he said. \"Or even as a first-line approach in many patients with preserved synchrony who require ventricular pacing. \" In addition, a potential new technology to treat arrhythmias by ablation is on the horizon using a new technique called pulsed-field ablation. \"It uses high voltage for a fraction of a second to precisely and selectively target heart muscle without affecting surrounding structures by means of electroporation and cell death, \" Dr. Vijayaraman said. \"This is a very exciting technology, and many trials are nearing completion. This will have a huge impact in the management of atrial fibrillation making ablation procedures even safer. \" ARRHYTHMIA THERAPY continued from page 3 The effects of economics and COVID-19 on cardiovascular risk will be highlighted by Esther Duflo, PhD, in this year's Paul Dudley White International Lecture. Dr. Duflo will deliver her lecture \"Laureate, Storytelling and Perspectives for Syndemic and Global Cardiovascular Risk Reduction, \" as part of the Main Event on Sunday. She is the Abdul Latif Jameel Professor of Poverty Alleviation and Development Economics in the Department of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. She's also co-founder and co-director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab. Dr. Duflo's research focuses on understanding the economic lives of people with low incomes with the goal to help design and evaluate social policies. She has received numerous academic honors and awards, including the 2019 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. She's also received the Princess of Asturias Award for Social Sciences; A.SK Social Science Award; Infosys Prize; David N. Kershaw Award; and a MacArther Genius Grant Fellowship. In addition to those recognitions, Dr. Duflo is co-author of Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty , which won the Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Y ear Award in 2011. More recently, she authored Good Economics for Hard Times .

In studying the social determinants of health, and how an understanding of these can transform the health care of global populations, do you feel this is making a difference in preventive strategies for patient heart health? Dr. Alb ert: If you look at 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines, which I was a part of, there's a section about social determinants of health and what to do for the different cardiovascular disease risk factors. To the best of my knowledge, it is the first ACC/ AHA guideline to include a section with recommendations about social determinants of health. In general, the medical community is more currently sensitized about social Michelle A. Albert, MD, MPH, FACC, FAHAQA& : Moving past the status quo to overcome CVD and health disparities determinants of health given the events of the past two years. More peer-reviewed articles are appearing in our medical journals about social determinants and health. AHA journals have an overarching health equity editorial board. The term adversity is beginning to be used to refer to adults and cardiovascular health. Traditionally, adverse childhood experiences have been studied in the pediatric and psychology arenas but not so much in adult cardiology. Hopefully, this momentum can continue and translate into consequential meaningfulness for the health of our patients and populations. On a cautionary note, though, there is also increasing push back related to the implications of this sensitization. QCan you give me some examples of health disparities in cardiac care (patient and health care professional) and how these need to be corrected? Dr. Alb ert: Some examples include cardiovascular procedures \u2014 including heart bypass, angioplasty and stenting and cardiac defibrillators \u2014 which are less likely performed or implanted, though, when indicated in Black patients compared to white patients. For example, we published research in Circulation showing that Massachusetts Health Care Reform did not improve disparities in the receipt of bypass surgery or angioplasty by race and ethnicity or socioeconomic status. Addressing health inequities requires action at multiple levels across sectors, including increased awareness and solutions addressing structural racism at the undergraduate and graduate medical levels, policy interventions, implicit bias training including assessment of the impact of that training and cultural competency training to name a few items. Additionally, we need to listen to our patients' concerns closely and have empathy. When my patients come to my clinic, the very first thing they tell me is that they know I will listen to them and their concerns as others have told them so. They know that I care about them and meet them where they are to address their specific needs and not only what I believe needs to be addressed. QYour work has been described as following a \"non-traditional\" path. In what way do you believe that to be true? Dr. Alb ert: On a very personal level, for a large part of my career, I have felt pretty isolated socially and academically. My interest in working on psychosocial stressors and adversity are not usually natural content for late- breaking cardiovascular science or cardiovascular clinical conference. Traditionally, when I attended non-epidemiology focused scientific conferences from the time since I was a fellow, race, ethnicity and psychosocial factors were generally not content for late-breaking clinical trials/science. Well, we know that therapies from these trials do not equitably get to everyone, especially persons from racially or ethnically underserved groups as well as socioeconomically disadvantaged people. So, there exists great need to diversify principal investigators and participants in clinical trials, along with performing implementation work that addresses psychosocial barriers alongside community organizations. I had to learn early in my career how to reach across the aisle to work with investigators and be mentored by persons from other disciplines outside of cardiology, such as sociology, psychiatry, public health and psychology. I realize now how this latter experience superbly prepared me for my ongoing career. In terms of taking a non-traditional AHA Presidential Address shines a light on differences and solutions The week prior to Scientific Sessions 2022, Scientific Sessions Daily News interviewed Michelle A. Albert, MD, MPH, FACC, FAHA, about advancing health care for global populations. As the American Heart Association president for 2022-23, Dr. Albert is the AHA's top science volunteer. She also presides over the association's Science Advisory & Coordinating Committee. Dr. Albert's work in increasing awareness of health inequities in CVD and its influence on prevention and treatment is the topic of today's Lewis A. Conner Presidential Address. approach, this has been my work for the last 20 years and not just the last two to three years that people have been talking about social determinants of health. My early work studied biomarkers of CVD and social determinants. For example, our team published the first large paper about the relationship of discrimination with cancer and cardiovascular mortality. One challenge is that today everyone feels that they are an expert on social determinants of health. Moreover, it is still tougher to receive grants and get papers published that focus on social factors. I believe that I can speak to this issue well as I have experience in doing molecular and genetic biomarker research, epidemiology, clinical trials and psychosocial research. I have a lot of respect for my colleagues in the PhD arena who have struggled to get their empirical work about social factors and health published in medical journals. QWhat's on the horizon for you to tackle in terms of health disparities and heart health? Dr. Alb ert: I am looking for ways that I can continue to push myself toward implementation science solutions to help address health inequities. Also, I hope to grow into roles that challenge me to push myself and the envelope in new ways. QWhat do you hope your Presidential Address will inspire? Dr. Alb ert: I hope my address will encourage people to make a difference wherever they are and not continue to think of things like economic or other times of toxic adversity as insurmountable. It is always important to act locally with an eye toward a global reach. Our global reach includes mentoring and sponsoring persons from diverse international backgrounds. 8 SCIENTIFIC SESSIONS DAILY NEWS | Day 2 Sunday, Nov. 6, 2022 9 #AHA22 ScientificSessions.org Sponsored by AmgenAHA Game YardPosters Zone 1 Posters Zone 2 RAPID FIRE #3 Posters Zone 3RAPID FIRE #2Best of Specialty Conferences Posters Business Suites Braindate Lounge FAHA LoungeWomen in Science and LoungeRecharge/ Headshot LoungeHeart TheatersHealth Innovation PavilionLearning Studio II Learning Studio I HeartQuarters Get With The Guidelines\u00ae Quality ShowcaseCase Theater Moderated Digital Posters Exhibitor Lounge and Sales Ofce Main Event IPosters Zone 4Basic Science Lounge RAPID FIRE #4RAPID FIRE #1Celebrate Basic Science Reception 2857400608 609 610 611 616 709 CardiologyMedtronic B550 B452Labcorp Drug Development AstraZeneca Bristol Myers Squibb Communication Center Sponsored by NovartisAHAtvREGISTRATIONClaim CEHotel/Housing Desk Science & Technology Hall Concierge Shop HeartPick up Badge and Lanyards Sponsored by Impulse Merck & ZOLL MedicalCytokinetics AffairsCVRxBoehringer Ingelheim/Lilly CommercialAmerican College of Cardiology Impulse Dynamics Heart Hub The Heart Hub is a unique learning and networking destination where attendees can participate in a variety of immersive, interactive and educational opportunities all in one place.

I would venture to say it's really thinking about the system. \" Mark Johnson, MD, PhD, professor of neurological surgery and senior consulting vice provost for mentorship, leadership and transformation at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, said historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) could play a critical role in reshaping the system. \"The value of HBCUs in helping to expand the diversity of the workforce is large, \" he said. \"Many of the social and political problems in our country that necessitated the creation of these schools still exist today. \" Fidencio Saldana, MD, MPH, dean of students at Harvard Medical School, said that while these problems may seem overwhelming, people can address these issues in their everyday lives. \"What, \" he asked the audience, \"can you do as an individual to help with this issue? If you're a trainee, maybe consider going into academic medicine and being a dean or a faculty member or a dean of admissions to help with the pipeline. If you are a practicing clinician, a cardiologist, could you come to the admissions committee meeting at your medical school or at your residency or at your fellowship? All of you can do one thing today or when you go home to help us improve this issue. \" Katrina Armstrong, MD, Jackson Professor of Clinical Medicine at Harvard Medical School, said medical professionals need to create opportunities for diversity to thrive. \"I do think that being able to fit what you're doing every day, just get up every day and try to move this forward and recognize that what works in one place may not work in another, \" she said. \"I do think that this issue of allowing people \u2014 everyone \u2014 to have the tools, the curiosity, the commitment to talent is critical. I often use the line from Paul Farmer, which is that talent is equally distributed and opportunity is not. \" INCLUSIVITY continued from page 111 #AHA22 ScientificSessions.org With Gregg Semenza, MD, PhDQA& : Breathing new life into understanding and treating ischemic cardiovascular disease QYou have an extensive and Nobel Prize- winning background in studying the behavior of cells in low oxygen settings and the impact of that work in understanding and treating various illnesses and diseases. Can you describe the impact of your work in treating coronary artery disease? Dr. Sem enza: Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) increase the transcription of genes encoding proteins, such as angiogenic growth factors. That increases the delivery of oxygen to hypoxic cells, and genes encoding proteins, such as glycolytic enzymes, which allows cells to survive oxygen deprivation. Among individuals with coronary artery disease who develop critical stenosis of a main coronary artery, two-thirds have collateral blood vessels that perfuse the heart tissue downstream of the obstruction and one-third do not. The patients with collaterals are more likely to survive after myocardial infarction than those without collaterals. In collaboration with Dr. Jon Resar, we analyzed 100 consecutive patients who were found to have critical stenosis of a major coronary artery for the presence of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the HIF1A gene that changes proline to serine at amino acid residue 582 of HIF-1alpha. We found that the frequency of the Prior to Scientific Sessions 2022, Scientific Sessions Daily News spoke with Gregg Semenza, MD, PhD, about molecular mechanisms of oxygen homeostasis. One of today's preeminent researchers on the molecular mechanisms of oxygen regulation, Dr. Semenza has led the field in uncovering how cells adapt to changing oxygen levels. He is best known for his Nobel Prize-winning discovery of the HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor 1) protein, which controls changes in gene expression in response to changes in oxygen availability. The discovery of HIF-1 has far-reaching implications for understanding and treating conditions, such as cancer and ischemic cardiovascular disease, in which hypoxia plays an important role in disease pathogenesis. Dr. Semenza shared the 2019 award with William G. Kaelin Jr., MD, of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Peter J. Ratcliffe of Oxford University.SNP was five times higher in patients who lacked coronary collaterals as compared to patients with collaterals. This suggests that genetic variation at the locus encoding HIF-1alpha may play a role in determining collateral formation in patients with coronary artery disease. Gain- of-function and loss-of-function studies in mice established that HIFs mediate ischemia-induced vascular remodeling. This occurs by activating the transcription of vascular endothelial growth factor A and other angiogenic growth factors. We found that the age-dependent impairment in the vascular response to ischemia was due to impaired HIF activity in a mouse model of peripheral arterial disease. We also showed that HIF-1alpha was required for protection of the heart by ischemic preconditioning. Taken together, work from our lab and many others indicate that HIFs play critical roles in the pathophysiology of ischemic cardiovascular disease. QCan you explain how your studies have or will translate into treatment? Dr. Sem enza: We have shown in mouse models of peripheral arterial disease that we can overcome the age-related impairment of ischemia- induced vascular remodeling by combining HIF-1alpha gene therapy with bone marrow- derived angiogenic cell therapy. Recently, drugs that induce HIF activity have been developed by several pharmaceutical companies. However, clinical trials are needed to investigate whether these drugs will benefit patients with peripheral arterial disease or coronary artery disease. A HIF-2alpha inhibitor was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. QHow do you hope to inspire others with your lecture? Dr. Sem enza: Hypoxia-inducible factors play important protective roles in the pathophysiology of ischemic cardiovascular disease, and strategies to increase HIF activity may have therapeutic utility. Our work illustrates the importance of basic research and its potential for translation into clinical practice. QDo you have a personal story of how you developed this expertise in your career? Dr. Sem enza: We had the good fortune to collaborate with several colleagues in cardiology at Johns Hopkins who helped us to investigate the roles of HIFs in ischemic cardiovascular disease. Dr. Semenza will present his Nobel Laureate Lecture \"Hypoxia-Inducible Factors in Physiology and Medicine\" at 9:30 a.m. Sunday. Dr. Semenza is the director of the vascular program at the Institute for Cell Engineering and professor of genetic medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland.12 SCIENTIFIC SESSIONS DAILY NEWS | Day 2 Sunday, Nov. 6, 2022 Emelia J.
