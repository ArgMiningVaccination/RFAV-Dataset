(p. 165)FICTION TRUTH or\"Is there a problem?\" I (J.S.N.) asked as I entered my classroom at St. John's University in Queens, New Y ork, on the morning of September 11, 2001. The students were gath-ered around the window. None replied, but one pointed out the window with a painedexpression on her face that I'll never forget. Moments later, I saw for myself the smokebillowing out of one of the towers of the World Trade Center, clearly visible some15 miles to the west. Then the second tower suddenly burst into flames. We watched instunned silence. Then the unthinkable occurred. Suddenly one tower was gone andthen the other. A student who had come into the room asked, \"Where are they?\"Another answered that they were gone. The first replied, \"What do you mean, gone?\" We watched from a distance the horror that we knew was unfolding. But many other New Y orkers experienced the World Trade Center disaster firsthand, includingthousands like New Y ork City police officer T erri T obin, who risked their lives to saveothers. Here, Officer T obin tells of her experience: \"Go! Go! It' s Coming Down!\" Then I saw people running toward me, and they were screaming. \"Go! Go! It's coming down!\" Just for a second, I looked up and saw it. I thought, I'm not going to outrun this.But then I thought, Maybe I can make it back to my car and jump in the back seat. Before I could make a move, the force of the explosion literally blew me out of my shoes.It lifted me up and propelled me out, over a concrete barrier, all the way to the otherside of the street. I landed face-first on a grassy area outside the Financial Center, andafter I landed there, I just got pelted with debris coming out of this big black cloud. And then I felt it, but what sticks with me is hearing it: The whomp of my helmet when I got hit in the head. The helmet literally went crack, split in half, and fell offmy head. I realized then that I'd just taken a real big whack in the head. I felt bloodgoing down the back of my neck, and when I was able to reach around, I felt thischunk of cement sticking out three or four inches from the back of my head. It wascompletely embedded in my skull. Then it got pitch black, and I thought, I must have been knocked unconscious, because it's totally black . But then I thought, I wouldn't be thinking about how black it is if I'm unconscious . And it was really hard to breathe. All I heard were people scream- ing. Screaming bloody murder. All sorts of cries. At that moment, I thought, This is it. We're all going to die on the street. \u2014From Hagen & Carouba ,2002, Women at Ground Zero: Stories of Courage and Compassion EXPOSURE TO STRESS ,ESPECIALLY TRAUMATIC STRESS LIKE THAT EXPERIENCED BY MANY thousands of people on 9/11, can have profound and enduring effects on our mental and physical health. This chapter focuses on the psychological and physical effects ofstress. In the next chapter, we discuss the types of psychological disorders that can arisefrom exposure to traumatic stress. The effects of psychological forms of stress bring into context the age-old debate about the relationship between the mind and the body. The 17th-century Frenchphilosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes (1596-1650) influenced modern thinking with his beliefin dualism, or separateness, between the mind and body. T oday, scientists recognize that mind and body are much more closely intertwined than Descartes would haveimagined. Psychological factors both influence and are influenced by physical func-tioning (Jones, 2006; Ryffa et al., 2006). Psychologists who study the interrelationshipsbetween psychological factors and physical health are called health psychologists. The study of the relationships between mind and body bring us to examining the role of stress in both mental and physical functioning. The term stress refers to pressure or health psychologist A psychologist who studies the role of psychological factors in physical illness.142 Chapter 5 stress A demand made on an organism to adapt or adjust. stressor A source of stress. adjustment disorder A maladaptive reaction to an identified stressor, characterized by impaired functioning or emotional distress that exceeds what would normally be expected. Difficulty in concentrating or adjustment disorder? An adjustment disorder is a maladaptive reaction to a stressor that may take the form of impaired functioning at school or at work, such as having difficulties keeping one's mind on one's studies.force placed on a body. In the physical world, tons of rocks that crash to the ground in a landslide cause stress on impact, forming indentations or craters when they land. In psy-chology, we use the term stress to refer to a pressure or demand that is placed on an organism to adapt or adjust. A stressor is a source of stress. Stressors (or stresses) include psychological factors, such as examinations in school and problems in social relation-ships, and life changes, such as the death of a loved one, divorce, or a job termination.They also include daily hassles, such as traffic jams, and physical environmental factors,such as exposure to extreme temperatures or noise levels. The term stress should be dis- tinguished from distress , which refers to a state of physical or mental pain or suffering. Some amount of stress is probably healthy for us; it helps keep us active and alert. Butstress that is prolonged or intense can overtax our coping ability and lead to states ofemotional distress, such as anxiety or depression, and to physical complaints, such asfatigue and headaches. A recent survey by the American Psychological Associationshowed that 43% of adult Americans report suffering adverse health effects from stress(American Psychological Association, 2006). Stress is implicated in a wide range of physical and psychological problems. We begin our study of the effects of stress by discussing a category of psychological disorders calledadjustment disorders, which involve maladaptive reactions to stress. We then consider the role of stress and other psychological and sociocultural factors in physical disorders. ADJUSTMENT DISORDERS Adjustment disorders are the first psychological disorders we discuss in this book, andthey are among the mildest. An adjustment disorder is a maladaptive reaction to an identified stressor that develops within a few months of the onset of the stressor.According to the DSM, the maladaptive reaction is characterized by significant impair- ment in social, occupational, or academic functioning or by states of emotional dis-tress that exceed those normally induced by the stressor. Prevalence estimates of therates of the disorder in the population vary widely. However, the disorder is commonamong people seeking outpatient mental health care, with estimates indicating thatbetween 5% and 20% of people receiving outpatient mental health services presentwith a diagnosis of adjustment disorder (APA, 2000).Stress, Psychological Factors, and Health 143 TABLE 5.1 Subtypes of Adjustment Disorders Disorder Chief Features Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood Sadness, crying, and feelings of hopelessness Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety Worrying, nervousness, and jitters (or in children, separation fears from primary attachment figures) Adjustment Disorder with Mixed Anxiety and Depressed MoodA combination of anxiety and depression Adjustment Disorder with Disturbance of ConductViolation of the rights of others or violation of social norms appropriate for one's age. Samplebehaviors include vandalism, truancy, fighting, reckless driving, and defaulting on legal obligations (e.g., stopping alimony payments) Adjustment Disorder with Mixed DisturbanceBoth emotional disturbance, such as depression or anxiety, and co nduct disturbance (as described above) Adjustment Disorder Unspecified A res idual category that applies to cases not classifiable in one of the other subtypes Source: Adapted from the DSM-IV-TR (APA, 2000). If your relationship with someone comes to an end (an identified stressor) and your grades are falling off because you are unable to keep your mind on schoolwork, youmay fit the bill for an adjustment disorder. If Uncle Harry has been feeling down andpessimistic since his divorce from Aunt Jane, he too may be diagnosed with an adjust-ment disorder. So too might Cousin Billy if he has been cutting classes and sprayingobscene words on the school walls or showing other signs of disturbed conduct. Thereare several subtypes of adjustment disorders that vary in terms of the type of mal-adaptive reaction (see Table 5.1). The concept of \"adjustment disorder\" as a mental disorder highlights some of the difficulties in attempting to define what is normal and what is not. When somethingimportant goes wrong in life, we should feel bad about it. If there is a crisis in business,if we are victimized by a crime, or if there is a flood or a devastating hurricane, it isunderstandable that we might become anxious or depressed. There might, in fact, besomething more seriously wrong with us if we did not react in a \"maladaptive\" way, atleast temporarily. However, if our emotional reaction exceeds an expected response, orour ability to function is impaired (e.g., avoidance of social interactions, difficultygetting out of bed, or falling behind in schoolwork), then a diagnosis of adjustmentdisorder may be indicated. Thus, if you are having trouble concentrating on yourschoolwork following the breakup of a romantic relationship and your grades areslipping, you may have an adjustment disorder. For the diagnosis to apply, the stress-related reaction must not be sufficient to meet the diagnostic criteria for other clinical syndromes, such as anxiety disorders or mooddisorders (see Chapters 6 and 8). The maladaptive reaction may be resolved if the stressoris removed or the individual learns to cope with it. If the maladaptive reaction lasts formore than 6 months after the stressor (or its consequences) have been removed, thediagnosis may be changed. Although the DSM system distinguishes adjustment disor- der from other clinical syndromes, it may be difficult to identify distinguishing featuresof adjustment disorders that are distinct from other disorders, such as depression(Casey et al., 2006). If concentrating on your schoolwork has become difficult because of the breakup of a recent romance,you could be experiencing a psychological disorder. TRUE. If you have trouble concentrating on your schoolwork following the breakup of a romanticrelationship, you may have a mild type of psycho- logical disorder called an adjustment disorder.FICTION TRUTH or144 Chapter 5 endocrine system The system of ductless glands that secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream. hormones Substances secreted by endocrine glands that regulate body functions and promote growth and development.

Although hormones maytravel throughout the body, they act only on specific receptor sites. Many hormones are implicated in stress reactions and various patterns of abnormal behavior.STRESS AND ILLNESS Psychological sources of stress not only diminish our capacity for adjustment, but also may adversely affect our health. Many visits to physicians, perhaps even most, can betraced to stress-related illness. Stress is associated with an increased risk of varioustypes of physical illness, ranging from digestive disorders to heart disease. The field of psychoneuroimmunology studies relationships between psychological factors, especially stress, and the workings of the endocrine system, the immunesystem, and the nervous system (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2002). Here we examine whatwe've learned about these relationships. Stress and the Endocrine System Stress has a domino effect on the endocrine system, the body's system of glands that release their secretions, called hormones, directly into the bloodstream. (Other glands, such as the salivary glands that produce saliva, release their secretions into a system ofducts.) The endocrine system consists of glands distributed throughout the body.Figure 5.1 shows the major endocrine glands in the body. Several endocrine glands are involved in the body's response to stress. First, the hypothalamus, a small structure in the brain, releases a hormone that stimulates thenearby pituitary gland to turn, stimulates the adrenal glands, which are located above the kidneys. Under the influence of ACTH, the outer layer of the adrenal glands, called the adrenal cortex, releases a group of hormones called cortical steroids (cortisol and cortisone are examples). Cortical steroids (also called corticosteroids ) have a number of functions in the body. They boost resistance to stress, foster muscle development, and induce the liver toStress, Psychological Factors, and Health 145 immune system The body's system of defense against disease.

Your immune system is always on guard against invading microbes and continuously dis-patches specialized white blood cells to identify and eliminate infectious organisms.FICTION TRUTH orrelease sugar, which provides needed bursts of energy for responding to a threatening stressor (for example, a lurking predator or assailant) or an emergency situation. Theyalso help the body defend against allergic reactions and inflammation. The sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system, or ANS, stimulates the inner layer of the adrenal glands, called the adrenal medulla, to release a mixture of epi- nephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). These chemicals functionas hormones when released into the bloodstream. Norepinephrine is also produced inthe nervous system, where it functions as a neurotransmitter. T ogether epinephrine andnorepinephrine mobilize the body to deal with a threatening stressor by accelerating theheart rate and by also stimulating the liver to release stored glucose (sugar), makingenergy available where it can be of use in protecting ourselves in a threatening situation. The stress hormones produced by the adrenal glands help the body prepare to cope with an impending threat or stressor. Once the stressor has passed, the body returns toa normal state. This is perfectly normal and adaptive. However, when stress is endur-ing or recurring, the body regularly pumps out stress hormones and mobilizes othersystems, which over time can tax the body's resources and impair health (Gabb et al.,2006; Kemeny, 2003). Chronic or repetitive stress can damage many bodily systems,including the cardiovascular system (heart and arteries) and the immune system. Stress and the Immune System Given the intricacies of the human body and the rapid advance of scientific knowledge,we might consider ourselves dependent on highly trained medical specialists to con-tend with illness. Actually our bodies cope with most diseases on their own, throughthe functioning of the immune system. The immune system is the body's system of defense against disease. It combats dis- ease in a number of ways (Jiang & Chess, 2006). Y our body is constantly engaged insearch-and-destroy missions against invading microbes, even as you're reading thispage. Millions of white blood cells, or leukocytes, are the immune system's foot sol- diers in this microscopic warfare. Leukocytes systematically envelop and killpathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi, worn-out body cells, and cells that havebecome cancerous. Leukocytes recognize invading pathogens by their surface fragments, called antigens, literally antibody generators. Some leukocytes produce antibodies, specialized proteins that lock into position on an antigen, marking them for destruction by spe-cialized \"killer\" lymphocytes that act like commandos on 2006; Kay, 2006). Special \"memory lymphocytes\" (lymphocytes are a type of leukocyte) are held in reserve rather than marking foreign bodiesfor destruction or going to war against them. They can remain inthe bloodstream for years and form the basis for a quick immuneresponse to an invader the second time around. Although occasional stress may not impair our health, chronic or repetitive stress can eventually weaken the body's immunesystem (Epstein, 2003; Kemeny, 2003). A weakened immunesystem increases our susceptibility to many illnesses, including thecommon cold and the flu, and may increase the risk of develop-ing chronic diseases, including cancer. Psychological stressors can dampen the response of the immune system, especially when the stress is intense or pro- longed (Segerstrom & Miller, 2004). Even relatively brief periods of stress, such as final exam time, can weaken the immunesystem, although these effects are more limited than those associ-ated with chronic or prolonged stress. The kinds of life stressorsthat can take a toll on the immune system and leave us more vul-nerable to disease include marital conflict, divorce, and chronic unemployment (e.g., Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2002). Traumatic stress, The war within. White blood cells, shown here (colored purple) attacking and engulfing a pathogen, form the major part of the body's system ofdefense against bacteria, viruses, and other invading organisms.146 Chapter 5 Stress and the common cold.

Surprisingly, stress makes you more resistant to the common cold. FALSE. Stress increases the risk of developing a cold.

Talking or writing about your feelings can help enhance both psychological and physical well-being.FICTION TRUTH or FICTION TRUTH orsuch as exposure to earthquakes, hurricanes, or other natural or technological disas- ters, or to terrorist attacks or other forms of violence, can also impair immunologicalfunctioning (Solomon et al., 1997). Scientists recently discovered that one way chronic stress damages the body's immune system is by increasing levels of a chemical in the body called interleukin-6 (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2003). Sustained high levels of this chemical are linked to inflam-mation, which in turn can contribute to the development of many disorders, includ-ing cardiovascular disease, cancer, and arthritis. Social support appears to moderate the harmful effects of stress on the immune system. For example, investigators in two landmark studies found that medical and dental students with large numbers of friends showed better immune functioning than students with fewer friends (Jemmott et al., 1983; Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 1984). Consider too the results of a classic study reporting that lonely students showed greater suppression of immune responses than did students with more social support (Glaser et al., 1985). Exposure to stress is also linked to greater risk of developing the common cold. In another landmark study in this field, people who reported high levels of daily stress,such as pressures at work, showed low blood levels of antibodies that fend off coldviruses (Stone et al., 1994). A later study by the same research group showed that moresociable people had greater resistance to developing the common cold than their lesssociable peers after these groups voluntarily received injections of a cold virus (Cohenet al., 2003). These results point to a possible role of socialization or social support inbuffering the effects of stress. We should caution that much of the research in the field of psychoneuroimmunol- ogy is correlational. Researchers examine immunological functioning in relation to different indices of stress, but do not (nor would they!) directly manipulate stress to observe its effect on subjects' immune systems or general health. Correlational research helps us better understand relationships between variables and may point to possibleunderlying causal factors, but does not in itself demonstrate causal connections. Investigators have learned that expressing emotions through writing about stressful or traumatic events has positive effects on both psychological and physical health andwell-being (Frattaroli, 2006). Evidence shows that people assigned to an expressivewriting program show fewer psychological and physical symptoms than do controlparticipants (Low, Stanton, & Danoff-Burg, 2006; Sloan & Marx, 2005; Sloan et al.,2007; Smyth & Pennebaker, 2001). In addition, terminally ill cancer patients asked towrite about their cancer had less sleep disturbance than did control patients who wroteabout neutral topics (de Moor et al., 2003). Why might expressive writing produce such beneficial effects? One possibility is that keeping thoughts and feelings about traumatic events tightly under wraps places a stress-ful burden on the autonomic nervous system, which in turn may weaken the immunesystem and thereby increase susceptibility to stress-related disorders. We should caution,however, that more research is needed before we can reach any definite conclusionsabout the effects of writing or other psychological interventions on the workings of theimmune system (Miller & Cohen, 2001). Terrorism-Related Trauma The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on America changed everything. Before 9/11we may have felt secure in our homes, offices, and other public places from the threatof terrorism. But now, terrorism looms as a constant threat to our safety and sense ofsecurity. Still, we endeavor to maintain a sense of normalcy in our lives. We travel andattend public gatherings, although the ever-present security regulations are a constantreminder of the heightened concern about terrorism. Many of us who were directlyaffected by 9/11 or lost friends or loved ones may still be trying to cope with the emo-tional consequences of that day. Many survivors, like survivors of other forms oftrauma, such as floods and tornadoes, may experience prolonged, maladaptive stress-ful reactions, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (discussed in Chapter 6).Stress, Psychological Factors, and Health 147 TABLE 5.2 Stress-Related Symptoms Reported by Americans in the Week Following the Terrorists Attacks of September 11, 2001 DepressionLack of Focus (difficulty concentrating) Insomnia Men 62 44 26 Women 79 53 40 Genders combined 71 49 33 Source: Pew Research Center.

Evidence from a recent community-based study in Michigan shows that the numberof suicide attempts jumped in the months following the 9/11 attacks (Starkman, 2006).But even those free of serious mental health problems may be emotionally affected inone way or another by the events of 9/11 (Galea et al., 2002). Most Americans reported feeling depressed in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, and a substantial proportion reported difficulty concentrating or suffered from insomnia(see Table 5.2). Not surprisingly, factors such as direct exposure to the attacks in NewY ork City and Washington, D.C., and time spent viewing TV coverage of the attackswere linked to higher levels of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms(Schlenger et al., 2002). Although most people exposed to traumatic events do notdevelop PTSD, many do experience symptoms associated with the disorder, such asdifficulties concentrating and high levels of arousal. In more than 60% of householdsin New Y ork City, parents reported that their children were upset by the attacks. Since9/11, many of us have become sensitized to the emotional consequences of traumaticstress. The accompanying A Closer Look feature focuses on the warning signs of trauma-related stress. People vary in their reactions to traumatic stress. Investigators trying to pinpoint factors that account for resiliency in the face of stress suggest that positive emotionscan play an important role. Evidence gathered since 9/11 shows that experiencing pos-itive emotions such as feelings of gratitude and love, helped buffer the effects of stress(Fredrickson et al., 2003). The General Adaptation Syndrome Stress researcher Hans Selye (1976) coined the term general adaptation syndrome (GAS) to describe a common biological response pattern to prolonged or excessive stress. Selye pointed out that our bodies respond similarly to many kinds of unpleas-ant stressors, whether the source of stress is an invasion of microscopic disease organ-isms, a divorce, or the aftermath of a flood. The GAS model suggests that our bodies,under stress, are like clocks with alarm systems that do not shut off until their energyis perilously depleted. The GAS consists of three stages: the alarm reaction, the resistance stage, and the exhaustion stage. Perception of an immediate stressor (for example, a car that swerves in front of your own on the highway) triggers the alarm reaction. The alarm reaction mobilizes the body to prepare for challenge or stress. We can think of it as the body'sfirst line of defense against a threatening stressor. The body reacts with a complex, inte-grated response involving both the central nervous system and endocrine system (Ellis,Jackson, & Boyce, 2006). In 1929, Harvard University physiologist Walter Cannon termed this response pat- tern the fight-or-flight reaction. We noted earlier how the endocrine system responds to stress. During the alarm reaction, the adrenal glands, under control by the pituitarygeneral adaptation syndrome (GAS) The body's three-stage response to states of prolonged or intense stress. alarm reaction The first stage of the GAS, characterized by heightened sympatheticactivity. fight-or-flight reaction The inborn tendency to respond to a threat by either fighting or fleeing.148 Chapter 5 TABLE 5.3 Stress-Related Changes in the Body Associated with the Alarm Reaction Corticosteroids are released.

The reaction is defined by secretion of stress hormones and increased activity of the sympathetic branch of the ANS. gland in the brain, pump out cortical steroids and stress hormones that help mobilize the body's defenses (see Table 5.3). The fight-or-flight reaction most probably helped our early ancestors cope with the many perils they faced. The reaction may have been provoked by the sight of a preda-tor or by a rustling sound in the undergrowth. But our ancestors usually did not expe-rience prolonged activation of the alarm reaction. Once a threat was eliminated, thebody reinstated a lower level of arousal. Our ancestors fought off predators or fledquickly; then their bodies returned to the normal, nonaroused state. Sensitive alarmreactions increased their chances of survival. Y et our ancestors did not remain for longin a state of heightened arousal after the immediate danger was past. In contrast,people today are continually bombarded with stressors\u2014everything from battlingtraffic in the morning to balancing school and work, or rushing from job to job.Consequently, our alarm system is turned on much of the time, which may eventuallyincrease the likelihood of developing stress-related disorders. When a stressor is persistent, we progress to the resistance stage, or adaptation stage, of the GAS. Endocrine and sympathetic system responses (release of stress hormones, People normally experience psychological distress in the face of trauma. If anything it would be abnormal to remain blas\u00e9 at a time of crisis or disaster.But stress reactions that linger beyond a month and affect an indiv idual's ability to function in everyday life can be a cause for concern. The American Psychological Association lists the following symptoms as warning signs oftraumatic stress reactions. Recurring thoughts or nightmares about the event Having trouble sleeping or changes in appetiteExperiencing anxiety and fear, especially when exposed to events or situations reminiscent of the trauma Being on edge, being easily startled, or becoming overly alertFeeling depressed, sad, and having low energyExperiencing memory problems including difficulty in remembering aspectsof the trauma Feeling \"scattered\" and unable to focus on work or daily activitiesHaving difficulty making decisionsFeeling irritable, easily agitated, or angry and resentfulFeeling emotionally \"numb,\" withdrawn, disconnected or different from othersSpontaneously crying, feeling a sense of despair and hopelessnessFeeling extremely protective of, or fearful for, the safety of loved onesNot being able to face certain aspects of the trauma, and avoiding activi- ties, places, or even people that remind you of the event If you or a loved one has experienced these symptoms for more than a month, it would be worthwhile to seek professional mental health assistance.Assistance is available through your college health services (for registeredstudents) or through networks of trained professionals.

During this stage the body tries to renew spent energy and repair damage. But whenstressors continue or new ones enter the picture, we may progress to the final stage ofthe GAS, which is called the exhaustion stage. Although there are individual differences in capacity to resist stress, all of us will eventually exhaust our bodily resources. The exhaus-tion stage is characterized by dominance of the parasympathetic branch of the ANS.Consequently, our heart and respiration rates decelerate. Do we benefit from therespite? Not necessarily. If the source of stress persists, we may develop what Selyetermed \"diseases of adaptation.\" These range from allergic reactions to heart disease\u2014and, at times, even death. The lesson is clear: Chronic stress can damage our health,leaving us more vulnerable to a range of diseases and other physical health problems. Cortical steroids are perhaps one reason that persistent stress may eventually lead to health problems. Although cortical steroids help the body cope with stress, they alsosuppress the activity of the immune system. Cortical steroids have negligible effectswhen they are only released periodically. Continuous secretion, however, weakens theimmune system by disrupting the production of antibodies, which can over timeincrease vulnerability to colds and other infections. Although Selye's model speaks to the general response pattern of the body under stress, different biological processes may respond to particular kinds of stressors. Forexample, persistent exposure to excessive noise may invoke different bodily processesthan other sources of stress, such as overcrowding, or psychological sources of stress,such as divorce or separation. Stress and Life Changes Researchers have investigated the stress-illness connection by quantifying life stress interms of life changes (also called life events ). Life changes are sources of stress because they force us to adjust. They include both positive events, such as getting married, andnegative events, such as the death of a loved one. Y ou can gain insight into the level ofstressful life changes you may have experienced during the past year by completing theCollege Life Stress Inventory on page 150. Evidence shows that people who experience greater numbers of life changes are more likely to suffer from psychological and physical health problems (Dohrenwend,2006). Again, we need to be cautious when interpreting these findings. The reportedlinks are correlational and not experimental. In other words, researchers did not (andwould not!) assign subjects to conditions in which they were exposed to either a highor low level of life changes to see what effects these conditions might have on theirhealth over time. Rather, existingdata are based on observations ofrelationships, say, between lifechanges on the one hand andphysical health problems on theother. Such relationships are opento other interpretations. It couldbe that physical symptoms aresources of stress in themselves andlead to more life changes. Physicalillness may cause disruptions ofsleep or financial burdens, and soforth. Hence, in some cases atleast, the causal direction may bereversed: Health problems maylead to life changes. We can't yettease out the possible cause-and-effect relationships. Although both positive and negative life changes can be For better or for worse. Life changes such as marriage and the death of loved ones are sources of stress that require adjustment. The death of a spouse may be one of the most stressful life changes that peopleever face. 150 Chapter 5 QUESTIONNAIRE Going Through Changes EVENT STRESSRATING Drunk driving 82 Sense of overload in school or work 82 Two exams in one day 80 Cheating on your boyfriend or girlfriend 77Getting married 76Negative consequences of drinking or drug use 75 Declaring a major or concerns about future plans 65 A class you hate 62Drinking or use of drugs 61Confrontations with professors 60 Starting a new semester 58 Going on a first date 57Registering for classes 55Maintaining a steady dating relationship 55 Commuting to campus or work, or both 54 Peer pressures 53Being away from home for the first time 53Getting sick 52 Concerns about your appearance 52 Getting straight As 51A difficult class that you love 48Making new friends; getting along with friends 47 Fraternity or sorority rush 47 Falling asleep in class 40Attending an athletic event (e.g., football game) 20How stressful has your life been lately?

In other words, marriage tends to be less stress-ful than divorce or separation. Or to put it another way, a change for the better maybe a change, but it is less of a hassle. Acculturative Stress: Making It in America Should Hindu women who immigrate to the United States give up the sari in favor ofCalifornia casuals? Should Russian immigrants continue to teach their childrenRussian in the home? Should African American children be acquainted with the musicand art of African peoples? Should women from traditional Islamic societies removethe veil and enter the competitive workplace? How do the stresses of acculturationaffect the psychological well-being of immigrants and their families? Sociocultural theorists have alerted us to the importance of accounting for social stressors in explaining abnormal behavior. One of the primary sources of stress imposed on immigrant groups, or on native groups living in the larger mainstream cul-ture, is the need to adapt to a new culture. We can define acculturation as the process of adaptation by which immigrants, native groups, and ethnic minority groups adjust tothe new culture or majority culture through making behavioral and attitudinal changes.Acculturative stress is pressure that results from the demands placed on immigrant, native, and ethnic minority groups to adjust to life in the mainstream culture. acculturative stress Pressure to adjust to a host or mainstream culture.Stress, Psychological Factors, and Health 151 Consider the challenges faced by Hispanic Americans. There are two general theo- ries of the relationships between acculturation and adjustment. One theory, dubbedthe melting pot theory, holds that acculturation helps people adjust to living in the host culture. From this perspective, Hispanic Americans might adjust better by replacingSpanish with English and adopting the values and customs associated with main-stream American culture. A competing theory, the bicultural theory, holds that psy- chosocial adjustment is fostered by identification with both traditional and host cultures.That is, the ability to adapt to the ways of the new society, combined with a support-ive cultural tradition and a sense of ethnic identity, may predict good adjustment.From a bicultural perspective, immigrants maintain their ethnic identity and tradi-tional values while learning to adapt to the language and customs of the host culture. If we are to investigate acculturation and its relationship to mental health we first must be able to measure it. Measures of acculturation vary. In assessing acculturation amongHispanic Americans, for example, researchers assess variables such as the degree to whichpeople favor English or Spanish in social situations, when reading, or while watching TV;preferences for types of food and styles of clothing; and self-perceptions of ethnic identity. We've learned that relationships between acculturation and psychological adjust- ment are complex. Some research links higher acculturation status to a greater likelihoodof developing psychological problems, whereas other research shows the opposite to bethe case. First, let us note some findings from research with Hispanic (Latino)Americans that highlight psychological risks associated with acculturation. Increased risk of heavy drinking among women. Evidence shows that highly accul- turated Hispanic American women are more likely than relatively unacculturatedHispanic American women to become heavy drinkers (Caetano, 1987). In LatinAmerican cultures, men tend to drink much more alcohol than women, largelybecause gender-based cultural prohibitions against drinking constrain alcohol useamong women. These constraints appear to have loosened among HispanicAmerican women who adopt \"mainstream\" U.S. attitudes and values. Increased risk of delinquency, smoking, and sexual intercourse among adolescents. Third- generation Mexican American male adolescents\u2014who are more likely to be accultur-ated than first- or second-generation Mexican Americans\u2014were at higher risk (Buriel, & Vasquez, 1982). Higher levels of acculturation are alsolinked to increased risks of smoking (Ribisl et al., 2000; Unger, Cruz, & Rohrbach,2000) and participation in sexual intercourse among Latino teens (Adam et al., 2005). Increased risk of disturbed eating behaviors. Highly acculturated Hispanic American high school girls were more likely than their less-acculturated counterparts to showtest scores associated with anorexia (an eating disorder characterized by excessiveweight loss and fears of becoming fat\u2014see Chapter 10) on an eating attitudes ques-tionnaire (Pumariega, 1986). Acculturation apparently made these girls more vul-nerable to the demands of striving toward the contemporary American ideal of the(very!) slender woman. From this evidence, we might gather that acculturation has a negative influence on psychological adjustment. Acculturation may contribute to an erosion of traditional family networks and values, which in turn may increase susceptibility to psychologicaldisorders in the face of stress (Ortega et al., 2000). On the other hand, we also have evi-dence of psychological benefits of a pattern of bicultural identification in which theindividual makes efforts to adjust to the host culture while also maintaining an identitywith the traditional culture. Consider a study of Mexican American elders (Zamanianet al., 1992). Those who were minimally acculturated showed higher levels of depres-sion than did those who were either acculturated or bicultural. The bicultural andhighly acculturated groups were similar in levels of depression, whereas those who wereminimally acculturated had a greater risk of depression. However, people with a bicul-tural identity in which they maintained identification with their original culture, whilealso adapting to the new one, experienced no greater vulnerability to depression. Why would low acculturation status be linked to increased risk of depression? The answer may be that low acculturation status is often a marker for low socioeconomic152 Chapter 5 status (SES). People who are minimally acculturated often face economic hardship and occupy the lower strata ofsocioeconomic status. Social stress resulting from financialdifficulties, lack of proficiency in the host language, andlimited economic opportunities add to the stress of adapt-ing to the host culture, all of which may contribute toincreased risk of depression and other psychological prob-lems (Ryder, Alden, & Paulhus, 2000; Y eh, 2003). Not sur-prisingly, evidence shows that Mexican Americans whowere more proficient in English generally had fewer signsof depression and anxiety than did their less English-proficient counterparts (Salgado de Snyder, 1987; Warheitet al., 1985). Y et socioeconomic status and language profi-ciency are not the only, nor necessarily the most important,determinants of mental health among immigrant groups.Consider the findings from a northern California samplethat showed better mental health profiles among Mexicanimmigrants than among people of Mexican descent born inthe United States, despite the greater socioeconomic disad-vantages faced by the immigrant group (Vega et al., 1998). It appears that \"Americanization\" may have damaging effects on mental health ofMexican Americans and that retention of cultural traditions may have a protective or\"buffer\" effect (Escobar, 1998). In sum, the erosion of traditional family networks and traditional values that may accompany acculturation among immigrant groups might increase the risk of psy-chological problems (Ortega et al., 2000). Studies with other ethnic groups also pointto the benefits of adapting to the host culture while maintaining ties to the traditionalculture. Among Asian Americans, for example, investigators find that establishingcontacts with the majority culture while maintaining traditional ethnic identityappears to generate less stress than withdrawal and separation from the host culture(Huang, 1994). Maintaining one's ethnic identity also seems to hold a psychologicalbenefit. Studies with Asian American adolescents show that those who with a strongethnic identity are better adjusted psychologically and have higher self esteem thanothers who are less strongly identified with their traditional culture (Huang, 1994;Phinney & Alipuria, 1990). Let us also note that a recent study of Asian immigrantadolescents in the United States showed that feelings of being alienated from bothcultures or feeling caught between the two\u2014the United States and the traditionalculture\u2014can lead to mental health problems (Y eh, 2003). Moreover, some outcomes need careful interpretation. For example, does the find- ing that highly acculturated Hispanic American women are more likely to drink heav-ily argue in favor of placing greater social constraints on women? Perhaps a looseningof restraints is a double-edged sword, and all people\u2014male and female, Hispanic andnon-Hispanic\u2014encounter adjustment problems when they gain new freedoms. Finally, we need to consider gender differences in acculturation. In one study, female immigrants showed higher levels of depression than male immigrants (Salgado deSnyder, Cervantes, & Padilla, 1990). Their higher levels of depression may be linked tothe greater level of stress women typically encounter in adjusting to changes in familypatterns and personal issues, such as the greater freedom of gender roles for men andwomen in U.S. society. Because they were reared in cultures in which men are expectedto be breadwinners and women homemakers, immigrant women may encounter morefamily and internal conflict when they enter the workforce, regardless of whether theywork because of economic necessity or personal choice. Given these factors, weshouldn't be surprised that wives in more acculturated Mexican American couplestend to report greater marital distress than those in less-acculturated couples (Negy &Snyder, 1997). The lead author of this study, psychologist Charles Negy of theUniversity of Central Florida, explores the role of acculturation among Latinos in theControversies in Abnormal Psychology feature on page 153. Maintaining ethnic identity. Some studies point to psychological benefits in immigrant groups that adapt to the host culture while maintaining ethnic identity. Immigrant groups show better psychological adjustment when they forsake their cultural heritage and adopt the values of the host culture. FALSE. Retention of cultural traditions may have a protective or \"buffer\" effect against the stresses associated with adjusting to a new culture.FICTION TRUTH orStress, Psychological Factors, and Health 153 Psychological Factors That Moderate Stress Stress may be a fact of life, but the ways in which we handle stress help determine our ability to cope with it. Individuals react differently to stress depending on psychologicalfactors such as the meaning they ascribe to stressful events. For example, whether a majorlife event, such as pregnancy, is a positive or negative stressor depends on a couple's desirefor a child and their readiness to care for one. We can say the stress of pregnancy is mod-erated by the perceived value of children in a couple's eyes and their self-efficacy\u2014their\u2014CHARLES NEGY As a young man of part Mexican American heritage, I worked in a grocery store in East Los Angeles and was intrigued by the wide range of people ofMexican ancestry I encountered. Many recent immigrants from Mexico seemedeager to practice the little English they knew and were interested in learning more about mainstream American culture. I also knew many immigrants, includ- ing many who had lived in California for more than 20 years, who spoke barelyany English and hardly ever ventured beyond the local community. When I entered graduate school it seemed natural for me to study accultur- ation among Latino or Hispanic Americans. Acculturation refers to adopting the values, attitudes, and behaviors of a host culture. In my early studies, I quickly observed what other researchers had already discovered; namely, thatLatinos in the United States varied greatly in their degree of acculturationtoward the U.S. culture. In general, the longer time they had lived in the United States, the more acculturated they tended to be, and the more accul- turated they were, the more they resembled non-Hispanic Whites in theirvalues, attitudes, and customs. In my early studies (e.g., Negy & Woods, 1992a; 1993), I found that the more acculturated Mexican American college students were, the more similar their scores were to those of non-Hispanic Whites on standardized personalitytests. I wasn't surprised to find that those who were more acculturated tendedto come from higher socioeconomic backgrounds (Negy & Woods, 1992b). I also found that among lower-income Mexican American adolescents who showed signs of depression, the more acculturated they were, the more likelythey were to have experienced thoughts of committing suicide (Rasmussen,Negy, Carlson, & Burns, 1997). I later began a line of research examining ethnic differences in marital relationships by comparing Mexican American couples to (non-Hispanic) White couples and Mexican couples (Negy, & Snyder, 1997; Negy, Snyder, &Diaz-Loving, 2004). As a group, Mexican couples reported more verbal and/or physical aggression in their relationships than did Mexican American couples, who in turn reported more aggression in their relationships than did Whitecouples. We also observed that Mexican American couples had more egalitarian(equal) relationships and higher levels of marital satisfaction than Mexican couples (Negy & Snyder, 2004). We learned from these findings that living in the United States was associated with relationship patterns among MexicanAmericans that were closer to the Americanized ideal of mutual respect andshared decision-making. Our more recent research showed that the more accul- turated Cuban Americans and Puerto Ricans were, the more positive attitudes they held toward mental illness (in terms of being treatable and beingassoci ated with less social stigma) and the more open they were to seeking professional therapy for themselves (Rojas-Vilches & Negy, in preparation). Taken together, my research suggests that more highly acculturated Hispanic couples have less conflicted, more egalitarian, and more satisfying marriages.On the other hand, acculturation is also linked to some mental health problems,such as increased likelihood of suicidal thinking as a way of dealing with depression. This mixed picture of acculturation among Latinos is similar tothe complex and sometimes conflicting results from studies examining rela- tionships between acculturation and mental health reported in this chapter. We also observed in our study of Mexican American couples that more highly acculturated women reported less satisfaction with the sexual compo- nent of their relationships than did less well acculturated women. Thesefindings lead us to wonder whether American culture imparts greater expec-tations of female sexual satisfaction in marriages that translate into lower satisfaction when these expectations are not fulfilled. There are important issues to keep in mind when interpreting our research findings. For starters, the research is correlational in nature. As you mayrecall about correlational data, we cannot say whether one variable causes another variable. For example, based on the findings from my study of mari- tal couples, I cannot conclude that acculturation is causally related to thedevelopment of more egalitarian marriages. It is possible that causationworks in the opposite direction\u2014that having an egalitarian marriage influ- ences acculturation. How? We can speculate that Mexican Americans with more egalitarian relationships may be more accepted by mainstream society,and the more interactions they have within the general society, the moreopportunities they have to acculturate. It may also be the case that having egalitarian marriages tends to be associated (correlated) with acculturation, but there is no causal link between the two. Learning more about Hispanics' relationships, particularly in the context of acculturation and mental health, is important because for many Latinos, the family, including the marital relationship, is the cornerstone of their identity and functioning. Our research may help inform the treatment inter-ventions clinicians can offer to Hispanic couples and families struggling withadjustment and acculturation challenges.

As we see next, psychological factors such as coping styles, self-efficacy expectancies, psychological hardiness, optimism, social sup-port, and ethnic identity may moderate or buffer the effects of stress. Styles of Coping What do you do when faced with a serious problem? Do you pre- tend it does not exist? Like Scarlett O'Hara in the classic film Gone With the Wind, do you say to yourself, \"I'll think about it tomorrow,\" and then banish it from your mind?Or do you take charge and confront it squarely? Pretending that problems do not exist is a form of denial. Denial is an example of emotion-focused coping (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). In emotion-focused coping, people take measures that immediately reduce the impact of the stressor, such as deny-ing its existence or withdrawing from the situation. Emotion-focused coping, however,does not eliminate the stressor (a serious illness, for example) or help the individualdevelop better ways of managing it. In problem-focused coping, by contrast, people examine the stressors they face and do what they can to change them or modifytheir own reactions to render stressors less harmful. These basic styles of coping\u2014emotion-focused and problem-focused\u2014have been applied to ways in which peoplerespond to illness. Denial of illness can take various forms, including the following. 1.Failing to recognize the seriousness of the illness 2.Minimizing the emotional distress the illness causes 3.Misattributing symptoms to other causes (for example, assuming the appearance of blood in the stool represents nothing more than a local abrasion) 4.Ignoring threatening information about the illness Denial can be dangerous to your health, especially if it leads to avoidance of, or noncompliance with, needed medical treatment. Avoidance is another form ofemotion-based coping. Like denial, avoidance may deter people from complyingwith medical treatments, which can lead to a worsening of their medical conditions.Evidence supports the negative consequences of avoidant coping. In one study,people who had an avoidant style of coping with cancer (for example, by trying notto think or talk about it) showed greater disease progression when evaluated a yearlater than did people who more directly confronted the illness (Epping-Jordan,Compas, & Howell, 1994). Other investigators link avoidance coping to the laterdevelopment of depression and to PTSD among combat veterans (Holahan et al.,2005; Stein et al., 2005). Another form of emotion-focused coping, the use of wish-fulfillment fantasies, is also linked to poor adjustment in coping with serious illness. Examples of wish-fulfillment fantasies include ruminating about what might have been had the illnessnot occurred and longing for better times. Wish-fulfillment fantasy offers the patientno means of coping with life's difficulties other than an imaginary escape. Does this mean that people are invariably better off when they know all the facts concerning their illnesses? Not necessarily. Whether you will be better off knowing all the facts may depend on your preferred style of coping. A mismatch between the indi-vidual's style of coping and the amount of information provided may hamper recov-ery. In one study, cardiac patients with a repressive style of coping (relying on denial) who received information about their conditions showed a higher incidence of med-ical complications than repressors who were largely kept in the dark (Shaw et al.,1985). Sometimes ignorance helps people manage stress\u2014at least temporarily. Problem-focused coping involves strategies that address the source of stress, such as seeking information about the illness through self-study and medical consultation.Information seeking may help the individual maintain a more optimistic frame ofmind by creating an expectancy that the information will prove to be useful. Self-Efficacy Expectancies Self-efficacy expectancies refer to our expectations regarding our abilities to cope with the challenges we face, to perform certainbehaviors skillfully, and to produce positive changes in our lives (Bandura, 1982, 1986).self-efficacy expectancies Beliefs in one's ability to accomplish particular tasks.Stress, Psychological Factors, and Health 155 We may be better able to manage stress, including the stress of coping with illness, if we feel confident (have higher self-efficacy expectan- cies) in our ability to cope effectively. A forthcoming exam may bemore or less stressful depending on your confidence in your ability toachieve a good grade. In a classic study, psychologist Albert Bandura and colleagues found that spider-phobic women showed high levels of the stress hormonesepinephrine and norepinephrine when they interacted with the phobicobject, such as by allowing a spider to crawl on their laps (Bandura etal.,1985). However, as their confidence or self-efficacy expectan cies for coping with these tasks increased, the levels of these stress hormones declined. Epinephrine and nor epinephr ine arouse the body by way of the sympathetic branch of the ANS. They make us feel shaky, have \"butterflies in the stomach,\" and generally feel nervous. Because high self-efficacy expectancies appear to be associated with lower secretionof these stress hormones, people who believe they can cope with theirproblems may be less likely to feel nervous. Psychological Hardiness Psychological hardiness refers to a cluster of traits that may help people manage stress. Suzanne Kobasa (1979) and hercolleagues investigated business executives who resisted illness despite heavy burdens ofstress. Three key traits distinguished the psychologically hardy executives (Kobasa,Maddi, & Kahn, 1982, pp. 169-170): 1.Commitment. Rather than feeling alienated from their tasks and situations, hardy executives involved themselves fully. That is, they believed in what they were doing. 2.Challenge. Hardy executives believed change was the normal state of things, not sterile sameness or stability for the sake of stability. 3.Control over their lives (Maddi & Kobasa, 1984). Hardy executives believed and acted as though they were effectual rather than powerless in controlling therewards and punishments of life. In terms suggested by social-cognitive theoristJulian Rotter (1966), psychologically hardy individuals have an internal locus of control . Psychologically hardy people appear to cope more effectively with stress by using more active, problem-solving approaches. They are also likely to report fewer physicalsymptoms and less depression in the face of stress than nonhardy people (Ouellette &DiPlacido, 2001; Pengilly & Dowd, 2000). Kobasa suggests that hardy people are betterable to handle stress because they perceive themselves as choosing their stress-creating situations. They perceive the stressors they face as making life more interesting andchallenging, not as simply burdening them with additional pressures. A sense ofcontrol is a key factor in psychological hardiness. Optimism Seeing the proverbial glass as half full rather than half empty is linked to better outcomes in terms of both physical and psychological health. Among heartdisease patients, optimistic attitudes are associated with less emotional distress;among cancer patients, optimism is associated with lower levels of emotional dis-tress, better psychological adjustment, and lower levels of reported pain; andamong pregnant women, it is linked to better birth outcomes, such as higher infantbirth weights (Bjerklie, 2005; Carver et al., 2005; Shnek et al., 2001; Trunzo &Pinto, 2003). Among pain patients, those expressing more pessimistic thoughts during flare-ups of pain tended to report more severe pain and distress (Gil et al., 1990). The pessimisticthoughts included, \"I can no longer do anything,\" \"No one cares about my pain,\" and\"It isn't fair I have to live this way.\" Research to date shows only correlational linksbetween optimism and health. Perhaps we shall soon learn whether learning to alterattitudes\u2014to learn to see the glass as half filled\u2014plays a causal role in maintaining orpsychological hardiness A cluster of stress-buffering traits characterized bycommitment, challenge, and control.

Y ou can evaluate your own level of optimism by com- pleting the Life Orientation T est in this section. The study of optimism falls within a broader contemporary movement in psychology called positive psychology. The developers of this move- ment believe that psychology should focus more of its efforts on thepositive aspects of the human experience, rather than just the deficitside of the human equation, such as problems of emotional disorders,drug abuse, and 2006). Although we shouldn't turn away fromthe study of emotional problems, we need to explore how positiveattributes, such as optimism, love, and hope, affect our ability to leadsatisfying and fulfilling lives. Another positive aspect of the humanexperience is the ability to help others in need and be helped by othersin turn, as in the case of social support. Social Support The role of social support as a buffer against stress is well docu- mented (e.g., Wills & Filer Fegan, 2001). In one study, having a broad network of socialcontacts was associated with greater resistance to developing an infection followingexposure to a common cold virus (Cohen & Mannarino, 1997). The investigatorsbelieve that having a wide range of social contacts may help protect the body's immunesystem by serving as a buffer against stress. Ethnic Identity African Americans, on the average, stand a greater risk than Euro Americans of suffering chronic health problems, such as obesity, hypertension,heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer (Brown, 2006; \"CDC Finds,\"2005; Shields, Lerman, & Sullivan, 2005). The particular stressors that AfricanAmericans often face, such as racism, poverty, violence, and overcrowded livingconditions, may contribute to their heightened risks of serious health-related prob-lems. Y et African Americans often demonstrate a high degree of resilience in copingwith stress (Cutrona et al., 2000). Among the factors that help buffer stress amongAfrican Americans are strong social networks of family and friends, beliefs in one'sability to handle stress (self-efficacy), coping skills, and ethnic identity.Interestingly, African Americans in a recent study who reported more activeattempts to seek social support showed less physiological responsiveness to theeffects of perceived racism, a significant life stressor, than did those who were lowin support seeking (Clark, 2006). Ethnic identity is associated with perceptions of a better quality of life among African Americans (Utsey et al., 2002) and appears to be more strongly related topsychological well-being among African Americans than among White Americans(Gray-Little & Hafdahl, 2000). Acquiring and maintaining pride in one's racial iden-tity and cultural heritage may help African Americans and other ethnic minoritieswithstand stresses imposed by racism. Although more research is needed to elucidatethe links among racial identity, self-esteem, and tolerance of stress, the available evi-dence suggests that African Americans who become alienated from their culturedevelop more negative self-images and stand a greater risk of developing not onlyphysical and psychological disorders, but also academic underachievement and mar-ital conflicts (Anderson, 1991).

Stress i nduces bodily responses such as excessive levels of sympathetic nervous system arousal, which if persistent may impair our ability to func- tion optimally and possibly increase the risk of stress-related illnesses. Psychological treatments have been shown to lower states of bodily arousal that may be prompted by stress. In this feature, we consider twowidely used psychological methods of lowering arousal: meditation andprogressive relaxation. MEDITATION Meditation comprises several ways of narrowing consciousness to moderate the stressors of the outer world. Yogis (adherents to Yoga philosophy) study the design on a vase or a mandala. The ancient Egyptians riveted their attention on an oil-burning lamp, which is the inspiration for the tale of Aladdin's lamp. In Turkey, Islamic mystics called whirling dervishes fix on their motion and the cadences of their breathing. We've learned that medita- tion has measurable benefits in treating many psychological and physical disorders, especially those in which stress plays a contributing role, such as cardiovascular disorders (Walsh & Shapiro, 2006). For example, a recent clinical trial showed improvements in coronary heart disease risk factors, including lower blood pressure, among heart patients who practiced meditation (Paul-Labrador et al., 2006).There are many meditation methods, but they share the common thread of narrowing one's attention by focusing on repetitive stimuli. Through passive observation, the regular person-environment connection is transformed. Problem solving, worry, planning, and routine concerns are suspended, and consequently, levels of sympathetic nervous system arousal are reduced. Many thousands of Americans regularly practice transcendental meditation (TM), a simplified kind of Indian meditation brought to the United States in 1959 by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Practitioners of TM repeat mantras \u2014relaxing sounds such as iengand om. Benson (1975) studied TM practitioners ages 17 to 41\u2014students, business- people, artists. His subjects included relative novices and veterans of 9 years of practice. Benson found that TM yields a relaxation response in many people. The relaxation response is characterized by reduced heart rate and metabolic rate and by lower blood pressure in people with hypertension (Benson, Manzetta, & Rosner, 1973; Gatchel, 2001). Meditators also tend to produce more alpha waves, which are brain waves connected with relaxation. Critics of meditation do not argue that meditation is without value; they suggest, instead, that meditation may have no distinct effects when compared to other forms of relaxation or even taking a restful break from a stressful routine. In mindfulness meditation, a form of meditation practiced by Tibetan Buddhists, the person focuses on conscious experience (thoughts, feelings,A CLOSER LOOK Psychological Methods for Lowering Arousal (continued)158 Chapter 5 and sensations) on a moment-to-moment basis, without judging or evaluat- ing the experience (Baer, 2003; Kabat-Zinn, 2003). This practice has beenlikened to observing the flow of a river. Mindfulness meditation shows promise in treating various physical and mental health problems, including chronic pain and stress, as well as improving psychological well-being and reducingrelapse rates in depressed patients & Teasdale, 2004; Roemer & Orsillo, there are differences among meditative techniques, the follow- ing suggestions illustrate some general guidelines. 1.Try meditation once or twice a day for 10 to 20 minutes at a time. 2.When you meditate, what you don't do is more important than what you do. So embrace a passive attitude: Tell yourself, \"What happens, hap- pens.\" In meditation, you take what you get. You don't strive for more. Striving of any kind hinders meditation. 3.Place yourself in a hushed, calming environment. For example, don't face a light directly. 4.Avoid eating for an hour before you meditate. Avoid caffeine (found in coffee, tea, many soft drinks, and chocolate) for at least 2 hours beforemeditation. 5.Get into a relaxed position. Modify it as needed. You can scratch or yawn if you feel the urge. 6.For a focusing device, you can concentrate on your breathing or sit in front of a serene object, such as a plant or incense. Benson suggests\"perceiving\" (not \"mentally saying\") the word oneeach time you breathe out. That is, think the word, but \"less actively\" than you normally would. Other researchers suggest thinking the word inas you breathe in and out,or ah-h-h, as you breathe out. They also suggest mantras, such as ah-nam, rah-mah, and shi-rim. 7.When preparing for meditation, repeat your mantra aloud many times\u2014if you're using a mantra. Enjoy it. Then say it progressively more softly. Close your eyes. Focus on the mantra. Allow thinking the mantra tobecome more and more \"passive\" so you \"perceive\" rather than think it.Again, embrace your \"what happens, happens\" attitude. Keep on focus- ing on the mantra. It may become softer or louder, or fade and then reappear. 8.If unsettling thoughts drift in while you're meditating, allow them to \"pass through.\" Don't worry about squelching them, or you may become tense. 9.Remember to take what comes. Meditation and relaxation cannot be forced. You cannot force the relaxing effects of meditation. Like sleep,you can only set the stage for it and then permit it to happen. 10.Let yourself drift. (You won't get lost.) What happens, happens.PROGRESSIVE RELAXATION Progressive relaxation was originated by University of Chicago physician Edmund Jacobson in 1938. Jacobson noticed that people tense their mus-cles under stress, intensifying their uneasiness. They tend to be unaware of these contractions, however. Jacobson reasoned that if muscle contrac- tions contributed to tension, muscle relaxation might reduce tension. Butclients who were asked to focus on relaxing muscles often had no ideawhat to do. Jacobson's method of progressive relaxation teaches people how to moni- tor muscle tension and relaxation. With this method, people first tense, thenrelax, selected muscle groups in the arms; facial area; the chest, stomach,and lower back muscles; the hips, thighs, and calves; and so on. Thesequence heightens awareness of muscle tension and helps people differenti- ate feelings of tension from relaxation. The method is progressive in that people progress from one group of muscles to another in practicing the tech-nique. Since the 1930s, progressive relaxation has been used by a number ofbehavior therapists, including Joseph Wolpe and Arnold Lazarus (1966). The following instructions from Wolpe and Lazarus (1966, pp. 177-178) illustrate how the technique is applied to relaxing the arms. Relaxation shouldbe practiced in a favorable setting. Settle back on a recliner, a couch, or abed with a pillow. Select a place and time when you're unlikely to be dis- turbed. Make the room warm and comfortable. Dim sources of light. Loosen tight clothing. Tighten muscles about two thirds as hard as you could if youwere trying your hardest. If you sense that a muscle could have a spasm, youare tightening too much. After tensing, let go of tensions completely. Relaxation of Arms (time: 4-5 minutes) Settle back as comfortably as you can. Let yourself relax to the best of yourability. . . . Now, as you relax like that, clench your right fist, just clenchyour fist tighter and tighter, and study the tension as you do so. Keep itclenched and feel the tension in your right fist, hand, forearm . . . and nowrelax. Let the fingers of your right hand become loose, and observe thecontrast in your feelings .... Now let yourself go and try to become more relaxed all over .... Once more, clench your right fist really tight . . . hold it, and notice the tension again .... Now let go, relax; your fingers straighten out, and you notice the difference once more .... Now repeat that with your left fist. Clench your left fist while the rest of your body relaxes;clench that fist tighter and feel the tension . . . and now relax. Again enjoythe contrast. . . . Repeat that once more, clench the left fist, tight andtense.... Now do the opposite of tension\u2014relax and feel the difference. Continue relaxing like that for a while .... Clench both fists tighter and together, both fists tense, forearms tense, study the sensations . . . andrelax; straighten out your fingers and feel that relaxation. Continue relaxingyour hands and forearms more and more .... Now bend your elbows and tense your biceps, tense them harder and study the tension feelings . . . allright, straighten out your arms, let them relax and feel that differenceagain. Let the relaxation develop. . . . Once more, tense your biceps; holdthe tension and observe it carefully. . . . Straighten the arms and relax; relaxto the best of your ability. . . . Each time, pay close attention to your feelingswhen you tense up and when you relax. Now straighten your arms, straightenthem so that you feel most tension in the triceps muscles along the back ofyour arms; stretch your arms and feel that tension .... And now relax. Get your arms back into a comfortable position. Let the relaxation proceed on itsown. The arms should feel comfortably heavy as you allow them to relax. . . .Straighten the arms once more so that you feel the tension in the tricepsmuscles; straighten them. Feel that tension . . . and relax. Now let's con-centrate on pure relaxation in the arms without any tension. Get your armscomfortable and let them relax further and further. Continue relaxing yourarms even further. Even when your arms seem fully relaxed, try to go thatextra bit further; try to achieve deeper and deeper levels of relaxation.(continued) Going with the flow. Meditation is a popular methodof managing the stresses of the outside world by reducing states of bodily arousal. This young woman practices yoga, aform of meditation. She \"goeswith the flow,\" allowing the distractions of her environment to, in a sense, \"pass through.\"Contrast her meditative statewith the apparently stressfulfeatures of the young man sit- ting behind her.Stress, Psychological Factors, and Health 159 Physical disorders in which psychological factors are believed to play a causal or contributing role have traditionally been termed psychosomatic disorders. The term psychosomatic is derived from the Greek roots psyche, meaning \"soul\" or \"intellect,\" and soma, which means \"body.\" Disorders such as asthma and headaches have traditionally been labeled as psychosomatic because of the belief that psychological factors play animportant role in their development. Ulcers are another ailment traditionally identified as a psychosomatic disorder. Ulcers affect about 1 in 10 people in the United States. However, their status as a psy-chosomatic disorder has been reevaluated in the light of recent landmark researchshowing that a bacterium, H. pylori, not stress or diet, is the major cause of the types of ulcers called peptic ulcers , which are sores in the lining of the stomach or upper part of the small intestine (Jones, 2006). Ulcers may arise when the bacterium damages theprotective lining of the stomach or intestines. Treatment with a regimen of antibioticsmay cure ulcers by attacking the bacterium directly. We don't yet know why somepeople who harbor the bacterium develop ulcers and others do not. The virulence ofthe particular strain of H. pylori may determine whether infected people develop peptic ulcers. Stress may also play a role, although we lack definitive evidence thatstress contributes to vulnerability (Jones, 2006). The field of psychosomatic medicine explores health-related connections between the mind and the body. T oday, evidence points to the importance of psychologicalfactors in a much wider range of physical disorders than those traditionally identi-fied as psychosomatic. In this section we discuss several traditionally identified psy-chosomatic disorders as well as other diseases in which psychological factors mayplay a role in the course or treatment of the disease\u2014cardiovascular disease, cancer,and HIV/AIDS. Headaches Headaches are symptoms of many medical disorders. When they occur in the absenceof other symptoms, however, they may be classified as stress-related. By far the mostfrequent kind of headache is the tension headache . Stress can lead to persistent con- tractions of the muscles of the scalp, face, neck, and shoulders, giving rise to periodicor chronic tension headaches. Such headaches develop gradually and are generallycharacterized by dull, steady pain on both sides of the head and feelings of pressureor tightness. Most other headaches, including the severe migraine headache, appear to involve changes in the blood flow to the brain (Durham, 2004; Linde et al., 2005). Migraineheadaches affect more than 28 million Americans. Typical migraines last for hoursor days. They may occur as often as daily or as seldom as every other month. Theyare characterized by piercing or throbbing sensations on one side of the head only orcentered behind an eye. They can be so intense that they seem intolerable. Sufferersmay experience an aura , or cluster of warning sensations that precedes the attack. Auras are typified by perceptual distortions, such as flashing lights, bizarre images,or blind spots. Coping with the misery of brutal migraine attacks can take its toll,impairing the quality of life and leading to disturbances of sleep, mood, and thinking processes. Theoretical Perspectives The underlying causes of headaches remain unclear and subject to continued study. One factor contributing to tension headaches may beincreased sensitivity of the neural pathways that send pain signals to the brain from theface and head (Holroyd, 2002). Migraines headaches may involve an underlyingcentral nervous system disorder involving nerves and blood vessels in the brain.The neurotransmitter serotonin is also implicated. Falling levels of serotonin maycause blood vessels in the brain to contract (narrow) and then dilate (expand). This stretching stimulates sensitized nerve endings that give rise to the throbbing, piercingpsychosomatic Pertaining to a physical disorder in which psychological factors play a causal or contributing role.160 Chapter 5 biofeedback training (BFT) A method of feeding back to the indiv idual information about bodily functions so that the person can gain some degree of control over these functions. People can relieve the pain of migraine headaches by raising the temperature in a finger. TRUE. Some people have relieved migraine headaches by raising the temperature in a finger.This biofeedback technique modifies patterns of blood flow in the body.FICTION TRUTH orcardiovascular disease A disease or disorder of the cardiovascular system, such as coronary heart disease or hypertension.Migraine! Migraine headaches involve intense throbbing pain on one side of the head. They may be triggered by many factors,such as hormonal changes, exposure tostrong light, changes in barometric pressure;hunger, exposure to pollen, red wine, and use of certain drugs and even monosodium gluta- mate (MSG).sensations associated with migraines. Evidence also points to a strong genetic contribution to migraine (\"Scientists Discover,\" 2003). Many factors may trigger a migraine attack. These include stress; stimuli such as bright lights; certain used toenhance the flavor of food; red wine; and even hunger. Hormonal changesof the sort that affect women prior to and during menstruation can alsotrigger attacks, and the incidence of migraines among women is about twicethat among men. Treatment Commonly available pain relievers, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen, may reduce or eliminate pain associated with tensionheadaches. Drugs that constrict dilated blood vessels in the brain or helpregulate serotonin activity are used to treat the pain from migraineheadache (Brandes, 2006; Silberstein et al., 2000). Psychological treatment can also help relieve tension or migraine headache pain in many cases. These treatments include training in biofeed-back, relaxation, coping-skills training, and some forms of cognitive ther-apy (Gatchel, 2001; Holroyd, 2002). Biofeedback training (BFT) helps people gain control over various bodily functions, such as muscle tensionand brain waves, by giving them information (feedback) about these func-tions in the form of auditory signals (e.g., \"bleeps\") or visual displays.People learn to make the signal change in the desired direction. Trainingpeople to use relaxation skills combined with biofeedback has also been shown to be effective. Electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback is a form of BFT that involves relaying information about muscle tension in the fore-head. EMG biofeedback thus heightens awareness of muscle tension in this region and provides cues that people can use to learn to reduce it. Some people have relieved the pain of migraine headaches by raising the tempera- ture in a finger. This biofeedback technique, called thermal BFT , modifies patterns of blood flow throughout the body, including blood flow to the brain, to help controlmigraine headaches (Blanchard et al., 1990; Gauthier, Ivers, & Carrier, 1996). One wayof providing thermal feedback is by attaching a temperature-sensing device to a finger.A console \"bleeps\" more slowly or rapidly as the temperature in the finger rises. Thetemperature rises when more blood flows to the fingers and away from the head. Theclient can imagine the finger growing warmer to bring about these desirable changesin the flow of blood in the body. Cardiovascular Disease Y our cardiovascular system, the network that connects your heart and blood vessels, isyour highway of life. Unfortunately, there are accidents along this highway in the formofcardiovascular disease (CVD, or heart and artery disease). CVD is the leading cause of death in the United States, claiming about 1 million lives annually and accountingfor about 4 in 10 deaths, most often as the result of heart attacks or strokes (Hu &Willett, 2002; Nabel, 2003). Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the major form of car- diovascular disease, accounting for about 700,000 deaths annually, mostly from heart attacks. CVD is the leading cause of death for both men and women, claiming even more women's lives than breast cancer. In coronary heart disease, the flow of blood to the heart is insufficient to meet the heart's needs. The underlying disease process in CHD is called arteriosclerosis, or \"hardening of the arteries,\" a condition in which artery walls become thicker, harder, and less elastic, which makes it more difficult for blood to flow freely. The majorunderlying cause of arteriosclerosis is atherosclerosis, a process involving the buildup of fatty deposits along artery walls that leads to the formation of artery-clogging plaque.If a blood clot should form in an artery narrowed by plaque, it may nearly or com-pletely block the flow of blood to the heart. The result is a heart attack (also called a Stress, Psychological Factors, and Health 161 myocardial infarction ), a life-threatening event in which heart tissue dies due to a lack of oxygen-rich blood. When a blood clot blocks the supply of blood in an artery serv-ing the brain, a stroke can occur, leading to death of brain tissue that can result in loss of function controlled by that part of the brain, coma, or even death. The good news is that CHD is largely preventable (Nabel, 2003). How? By reducing the risk factors we can control. Some risk factors we can't control, such as age andfamily history. But a number of risk factors can be controlled through medical treat-ment or lifestyle changes\u2014factors such as high blood cholesterol, hypertension (highblood pressure), smoking, overeating, heavy drinking, consuming a high-fat diet, a sedentary (e.g., Mendelsohn & Karas, 2005; Panagiotakos et al., 2005;Pickering, 2003). Unfortunately, many of these factors remain uncontrolled. For exam-ple, only about one in four adults with hypertension take medications to control bloodpressure (Chobanian, 2001; Hyman & Pavlik, 2001). Adopting healthier behaviors can have beneficial effects on the heart. For example, evidence shows that even seasoned couch potatoes can reduce their risk of cardiovas-cular disease by becoming more physically active (Blumenthal et al., 2005; Borjesson &Dahlof, 2005). Negative Emotions Might your emotions be putting you at risk of coronary heart disease? It appears so. Frequent emotional distress in the form of anger, anxiety, anddepression can have damaging effects on the cardiovascular system (Frasure-Smith &Lesp\u00e9rance, 2005; Geipert, 2007; Orth-Gom\u00e9r et al., 2000). Researchers highlight the toxic effects of chronic anger on the heart. Occasional feelings of anger may not damage the heart in healthy people, but chronic anger\u2014thetype you see in people who seem angry all of the time\u2014is linked to increased risk ofCHD (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2002; Pressman, & Cohen, 2005; Rutledge & Hogan, 2002;Steptoe, Wardle, & Marmot, 2005). Anger is closely associated with hostility\u2014a personality trait characterized by quickness to anger and by tendencies to blame others and to perceive the world in neg-ative terms. Hostility is a component of the Type A behavior pattern (TABP), a style of behavior that characterizes people who are hard driving, ambitious, impatient, andhighly competitive. Although earlier research had linked the Type A pat-tern to a higher risk of CHD, more recent research casts doubts on therelationship between this personality pattern and coronary risk (Geipert,2007). However, we have more consistent evidence linking the trait ofhostility, a component of the Type A pattern, to increased risks of heartdisease and other negative health outcomes (Geipert, 2007; Mathews,2005; Olson et al., 2006). Hostile people tend to have \"short fuses\" and areprone to get angry easily. How might anger and other negative emotions contribute to heart dis- ease? Although we can't be sure, investigators suspect that the stress hor-mones epinephrine and norepinephrine play significant roles (Januzzi &DeSanctis, 1999; Melani, 2001). Anxiety and anger trigger the release of thesestress hormones by the adrenal glands. These hormones increase heart rate,breathing rate, and blood pressure, which results in pumping more oxygen-rich blood to the muscles to enable them to prepare for defensive action\u2014to either fight or flee\u2014in the face of a threatening stressor. In people whofrequently experience strong negative emotions such as anger or anxiety, thebody may repeatedly pump out these stress hormones, eventually damagingthe heart and blood vessels. Evidence indicates that episodes of acute anger can actually trigger heart attacks and sudden cardiac death in some people with establishedheart disease (Clay, 2001a). We have also learned that people who arehigher in hostility tend to have more cardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity andsmoking, than do less hostile people (Bunde & Suls, 2006). Anxiety and anger may alsocompromise the cardiovascular system by increasing blood levels of cholesterol, thefatty substance that clogs arteries and increases the risk of heart attacks (Suinn, 2001). Emotions and the heart. Emotional stress in the form of persistent negative emotions, suchas anxiety and anger, is a risk factor in heart-related problems.Type A behavior pattern (TABP) A behavior pattern characterized by a sense oftime urgency, competitiveness, and hostility.162 Chapter 5 The patient's heart was failing (Sanders, 2006). She was only 45, but showed all the signs of having a heart attack. But it wasn't a heart attack. Were it a heart attack, there would have been blockage of blood flow through the arteries that service the heart. However, blood flowed freely to her heart. No, in this case, the woman's heart was failing because of the emotional shockof losing her husband in a car crash two days earlier. She had rushed to thecrash site and collapsed next to his body, crying inconsolably and trying desperately but unsuccessfully to wake him. Two days later she was rushed to the hospital complaining of chest pains and difficulty breathing. The doctors realized she was a victim of \"broken-heart sy ndrome,\" a potentially life threatening condition. Under high emotional stress, the body releases large amounts of the epinephrine and norepinephrine into the blood stream.Physicians suspect that in broken-heart sy ndrome, th ese hormones effectively \"stun\" the heart, preventing it from pumping normally (Wittstein et al., 2006). This woman's heart was pumping only a fraction of the expected amount of blood. Fortunately, the woman survived, as the levels of stress hormones receded and the heart returned to pumping at a nearly normal level. Later,she told a reporter, \"If anyone had told me that you could die of a brokenheart . . . I'd never have believed it. But I almost did\" (Sanders, 2006, p. 28). Fortunately, broken-heart sy ndrome is a rare occurrence, but it may explain cases of people who s uddenly die a few days or weeks following an emotional shock, such as the s udden death of a spouse. Patients with estab- lished coronary heart disease may be especially susceptible to coronary events in response to strong emotional stress (Strike et al., 2006).A CLOSER LOOK Dying of a Broken Heart Helping angry people learn to remain calm in provocative situations may have bene- ficial effects on the heart as well as the mind. Cognitive-behavioral therapies are availableto help chronically angry people better control their emotional responses to anxiety-provoking or angering situations (e.g., Deffenbacher et al., 2000). Along these lines, menwith CHD who received a hostility-reduction program showed less hostility and lowerblood pressures after treatment than did controls (Gidron, Davidson, & Bata, 1999). Investigators find additional links between coronary heart disease and other forms of emotional stress, including depression (Carney, Freedland, & Jaffe, 2001; Miller &Blackwell, 2006). In one research example, people without established heart diseasewho suffered from major depression were nearly four times more likely than nonde-pressed people to die from heart-related causes over a 4-year study period (Penninxet al., 2000). All in all, taking care of our emotional health may have additional bene-fits for our physical health. Social Environmental Stress Social environmental stress also appears to heighten the risk of CHD (Krantz et al., 1988). Such factors as overtime work, assembly-line labor,and exposure to conflicting demands are linked to increased risk of CHD (C. D.Jenkins, 1988). The stress-CHD connection is not straightforward, however. Forexample, the effects of demanding occupations may be moderated by factors such aspsychological hardiness and whether or not people find their work meaningful (Krantzet al., 1988). Other forms of stress are also linked to increased cardiovascular risk. Researchers in Sweden, for example, find that among women, marital stress triples the risk ofrecurrent cardiac events, including heart attacks and cardiac death (Foxhall, 2001;Orth-Gom\u00e9r et al., 2000). Ethnicity and CHD Coronary heart disease is not an equal opportunity destroyer. European Americans (non-Hispanic Whites) and African Americans (non-HispanicBlacks) have the highest rates of death due to coronary heart disease (see Figure 5.2).Factors such as obesity, smoking, diabetes, and hypertension play important roles indetermining relative risks of CHD and the rate of CHD-related deaths. For example,African Americans have higher rates of hypertension relative to other U.S. populationgroups (see Figure 5.3) as well as higher rates of obesity and diabetes. Moreover, a dualstandard of care limits access to quality health care for minority group members. BlackAmericans with CHD who suffer heart attacks typically receive less aggressive andpotentially lifesaving treatments than do Whites with CHD, which likely contributes totheir higher death rates (Chen et al., 2001; Stolberg, 2001). This dual standard of caremay reflect discrimination as well as cultural factors limiting utilization of services,such as African Americans' cultural mistrust toward the medical establishment.Stress, Psychological Factors, and Health 163 We finish this section with encouraging news. Americans have begun to take better care of their cardiovascular health. The incidence of CHD and deaths from heart dis-ease have been declining steadily during the past 50 years, thanks largely to reductionsin smoking, to improved treatment for coronary heart disease, and perhaps to otherlifestyle changes, such as reduced intake of dietary fat. Better-educated people are alsomore likely to modify unhealthful behavior patterns and reap the benefits of change.Is there a message here for you? Asthma Asthma is a respiratory disorder in which the main tubes of the windpipe\u2014thebronchi\u2014constrict and become inflamed, and large amounts of mucus are secreted.During asthma attacks, people wheeze, cough, and struggle to breathe in enough air.They may feel as though they are suffocating. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), an estimated 14 million adults and 5 million children in the United States are affected by asthma (CDC, 2001b,2004a). Rates of asthma are on the rise, having more than doubled over the past thirtyyears. Attacks can last from just a few minutes to several hours and vary notably inintensity. Series of attacks can harm the bronchial system, causing mucus to collect andmuscles to lose their elasticity. Sometimes the bronchial system is weakened to thepoint where a subsequent attack is lethal. Theoretical Perspectives Many causal factors are implicated in asthma, including allergic reactions; exposure to environmental pollutants, including cigarette smokeand smog; and genetic and immunological factors (Giembycz & O'Connor, 2000; VanEerdewegh et al., 2002). Asthmatic reactions in susceptible people can be triggered byexposure to allergens such as pollen, mold spores, and animal dander; by cold, dry air;and by emotional responses such as anger or even laughing too hard. Psychological fac-tors such as stress, anxiety, and depression can increase susceptibility to asthmaticattacks (Greengrass, 2002; Lehrer et al., 2002). Asthma, moreover, has psychologicalconsequences. Some sufferers avoid strenuous activity, including exercise, for fear ofincreasing their demand for oxygen and tripping attacks. Death Rates for Corronary Heart Disease (per 100,000 people) Asian/Pacific Islander: American Indian/Alaska Native: FIGURE 5.2 Coronary heart disease death rates in relation to race and ethnicity. Deaths due to CHD in our society fall disproportionately on White men and on Black (non-Hispanic) men and women. Source: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, Centers for Disease Control, February 16, 2001, 50(006), 90-93.164 Chapter 5 Treatment Although asthma cannot be cured, it can be controlled by reducing expo- sure to allergens, by desensitization therapy (\"allergy shots\") to help the body acquire more resistance to allergens, by use of inhalers, and by drugs that open bronchial passages during asthma attacks (called bronchodilators ) and others (called anti-inflammatories) that reduce future attacks by helping to keep bronchial tubes open (Sears et al., 2003;Sin et al., 2004). Psychological treatment may also help asthma sufferers apply the skillsof muscle relaxation to improve their breathing (Lehrer et al., 1994), and for asth-matic children, family therapy that helps reduce family conflict (Lehrer et al., 1992).Family co nflict is linked to increased rates of hospitalization for asthmatic children (Chen et al., 2003). Cancer The word cancer is arguably the most feared word in the English language, and rightly so: One of every four deaths in the United States is caused by cancer. Cancer claimsabout half a million lives in the United States annually, one every 90 seconds or so. Menhave a one in two chance of developing cancer at some point in their lives; for womenthe odds are one in three. Y et there is good news to report: The cancer death rate hasbeen inching downward in recent years, in large part due to better screening and treat-ment (Jemal et al., 2007). Cancer involves the development of aberrant, or mutant, cells that form growths (tumors) that spread to healthy tissue. Cancerous cells can take root anywhere\u2014theblood, the bones, lungs, digestive tract, and reproductive organs. When it is notcontained early, cancer may metastasize, or establish colonies throughout the body, leading to death.

African Americans have higher rates of hypertension, one of the key risk factors for heart attacksand strokes. Source: Adapted from Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics\u20142005 Update . American Heart Association, 2005.Stress, Psychological Factors, and Health 165 There are many causes of cancer, including genetic factors, exposure to cancer- causing chemicals, and even exposure to some viruses (Godtfredsen, Prescott, & Osler,2005; Samuels et al., 2004; Walsh et al., 2006). Unhealthy behavior patterns also con-tribute to the development of cancer, including dietary practices (high fat intake),heavy alcohol consumption, smoking, and excessive sun exposure (ultraviolet lightcauses skin cancer). On the other hand, daily intake of fruits and vegetables may lowerthe risk of some forms of cancer. Death rates from cancer are lower in Japan than inthe United States, where people ingest more fat, especially animal fat. The difference isnot genetic or racial, however, because Japanese Americans whose fat intake approxi-mates that of other Americans show similar death rates from cancer. Stress and Cancer A weakened or compromised immune system may increase sus- ceptibility to cancer. We've seen that psychological factors, such as exposure to stress,may affect the immune system. So it stands to reason that exposure to stress mightincrease a person's risk of developing cancer. However, evidence linking stress tocancer is inconclusive and requires further study (Delahanty & Baum, 2001; Dougall & Baum, 2001). On the other hand, we have learned that psychological interventions that focus on helping cancer patients cope with the disease, such as group support programs, canimprove their psychological adjustment and well-being (Helgeson, 2005; Taylor et al.,2003). It remains to be seen whether psychological interventions actually increase thelength of survival of patients suffering from cancer. Cancer patients may benefit from training programs that focus on developing coping skills, such as relaxation, stress management, and coping thoughts, to helprelieve the stress and pain of coping with cancer. Coping-skills training may also helpcancer patients deal with the unpleasant side effects of chemotherapy. Cues associ-ated with chemotherapy, such as the hospital environment itself, may become con-ditioned stimuli that elicit nausea and vomiting even before the drugs are adminis-tered. Pairing relaxation, pleasant imagery, and attentional distraction with thesecues can help reduce nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy (Redd &Jacobsen, 2001). Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV attacks the immune system, leaving it helpless to fend off diseases it normally would hold in check. HIV/AIDS is one of history's worstepidemics. Worldwide, more than 40 million people are infected with HIV (Hammeret al., 2006). HIV/AIDS has claimed more than 430,000 lives in the United States andsome 25 million lives worldwide. There are two primary reasons for including HIV/AIDS in our discussion of psy- chological factors in physical illness. First, people living with HIV/AIDS often developsignificant psychological problems in adjusting to living with the disease. Second,behavioral patterns such as unsafe sexual and injection practices play the dominantrole in determining the risk of contracting and transmitting the virus. HIV can be transmitted by sexual contact (vaginal and anal intercourse; oral-genital contact); direct infusion of contaminated blood, as from transfusions of contaminatedblood, accidental pricks from needles used previously on an infected person, or needlesharing among injecting drug users; and from an infected mother to a child during preg-nancy or childbirth or through breast-feeding. AIDS is not contracted by donatingblood; by airborne germs; by insects; or by casual contact, such as using public toilets,holding or hugging infected people, sharing eating utensils with them, or living or goingto school with them. Routine screening of the blood supply for HIV has reduced the riskof infection from blood transfusions to virtually nil. The majority of cases of HIV trans-mission worldwide involve heterosexual intercourse; in the United States, heterosexualintercourse accounts for 35% of new cases of HIV infections (CDC, 2004b). Compelling evidence now exists that psychotherapy can increase survival rates in cancer patients. FALSE. Evidence has not demonstrated\u2014not yet at least\u2014that psychological treatments increasesurvival rates of cancer patients. However, evidencedoes show that psychological treatment in the formof group therapy improves the emotional well-being of cancer patients.FICTION TRUTH or166 Chapter 5 AIDS support group. AIDS support groups offer emotional support and assistance to people with HIV/AIDS, their families, andtheir friends.There is no cure or vaccine for HIV infection, but the introduction of highly effec- tive antiretroviral drugs has revolutionized treatment of the disease, raising hopes thatit can become a chronic but manageable disease. However, hopes are tempered by thefact that many patients fail to benefit fully from antiviral drug combinations and by theemergence of some drug-resistant strains of the virus. The lack of a cure or effectivevaccine means that prevention programs focusing on reducing or eliminating riskysexual and injection practices represent our best hope for controlling the epidemic. Adjustment of People with HIV and AIDS Given the nature of the disease and the stigma suffered by people with HIV and AIDS, it is not surprising that manypeople with HIV , although certainly not all, develop psychological problems, mostcommonly anxiety and depression (Heckman et al., 2004; Morrison et al., 2002). Psychologists and other mental health professionals are involved in providing treatment services to people affected by HIV/AIDS. Coping-skills training andcognitive-behavioral therapy can help improve psychological functioning, abilityto handle stress, and quality of life among patients with HIV/AIDS and reducetheir feelings of depression and anxiety (Lechner et al, 2003; Lutgendorf et al.,1997). Treatment may incorporate training in stress-management techniques, suchas self-relaxation and positive mental imagery, and cognitive strategies to controlintrusive negative thoughts and preoccupations. The importance of stress man-agement skills is highlighted by findings that stressful life events and passivecoping (use of denial) were associated with faster progression to AIDS in HIV-infected men (Leserman et al., 2000). Antidepressant medication may also help patients with HIV/AIDS cope with a frequent emotional consequence of living with the disease\u2014depression. Whethertreatment of depression or stress management training can improve immunologicalfunctioning or prolong life in people with HIV and AIDS remains an open question. Psychological Interventions to Reduce Risky Behaviors Providing information about risk reduction alone is not sufficient to induce widespread changes in sexualbehavior. Despite awareness of the dangers, many people continue to practice unsafesexual and injection behaviors. Fortunately, psychological interventions are effective inhelping people alter these risky behaviors (e.g., Albarrac\u00edn, Durantini, & Ear, 2006;Carey et al., 2004). These programs raise people's awareness about risky behaviors andhelp them develop more adaptive behaviors, such as learning how to refuse invitations ADJUSTMENT TO PHYSICAL ILLNESS /HIV POSITIVE : The case of Julia \"You're born into society to groups or classes that are marginalized.\" Stress, Psychological Factors, and Health 167 to engage in unsafe sex and how to communicate effectively with one's partner(s) about safer sex. The likelihood of engaging in safer sex practices is also linked to theavoidance of alcohol and drugs before sex and to the perception that safer sex practicesrepresent the social norm (expected behavior) within one's peer group. Preventing AIDS For the first time, a generation of young people has come of age at a time when the threat of HIV/AIDS hangs over every sexual encounter. People maydecrease the risk of being infected by HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases(STDs) by taking the following measures. Only the first two are sure paths to avoidingthe sexual transmission of HIV . The others reduce the risk of infection, but cannot becertified as perfectly safe. For those who are going to be sexually active without know-ing (not guessing) whether their partner(s) are infected with HIV or some other STD,we can speak only of safe(r) sex\u2014not of perfectly safe sex. 1.Maintaining lifelong celibacy. 2.Remaining in a lifelong monogamous relationship with an uninfected person who is doing the same thing. Although these first two sexual career paths guarantee safety, they are not followed by the majority of students or other Americans. 3.Being discerning in one's choice of sex partners. Get to know another person before engaging in sexual activity. Still, getting to know a person is no guarantee theperson is uninfected with HIV . Avoid contact with multiple partners or withpeople who are likely to have multiple partners. 4.Being assertive with sex partners. It is important to communicate concerns about AIDS clearly and assertively with sex partners. 5.Inspecting one's partner's sex organs. There are no obvious signs of HIV infection, but people who are infected with HIV are often infected by other sexually trans-mitted diseases as well. It may be feasible to visually inspect your partner's sexorgans for rashes, chancres, blisters, discharges, warts, and lice during foreplay.Consider any disagreeable odor a warning sign. 6.Using latex condoms. Condoms protect men from infected vaginal fluids and stop infected semen from entering women. All condoms (including so-called naturalcondoms made of animal intestines or \"skins\") act as barriers to sperm, but onlylatex condoms can prevent transmission of HIV . 7.Using spermicides. Spermicides containing the ingredient nonoyxnol-9 kill HIV as well as sperm. Spermicides should be used along with latex condoms, not as a sub-stitute for condoms. 8.Consulting a physician following suspected exposure to a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Antibiotics following unprotected sex may guard against bacterial STDs, but they are of no use against viral STDs, such as genital herpes and HIV/AIDS.Consult with a physician before using any medications, including medications youmay have stored away in your medicine cabinet. 9.Seeking regular medical checkups. Checkups and appropriate laboratory tests enable you to learn about and treat disorders that might have gone unnoticed. 10.Avoiding sexual activity if there are doubts about safety. None of the safer sex practices listed guarantees protection. Why not avoid sexual activity when doubts of safety exist? In this chapter we focused on relationships between stress and health and on the psychological factors involved in health. Psychology has much to offer in the under- standing and treatment of physical disorders. Psychological approaches may help in the treatment of such physical disorders as headaches and coronary heart disease.Psychologists also help people reduce the risks of contracting health problems such ascardiovascular disorders, cancer, and AIDS. Emerging fields such as psychoneuroim-munology promise to further enhance our knowledge of the intricate relationshipsbetween mind and body.168 Chapter 5 Adjustment Disorders What are adjustment disorders? Adjustment disorders are maladaptive reactions to identified stressors. What are their features? Adjustment disorders are character- ized by emotional reactions that are greater than normallyexpected given the circumstances or by evidence of significantimpairment in functioning. Impairment usually takes the form ofproblems at work or school, or in social relationships or activities. Stress and Illness How is stress linked to physical illness? Evidence links expo- sure to stress to weakened immune system functioning, which inturn can increase vulnerability to physical illness. However,because this evidence is correlational, questions of cause andeffect remain. What is the general adaptation syndrome? This is the name given by Hans Selye to the generalized pattern of response ofthe body to persistent or enduring stress, as characterized bythree stages: the alarm reaction, the resistance stage, and theexhaustion stage. How are life changes related to physical health problems? Again, links are correlational, but evidence shows that peoplewho experience more life stress in the form of life changes anddaily hassles are at an increased risk of developing physicalhealth problems. What psychological factors buffer the effects of stress? These factors include coping styles, self-efficacy expectancies,psychological hardiness, optimism, and social support. Psychological Factors and Physical Disorders What roles do psychological factors play in the onset ofheadaches and their treatment? The most common headache is the muscle-tension headache, which is often stress related.Behavioral methods of relaxation training and biofeedback areof help in treating various types of headaches. What behavioral or lifestyle factors increase the risk of coro- nary heart disease? Psychological factors that increase the risk of coronary heart disease include patterns of consumption,leading a sedentary lifestyle, and persistent negative emotions. What role do psychological factors play in asthma? Psychological factors such as stress, anxiety, and depression may trigger asthma attacks in susceptible individuals. What role do psychological factors play in the develop- ment of cancer and its treatment? Although relationships between stress and risk of cancer remain under study, behav-ioral risk factors for cancer include dietary practices (espe-cially high fat intake), heavy alcohol use, smoking, and exces- sive sun exposure. Psychological interventions help cancerpatients cope better with the symptoms of the disease and itstreatment. What roles do psychologists play in the p revention of HIV/ AIDS and treatment of people with HIV? Our behavior patterns influence our risk for contracting HIV . Psychologists have becomeinvolved in the prevention and treatment of AIDS because AIDS,like cancer, can have devastating psychological effects on victims,their families and friends, and society at large, and because AIDScan be prevented through reducing risky behavior. Scoring Key for The College Life Stress Inventory. Although we have no national norms by which to compare your score, the testdevelopers obtained an average (mean) score of 1,247 based on asample of 257 introductory psychology students. About two ofthree students obtained scores in the range of 806 to 1,688. Computing your total score helps you gauge how you compare to the students in the original study sample in terms of youroverall stress level. Bear in mind, however, that the same level ofstress may affect different people differently. Y our ability to copewith stress depends on many factors, including your copingskills and the level of social support you have available. If youare experiencing a high level of stress, you may wish to examinethe sources of stress in your life. Perhaps you can reduce the levelof stress you experience or learn more effective ways of handlingthe sources of stress you can't avoid. Scoring Key for The Life Orientation Test. T o arrive at your total score for the test, first reverse your score on items 3, 8, 9, and 12. That is, 4 is changed to 0 3 is changed to 12 remains the same1 is changed to 30 is changed to 4 Now add the numbers of items 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12. (Items 2, 6, 7, and 10 are \"fillers\"; that is, your responses are not scoredas part of the test.) Y our total score can vary from 0 to 32. Scheier and Carver (1985) provide the following norms for the test, based on administration to 357 undergraduate men and267 undergraduate women. The average (mean) score for menwas 21.03 (standard deviation =4.56), and the mean score for women was 21.41 (standard deviation =5.22). All in all, approx- imately 2 out of 3 undergraduates obtained scores between16 and 26. Scores above 26 may be considered quite optimistic,and scores below 16 quite pessimistic. Scores between 16 and 26are within a broad average range, and higher scores within thisrange are relatively more optimistic.SUMMING UPStress, Psychological Factors, and Health 169 KEY TERMS health psychologist (p. 141) stress (p. 142) stressor (p. 142) adjustment disorder (p. 142) endocrine system (p. 144) hormones (p. 144) immune system (p. 145) general adaptation syndrome (GAS)(p. 147)alarm reaction (p. 147) fight-or-flight reaction (p. 147) resistance stage (p. 148) exhaustion stage (p. 149) acculturative stress (p. 150) emotion-focused coping (p. 154) problem-focused coping (p. 154) self-efficacy expectancies (p. 154) psychological hardiness (p. 155)positive psychology (p. 156) psychosomatic (p. 159) biofeedback training (BFT) (p. 160) cardiovascular disease (p. 160) Type A behavior pattern (TABP) (p. 161) MEDIA TOOLS A variety of digital and online learning tools are available to enrich your learning experience and help you succeed in thecourse.
