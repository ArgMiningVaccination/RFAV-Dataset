The CHNA was developed in accordance with all federal rules and statues, specifically, PL 111 -148 (the Affordable Care Act) which added Section 501(r) to the Internal Revenue Code. The MMCSC Needs Assessment was undertaken in this context and developed for the purpose of enhancing health an d quality of life throughout the community. This assessment builds upon the CHNA completed in 201 6. The 201 6 Implementation Plan results are reviewed in Appendix A. The CHNA uses detailed secondary public health data at state, county, and community levels, a community health survey, and focus groups with other community stakeholders. MMCSC is a member of RWJ Barnabas Health, which convenes a multi - disciplinary, multi -facility Steering Committee that provides additional support and leadership. Also, insight and expertise from the Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus CHNA Local Oversight Committee helps to identify health assets, gaps, dispa rities, trends, and priorities. The Methodology section details the data collection process and analysis. Service Area The service area is determined by considering three factors: patient origin, market reliance on the Hospital ( market share ), and ge ographic continuity and proximity. Zip codes representing approximately 50% of the MMCSC patient origin form the initial primary service area (PSA); any zip code in which the Hospital has a high market share presence is also included. Zip codes with low er market share are deleted from the PSA definition and included in the secondary service area (SSA). Geographic proximity is used to create a contiguous area and completes the service area determination. MMCSC 's PSA is predominantly located in t he northern section of Ocean County . The SSA is comprised of other sections in the central and southern areas of the county . For purposes of this assessment, Ocean County , MMCSC 's home county, was selected to best represent communities served by the Medical Center in reviewing data sources presented at the county level . MMCSC Primary Service Area ZIP Code ZIP Name 07727 07731 Howell Manchester 08754 Toms River 08756 Toms River ES-2 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus TOP HEALTH ISSUES The MMCSC Oversight Committee considered primary and secondary data to determine top health issues based on capacity, resources, competencies, and needs specific to the populations it serves. These issues are within the Hospital's purview, competency and resources to impact in a meaningful manner: substance abuse , management of chronic diseases : heart disease , diabetes and cancer . 1. Substance Abuse Substance abuse refers to a set of related conditions associated with the consumption of mind - and behavior -altering substances that have negative behavioral and health outcomes. Risk factors for substance abuse are similar to mental health conditions and also include poverty and drug availability. Substance abuse has a major impact on individuals, families, and communities. The effects of substance abuse are cumulative, significantly contributing to costly social, physical, mental, and public health problems. Approximately 10% of American's suffer from a drug abuse problem. Despite a steady decline of drug addiction in the early 2000's substance abuse has increased dramatically in over the past decade . The pervasive use of drugs stems from a variety of factors including the increase availability of drugs. Alterations in brain chemistry caused by prescription and street drugs, as well as untreated emotiona l and psychological conditions that lead to drug experimentation. Behavioral health disparities impact diverse groups in the U.S., including racial and ethnic groups, young adults, women, and the LGBTQIA community. There is stigma associated with mental health diagnosis and treatment, particularly among African -Americans and Latinos. Behavioral health plays a major role in one's ability to maintain good physical health. Problems with physical health, such as chronic diseases, can have a serious impact o n mental health and decrease a person's ability to participate in treatment and recovery. Of late, the issue of opioid misuse and addiction has captured the attention of federal and state governments, leading to the U.S. President declaring the opioid cri sis a public health emergency. To help clarify some of the reasons for this decision, the National Institute on Drug Abuse has estimated that 115 people a day die as a result of an opioid overdose. In 2014 alone, AHQR reported New Jersey had the 6th high est rate of emergency room visits for opioids (265.4/100,000 population). Between 2014 and 2016, there was a 40% rise in the number of deaths as a result of drug overdoses in the State. The majority of the victims had heroin or fentanyl in their systems. To help combat this issue, New Jersey announced a statewide initiative to help combat the opioid crisis. One of the initiatives will include a 24 -hour response team which will include first responders, mental health advocates, substance abuse counselors specially trained in dealing with addiction, and a beefed - up prescription monitoring program funded by more than a million dollars in federal grants. In 2016, there was a higher percentage of binge drinkers in Ocean County (16.4%) than the County Health Ranking benchmark (12.0%). Alcohol -impaired driving deaths were 24.3% compared to the County Health Ranking benchmark of 13.0% In 2016, 49.4% of primary drug treatment admissions for heroin compared to 43.4% statewide . The number of opioid dispensations reached more than 75% of the County's population. ES-3 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus Drug overdose deaths increased from 134 in 2014, to 242 in 2016. Naloxone administrations increased from 624 in 2015, to 977 in 2016. MMCSC patients have access to an array of prevention, int ervention and substance use disorder services through the RWJBarnabas Health Institute for Prevention and Recovery (IFPR) is a leader in New Jersey for substance use disorder, focused prevention, and recovery services. IFPR has almost 30 years of experien ce providing programs and services implemented by a team of highly skilled professionals. Through comprehensive programs offered across NJ, IFPR perpetuates real change by facilitating effective, long -term impact which creates prevention and recovery prep ared communities. IFPR is also recognized for its tobacco cessation services, as well as its Training Institute. 2. Management of Chronic Diseases (1) Cardiovascular Disease Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women of most ethnicities, causing 1 in every 4 deaths in the United States. Cardiovascular disease refers to a constellation of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels. These conditions are caused by the failure of valves or muscle of the heart and are worsened by blockage of veins and arteries. Some of the most prevalent types of heart disease include coronary artery disease, heart attack, heart failure, congenital heart diseases, and stroke. Comor bid conditions include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. Each of these conditions contribute to and exacerbate cardiovascular disease by diminishing blood vessel function. High blood pressure is usually asymptomatic but damages the heart , kidneys, and brain. High levels of LDL cholesterol can build up in blood vessels, eventually causing fatal blockages. Nearly two -thirds of diabetics die from some form of heart vessel disease. All three comorbidities are preventable and can be contained by changing behavioral risk factors. Coronary artery disease, the most common type of cardiovascular disease, causes more than 370,000 deaths annually.2 In 2012, this condition alone cost the United States $444 billion, with annual increases projected. H eart failure kills more than 177,000 people every year and poses a significant economic burden. Older Americans are hospitalized for heart failure more than any other age group. As the nation's population skews older in coming decades, the cost of heart fa ilure is projected to triple by 2030. While some risk factors for heart disease (age, family history, male gender, post -menopause, race) cannot be altered, lifestyle changes minimize health conditions associated with heart disease, thereby lowering the li kelihood of onset. Obesity increases cholesterol, elevates blood pressure levels, and causes diabetes, all comorbid conditions of heart disease. Healthy eating and exercise can lead to a healthy weight and lower the risk of heart disease. Physical inacti vity leads to high blood pressure, high triglyceride levels, low levels of HDL cholesterol, diabetes, and obesity. Regular physical activity can improve these measures. Dietary choices can also increase one's risk of heart disease and obesity. Diets high in saturated fats and cholesterol raise blood cholesterol levels and promote atherosclerosis. Diets high in salt content can raise blood pressure levels. Excessive alcohol use leads to increased blood pressure and higher levels of triglycerides. Cigarett e smoking increase the risk of developing heart disease and heart attack by 2 to 4 times by increasing blood pressure and promoting atherosclerosis. Second -hand smoke can increase the risk of heart disease to non -smokers as well.3 2 www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm 3 www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/behavior.htm ES-4 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the nation, New Jersey and Ocean County. Between 201 4 and 201 6, the Ocean County age -adjusted mortality rate decreased for deaths due to heart disease but remain ed higher than statewide and surrounding counties. Between 20 11 and 201 5, the percent of Ocean County adult residents reported high blood pressure decreased 4.8 percentage points, from 38.4 % to 33.6% , but remained above the Healthy People 2020 target of 26.9%. Adults with high cholesterol in Ocean County w ere nearly 40% of the population. Cardiovascular disease and related illnesses (high blood pressure, diabetes, and stroke) are prevalent among MMCSC service area residents. Cardiovascular disease was identified in a survey of local heath officers as one of the top six health -related concer ns in the primary service area. Service area residents also identified cardiovascular disease as a key health concern in a Bruno & Ridgway survey. Many chronic diseases are caused by a short list of risk behaviors including tobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke; poor nutrition, including diets low in fruits and vegetables and high in sodium and saturated fats; lack of physical activity; and excessive alcohol use. MMCSC addresses the risk factors associated with and the effects of cardiovascular il lness. MMCSC provides COPD, obesity, high blood pressure, cancer, and cardiac disease screenings. Health education lectures developed collaboratively with local Health Departments, Boards of Education, libraries, and professional and community organization s are available to the community. The Heart Center at MMCSC earned disease -specific Joint Commission Certification for Heart Failure, Acute Coronary Syndrome, and Cardiac Rehabilitation. (2) Diabetes Chronic diseases are non -communicable, prolonged in d uration and rarely completely cured. Chronic illness is a significant driver of the national burden of disease and associated costs. Approximately 6 in 10 Americans live with at least one chronic health condition. Chronic diseases are responsible for 70% o f deaths in the United States and treatment accounts for 86% of healthcare costs.4 Individuals living with severe chronic illness are heavy users of acute hospital services; better coordination of care can potentially improve health outcomes while reducing hospital use.5 Common chronic conditions include heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes and arthritis. Diabetes is a disease in which blood glucose levels are elevated due to abnormal insulin levels. Type 1 diabetes does not allow the body to produce insulin. Type 2 diabetes, the more common disease type, inhibits the body from optimally making or using insulin. Without adequate insulin, glucose remains in the bloodstream and over time, excess blood glucose can cause serious problems, including damag ing the eyes, kidneys, and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and amputation. Pregnant women may develop gestational diabetes. Based on the latest BRFSS survey, the percent of Ocean County residents told they had diabetes decreased fr om 9.9% in 2011, to 6.6% in 2016. 4 http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/ 5 http://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472 -6963 -13-164 ES-5 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus Diabetes is a contributing factor to renal failure. In 2016, the rate of Ocean County residents using a hospital service for renal failure was higher than the State rate. The percent of Ocean County residents with a BMI o f >= 30 trended upward from 26.8 % in 201 2, to 28.8 % in 2016. Within Ocean County, the percent of adults reporting no leisure -time physical activity trended upward from 25.5 % in 2014 , to 24.8 % in 2016. Educating those that have diabetes or who are at risk for diabetes is the goal of MMCSC's Diabetes Education Program. Recently awarded the prestigious American Diabetes Association (ADA) Education Recognition Certificate, the program is now certified by the ADA as offering a high -quality diabetes self - manage ment that is an essential component of effective diabetes treatment. The program is taught by certified diabetes educators who are also registered nurses and dieticians. Participants receive assistance with glucose monitors, receive nutritional information and advice with meal planning, and learn about treatment options. (3) Cancer Care Cancer, the second leading cause of death in the United States, causes approximately 1,600 deaths per day. The disease initiates with unrestrained and abnormal cell growth and spreads via the blood and lymph systems. Cancer is caused by gene mutations that affect how cells grow and divide. Mutations can be inherited or caused by environmental and lifestyle factors. In 2011, the Agency fo r Healthcare Research and Quality estimated the cost of cancer in the United States totaled $88.7 billion, with increases projected. There are over 100 different types of cancers, but lung, colorectal, and breast cancers carried the heaviest economic burde n. Lung, colorectal, and breast cancers are also responsible for high disability - adjusted life years (DALYs). Prevention, early detection, and treatment of common cancers yield economic benefits as treating late - stage cancer is more expensive than treatin g early -stage cancer. Late -stage breast cancer treatment costs three times more than management of early -stage disease. Screening for cervical, breast and colorectal cancers helps detect disease at an early and treatable stage. Vaccines to prevent Hepatit is B (HBV) and HPV are critical to prevention of liver and cervical cancers. Lifestyle -related health behaviors, such as tobacco use, diet, and physical activity can also be modified to reduce risk. The elderly are at greater risk for developing cancer t han younger age cohorts. The median age of cancer diagnoses is 66, with persons aged 65 -74 having a 1 in 4 chance of developing the disease. Between 5 - 10% of all cancer cases can be attributed to genetic defects and the remaining 90 -95% attributed to envir onmental and lifestyle factors. While genetics like age and family history cannot be manipulated, most other major risk factors and lifestyle choices can be changed. Obesity increases the risk of several cancers; physical activity and nutritious eating c an help bring about a healthy weight. One study of severely obese people found significant weight loss reduced risk by one - third. Obesity is associated with increased risks for many types of cancer including breast, colon, endometrial, esophagus, kidney, p ancreas, gall bladder, thyroid, ovary, cervix, prostate, multiple myeloma and lymphoma.6 6 Retrieved from www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/obesity/facts.htm . ES-6 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus Carcinogens are substances that are responsible for damaging DNA, promoting and aiding cancer. Tobacco, asbestos, radiation (gamma and x -rays), the sun, a nd car exhaust fumes are well known carcinogens. The rate of breast cancer is greatly increased when women have excess estrogen levels for a prolonged time period. Viruses that weaken the ability of the immune system to fight infection (HPV, Hepatitis B an d C, Epstein -Barr, HIV) and immunosuppressive drugs are also linked to an increased risk. Between 20 07 and 201 6, the age -adjusted mortality rate for cancer in Ocean County decreased from 200.2 /100,000 to 162.6 /100,000. 7 o The 201 6 Ocean County cancer morta lity rate was higher than the New Jersey AAMR of 148.3 /100,000 and higher than Monmouth County . In 201 6, 68.0 % of Ocean County adults 50+ had a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, higher than New Jersey ( 65.1 %). In 201 6, 79.9 % of Ocean County women 40+ reporte d having a mammogram screening within the past 2 years, compared to 77 .3% in New Jersey.8 In 201 6, in Ocean County, 73.4 % of women aged 18 and older had a pap smear within the last three years, compared to 7 4.5% in New Jersey.9 In 2016, the overall incidence of cancer in Ocean County (509.4/100,000) was higher than the State and Monmouth County rates. In the Community Health S urvey, cancer was identified as one of the top five health -related concerns in the primary service area. MMCSC presents comm unity lectures addressing cancer prevention. Health education is supplemented with screenings for lung, breast, prostate, oral, cervical (PAP smear), and skin cancer. Screenings and lectures are collaborative efforts with local Health Departments, Boards o f Education, libraries, and professional and community organizations. MMCSC is accredited by the American College of Radiation Oncology and The American College of Surgeons. The staff at MMCSC's Cancer Center includes dieticians, hospice liaison nurses, m edical oncologists, medical physicists, nurse educators, oncology -certified nurses, pastoral care, pathologists, radiation oncologists, radiation therapists, social workers (bilingual available), and surgical oncologists. 7 ibid 8 County Health Rankings 2016 http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/new -jersey/2016/measure/factors/50/data 9 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2012 1 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus 1. INTRODUCTION MMCSC Service Area The Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus (MMCSC ) Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) is designed to ensure that the Medical Center continues to effectively and efficiently serve the health needs of its service area. The CHNA was developed in accordance with all federal rules and statues, specific ally, PL 111 -148 (the Affordable Care Act) which added Section 501(r) to the Internal Revenue Code. The MMCSC Needs Assessment was undertaken in this context and developed for the purpose of enhancing health and quality of life throughout the community. This assessment builds upon the CHNA completed in 201 6. The 2016 Implementation Plan results are reviewed in Appendix A. The CHNA uses detailed secondary public health data at state, county, and community levels, a community health survey, and focus groups with other community stakeholders. MMCSC is a member of RWJ Barnabas Health, which convenes a multi -disciplinary, multi -facility Steering Committee that provides additional support and leadership. Also, in sight and expertise from the Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus CHNA Oversight Committee helps to identify health assets, gaps, disparities, trends, and priorities. The Methodology section details the data collection process and analysis. Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus , loca ted in Lakewood , New Jersey , is one of four acute c are hospitals operating in Ocean County . MMCSC is an affiliate of RWJ Barnabas Health. The Medical Center's primary service area encompasses 12 zip codes that are part of the northern area in the County. Municipalities in Central and Southern Ocean County comprise the Secondary Service Area (SSA) . The MMCSC Oversight Committee determined a number of priority issues to be within the Hospital's purview, competency and resources to impact in a meaningful manner . These included substance abuse, chronic disease management : heart disease , diabetes and ca ncer . The CHNA uses detailed secondary public health data at state, county, and community levels , from various sources including Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Census Bureau, Healthy People 2020 , the County Health Rankings, and hospital discharge data, to name a few. 2 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus Healthy People 2020 is a 10 -year agenda to improve the nation's health that encompasses the entire continuum of prevention and care. For over three decades Healthy People has establishe d benchmarks and monitored progress over time to measure the impact of prevention activities. Healthy People 2020 benchmarks are used throughout the report to assess the health status of residents. The County Health Rankings, published by the University o f Wisconsin Population Health Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, rank the health of nearly all counties in the United States. The rankings look at a variety of measures that affect health such as high school graduation rates, air pollution levels, income, rates of obesity and smoking, etc. These rankings are also used throughout the report to measure the overall health of Ocean County residents. County rates are also compared to statewide rates. The MMCSC needs assessment was developed for the purpose of enhancing the health and quality of life throughout the community. To this end, both internal and external data were used to understand recent health indicators and opportunities to provide a positive impact on health and wellness. Oth er significant needs determined by this CHNA include: Mental Health Access to Care Language/Cultural Barriers Access to Specialty Care Services Access to Physicians Maternal/Child Health Awareness of Resources 3 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus 2. METHODOLOGY/SERVICE AREA A. METHODOLOGY Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus (MMCSC ) developed an evidenced -based process to determine the health needs of Ocean County residents. CHNA data sources include both primary and secondary data to provide qualitative and quantitative information about the communities. Data from these sources we re reviewed with the Steering Committee to identify and prioritize the top issues facing residents in the service area (see Top Health Issues section). The flow chart below identifies the CHNA and implementation planning process employed. Prioritiz ation Process Following the Steering Committee's review of quantitative and qualitative data on April 30, 2019, a list of 11 issues were identified by consultants as common themes of the research. These issues became the suggested priority issues and inc luded: Mental Health Substance Abuse Cancer Awareness of Resources Maternal & Child Health Access to Specialty Care Services Heart Disease 4 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus Diabetes Access to Physicians A ballot was developed, and a survey sent in August 2019 to member s of the local Stee ring Committee asking them to rank each issue based on the following criteria. Number of people impacted Risk of mortality and morbidity associated with the problem Impact of the problem on vulnerable populations Meaningful progress can be made within a three -year timeframe Community's capability and competency to impact A tally of the ballots cast resulted in the following five issues to be ranked highest overall. Substance Abuse Heart Disease Diabetes Cancer Mental Health Rankings were also developed and weighted for each prioritization criterion. Members of the Hospital's Executive Committee met to discuss and determine the priority/priorities it would undertake for the next three years. They agreed that for the next three years the Hospital would work on the following top priority areas : Substance Abuse Chronic Disease Management o Heart Disease o Diabetes o Cancer Primary Data Sources Community Health Needs Surveys In order to obtain a service area -specific analysis for the MMCSC service area, on -line survey Interviews were conducted among 512 residents of the Hospital's PSA. Interviews were conducted online and by telephone. A link to the online survey was displayed on hospital web pages and social media sites. Additionally, postcards were handed out at area businesses and libraries, directi ng residents to the online survey link. Focus Group Discussions Two focus groups were undertaken to uncover additional information from key community groups and individuals with respect to health needs, challenges and barriers, and suggestions for imp roving access to health care. MMCSC Focus Group Report is found in Section 4. (See Section 4) Focus group meetings were 5 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus conducted on July 8, 2019 by New Solutions, Inc . and included representatives of Hasidic population and those representing low income m inority populations. Secondary Data Sources Over 100 secondary data sources are compiled in this CHNA, presenting data by indicator by county and state. Sources include: The United States Census Bureau, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH), and B ehavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). See Appendix B for a detailed list of sources. Appendix C contains a detailed report of cancer incidence and mortality by cancer site for Ocean County for the years 2010 -2017. In addition, hospital tum or registry data is utilized to understand stage of cancer at time of diagnosis. Health Profile Section 5 provides a comprehensive presentation of health outcomes as well as the social determinants of health and other health factors that contribute to the health and well -being of Ocean County residents. Color Indicator Tables Throughout the Health Profile Section of this CHNA, the color indicator tables compare county level data to Healthy People 2020 targets, County Health Rankings benchmarks, and New Jersey State data. Data by race/ethnicity are compared to data for all race s in the county, unless otherwise indicated. Ocean County was the midpoint value compared to a range 20% higher than the value for New Jersey, Healthy People 2020 , or County Health Rankings Benchmarks, or 20% lower than the value for New Jersey, Healthy People 2020 , or County Health Rankings Benchmarks. If the county value was within the range 20% lower or 20% higher than the comparison indicator, or considered wit hin reasonable range, the indicator will be yellow. The table will be red if the Ocean County value is more than 20% worse or lower than the indicator value. If the Ocean County value is 20% better or higher than the indicator value, the table will be gree n. Comparative counties are also presented providing additional context for select health indicators. Assets and Gaps Section 6, Assets and Gaps, summarizes the preceding components of the CHNA. Assets highlight county information indicating improvement over time, in comparison to other counties and the State, or in comparison to other races or genders. Gaps focus on disparities in Ocean County or the MMCSC Service Area that have a negative trend, in comparison to other counties in the State or to other races or genders. Resource Inventory A service area -specific resource inventory is included as Appendix D, which details health and social service resources available to residents in Ocean County . Providers' names, addresses, and phone numbers and type of services provided are contained in the inventory. 6 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus B. SERVICE AREA Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus is located in Lakewood , New Jersey. It is one of four hospitals serving residents in Ocean County . The Medical Center 's primary service area (PSA) consists of the following zip codes: MMCSC Service Area Map The service area is determined by taking into consideration three factors: patient origin, market reliance on the Hospital (market share ), and geographic continuity/proximity. Typically, the combined service area represents 75 -80% of the Medical Center's patients. Zips codes represe nting approximately 50% of the MMCSC patient origin form the initial PSA. Added to this list is any zip code in which the Medical Center has a high market share presence , any zip code with low er market share is deleted from the PSA definition and becomes part of the secondary service area (SSA) . The next range of zip codes comprise the SSA. Geographic proximity is used to create a contiguous area completes the service area determination. MMCSC 's PSA is predominantly located in t he northern portion of Ocean County . The SSA is comprised of other sections in the central and southern areas of the county . For purposes of this assessment, Ocean County , MMCSC 's home county, was selected to best represent the communities served by the Hospital in terms of county level data . Most of the secondary data in this report is based on county level data.

FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSION A. MINORITY POPULATIONS FOCUS GROUP On July 8, 2019, a focus group was held at Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus with seven community members representing minority populations in the region. Participants were asked about the health status, needs and barriers to care for minority populations. MOST PRESSING HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES When asked about the most pressing health or mental health issues facing the community, most mentioned that the minority community did not have a good working knowle dge of the resources that were available to them and as a result were using or expecting the Hospital to be the one -stop shop for all their needs. In addition to not knowing who to reach out to for help, minority populations fear they may not be welcomed. This fact is oftentimes a barrier to the receipt of services. \"You have a lot of people that have health issues like high blood pressure, diabetes and they just need help and counseling to understand what they need to do. There is no one they can reach out to and feel comfortable reaching out.\" \"How can we begin to connect people with a resource in the community, so they don't have to worry about going to the hospital . . . but going to someone they trust . . .\" MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES Misconceptions and stigmas around mental health are often barriers to the receipt of mental health services. Other barriers included a lack of understanding about how to access and navigate the system. Participants also talked about the life crises many minority communitie s faced and how these issues impacted residents' health and mental health. \"There's a lot of misconceptions about mental health and I think it exists at every social level, but even more so when you have low socioeconomic conditions . . . when there's a lo t of poverty.\" \"You know the major illnesses facing our community are depression, anxiety and fear. Those are the three major health issues in this community because everything else stems from that. The anxiety of not being able to take my child to a saf e school where they will be fed.\" \"I've had to dispel a lot of things because there's a lot of fear to request help. They don't want their child labeled in Special Education. They don't want this, they don't want that, and then they suffer alone, and you see parents feeling guilty. A lot of guilty parenting happens because they just don't understand why a child would behave a certain way and what kinds of things are producing these behaviors.\" \"They need navigators, they literally need someone to make phone calls because they don't even know how to articulate why they are making an appointment. So, they really need a lot of physical, logistical and emotional support.\" BARRIERS ACCESSING SERVICES Participants also talked about barriers that residents had in accessing services including transportation and the need for mobile services that could be brought to the community. \"A lot of places people are referred to are up north. How are they supposed to get there? Taxi rides are expensive.\" 52 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus \"I know they have companies that transport, but a lot of them (community residents) have no idea how to fill out the paperwork to set up the appointment.\" \"That's another reason why the emergency rooms are so impacted, because folks have no other place to go.\" Others mentioned the fact that there were available resources through sites and mobile vans operated by Ocean Health Initiatives, school -based health services programs, as well as services provided by the Ocean County Department of Health, especially with regard to flu clinics, mobile vans, screenings and annual health fairs. While it was acknowledged that these services were available, it was also mentioned that it was often difficult to get the community to come out to utilize these services. \"And yes, i t's difficult to get the community to come out and to come to these things. You are afraid , you have trust issues, you have areas where people are afraid to come out and do the things they need to, to better themselves. And a lot of time they just need t o have someone to help them, give them a little come on, let's go here. It takes a hands -on approach , but it has to be done.\" COMMUNITIES NOT BEING SERVED Asked if there were consumers not being served, the overwhelming response was about homeless popul ations and the lack of available services for the homeless of Ocean County. Many stories were offered about the health issues facing these individuals and the lack of resources available to meet their most basic needs for food, shelter and clothing. \"Ther e's a large population of people that lives on the train tracks in Lakewood , it's like they're in a different world.\" \"We had a family call our church line and there were no resources to help them in this community. Every place I called to try to help the m was saying we don't' do that. If there's not an infant there is nothing we can do.\" \"I've seen or heard that people are put up in a hotel for a few days, but that's the limit. And after that, where do you go?\" A lot of folks are not going to come out o f those woods because of a lack of trust, because what's going to happen to them if they do? ( the undocumented)\" POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS When asked what needs to be done to solve some of the health and mental health problems in the community, most representa tives talked about communication and working with each other to share existing resources and developing others. Respondents also suggested reimag ining the ED as an information and referral service. \"So how do we communicate with the agency so we can come together? What would it look like if you reached out to all the churches in the community and we all helped you find not only the financial means to finish the building (church property to be renovated and used for community purposes), but also worke d together collectively? How do we apply for grants so that the government and state agencies realize these people are addressing a need not to maintain the so - called 'needy community', but help them get out of that situation?\" \"Even in a position of lead ership, we are the minority and it's time that we take those blinders off and learn how to work together. I would love that we could connect and find ways to help the community thrive in all its assets.\" \"So, in what ways can we partner? We need to partn er!\" 53 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus \"Let's see how we can connect from this day forward. Let's see how we can help one another. I didn't even know Pastor was over there and I should have, so now I know you are out there and I'm going to reach out. It's not about how many members you have or how many I have ; it's about reaching the community and helping the community get to a better place.\" \"Perhaps once a month or a quarter something could be sent to the churches about what's available or what's coming up so we can announce it on Sund ays or the days we have Bible Study.\" \"So, what would it look like if instead of going to individual churches we have a community -wide event? Music of all cultures, food and then tables with all of the resources and then have in intervals \"bright spots \" - this organization is here for this, and you have these commercials about what each organization can offer.\" \"I'm just thinking about it, I feel like the theme is communications, breaking down communication . . . many people, even those who are poor have p hones. Apps are the way to go when it comes to communications now. And there's just so much technology out there to bring so many people together . . . I don't know where it would be sponsored from (on -line resource directory) but it has to be a communi cation platform that is easily and readily accessible to leaders and members. At least leaders could promote it and its ease of use.\" \"If we want to think out of the box, why does the emergency department have to be the emergency department? Why not have other tracts for when it's not an emergency? It's a place of trust already and people come here but it's expensive , a burden - why not turn that into an opportunity. A person in the ED that would be a liaison to the different resources people need.\" MEETING CONSUMERS NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS There was a great deal of divergence of opinions regarding how to meet the needs and expectations of minority populations. Some felt that this population had few expectations because of their belief that things wo uld not change. Others believed that most were looking for respect or woke each morning with faith and hope that something good would happen. Participants did not believe that minority populations were treated respectfully. \"You have to treat people kind and nice, not be afraid of folks. You can't be afraid to help someone if they don't look or smell like you. You can't be afraid to help them.\" \"I don't think people are treated with respect. Because when people come in, they're not received properly . . . If you're hurting and you want help, you don't need someone to be nasty to you.\" \"I think that one of the greatest barriers two of them actually , in our community is the misconception that people are poor or are homeless, or lack health because they want to. It's not they want to be there, and they don't actually want to be helped. They want to be acknowledged as able -bodied human beings that want to strive and thrive.\" \". . . the people want to know you're there to help them. They want to feel lov e and trust.\" SERVICES THAT ARE HARD TO OBTAIN Participants were most troubled by the lack of shelters for homeless people and families. While it was acknowledged that heating and cooling centers were available for emergencies, there were no services to shelter adults in need of housing. Most participants agreed that basic services for homeless - showers and a bed to sleep in were the most difficult services to find in the community. Other needs mentioned included mental health care needs for children. Community representatives said that getting parents support to help with their child's issues is often frustrating because parents are dealing with their own 54 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus crises and are not proactive about educating themselves through workshops. More often helping p arents individually through the crisis has worked more effectively but is time -consuming and expensive. \"Play -based therapy for younger children. We are finding a lot of mental health needs. A lot of social emotional needs.\" \"The uninsured are not gettin g anything. How do we get these kids, who have been victims of domestic violence and severe PTSD issues , services? If I d idn't get these kids services, they would be suspended daily because of their aggression.\" \"We have no shelters. We'll shelter dogs . . . before we will shelter and house people. I just have an issue with that.\" HEALTHY HABITS Most participants felt that people were aware of the importance of eating healthy, but their life situations were often not stable enough for th em to commit to that type of lifestyle. \"Many of migrant populations are resourceful and come from agricultural countries where they grow vegetables and they'll have their local gardens, if they are in a stable situation.\" \"A lot of teen Moms have to be ta ught how to shop. What to get. This generation wants quick ; anything you can pop in the microwave and be done.\" B. ORTHODOX JEWISH COMMUNITY FOCUS GROUP On the afternoon of July 8, 2019, a second focus group made up of individuals representing Orthodox Jewish organizations came together to discuss their health needs, barriers to the receipt of services, and ideas to improve the health of their community. A follow -up interview was conducted on August 1, 2019 to obtain additional ins ights into these topic areas. MOST PRESSING ISSUES When asked about the most pressing problems faced by the community, most agreed that being one of the largest growing populations in New Jersey and having minimal pediatric services and no obstetrical services was problematic and concerning for them. As described by participants, the lack of obstetrical services at MMCSC meant they had no options locally and had to leave the area to deliver in Long Branch, New Brunswick, Brick or Hackensack (places where most obstetricians they use practice). Participants believed pediatric specialty care services were insufficient to meet the needs of the 30,000 school -aged children living in Lakewood . Participants also felt it would be beneficial for the Hospital, pediatricians and the community to identify what types of minor or intermediate pediatric services could be offered on the Hospital campus in an outpatient setting so that only inpatient or highly specialized issues would need to be transferred t o another hospital. Residents also expressed concern over the lack of information about new programs. For example, participants felt the community had not received enough information about the Hospital's new GEM program. The consensus was that with more and more seniors leaving their homes and moving to Lakewood to be closer to their children, the geriatric program would be well utilized by the community if more people were aware of the service. \"Number 1 fastest growing community in the world with the highest birth rate and we don't have a hospital in our town for giving birth. The a verage family has 10 -12 kids in this community.\" 55 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus \"Monmouth is 45 minutes away and there are countless stories of people delivering on the road. Ambulances don't want to g o there because Jersey Shore is so much closer, but our doctors use Monmouth.\" \"I think not having OB impacts emergencies that may be OB -related. You want to bring them somewhere there's an OB Department.\" \"We would benefit from having Monmouth services p rovided here and Kimball services provided at Monmouth.\" \"Basically, what happens (in Pediatrics) is when you are very limited, a lot of the in -between staff doesn't come here because people are saying if I am going to get definitive care then I'm going to the hospital where I can get definitive care.\" \"I think that program (GEMS) is something the community should be made more aware of. So that people who are coming here definitely could avail themselves of the geriatric program .\" Other services responden ts felt were missing or hard to access included not having an intensivist in the Hospital and the lack of orthopedic surgeons in the community. Another mentioned a large pediatric group that was no longer accepting Medicaid Managed Care which was placing a hardship on families who were used to getting pediatric care from this practice. Respondents felt that Monmouth Medical Center South and Monmouth Medical Center were extremely good at understanding and respecting Orthodox Jewish religious and cultural customs and observances . MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES With regard to mental health, participants believed that mental health issues were heightened as a result of residents waiting until they were in crisis before reaching out for help because of their fear of be ing hospitalized and losing contact with their primary therapist or psychiatrist. Participants suggested that having an urgent care type of service for mental health would take care of a lot of these problems and would encourage people to come in before their problems reached crisis proportion. Individuals from the Hospital offered information regarding a DSRP program that was designed specially to deal with these urgent situations. Participants agreed that information about this program needed to be s hared with physicians and community stakeholders so that they were better informed about existing community resources. \"Knowledge is powerful and if there's something going on new in the hospital or in the system, even if its small and only 5, 10, 15 or 20 people would use the service , it's important that we figure out a channel for getting the information out.\" \"I think i f we can work in a way of really being super communicative with the community, that would be tremendous.\" \"There's a community council we discussed, and that's definitely a good idea. Like a community council to bring stakeholders together and keep them i nformed so they could go back and tell their communities.\" \"I think email lists are something we can certainly work on with the hospital. And anything really large, I think the hospital does and should continue to use press releases in whatever publicatio ns the community reads.\" 56 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus HEALTHY COMMUNITY AND HEALTH AWARENESS When asked for their views with respect to Lakewood being a healthy community, most felt the community was safe, with the exception of the traffic, the driving and congestion, and the lack of bike lanes. Most believed that the infrastructure has not kept up with population growth, but that significant progress was being made. Most felt that residents were aware of the value of maintaining heathy lifestyles. Representatives were aware of people in need, homeless and in those in crisis, and through various organizations in the community worked to get them necessary services. Social work services to help residents with elderly parents was mentioned as being needed in the community in respon se to a question regarding members of the community who were not being served. A Hospital spokesperson responded with information about support groups, and a caregiver program that was available, further highlighting the need for more communication about available resources within the community. Lastly, respondents were extremely complimentary about the changes that had been instituted at the Hospital to ensure that the Orthodox Jewish community felt that MMCSC cared about fulfilling their needs. 57 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus 5. OCEAN COUNTY /SERVICE AREA HEALTH PROFILE The Ocean County Health Profile provides a discussion of outcomes and factors in determining health. Ocean County data are compared to l ocal, county, state, and national measures . A. OCEAN COUNTY OVERVIEW Ocean County is the second largest county in New Jersey. It is located along the Jersey Shore. The county encompasses a land mass of 915.40 square miles, the largest county in New Jersey. The county is made up the following municipalities: Barnegat Light, Barnegat Township, Bay Head, Beach Haven, Beachwood, Berkeley Township, Brick Township, Eagleswood, Harvey Cedars, Island Heights, Jackson Township, Lacey Township, Lakehurst, Lakewood Township, Lavallette, Little Egg Harbor Township, Long B each Township, Manchester Township, Mantoloking, Ocean Gate, Ocean Township, Pine Beach, Plumsted Township, Point Pleasant Beach, Point Pleasant Borough, Seaside Heights, Seaside Park, Ship Bottom, South Toms River, Stafford Township, Surf City, Toms River Township, and Tuckerton. Much of the County is flat and coastal, with many beaches. Forty miles of Barrier Island form the Barnegat and Little Egg Harbor Bay, offering a wide range of water sports . In addition to being the northeast gateway to New Jerse y's Pine Barrens, Ocean County is also home to six state parks. 58 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus The following is an example of community health disparities identified in the CHNA. In 2016, the median household income in Ocean County ($63,108) was more than $10,000 below the statewide median of $73,702. The median household income of residents of Howell was $99,437 in 2016 compared to $36,980 in Manchester. In 2016, 31.5 % of Lakewood residents were living in poverty compared to 11.2% county -wide. Ocean County's population is much older than the State. Ocean County's population is predominantly White (83.9%) compared to 54.4% in New Jersey. Ocean County's teen birth rate, 15 -17-year -olds, for Hispanics (20.1/1,000) was higher than the rate statewide (15.0/1,000). Black residents in Ocean County had the highest age-adjusted mortality rate ( AAMR ) for heart disease compared to Whites and Hispanics. Black residents in Ocean County had higher rates of AAMR for cancer than Whites and Hispanics. The drug overdose death rate was higher in Ocean C ounty than the rate statewide and in Monmouth County. The percent of Ocean County low birth weight and very low birth weight infant s was higher among Blacks than for Whites and Hispanics. B. MMCSC SERVICE AREA Between 2010 and 201 8, the population of the MMCSC Service Area increased by over 3% (3.79 %). In 2023, the Service Area population is expected to increase another 2.34 % to 415,175 .

SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH Social determinants of health include socioeconomic and environmental factors which influence health outcomes, disparities in health, equity in health care, and are important tools to assess health at the local level. Healthy People 2020 provides a framew ork for assessing social determinants of health across five topic areas: economic stability; education; social and community context; health and health care; and, neighborhood and built environment. While a relatively affluent county, there are residents of Ocean County and MMCSC Service Area that face many socioeconomic challenges that may have consequences for health and health care in the region.10 1. Socioeconomic Status Socioeconomic status is the aggregate of several social, economic, and demographic measures. In this analysis, these measures include household Income and poverty, unemployment, education, ethnic and racial makeup, age, and Divinity Health's Health Need Index by service area. According to Healthy People 2020 , socioeconomic factors contribute to disparities in disease incidence and mortality among racial, ethnic and underserved groups. Studies indicate that income and socio economic status (SES) is a better predictor of the likelihood of an individual's or group's access to education, health insurance, and safe and healthy living and working conditions than race or ethnicity. SES also impacts the prevalence of behavioral risk factors (tobacco smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, excessive alcohol use) and rates of preventive screenings (lower SES, fewer screenings). 10 https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics -objectives/topic/social -determinants -of-health Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus Income, Poverty, and Unemployment Income influences the way people invest in their health and provides options for healthy lifestyle choices . In low income circumstances, preventive care expenses are more often neglected in favor of immediate living expenses. The longer people live in poverty, the more abject their income disadvantage and the more likely they are to suffer from a range of health problems. Circumstances that lead to poverty also may lead to social exclusion, discrimination, racism, stigmatization, and unemployment. Thus, the following measures of income and poverty may be evidence of these problems. Unemployment puts health at risk, starting when people first feel their jobs are threatened, before they become unemployed. Job insecurity increases mental health issues, p articularly anxiety and depression. Populations with higher unemployment rates have collective increased risk of premature death. Those who are unemployed face greater challenges to health and well -being, including lost income and health insurance. Unemployed individuals are 54% more likely to be in poor or fair health as compared to employed individuals. Accord ing to CHR, racial and ethnic minorities and those with less education, often already at -risk for poor health outcomes, are most likely to be unemployed. Labor statistics indicate unemployment rates peaked at the height of the recession in 2010 and began t o show some improvement beginning in 2014. Most areas of the State have shown continued improvement. Ocean County Ocean County residents have traditionally had lower median household income than residents of the State. In 201 6, the median household income in Ocean County was $ 63,108 , more than $ 10,000 below the State median of $73,702 In 201 6, Ocean County had a higher percentage of people living below the federal poverty level than statewide, 11.2 % and 10.9% respectively. 11 Between 201 4 and 201 6, unemployment throughout New Jersey declined. In 201 6, the Ocean County unemployment rate was 4.5%, a decrease of 1.4% from 2014, and lower than the New Jersey unemployment rate of 5.2%.12 MMCSC Service Area The 2016 median household income of Howell ($99,437 ) and Toms River 08753 ($73,227 ) residents was more than the county -wide figure ($ 63,108), and highe r than most of the other Service Area zip codes. In 2016, there were 31.5 % of Lakewood residents living in poverty compared to 11.2 % county - wide. 11 Ibid. 12 United States Bureau of Labor Statistics Newark, NJ -PA, Division Economic Summary 2016 http://www.bls.gov/regions/new -york -new - jersey/summary/blssummary_newark_div.pdf 61 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus Median Household Income State and County Comparisons - 2014 -2016 Source: United States Census 2016 5 Year ACS Estimates 2014 2016 New Jersey $72,062 $73,702 Ocean County Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus Median Household Income, 2018 Ocean County HOUSEHOLD INCOME (2018*) GEOGRAPHIC AREA MEDIAN New Jersey $78,317 Ocean Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus In 201 6, the percent of families living in poverty in Ocean County (7.5%) was lower than the State (8.1%).13 o In 201 6, 31.5 % of people and 26.3 % of families were living in poverty in Lakewood .

To ascertain the number of households that may be struggling due to the high cost of living in New Jersey we turned to the United Way's ALICE (Asset Limited Income Constrained Employed project)16 to get a better idea of the number of households that earn more than the Federal Poverty Level but less than the basic cost of living in Ocean County . As shown in the chart below, the Alice Threshold (AT) com bined the number of households in poverty and ALICE households equals the population struggling to afford basic needs. In Ocean County , this percentage amounts to 47% (201 6). Households by Income, 20 10 to 201 6 Ocean County Sources: 2016 Point -in-Time Data : American Community Survey.

There appears to be differences among municipalities in Ocean County in terms of the percentage of households living in poverty or at the ALICE threshold. Sixty -six percent of Lakewood and Seaside Heights residents , and 5 8% of Manchester residents had incomes at the Federal poverty level or at the ALICE threshold.

Education People with higher levels of educational attainment tend to have lower morbidity rates from acute and chronic diseases, independent of demographic and labor market factors. Life expectancy is increasing in the United States, yet differences have become more pronounced between those with and without a college education. The mechanisms by which education influences health are complex and likely include interrelationships between demographic and family background indicato rs, effects of poor health in childhood, greater resources associated with higher levels of education, a learned appreciation for the importance of good health behaviors, and one's social networks.20 The ability to communicate in English is also a key part of educational competence. The lack of English proficiency can negatively impact one's ability to understand and follow medical directions. Ocean County residents experienced a decrease in the percentage of the population over age 5 with limited English proficiency.

Social and Community Context Social Associations Social isolation can negatively impact health outcomes. Having a strong social network is associated with healthy lifestyle choices, positive health status, and reduced morbidity and mortality. Participation in community organizations can enhance social trust and a sense of belonging.24 Social associations include structured membership organizations such as civic organizations, bowling centers, golf clubs, fitness centers, sports organizations, religious organizations, political organizations, business and professional associations.

Health and Health Care Access to affordable quality health care is important to physical, social, and mental health. Health insurance helps individuals and families access needed primary care, specialists, and emergency care, but does not ensure access. It is also necessary for providers to offer affordable care, be available to treat patients and be near patients.25 25 http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/our -approach/health -factors /access -care Indicator Healthy People 2020 Target County Health Rankings Benchmark New Jersey Membership Organizations N.A. 8.28 8.34 8.326.22 6.63 6.968.27 8.37 8.53 2013 2014 2015New Jersey Ocean County Monmouth County National Benchmark: 22.1 Ocean County 2015: 6.96 78 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus Health Insurance The expansion of Medicaid coverage and the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) coverage provisions , which began taking effect in 2010, helped decrease the nation's uninsured rate by 7.2 percentage points, from 16 percent in 2016 . That translates into 20.4 million fewer people who lacked health insurance in 2016 compared to 2010. The uninsured rate is estimate d to have increased to 15.5% in the first quarter of 2018, meaning another 4 million lost coverage since 2016 due to changes in health policy and insurance offerings. The uninsured are less likely to have primary care providers than the insured; they also receive less preventive care, dental care, chronic disease management, and behavioral health counseling. Those without insurance are often diagnosed at later, less treatable disease stages than those with insurance and, overall, have worse health outcomes , lower quality of life, and higher mortality rates. Neighborhoods with low health insurance rates often have fewer providers, hospital beds and emergency resources than areas with higher rates. Even the insured have more difficulty getting care in these areas. Cost can be a barrier to care even for those who have insurance. Lack of insurance creates barriers to timely access to care for patients and financial burdens to the providers who care for them. Since 2013, the non -elderly population without he alth insurance in Ocean County has trended downward, decreasing from 13.6 % in 2013 to 8.8% in 2015. From 2013 through 2015, Ocean County had consistently lower rates of non -elderly population without health insurance than statewide . In 201 5, Ocean County (8.8%) had a higher percentage of uninsured than the ambitious Healthy People 2020 target of no person without health coverage . Ocean County also had a higher percentage of individuals without insurance than the CHR Benchmark.

Health insurance assists individuals and families to obtain primary care, specialists, and emerg ency care, but does not ensure access. Access to care goes beyond just insurance, it is also necessary for providers to offer affordable care, be available to treat patients and be near patients.26 Primary Care Physicians Nationally, many areas lack sufficient providers to meet patient needs; as of June 2014, there are about 7,200 primary care, 5,000 mental health and 5,900 dental federally designated Health Professional Shortage Areas in the US. Having a usual primary care provider is associated with a higher likelihood of appropriate care and better outcomes. In 2017, 88% of Americans had a usual source of care, but those with low incomes are less likely to than those with higher incomes, and the uninsured are twice as likely as the insured to lack a usual care source.27,28 Between 2013 and 2015, the ratio of population to primary care physicians in Ocean County increased from 2,099 :1 to 2,230 :1. In 201 5, the Ocean County ratio for primary care providers wa s worse than the CHR national benchmark (1,030:1).

Based on a wide array of demogra phic and economic statistics, the CNI provides a score for every populated ZIP Code in the United States. A score of 1.0 indicates a ZIP Code with the least need and a score of 5.0 represents a ZIP Code with the most need. The CNI is useful as part of a larger community health needs assessment to pinpoint specific areas with greater need than others. The CNI score is an average of five barrier scores that measure socio -economic indicators of each community using 2017 source data.

Communities with low CNI scores can be expected to have high hospital utilization. There is a causal relationship between CNI scores and preventable hospitalizations and ED visits for managea ble conditions. Communities with high CNI scores may have more hospitalization and ED visits that could have been avoided with improved healthy community structures and appropriate outpatient and primary care.

Ocean County ranked among the top performing quartiles of all counties in New Jersey, in terms of housing units built before 1950. 32 Report On the National Survey of Lead -Based Paint in Housing, https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/documents/r95 -003.pdf 11.3 9.811.0 7.911.0 9.5 2011 2012New Jersey Ocean County Monmouth County National Benchmark: 6.7 Ocean County 2012: 7.9 92 Community Health Needs Assessment RWJ Barnabas Health: Monmouth Medical Center Southern Campus Housing Built Before 1950 With Possible Lead -Based Paint Hazard State & County Comparisons 2016 Source: https://www26.state.nj.us/doh -shad/indicator/view/pre1950home.percent.html Lead Hazards The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines lead poisoning in children as a blood lead level of 10 micrograms per deciliter (\u00b5g/dL) or above. Young children can be exposed by swallowing lead dust or soil that gets on their hands or objects they put into their mouths such as toys; swallowing leaded paint chips; breathing leaded dust or lead contaminated air and eating food or drinking water that is contaminated with lead. Very high levels of lead can cause seizures, brain damage, developmental or intellectual disabilities, coma and even death. Exposure to lead, even at low levels, has been associated with decrease hearing, lower intelligence, hyp eractivity, attention deficit, and developmental problems.33 County level analysis cannot reveal individual town disparities in blood lead levels particularly in towns with housing stock built before 1950. In 2015, 0. 1% of Ocean County children had elevated blood lead levels compared to 0.52% statewide. The percent of children with elevated blood lead levels decreased from 0.30% in 2013 to 0.10% in 2015.

HEALTH FACTORS Health factors represent the influences that impact one's health. These include demographic, social, environmental, economic, and individual behaviors as well as clinical care and access to services. Social determinants were described in Section B precedi ng Health Factors. 1. Clinical Care Measures Inpatient and ED Utilization Factors impacting hospital utilization may include policy change, advances in technology, practice patterns and demographics. Many federal and state health care payment reforms, including the Affordable Care Act (ACA), were designed to improve care transi tions, coordination of care, enhance ambulatory care and improve access to primary care. The anticipatory result would include improved coordinated care and declines in inpatient and ED utilization. Inpatient Ocean County 's 2016 inpatient utilization r ate ( 199.73 /1,000) was higher than the State Service Area inpatient rate ( 189.97 /1,000) was lower than the Ocean County rate.

Health Behaviors Maternal / Fetal Health Prenatal Care The medical care a woman receives during pregnancy monitors her health and the developing fetus. Low - risk pregnancies should visit a prenatal provider every four or six weeks through 28 weeks, then every two or three weeks from weeks 28 -36, and finally every week in the ninth month until delivery. A high -risk pregnancy requires add itional visits.38 Pregnant women who do not receive adequate prenatal care risk undetected complications and an increased possibility of adverse outcomes. 38 http:/ /www.plannedparenthood.org/health -info/pregnancy/prenatal -care IndicatorHealthy People 2020 TargetCounty Health Rankings BenchmarkNew Jersey Primary C -Section Rate Single >=37 Week Low Risk Births Delivered By C -Section/Single Live Births To Low Risk FemalesN.A.

Tw o significant benefits are improved birth weight and decreased preterm delivery. Infants born to mothers who receive no prenatal care have an infant mortality rate five times higher than mothers who receive appropriate prenatal care in the first trimester of pregnancy. Enrollment in care during the first trimester of pregnancy reflects timely initiation of prenatal care.39 In 2016, only 65.9 % of Ocean County women entered prenatal care in the first trimester compared to 72.1% in New Jersey. As compared to other New Jersey counties, Ocean County ranks in the worst performing quartile.

People who engage in all of these behaviors are 66 percent less likely to die early from cancer, 65 percent less likely to die ea rly from cardiovascular disease and 57 percent less likely to die early from other causes compared to those who do not engage in any of these behaviors.43 Tobacco Use Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Smoking leads to disease and disability, and harms nearly every organ in the body, and causes cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and lung diseases such as emphysema, bronchi tis, and chronic airway obstruction. Exposure to secondhand smoke can lead to lung cancer and heart disease. Each year, smoking kills approximately 480,000 Americans, including 41,000 from secondhand smoke. On average, smokers die 10 years earlier than no nsmokers. About 15% of U.S. adults smoke. Each day, nearly 3,200 youth smoke their first cigarette, and 2,100 people transition from occasional to daily smokers. Smokeless tobacco also leads to various cancers, gum and teeth problems, and nicotine add iction. Almost 6% of young adults use smokeless tobacco and half of new users are younger than 18.44, 45 Between 2012 and 2016, smoking rates decreased in Ocean County with from 20.3% in 2014 to 13.1% in 2016.

As of 2016, 41 million Americans struggled with hunger in the U.S. A household that is food insecure has limited or uncertain access to enough food to support a healthy life. Obesity among f ood insecure people, as well as low income individuals, occurs in part because they are often subject to the same challenges as other Americans (more sedentary lifestyles, increased portion size) and because they face unique challenges in adopting and main taining healthy behaviors, including limited resources and lack of access to affordable healthy food, cycles of food deprivation and overeating, high levels of stress and anxiety, fewer opportunities for physical activity, greater exposure to marketing of obesity promoting products, and limited access to health care.47 The percent of Ocean County residents with a Body Mass Index (BMI) >=30 trended upward from 26.8 % in 201 2, to 28.8 % in 2016.

Cancer Screening Breast Cancer (mammography) According to the American Cancer Association, women ages 40 to 44 should have the choice to start annual breast cancer screening with mammograms (x -rays of the breast) if they wish to do so. Women age 45 to 54 should get mammograms every year. Women 55 and older should switch to mammograms every 2 years, or can continue yearly screening. Screening shou ld continue as long as a woman is in good health and is expected to live 10 more years or longer. Women should also know how their breasts normally look and feel and report any breast changes to a health care provider right away. Some women - because of th eir family history, a genetic tendency, or certain other factors - should be screened with MRIs along with mammograms. The number of women who fall into this category is very small. In 2016, 79.9% of Ocean County women over age 40 had a mammography within the past two years, up 23.5 percentage points since 2012.

Women between the ages of 21 and 29 should have a Pap test done every 3 years. Women between the ages of 30 and 65 should have a Pap test plus an HPV test (calle d \"co -testing\") done every 5 years. Women over age 65 who have regular cervical cancer testing in the past 10 years with normal results should not be tested for cervical cancer. Women with a history of a serious cervical pre -cancer should continue to be tested for at least 20 years after that diagnosis, even if testing goes past age 65. Some women - because of their health history (HIV infection, organ transplant, DES exposure, etc.) - may need a different screening schedule for cervical cancer. In 201 6, 73.4 % of Ocean County women over age 18 ha d a pap smear within the past three years as compared to 74.5 % of New Jersey women 18+.

Vaccines introduce the antigens that cause diseases. Immunity , the body's means to preventing disease , recognizes germs and produces antibodies to fight them. Even after many years, the immune system continues to produce antibodies to thwart disease from recurring . Through vaccination we can develop immunity without suffering from disease .49 Childhood Immunizations: DPT, polio, MMR & Hib (aged 19 -35 months) Young children are readily susceptible to disease and the consequences can be serious or life - threatening. Childhood immunizations minimize impact of vaccine preventable diseases. Combined 4 vaccine series (4:3:1:3) refers to 4 or more doses of DTP/DT, 3 or more doses of poliovirus vaccine, 1 or more doses of MC V and 3 or more doses of Hib .50 Conflicting information in the news and on the internet about children's immunizations may cause vaccine hesitancy among select parents. Health care providers have been encouraged to use interventions to overcome vaccine no n-compliance, including parental counseling, increasing access to vaccinations, offering combination vaccines, public education, and reminder recall strategies. Childhood immunization is an evidenced -based strategy, which is known to reduce the incidence, prevalence and mortality of many communicable diseases in many Western Countries including the U.S. In 2016, 95.9% of first grade students in Ocean County had received all required immunizations compared to 92. 7% statewide. 93.3% of all Ocean County stude nts received all required immunizations, slightly less than the statewide percentage (94.4%).

Premature Deaths An alternate method to reviewing crude or age -adjusted death rates as a measure of premature mortality is assessing Y ears of Potential Life Lost (YPLL). YPLL calculate the number of years of potential life lost for each death occurring before a predetermined end point, in this case, age 75 per 100,000 population. Premature deaths are reviewed to highlight potentially prevent able adverse outcomes. The Ocean County YPLL rate increased from 6,161. 78/100,000 for the period 2010 -2012, to 6,397. 64/100,000 for the period from 2014 -2016.

Behavioral Health -Related Death s Mental health is a state of well -being in which an individual realizes his or her own abilities, cope s with normal life stresses, work s productively, and is able to contribut e to his or her community. Mental illness is dia gnosable mental disorders or health conditions characterized by alterations in thinking, mood, or behavior (or some combination thereof) associated with distress and/or impaired functioning. Depression , the most common type of mental illness , is associated with higher rates of chronic disease, increased health care utilization, and impaired functioning. However, r ates of mental illness treatment remain low, and often the treatment received is inadequate. Statewide deaths due to suicide decreased from 2014 (8.8/100,000) to 2016 (7.7/100,000), or 12.5 %, while Ocean County 's suicide rate declined from 11.6 /100,000 to 6.4/100,000 for the same period.

Infant Mortality Infant mortality, the death of a baby prior to his or her first birthday, is t raditionally used as an indicator of the health and well -being of a nation. Infant mortality is calculated as the number of infant deaths under age 1 per 1,000 live births. Great disparities exist in infant mortality by age, race, and ethnicity. Most frequent causes are s erious birth defect , preterm birth / low birth weight, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), m aternal complications of pregnancy , and i njury .57 The overall infant mortality rate declined statewide from the period 200 7-2009 (5.2/100,000) to 2013-2015 (4.6/100,000). The Ocean County infant mortality rate declined from 3.5/100,000 to 2.7/100,000 between 2013 and 2015.

Low and Very Low Birth Weight Infants Birth weight is th e most important factor affecting neonatal mortality and a significant determinant of post neonatal mortality . Low birth weight infants (less than 2,500 grams) are at an increased risk for health problems ranging from neurodevelopmental disabilities to respiratory disorders.58 Racial disparities in low birth weight babies persist; nationally, non -Hispanic Black infants continue to die at nearly twice the rate of non -Hispanic Whites. Low Birth Weight In 2016, Ocean County had a lower percentage of low birth weight babies ( 6.4%) than the State (8.1%) and Monmouth County ( 7.4%). The 201 6 percent of Ocean County low birth weight babies was lower than the Healthy People 2020 target of 7.8% . The percentage of Ocean County low birthweight babies was higher among Blacks ( 20.1 %) than for Whites ( 5.8%) and Hispanics ( 6.4%) in 2016 . Very low birth weight babies (less than 1,500 grams ) are at greater risk of adverse outcomes than low birth weight babies. Very Low Birth Weight In 2016, 0.9% of Ocean County babies were very low birth weight as compared to 1.4% statewide . The 201 6 percent of very low birth weight babies in Ocean County was lower than the rate in Monmouth County ( 1.0%).

Health Status and Behavioral Health Status Health status and behavioral health status are broad multidimensional concepts including self -report measures of physical and mental health. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), the nation's premier system of health -related telephone surv eys, collects data about U.S. residents regarding health -related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions and use of preventive services. In 1984 , the survey began collecting data in 15 states and is currently conducted in all state s includ ing Washington D.C. and three United States territories. The most recent data available are for the year 201 6. General Health Status Between 2012 and 201 6, BRFSS data report ed an increase in the percent of Ocean County residents who indicate their health as \"poor or fair,\" from 16.8 % to 17.6 %. In 2016, 17.5% of New Jersey respondents report that their health is \"fair or poor,\" slightly lower than the rate among Ocean County residents.

The three most common t ypes of diabetes are Type 1, Type 2 and Gestational. Individuals with diabetes may develop serious health complications including heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, blindness, amputation and premature death. Type 1 develops when insulin producing cells located in the pancreas are destroyed. There is no known way to prevent Type 1 diabetes. In order t o survive, Type 1 diabet ics must have insulin delivered b y injection or pump. Type 2 primarily onsets with insulin resistance disorder in which cells within the muscles, liver, and fat tissue are unable to properly use insulin. Higher risk for developing Type 2 diabetes is associated with older age, obesity, fam ily history of diabetes , history of gestational diabetes , impaired glucose metabolism, physical inactivity, and race/ethnicity. African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, American Indians, some Asians, and Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders are at part icularly high risk for Type 2.
