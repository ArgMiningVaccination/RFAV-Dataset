Both types of tests are recommended in order to draw a clear picture of the root causes of your health problems and to identify your specific requirements. We are then able to re-establish equilibrium using nutritional and lifestyle intervention. Functional tests, in particular, can be invaluable in identifying the underlying cause of imbalance, as well as your unique nutritional needs, when coupled with your health history, dietary/lifestyle habits and nutritional goals. Diagnostic tests bring faster successful outcomes by facilitating the development of more individualised and targeted therapeutic protocols, as well as preventing illness. Laboratory tests are selected carefully depending on your particular health issue, among a wide range of tests offered by well established scientific laboratories in the EU, UK and US. The turnover of most tests is two to four weeks. Tests are most often non-invasive and typically involve a breath, blood, saliva, urine or stool sample. The majority of samples can be taken at home but a patient may occasionally be asked to attend a laboratory to provide samples. Our clinic offers a broad range of functional health tests to help assess the causes of ill health. The following is a selection of the tests available: Gastrointestinal Tests: digestion and gut function analysis - Digestive Stool Analysis (such as GI Map, Doctor's Data & Genova Diagnostics) - to check for digestion and absorption, the presence of pathogens (yeast, bacterial infections, viruses and parasites), map the gut microbiome (the balance of 'good' to 'bad' gut bacteria), digestive enzyme levels, gut immunity and possible inflammation in the large intestine - SIBO breath test - to check for possible bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine, often present in IBS, bloating and other gastrointestinal disturbances. - Lactose & fructose intolerance breath test - Leaky gut/ Intestinal Permeability test - to check for integrity of the gut lining, very helpful in gastrointestinal disturbances and immune system reactions, including autoimmunity (rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's, ulcerative colitis etc) and allergies - Candida test - to check for yeast overgrowth - H. Pylori Antigen test Immunology Tests: allergy and antibody profiles - Gluten intolerance (celiac profiles) and Gluten Sensitivity (non-coeliac mediated) - Food allergy (IgE-immediate allergic reactions) and Food Sensitivity & Intolerance (IgG-delayed) test. Food, food additives and environmental allergens have been implicated in a wide variety of conditions ranging from bloating, migraines, headaches, stomach aches, IBS, constipation/diarrhea, cough, runny nose to severe illnesses such as arthritis and coeliac disease. Food intolerances may show up even 72h after exposure to an antigenic substance, making it hard to identify the causative agent. Common sesnitivities include but are not restricted to wheat, gluten, yeast, dairy (lactose or casein), milk, nuts, corn, eggs, seafood, beans. We use panels that test for both raw and cooked foods. Endocrine Tests: hormone profiles Practically all systems in the body are controlled by hormones, yet poor diet, stressful lifestyles and exposure to toxins may disrupt hormonal levels, resulting in profound effects on health. A range of functional tests are available to evaluate different hormones, including: - Adrenal Stress Index Test - to measure the level of salivary cortisol and DHEA, critical for uncovering biochemical imbalances underlying chronic fatigue. - Thyroid Hormone Profiles - to analyse thyroid hormone production and metabolism, the disruption of which affects virtually every metabolic process in the body, from mood and energy levels to weight and sex drive. Conventional diagnostic testing will only test for clinical hypo/hyperthyroidism (disease). Subclinical hypothyroidism is increasingly common in the UK and Mediterranean countries, often left undiagnosed, leaving people feeling desperate or 'not right'. Functional testing is crucial for early detection of thyroid issues and prevention of thyroid disease. Sadly, only a few markers of thyroid function are tested by GPs, however a full panel is most often needed in order to diagnose and address poor thyroid function efficiently. - Female/Sex Hormones Profile - a test using saliva to track female hormones over a cycle to find out where the imbalances are occurring. Can help determine the root cause of hormonal imbalance issues such as PMS, infertility and menstrual irregularity as well as menopause - Oestrogen metabolism test - this test measures the ratio of 'good' to 'bad' oestrogen metabolites which can either encourage or inhibit hormonal-dependent cancer Nutritional and Toxin Status Assessment Inadequate levels of vitamins, minerals and other orthomolecular nutrients or excessive levels of heavy metals can lead to a vast array of health complaints, including infertility, menopause, osteoporosis, miscarriage, children's health problems, fatigue, depression as well as more serious diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Nutritional assessments establish the success of dietary and supplementation plans. - Mineral Hair Analysis Test - to test for mineral levels and heavy metal toxicity. Heavy metal assessment is particularly important for individuals coming in contact with toxic chemicals on a daily basis, such as smoking, living in polluted cities, paint, mines, mercury dental fillings, pesticides, vaccines, excessive fish consumption etc - Bone scanning - to evaluate the risk of osteoporosis - A number of comprehensive nutritional assessments which measure the levels of organic acids, vitamin and mineral status, protein/ amino acid adequacy, cellular energy production and neurotransmitter processing, such as the Optimal Nutrition Evaluation, NutrEval, Antioxidant biomarkers, Plasma Mineral Profile, Fatty Acid Profile, Anaemia Profile etc and help determine which nutrients and at what levels are most important for you, as opposed to the mythical average person. - Liver Detoxification Profile - to test for the rate of toxin elimination. Metabolic Assessment Genetics, sedentary lifestyle and progressive weight gain are all risk factors for cardiovascular disease, Metabolic Syndrome, diabetes and obesity. Cholesterol has been blamed for many years for the aforementioned conditions, however the latest research points towards more specific and accurate biochemical markers. A range of tests are available for early detection of risk, including: - PCOS screening - Inflammation markers - Homocysteine Level Assessment - Body fat assessment - Glycosylated Haemoglobin - Fating glucose and insulin levels (pre-diabetes, weight gain, inflammation, PCOS, autoimmunity) - Leptin levels It is important to underline that while conventional medicine looks at \"normal/medically-accepted\" ranges of blood tests, Functional Medicine looks at the optimal narrower ranges, and evaluates GP tests accordingly. Conventional medicine reference ranges are very wide. You might have been dismissed by your doctor as \"normal/ok\" , while feeling pretty bad. Genetic Testing Nutrigenomics is a branch of nutritional genomics and cutting-edge area of research that studies the effects of foods and food constituents on gene expression (DNA), at a molecular level. Knowing which specific foods can have an effect on our genetic expression is invaluable when dealing with chronic illness/symptoms. Nutrigenetics studies how genetic variation or SNPs can influence, nutrients' absorption, metabolism, elimination or biological effects, what can be extremely useful in pointing towards our unique needs and creating long-lasting results. Knowing our genetic predispositions can help prevent illness and foster optimal health for a lifetime. We use various laboratories in the EU, UK & US that offer DNA Genetic Testing & Analysis. "}
