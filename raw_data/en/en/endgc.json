Our office incorporates techniques that focus attention on balancing the physical body and mental body systems. PHYSICAL & COGNITIVE STRESS What is stress? Stress in simple terms is a pressure that can stimulate a response within the body. Physical stress is physical pressure that is caused by external forces such as exercise or illness. The body's automatic response to physical stress demands more energy into the muscle and tissues to achieve a balanced and healing state. Cognitive stress refers to strain on the mind due to repetitive mental and emotional pressures. Cognitive stress can come from ongoing challenges that do not allow for recovery time in between stressful events. WHY WE TREAT STRESS Acute stress is a short-lived experience where the body can recover quicker from a stressful experience. Chronic stress is considered when there is no time for recovery in between events. Take time to heal yourself to keep up with the events life presents you. When the body reacts to stress, the physical body can be felt to push back, tense up, or can be restricted. A chemical reaction also occurs within the body and the brain responds by stimulating six different body systems to work harder. Those impacted are the respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrine, nervous, gastrointestinal, and reproductive systems. OUR GOAL Our goal is to bring awareness to the types of stress because the whole body can be positively, or negatively impacted by it. In a busy, high-achieving world, our space can be a stress-free zone where we bring a sense of calm and peacefulness to your day. \"Came in with severe lower back pain and Dr. Kurt did a wonderful job re-aligning me and helping ease that pain.
