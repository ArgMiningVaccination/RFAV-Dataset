A healthy diet full of whole, unprocessed foods helps you better manage diabetes and heart disease, both of which are risk factors for more serious symptoms with COVID-19. Some research has shown that vitamins C and D and zinc may have some protective effects by bolstering immunity. Natural sources are best, so get your vitamin C in foods like citrus fruits and raw or lightly cooked vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower. Vitamin D is found in oily fish like salmon and herring, as well as in lean meat. Zinc is available in nuts, whole grains, legumes like beans, lentils, and chickpeas, oysters, and poultry/lean meat. If you're thinking of supplements, 1000 milligrams (mg) a day of vitamins C and D and 30 mg zinc may help support a healthy immune system\u2014just be sure not to overload on supplements.

If you don't have someone to walk with, use your time walking to meditate, and get a double dose of healthfulness. You don't need a mask to walk outdoors in an uncrowded area, but if you do run into a friend, wave from a safe distance\u2014at least 6 feet away. Walking won't stamp out COVID-19, but it can help keep you stronger, fitter, and healthier overall. That includes your mental health. Walking can improve your mood and help relieve stress, which crushes your immune system. Any movement is important, so whatever you choose, just move. Reduce stress You've probably seen the short-term effects of stress through a rise in blood pressure or an occasional bout of stomach upset. Over time, ongoing stress produces hormones in our bodies that weaken the immune system and defenses against illness. Interrupting chronic stress can help reduce its negative effects.

Clean, clean, clean You already know the importance of [handwashing](/articles/10-hand-washing-facts-to-clean-up-your-act). You should be doing it after every grocery shopping trip, mailbox pick-up, bathroom visit, and house cleaning. And, keeping your house clean is important, too. You can better protect yourself by cleaning and sanitizing high-touch surfaces daily: doorknobs, refrigerator handles, faucets, toilet handles, and remote controls. Don't tire of social distancing and mask wearing We know it's hard but stay strong and be smart. Practice social distancing, even with family. Limit groups indoors to under 10 people, and avoid visiting altogether if someone has been exposed to COVID-19, or traveled to an area where cases are spiking. Be diligent about wearing a mask around anyone who doesn't live in your home, including extended family. They may go to work or school, making them more vulnerable to COVID-19 exposure. If you must have work done in your home, insist that service providers wear masks\u2014and you should wear one while they're inside the house, as well. Visit stores at \"off-hours\" and make a thorough list so you can limit trips. Is it time for a checkup?
