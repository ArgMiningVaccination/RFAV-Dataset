Failing to do so may result in serious, long-term health problems. Researchers studied nearly 7,500 workers for an average of 32 years. About one-fourth regularly put in 40 hours a week, but many worked more. About 57 percent logged 41 to 50 hours and 13 percent worked 51 to 60 hours. Another 3 percent toiled for more than 60 hours weekly. Th e more hours worked, the greater the risk of developing four chronic diseases: heart disease, non-skin cancer, arthritis and diabetes. Results were published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine. WOMEN VS. MEN Th e risks di ered by gender. When the researchers analyzed men alone, long work hours were linked only to arthritis. In contrast, women who spent more than 60 hours per week on the job had nearly triple the risk for each of the four health problems as those who worked less. W omen often have more family responsibilities than men, the study authors note, meaning long work hours could add even greater stress. RELIEVE STRESS Building better work-life balance would likely bene t both employees and employers, experts note. Can't change your work hours? Protect your health by managing stress. Plan your time using tools like to-do lists. Exercise regularly \u2014 at least two hours and 30 minutes per week \u2014 to relax muscles and improve your mood. Finally, try soothing, mind-clearing techniques like deep breathing and meditation.What's the best way to deal with conflict in a relationship? A: Follow these simple steps to help deal with conflict in a fruitful way: 1 . Listen without interjecting; 2. Validate the other person; 3. Be willing to compromise; and 4. Be willing to apologize and forgive. How does stress affect relationships? A: Those who are stressed often engage in mindreading, assuming and jumping to conclusions, creating distance and tension. Communicate your needs and the reason behind your stress to create a stronger bond with your loved one. What's the difference between spending time vs. spending quality time? A: Our daily interactions with our loved ones can become routine. You can see this way of interacting within a relationship as just spending time \u2014 not quality time. Spending quality time involves being fully in the moment with your partner or spouse, which encompasses focus, attentive body language and the ability to listen.

If you have asthma, nd out from your doctor in advance what you should do if your symptoms get more severe or if you feel like you are having an asthma attack. 4GET HELP IF YOU NEED IT . Th e spring and summer months can be di cult for many people with asthma, but there's no need to su er. If you are still having trouble with your asthma despite trying to avoid triggers and taking medication, talk with your doctor.Spring is in the air. And if you have asthma and allergies, pollen and pollution can cause your symptoms to fl are up. But the change in seasons doesn't mean that you have to stay inside all the time. T ake these four steps toward relief. 1MAKE A PLAN. Do you start coughing and wheezing at the rst signs of spring? T alk with your doctor or an allergist to gure out what's causing your symptoms. He or she can work with you to create a plan that controls your exposure to them or may prescribe medicine to help control your symptoms. 2CHECK THE AIR QUALITY. While some air pollution exists all year, certain types can get worse in the summer during hot afternoons and evenings. If the air is polluted, you may nd it harder to breathe when you are active outside. Air pollution can also make you more sensitive to other triggers. Y ou may notice asthma symptoms the day after you've been breathing polluted air.Sometimes it's obvious when the air is polluted, such as on a hazy or smoggy day, but in other cases it's not. If you are sensitive to air pollution, you may want to check the air quality before you plan any outside activities. Y ou can usually nd reports about the air quality in your area in local newspapers or on TV or radio stations. Th ese reports are also available on the Environmental Protection Agency website airnow.gov . 3PROTECT AGAINST POLLEN. For many allergy su erers, pollen and mold are the main problem.

Quick tips to keep you healthy!LIVE IT 4 Loma Linda University Health A Healthy Tomorrow NATURAL DEODORANTS AND YOU From roll-ons and \"spritzes\" to sticks and creams, trendy natural deodorants promise to battle armpit odor with ingredients like clay, essential oils and plant extracts. Some are even vegan, organic and cruelty-free. Here's what you usually won't find inside: chemicals used in conventional deodorants and antiperspirants, such as aluminum-based compounds, parabens and phthalates. Intrigued by these increasingly popular products? Here are answers to common questions you may have. Q: Will I smell? A: Active ingredients in natural deodorants may discourage armpit odors in several ways. Clay may help because it can absorb perspiration. Sage extracts discourage growth of underarm bacteria that cause body odor. Manufacturers of natural deodorants say tapioca starch also absorbs sweat and that botanicals, including coriander fruit oil, hops extract, grapefruit essential oil, lavender, peppermint, tea tree and plant enzymes, battle underarm odor, too. Q: How long does protection last? A: Protection varies by product. Some promise multiday coverage, while others say freshness lasts from morning until night. Still others advise users to reapply as needed throughout the day.And while some products say they control underarm wetness, others are more direct about what they do \u2014 neutralizing or preventing odor \u2014 and what they won't do \u2014 like preventing you from sweating.

Ideally, girls and boys should receive the series of shots at 11 or 12 years old, but they are still effective up to age 26. Even if they have received the HPV vaccine, women should receive regular pap tests to check for signs of cervical cancer beginning at age 21.Our FavoriteFalafel Serving size: 2 ba Servings per recipPrep time: 10 minCook time: 15 min INGREDIENTS 1 can chickpeas, 15 oz., rinsed, drained and patted dry 1 \u00b3 cup parsley, fresh 1 \u00b3 cup cilantro, fresh 4 cloves garlic2 shallots, minced \u2014 equivalent to \u00be cup (can substitute yellow onion) 2 tbsp. sesame seeds, raw1\u00bd tsp. cumin, ground (plus more to taste) 1 tsp. coriander 3-4 tbsp. breadcrumbs (can substitute with an oat or gluten-free blend with varied results) 3-4 tbsp. grapeseed oil for cookingOPTIONAL: Breadcrumbs for to 375\u00b0F.

Serve warm with a tzatziki sauce, inside a pita with desired toppings or atop a bed of greens. !HEART ATTACKS ON THE RISE Historically, women in midlife have been at a lower risk for heart disease and heart attacks than men the same age. As a result, prevention and management efforts have focused on men \u2014 with positive effects. Unfortunately, the news is not as good for women. Over the last 20 years, one small study found that heart attacks have increased among women ages 35 to 54. They are also suffering more strokes. One theory suggests that women and their doctors have not addressed their risk factors and have focused more on warding off other diseases, such as cancer. WOMEN'S HEART ATTACK SYMPTOMS UNUSUAL FATIGUE SLEEP DISTURBANCES SHORTNESS OF BREATH INDIGESTION ANXIETYEven so, learning about the condition can help you take steps to ease your symptoms. More than 20 million Americans have neuropathy, a disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Th ese nerves transmit signals from the spinal cord and brain to the hands, feet, joints, skin and internal organs. Neuropathy has a variety of causes. About 30 percent of cases relate to diabetes, and another 30 percent have no known cause. Th e remaining cases stem from autoimmune disorders, infections, cancer and cancer treatments, kidney and thyroid disease, dietary problems, alcohol abuse and poor blood fl ow to the legs. SYMPTOMS In some people, neuropathy develops gradually. In others, it comes on suddenly. Th e symptoms can include: Arm and leg weakness. Th is can make it hard to walk, keep your balance or carry things. Numbness, tingling or aches. Th ese may cause pinching sensations, or sharp, deep pain. Such symptoms often worsen at night. Organ problems. Th ese can cause digestive issues, di culty swallowing, diarrhea, constipation or feeling faint or light-headed when standing from a seated position. Damage to speci c nerves in the head. Trouble focusing, double vision, pain behind one eye or paralysis on one side of the face can result. Erectile dysfunction, bladder problems or excessive perspiration.DIABETIC NEUROPATHY People with diabetes who have uncontrolled blood sugar have a higher risk for neuropathy. Th e condition a ects around 60 to 70 percent of people with diabetes. W orking with your doctor to control your blood sugar, taking insulin an d other medications as prescribed, exercising regularly, eating a healthy diet and maintaining a healthy weight may help you prevent it. DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT While some forms of neuropathy can be cured, many cannot. Even so, depending on the underlying cause, symptoms can be relieved. Seeking medical attention early is one key to e ective treatment. Th e condition is usually diagnosed via a complete medical history and physical exam by a doctor. Th e physician may also ask for blood tests or exams that gauge your nerve function. Braces and splints may help improve mobility. SELF-CARE Th ese recommendations can help you take care of yourself if you have neuropathy: Be careful when using kniv es, scissors and other sharp objects. W alk slowly and use a cane to steady your gait. W ear shoes to protect your feet from injury. Check hot water temperature with a thermometer before showering or bathing. See if acupuncture or massage provides pain relief or helps restore nerve function.Neuropathy has a variety of causes, and you can't always prevent or cure it.NEUROPATHY: WHEN GOOD NERVES GO BAD 6 Loma Linda University Health A Healthy TomorrowARE YOU SUFFERING FROM NERVE PAIN?
