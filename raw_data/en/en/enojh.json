What is Chiropractic? Chiropractic is a unique health care paradigm based on your body's inborn ability to heal itself and resist disease. Unlike the allopathic (medical) approach which focuses on the disease, chiropractic focuses o improving the natural defenses. We do this by reducing the interferences with the nervous system. It is the brain's job to interpret your internal and external environments and adjust the body's system accordingly. The brain talks to each and every organ ( & vice-versa) through the nerves. The nerves branch off the spinal cord which is housed in the spinal bones. These nerves branch out between the bones. If the spinal bones become misaligned ( a subluxation) pressure can be placed on the nerves and interfere with the message coming from the brain down into the spinal cord and out the nerve root. Good communication is vital for optimum health. Chiropractic restores proper spinal function with chiropractic adjustments. Because the goal of chiropractic is to restore you to your optimum function, we do not treat symptoms. We do monitor conditions and aid in the healing process allowing your body to heal itself and be as healthy as it can be. 2. What does a Chiropractor do? Doctors of Chiropractic are specialists in the detection, reduction and prevention of nervous system interferences. Chiropractors do this by locating misaligned vertebrae which is called a subluxation, and correcting that subluxation through an adjustment. An adjustment occurs when the chiropractor provides a specific force to the subluxated bone in a specific direction with a specific intent. To determine the cause of your health problem chiropractic doctors examine your spine. This exam may include x-rays, orthopedic and neurological testing as well as neurovascular testing. You will be shown the exact locations of any nervous system interference and get specific recommendations for your chiropractic care program. 3. Why should I go to a chiropractor? People of all ages can benefit from chiropractic care. A doctor of chiropractic should be a part of every family's health care team of professionals. It is important to get your spine checked regularly so that you can stay healthy and allow your body to function to the best of its ability. Chiropractic is a preventive health care. Just as you would take your car in for check-up's and oil changes to keep it running well, your body is a very complex organism that requires maintenance of it own. Along with a healthy diet and regular exercise chiropractic can provide an avenue to maintain a healthy lifestyle so that one may enjoy every decade of life. 4. If I start going to the chiropractor, do I have to go for the rest of my life? The quick answer is NO. How long you chose to benefit from chiropractic care is entirely up to you. Most patients find that periodic chiropractic check-ups help keep them in good shape. Those who are active, have stressful jobs, play sports or want to be their very best find that a schedule of preventive visits allow them to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Spinal problems that may have occurred as a child may require longer care in order to stabilize the condition and allow the individual to have optimum health. Chronic problems often involve muscle and other soft tissue damage which can lead into early degenerative changes in the spine. Some patients may come in for acute care or when they are experiencing pain. This type of care may result in a more frequent schedule of care to stabilize the area. Whatever category you may fall into, our office is ready to assist you in your needs. It is your body and your choice how long you chose to benefit from chiropractic care. 5. Does insurance cover chiropractic care? Most insurance companies will have some chiropractic coverage. Some cover more than others.
