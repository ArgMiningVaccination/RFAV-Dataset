Drugs often are tested on middle-aged adults, but are later used by many individuals who are more susceptible to drug injuries, like children, the elderly, or pregnant women. Furthermore, pre-market trials cannot identify health problems that arise only after long-term use. Yet, many drugs are meant for long-term use; for example, drugs, for birth control, to stabilize blood sugar for diabetes, or to control high blood pressure, cholesterol, depression, or mood disorders. Also, a physician may prescribe drugs in ways that differ from how they were tested. The pre-market trial may test a pain reliever for short-term acute use, but some physicians may prescribe it for continuing use. Moreover, some injuries are caused by the interaction of two or more drugs, and are not discovered until they have been marketed and used by a larger population.\").496 Vol. 10:2 PUTTING PATIENTS FIRST interactions (DDs)\" between a newly approved drug and the drugs already being taken by the patient. Researchers at Stanford University recently noted that \"DDIs cause nearly 74,000 emergency room visits and 195,000 hospitalizations in the USA.\"3 This situation is not due to laxity by the FDA so much as it reflects the current state of health care. As Professor Barbara Evans explains, the FDA plays the role as \"gatekeeper\" in assessing the safety and efficacy of drugs, and other products, before they go on the market but as a matter of \"realism\" because \"[t]he gate is intrinsically porous, and safety cannot be achieved by fighting that fact but rather by responding to it.\"4 Indeed, concerns about the problem resulted in Congress extending the FDA's ability to require manufacturers to conduct their own research studies to assess the safety and efficacy of the drugs they sell not just before seeking FDA approval but afterwards as well.5 Yet despite the awarding of these new 3 Bethany Percha and Russ B.

See generally, Barbara J. Evans, The Ethics of Postmarketing497 2013 INDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW powers, there is still no comprehensive mechanism in place to gather the information needed to protect or warn patients who receive these prescriptions.6 So although the FDAA gives the FDA the authority to require sponsors to conduct post-market clinical trials if it is aware of \"a known serious risk related to the use of the drug involved\" 7 it also authorizes the FDA to \"[alssess signals of serious risk related to the use of the drug.\"8 This article proposes ways in which the FDA can use this power to promote and protect the public's health.

It is the claim of this article that although the phenomena of the emergence of post- approval hazards is inevitable, the FDA can do far more to protect patients by using its legal authority to require post- market surveillance for all, not some, newly approved products. Moreover, it can increase the likelihood of relevant information coming to its attention sooner by targeting the specific groups who are likely to have early knowledge of harms caused by new drugs: the sponsors, health care providers, patients, and the FDA itself. Specifically, the FDA should amend the approval process to create formal post-market surveillance on all newly approved drugs. It should impose requirements on Sponsors to seek out information about potential problems, to organize that data in a way that is easy to review, and to report that information directly to the FDA on a regular basis for at least two years after the product is on the market. Moreover, because the FDA's resources will always be less than the drug sponsor, who expects to profit from product sales, the burden of discovering and analyzing post- market adverse events should be shifted to the drug sponsor. This article makes several new suggestions as well as highlighting those already proposed by scholars, the Institute of Medicine and consumer groups to find potential problems sooner by making information about potential dangers, both pre-approval and once the drug is on the market. These include: * Increasing access to information available, now, only to pharmaceutical companies by implementing anti-retaliation protections for potential whistleblowers * Requiring that sponsors pro-actively search for and turn over to the FDA all Drugs.aspx.500 Vol. 10:2 PUTTING PATIENTS F HST information which could lead to a conclusion that a recently released drug is causing harm not apparent to the FDA during its review process. * Requiring sponsors to notify patients that they are taking a recently approved product and provide a mechanism for them to quickly and easily report any unusual experiences, which may be attributable to the new product. * Monitoring the medical and pharmacy records of patients taking newly approved drugs to detect patterns of harmful side-effects or interactions. * Opening the door to the information obtained by the prescribing physicians by both requiring that all information acquired by the Sponsor through direct or indirect contact be reported to the FDA. * Making use of up-to-date bioinformatics techniques to survey all available data on new drug use that could indicate emerging problems. This article reviews the problems the FDA faces in getting the information it needs to protect the public's health after it approves a drug, device or biologic and then makes several proposals for stronger measures, all within the FDA's existing regulatory authority, to ensure that the FDA has access to the information it needs make evidence- based regulatory decisions. This article concludes that the current culture which differentiates between the importance of FDA oversight in approving the drug and FDA oversight post-approval is the cause of a persistent and often deadly failure to carry out its statutory mission of making sure that all drugs, devices and biologics subject to its regulation are both safe and effective for the patients who depend on them. However, the Sponsors who have spent billions in the development and approval process are501 2013 INDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW not likely to welcome a warning that a drug may pose unknown risks. II. SCOPE OF PROBLEM No one knows, with certainty, how many patients suffer harm that can be directly attributed to their having taken a recently approved drug, but common sense suggests that a previously unknown reaction is more likely to occur with a new drug. The FDA reports that there are over 2 million serious adverse drug reactions every year and among those 100,000 deaths. 10 It is often the case that a drug manufacturer knows of potential health concerns quite soon after the drug is available on the market. This is because problems emerge in the testing process and are not reported to the FDA, or because their network of representatives receive reports from prescribing physicians Although the FDA certifies drugs as \"safe and effective\" before allowing them on the market, they do so based on the information available to them at the time. It is, however, inevitable that issues will emerge over time as they are used by many more patients 11 and by patients with characteristics different from the subjects on which the drug was tested. Indeed, subjects in drug trials are often far less sick than those patients who will eventually be taking the drug once it is on the market.12 Thus, no matter how much 10 Kenneth Wu Wenchen and Nicholas Pantaleo, Evaluation of Outpatient Adverse Drug Reactions Leading to Hospitalization, 60 Am. J. HEALTH SYsT. PHARM. 3, 3 (2003). \"The growing number of newly approved drugs and the increased potency of these medications, coupled with the complex disease treatments, have contributed to the increased risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the ambulatory care setting.\" See Percha and Altman, supra note 3. 11 See Evans, 85 Notre Dame Law Review supra note 4 at 445 (\"premarket drug trials are simply too small to detect rare adverse events, yet even rare risks can generate large number of causalities once a drug is marketed to millions of people\"); Rodwin, supra note 2 at 514 (\"pre-market clinical trials use a sample that is too small to identify many of the adverse drug reactions that will occur in much larger populations\"). 12 Evans, 85 NOTRE DAME L. REV. supra note 4 at 448-449 (\"clinical trials admit subjects who are, on average, less likely to suffer adverse502 Vol. 10:2 PUTTING PATIENTS FIRST information a drug sponsor provides to the FDA in support of the drug's safety and effectiveness, once the drug is approved it can be prescribed by almost any physician for any medical condition.13 As a result, even if the FDA is aware of a potentially dangerous drug interaction and requires that drug sponsors warn against its use in these specific populations or in combination with other drugs, there is nothing to stop a physician from substituting his or her own judgment for that of the FDA and writing such a prescription. Without debating the merits of retaining these broad prescribing powers, it is self-evident that the practice of off-label prescribing makes it impossible for the FDA to conduct a safety and efficacy review relevant to all the people to whom the drug may be prescribed. There are two inherent characteristics of clinical trials which guarantee that products go on the market without complete information. The trials involve less people and cover a shorter period of time.14 Some attribute the short testing time to the 1992 Prescription Drug User Fee Act events than other people. High-risk patients are deliberately excluded from trials both for commercial reasons (to make the interventional drug look good) and for ethical reasons (to minimize risks to research subjects\") (citing Kenneth L. Melmon, ATTITUDINAL FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE UTILIZATION OF MODERN EVALUATIVE METHODS, IN INST. OF MED., MODERN METHODS OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION 135, 142 (Annetine C.

L.REV. 407 (2012) (Much of the publically available information on off-label prescriptions comes from the drug company's being caught and sued or prosecuted for their own efforts to expand their sales by engaging in the legal practice of promoting drugs for uses not approved by the FDA.

But in the case of a drug for a chronic condition that may be taken for decades, it would be impracticable to extend the approval period. Indeed, one study documented an adverse event that emerged 36 years after approval.16 As an article in the Journal of Clinical Oncology Nursing explains: Most phase II premarketing drug trials are statistically under-powered to detect adverse reactions, and treatment duration often is limited. In addition, patients in phase II trials are prescreened for safety, comorbidities, and concomitant drugs. Rare and serious events may occur after the drug is marketed and used in broader populations for longer durations.'7 By their nature, adverse events are less likely to occur during a clinical trial than when a drug is actually administered to a patient. The primary reason is one of time. Clinical trials are short-often lasting no more than 12 weeks. Moreover, the Sponsor itself determines the 15 U.S. FOOD & DRUG ADMIN., PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE ACT (PDUFA) IV: DRUG SAFETY FIVE-YEAR PLAN 2008-2012, at 2 (2008), at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Forlndustry/ Halquist, 877-886 (2008), available at http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/585694_2 (using as examples serious but delayed adverse effects of drugs intended to preserve the bones and increase red blood cells in patients undergoing chemotherapy which, instead, increased their risk of death) . 16 Ladewski, L.A., A., Kuzel, T.C., et al., Dissemination Of Information On Potentially Fatal Adverse Rug Reactions For Cancer Drugs From 2000 To 2002: First Results From The Research On Adverse Drug Events And Reports Project, J.

Another reason concerns the controlled circumstances under which clinical trials are conducted. Unlike patients taking a medication at home who make annual visits to their physician, subjects in trials are monitored very closely. Trends which might indicate potential adverse events, such as slowly rising blood pressure, can be identified before the occurrence of an adverse event. While petitioners are required to report subjects who drop out or who are excluded from a trial being submitted to support their application, it is often difficult to know why. Another, more general concern, is that a drug 18 Benjamin P.

As physician and law professor William M. Sage explained in his student note, \"extensive use in humans is the only way to measure safety or efficacy.\"24 There are many reasons why problems 21 See Trudo Lemmens and Candice Telfer, Access to Information and the Right to Health: The Human Rights Case for Clinical Trials Transparency, 38 Am.J.L. & Med 63,93 (\"a host of studies indicate that industry-sponsored trials are much more likely than other trials to conclude that drugs produced by the sponsoring company are safe and effective.\"). 22 For an account of the allegations and what is publically known regarding the settlement of a case involving a $2.5 million fine imposed on Glaxosmithkline for harm caused by the drug Paxil of which they were aware but did not report to the FDA, see Benjamin Falit, The Path To Cheaper And Safer Drugs: Revamping The Pharmaceutical Industry In Light Of Glaxosmithkline's Settlement, 33 J.

One of the most common is that the relatively small study population does not have the same characteristics of the patients who will be taking the drug.25 This is especially true of populations designed as \"vulnerable\" under federal law such as children and pregnant women. 26 The issue of a possibly non- representative study population is especially serious when a drug has been tested overseas. 27 For example, in withdrawing the approval of Meridia, a weight loss drug, Gerald Dal Pan, director of the FDA's Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology stated that, \"[t]he patients in the European SCOUT trial did not have the same characteristics as the patients for the approved indication in the United States; however, these results, combined with other available safety data raised serious questions about Meridia's safety for all patient groups.\" 28 Sidney Wolfe, head of Citizen's Action, a public interest organization often in strong opposition to pharmaceutical companies, stated that his organization had been asking the FDA to ban 25 See generally Scott Tillett, Off-Label Prescribing of SSRIS to Children: Should Pediatric Testing Be Required, or Are There Other Means To a Safer End for Children? 19 S.CAL.

Should a patient know that she is being prescribed a drug under FDA review after the drug has been banned in Europe? In 2011 and again in 2012 the Institute of Medicine issued reports detailing the harm caused by the FDA's lack of effective procedures for monitoring the safety and effectiveness of Medical Devices (2011)31 and then drugs (2012). 32 The Institute of Medicine's Committee inves- tigating the process of post-market approval put the problem in stark terms. Having outlined the many ways that these failures of post-market oversight had caused harm, it recommended that the FDA take a \"lifecycle approach\" to its task of making sure that the drugs prescribed to the public were both safe and effective.33 A key component of the \"lifecycle\" approach is to develop mechanisms for monitoring information about how the drug is actually working when administered to a large number of patients. The Committee premised its recommendations on the fact that they were all within the power granted the FDA by Congress in the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA),34 which provided the FDA with new regulatory tools including the authority to mandate at the time of approval 29 Bruce Japsen & Andrew Zajac, Abbot to withdraw diet drug Meridia, L.A.

In light of this authority, the Committee proposed a three-stage framework for the FDA to use in order to acquire post- market information and to conduct periodic post-market evaluations of the drug's risk-benefit profile.35 The committee's framework is based on giving priority to the perspective of the patient rather than on relying only on reports from physicians or drug companies.36 The Committee helpfully went further in its specific suggestions as to how the FDA could implement a more effective post-market review process. It suggested for each drug it approved, that the FDA develop a Benefit and Risk Assessment and Management Plan (BRAMP) that it could update whenever it re-evaluates a drug's benefit-risk 35 INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES, ETHICAL AND SCIENTIFIC ISSUES IN STUDYING THE SAFETY OF APPROVED DRUGS (2012), available at http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2012/Ethical-and-Scientific- Issues-in-Studying-the-Safety-of-Approved-Drugs.aspx (As the Institute of Medicine describes the process, \"[i]n the first stage (Stage I) of the framework, FDA should define the public health question that prompted the need for a regulatory decision, including identifying the specific characteristics of the drug and health problem at issue, available information about the drug, alternative treatments that are available, and plausible regulatory actions and their potential consequences. In the second stage (Stage II) of the framework, FDA should evaluate the quality of evidence on both the benefits and the risks associated with the drug, including any new information that has triggered the need to consider regulatory action. The output of this stage includes estimates of the likelihood and magnitude of a drug's benefits and risks and a characterization of the scientific evidence on which the estimates are based. The third stage (Stage III) of the framework is the stage in which regulatory decisions are made and implemented. This stage involves synthesizing and integrating the estimates of benefits and risks and the quality of the evidence on which these are based (from Stage II) with the public health question (as specified in Stage I); deciding on the appropriate regulatory actions, including whether further study should be required; communicating the decision; implementing the regulatory actions; evaluating the effects of the regulatory actions; and, particularly in the case of complex or difficult decisions, evaluating the decision-making process and the impact of the action taken on the public's health.\"). 3 6 Id.2013 509 INDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW profile.37 In this way, \"[t]he document would serve as a guide that supports organizational adherence to the lifecycle approach, increases the transparency of FDA's decisions, and fosters collaboration between FDA and drug sponsors.\"38 Explaining further the purpose of the BRAMP system, Eric M. Meslin, the director of the Indiana University Center for Bioethics who was a member of the committee, commented that the: FDA should be as serious about monitoring the safety of approved drugs on the market as it is about testing drugs before they get to the market. They already have a lot of this authority now -they just need to use it.39 Michelle M. Mello, also a committee member, wrote a commentary in the New England Journal of Medicine recognizing the general difficulty of keeping human subjects of medical research safe but concluded that that \"the IOM committee's report makes a number of actionable recommendations that the FDA can implement under its existing authority.\"40 III.

But because of the complexity of the human body and the large number of drugs already on the market, it is not possible to discover interactions. But it is also an issue of risk assessment-sponsors must weigh the cost of doing more and more testing against the likelihood of an adverse event occurring. As one commentator explains, \"[w]ill we catch all Drug interactions before marketing? Almost certainly not.\" But \"[s]hould we try to catch all of them, or proceed with the knowledge that one is going to slip by occasionally? That is a question for high-level risk-benefit-cost analysis within the pharmaceutical industry, with input from regulatory agencies.\" 42 Although the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) has the final authority to approve all drugs in the United States it does not often conduct the clinical trials which produce the data on which its decisions of the drug's safety and efficacy are based. That is the job of the sponsor.43 Instead, once clinical trials are completed, the FDA \"reviews the company's data and proposed labeling\" to determine if the \"drug's health benefits outweigh its own 41 See generally U.S. Department of Health & Human Services: Food & Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), Guidance for Industry Drug Interaction Studies-Study Design, Data Analysis, Implications for Dosing, and Labehng Recommendations (2012), available at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceCompliance Regulatorylnformation/Guidances/UCM292362.pdf. 42 Chris Bode, The Nasty Surprise of a Complex Drug-Drug Interaction, 15 DRUG DISCOVERY TODAY 391-39 (2010) http://dx.doi.org/ 10.1016/j.drudis.2010.02.013. 43 See BERNICE SCHACTER, THE NEW MEDICINES: How DRUGS ARE CREATED, APPROVED, MARKETED, AND SOLD (2006) at 9; Silence is Not the Best Medicine: Requiring Disclosure of Clinical Trial Data for Abandoned Drugs, 33 J.

According to former medical journal editor Richard Smith, \"[a]ll journals are bought-or at least cleverly used-by the pharmaceutical industry.\"46 Others think the substantial financial resources pharmaceutical companies bring to the trials improve the quality of the information available.47 It is the sponsors who develop the protocols under which the drugs are tested, pay the physicians and medical centers involved in the clinical trials, and analyze the data themselves.48 Then, when the results are positive, they write the journal articles which introduce the drug to the practicing physicians who will prescribe them to patients. Despite recent efforts to make the clinical trials process more transparent, a drug's sponsor still has no obligation to provide the FDA with all the information it has gathered during the course of pre- market drug development and clinical trials.49 There are at least three major categories of information that a sponsor does not have to disclose. As a private company, a pharmaceutical company is entitled to keep its drug development process confidential until it decides to initiate 44 Id. 45 Fazal Khan & Holloway supra note 13 at 422 (\"Pharma's control over the clinical-trial process results in a lack of transparency and, consequently, an unsafe environment for American consumers.

A Washington Post article written in 2004 suggested based on the few drug company trials in the registry that most sponsors were simply violating the law.52 More recent data does not document much change. Moreover, sponsors can and usually do require that doctors and scientists outside of their own companies who are involved in conducting the clinical trials sign strict confidentiality agreements.53 Failing to report the existence of, let alone the results from, unsuccessful clinical trials is only one of the ways in which sponsors withhold negative information from the FDA.54 Specifically, these non-disclosures include omitting 50 See Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355 (2006); 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.22(a) (2011) (outlining general requirements for IND submission).

This is something the FDA would probably notice because it requires Sponsors to identify potential groups of patients and provide the information relevant to that pool. If the FDA finds the information inadequate it can require that the sponsor collect more data or it can require that the absence of data be included on the drug's label.58 However, and the Sponsors are aware that once approved, it is likely that the product can be prescribed to any patient by any licensed physician for any reason. 59 Also, there is no requirement that when rules regarding clinical trials change sponsors go back and acquire this kind of information for drugs already on the market. Thus, a relatively recently approved drug like Lisinopril, which treats high blood pressure, has extensive information about its clinical trials. \"Black hypertensive patients (usually a low-renin hypertensive population) had a smaller average response to monotherapy than non-Black patients,\"60 but an older blood pressure medication like Serpalan makes no mention of racial differences.61 Extending whistleblower protection to company employees would increase the channels of information through which information of concerns arising during clinical trials could reach physicians and regulators before the circumstances under which the data were derived.

B. Getting Information From Health Care Providers 1. Prescribing Physicians The first line of defense in protecting the public from emerging dangers of newly approved drugs has to be the physicians who prescribe them. They are in the best position to learn of problems experienced by the patients. I propose that healthcare providers be brought more actively into the process of being alert to emerging problems from newly approved drugs by requiring them to report what they see. This reporting requirement should include any decision to stop prescribing a drug either because it was not effective or because of an emerging side effect. Although this may seem burdensome, in fact most prescribing physicians receive weekly visits from drug sponsors and can easily meet their obligations by reporting the information, which in turn the sponsor would then be required to report to the FDA. After a drug or device is approved, the sponsor's efforts shift from the FDA approval process to marketing their products directly to the physicians who will prescribe them to patients.63 Once the 62 See lan Ayers, Information Escrows, 111 UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW 145, 193 (2012) (proposing the creation of \"information escrows\" to counter the problem of physicians' and patients' reluctance \"to submit voluntary [adverse drug events] reports because they lack incentive to report and fear negative repercussions or embarrassment if prescription error or patient noncompliance is blamed.\"). 63 Joshua Weiss, Medical Marketing in the United States: A Prescription For Reform, 79 GEO.

It is these prescribing physicians who will have the most information about problems patients suffer after the drug is prescribed. For that reason, one of the most important sources of information about emerging post- market concerns with a prescription drug is the prescribing physician herself. First, because this is her patient she is most likely to be the one monitoring the effects of the drug. Second, in a large sense, if she has begun prescribing this drug to one patient it is reasonable to assume that she is prescribing it to others too and, depending on whether hers is a general or specialized practice, may well soon be following many patients. Since the same pharmaceutical representatives visit the same doctors, they are in the best position to hear of problems. As important as it is to bring information from physicians to the FDA for analysis, leading bioinformatics specialists Bethany Percha and Russ B. Altman explain that \"we cannot realistically expect practicing physicians to notice and document most DDIs on their own.\"69 This is because, \"[p]atients who take multiple drugs are often afflicted with multiple comorbidities, and it is difficult to determine whether adverse events are the result of side effects from a single drug, interactions between two or more drugs, or exacerbations of the patient's underlying disease(s).\" 70 Further, \"[t]he number of patients on a particular drug combination, especially within a single practice or hospital, may be small, preventing physicians from recognizing patterns of interactions within their own patient cohorts.\"7' Also, prescribing physicians may be only freebies to doctors' offices, a practice known as \"detailing.\") (footnotes omitted). 68 MARCIA ANGELL, THE TRUTH ABOUT DRUG COMPANIES: How THEY DECEIVE US AND WHAT TO Do ABOUT IT 122 (2005) (estimating $54 billion in marketing expenditures for 2001). 69 See generally Percha and Altman supra note 3. 70 Id. 71 Id.518 Vol. 10:2 PUTTING PATIENTS FIRST one of many health care providers a patient taking a newly prescribed drug sees. 2. Other Health Care Providers Since adverse events can take many different forms, a patient experiencing a problem may not contact the prescribing physician. Instead, he or she may mention the problem to another health provider, may visit a walk-in clinic, or even an emergency room. 72 Moreover, while physicians and hospitals are increasingly moving towards interoperable medical records, the goal of complete interoperability in the United States has not yet been reached. Thus, important information still has to come from the patient himself who may not be able to give an accurate chronology of when an individual medication was prescribed. The result can be serious and often preventable injury.73 Adverse events caused by drug interaction are a particular problem in the emergency room because the treating physicians are less likely to have access to the patient's medical records.

While providers are aware of many interactions and usually ask about them in a history, they are less likely to recognize a problem caused by a new drug. It is often only by reviewing large amounts of data that patterns of drug side effects emerge.74 For example, if a patient who receives a prescription for a new cardiac medication begins visiting an orthopedist it might signal the emergence of circulation issues instead of mere leg pain. Finally, patients may present emergency rooms with issues that may or may not be immediately attributed to the new drug. For these reasons it is important to track all contacts between a patient taking a new drug and the health care system. This includes patterns of office visits by patients who have begun taking a drug new on the market. It also includes pattern of prescriptions. Currently, a physician who begins to routinely prescribe stomach acid reducing drugs when she prescribes a new cholesterol medication is under no obligation to report this to the FDA and she may not immediately recognize the emerging pattern. Another issue involving all physicians is their potential reluctance to report adverse events for fear of suffering retaliation from the pharmaceutical companies. 75 Un- fortunately this is not uncommon. There are many documented cases of pharmaceutical companies engaging in deliberate activities to discredit physicians who they 74 John Markoff, Unreported Side Effects Of Drugs Are Found Using Internet Search Data, Study Finds, New York Times (March 6, 2013) http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/science/unreported-side-effects-of- drugs-found-using-internet-data-study-finds.html?_r-0&adxnnkl&adxnnlx- 1372008096-5YMEN+ntOpH54L2Q91qbwA (describing study of web searches by patients taking newly approved drugs which revealed side effects unknown to the FDA) (last visited June 23, 2013). 75 See Geneva Campbell (comment) Snitch or Savoir?

Tactics a pharmaceutical company might employ range from excluding physicians from lucrative consulting contracts to a more general campaign intended to reduce employment opportunities. 3. Pharmacies and Pharmacists Another important source of information for issues that arise post-approval is the pharmacy where a patient goes both to pick up prescription drugs and to self-medicate with drugs available without a prescription. These are often described as over-the-counter or OTC drugs. 76 At the pharmacy level, the FDA can make use of existing technology to monitor the pharmacy purchases by the patient who has been prescribed a new drug. 7 A little- studied area but one that raises many concerns is the interaction among all the substances ingested by an individual patient. The array of non-prescription medications and dietary supplements available to the American public in an ordinary drug store or supermarket is substantial. A recent example of how significant these interactions can be comes from studies conducted by academic researchers, not pharmaceutical companies, such as the effects of grapefruit juice in altering the way a variety of drugs are absorbed into the blood stream.

As Professor Rodney Miller explains in pointing out the short-comings of any post-market surveillance system, \"Discovery of 'adverse effects' will always lag behind the injuries that make their detection possible.

As commentator Bronwyn Mixter advised in BNA's Health Care Daily Report, \"This leaves the industry somewhat off the hook for reviewing internet sites that they do not sponsor.\"83 In the absence of guidance, the response of the pharmaceutical industry has been to retreat from social media in order to avoid acquiring information about potential adverse events. 84 As American Medical News reports: In August 2011, many pharmaceutical companies shut down Facebook pages- 82 U.S. Department of Health & Human Services: Food & Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), supra note 41 at 7. 83 Stuart L.

The companies cited a lack of FDA guidance on how to handle social media comments as their reason for shutting down the pages. Most vowed to keep their pages shut down until the FDA provided guidance on how comments be handled.85 The result is that pharmaceutical companies have no real duty to either correct misinformation or report adverse events if they, themselves, have not initiated the communication. Thus, a spokesman for an advertising agency representing pharmaceutical companies recently commented, \"'[ilt is not appropriate to simply bury your head ....The risk is not being aware of a potential public health risk' if people are distributing incorrect information about drug products,\" head burying is a legal option.86 D. Investing in Monitoring Technology Reviewing patients' medical records will reveal information about possible adverse effects beyond what could be achieved by waiting for any individual patient to file a complaint. Technology exists to monitor the first generation of the public who are prescribed a new medication for potentially serious medical events, which 85 Stuart L. Friedel and Joseph A.

A fully functioning interoperable system of electronic health records could track doctor's visits wherever and whenever they occur for references to symptoms or complaints, which could be an early sign of harm. It could also track pharmacy visits for purchases of non-prescription medications such as antacids or muscle soreness, which also may indicate adverse affects. Moreover, this kind of monitoring could catch the possible masking of symptoms through self- medication. Linking monitoring systems to research subjects or first generation consumers is well within the abilities of currently available technology. Pharmacies already track non-prescription purchases because, until recently, they were reimbursable under some employee benefit plans.88 Linking pharmacy records to a patient's already existing medical records would be a powerful step towards monitoring post-market adverse events. 89 Because this software will have access to complete medical records it will be possible to identify specific factors which correlate with side-effects such as co-morbidities or other drugs being taken.

E. Helping the FDA Make Use of the Information It Receives The last on the list of people and entities most likely to learn of adverse effects from a recently approved drug or device is the FDA. The FDA's limited oversight after a drug or device is approved and released on the market has been the topic of considerable and sustained criticism.90 In 2006, the Institute of Medicine issued two highly critical reports which cite \"a range of problems including chronic underfunding, insufficient regulatory authority, staff conflicts, and poor management ...[calling] for sweeping changes in the way the ...[FDA] monitors drug safety.\"91 The reports make specific recommendations for measures to gather information about potential harm as soon as possible from the insiders who have spoken with the doctors prescribing the drugs and the patients taking it.92 90 See generally, Jennifer S.

However, it is familiar with the concept of contracting with private companies for data mining services96 and there is already an industry in the private sector devoted to using their own, proprietary, software programs to analyze the FDA's own data.97 The central premise of this article is that the FDA should be using all its powers to develop systems intended to reduce the harm suffered by patients from problems that only emerge after a product is on the market. But within the reality of the FDA's funding base, it suggests that among these powers is the ability to shift the cost for these systems to those who stand to benefit financially from the product's success: its sponsor. Another thing the FDA could do is keep in closer contact with the drugs and devices used in the United States that are usually also distributed throughout the world. Many jurisdictions have their own adverse event tracking systems, but so far there is no systematic structure for cooperation. 98 Some of the most serious post-approval adverse events are the result of side effects from a single drug, interactions between two or more drugs, or exacerbations of the patient's underlying disease(s).\" 96 Jeryl Bier, FDA Seeks 'Data Mining and Targeting Software', The Standard (Jun http://www.weeklystandard.com/ software_736829.html 97 ADVERSEEVENTS.COM, http://www.adverseevents.com/about utilizes a data sourcing method called RxFilterTM, providing precise, standardized solutions for an accurate view of drugs safety issues reported to the FDA.

Moreover, Congress has already identified extending whistleblowing protection for employees of pharmaceutical companies as an important method of ensuring compliance with federal anti-fraud laws such as Dodd-Frank99 and the Affordable Care Act.100 Whistleblower protection must, then, extend to every individual who may come into contact with information about dangers to the public's health.

POLITICAL SCI.529 2013 INDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW 2 Models of Strong Whistleblower Protection in Recent Federal Statutes In the last ten years, there has been significant interest by Congress in extending protection to consumers from corporate fraud by developing new statutes, and amending old ones, that provide strong incentives for whistleblowers as well as greater protection from employer retaliation. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) exceeds all previous federal whistleblower statutes by actually requiring disclosure.102 It was enacted in response to a series of public scandals in which companies' outside lawyers and accountants failed to report what was obvious fraud and wrong-doing.103 Another enhancement to a whistleblowing statute is the provision of an incentive for a whistleblower such as is available in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Consumer Protection Act.104 Dodd-Frank amends both SOX1o5 and the False Claims Act06 to provide greater protection against retaliation for whistleblowers.07 REV. 249, 263 (2008) (While this article focuses on the task of bringing legal protection against retaliation, that is not to suggest that \"fear of retaliation\" is the only relevant factor as Michael Ting has developed a mathematical model identifying the key factors which affect a public employee's decision to disclose information and suggests that motivation depends on the characteristics of the organization itself so that no one set of incentives will be effective in every setting.). 102 See 18 U.S.C. \u00a71513(e) (2012) (SOX also has strong anti- retaliation provisions stating that it is unlawful for any company or individual to take any action with intent to retaliate against any person, for providing truthful information to law enforcement relating to the commission of a federal offense).

Using Active Surveillance The burden for reporting adverse events from prescription drugs is on the pharmaceutical company, not the prescribing doctor, the issuing pharmacist or the injured patient. In contrast, hospitals that receive Medicare funding are required by law to \"track medical errors and adverse patient events, analyze their causes, and implement preventive actions.\"109 In 2007 the Institute of Medicine (IOM) conducted a workshop to directly consider the challenges the FDA would face in the future addressing the issues of drug safety identified by the 2007 report. 110 Although the workshop covered many topics, it focused considerable attention on issues of post-market review. It made several recommendations for how the FDA could better use its resources to implement stronger protections. 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376-2223. 108 See 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 42121(b)(2)(B)(iv) (2012). See also Collins v. Beazer Homes USA, Inc., 334 F.

The Workshop Summary explained why the Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) was inadequate. It noted that the AERS consisted of data from three datasets: \"[1] averse event data reported voluntarily through MedWatch (generally by physicians, other health care practitioners, and consumers), [21 mandatory periodically reported data from product manufacturers, and [3] mandatory 7- and 15-day expedited report data from manufacturers following notification of a serious and unexpected adverse event.\"113 However, there is no obligation on the part of manufacturers to actively seek out information about adverse events and no division of the FDA is tasked with the responsibility of conducting active surveillance. As a result there are frequently long delays between the emergence of a problem and the FDA awareness of it. While this passive surveillance system may be capable of detecting rare serious adverse events, it has several limitations, including profound underreporting, biased reporting, and difficulties in attributing an adverse event to a specific drug. Additionally, when analyzing postmarket epidemiological data collected through passive surveillance, it is difficult to know just how many people have taken a drug (i.e., to determine a denominator), it is difficult to know how many events occurred (i.e., to determine the numerator) because of underreporting, and therefore it is difficult to conclude the rate at which an event would take 111 Id. at 91. 112 Id. at 92. 113 Id. at 33.532 Vol. 10:2 PUTTING PATIENTS FIRST place (e.g., event x would occur in 1 of every 100,000 persons).\"114 4. Monitoring Harm and Protecting Whistleblowers through Bioinformatics The FDA is aware that the future of effective monitoring for adverse events is through innovations in bioinformatics. Bioinformatics is \"a field devoted to the creation and application of computational methods for the acquisition, representation, retrieval, and analysis of biomedical data.\" 115 In 2008 it adopted the Sentinel Initiative, described as: A national electronic system that will transform FDA's ability to track the safety of drugs, biologics, and medical devices once they reach the market ... .[The Sentinel Initiative aims to develop and implement a proactive system that will complement existing systems that the Agency has in place to track reports of adverse events linked to the use of its regulated products.116 It is increasingly clear that much of the information the FDA needs to identify possibly harmful, and previously unknown, side effects is available through data analysis. This includes both information and data bases designed to track adverse events as well as mining existing electronic sources, such as social media, for evidence of problems. For example, in a 2010 study researchers tracking the web searches of over six million users were able to find evidence that \"an antidepressant, paroxetine, and a cholesterol lowering drug, pravastatin\" when combined \"caused high 114 Id 115 Russ Altman, Real Quick: What is Bioinformatics?, WORDPRESS.COM WEBLOG (Apr. 8, 2013, 3:00 http://rbaltman. wordpress.com/real-quick-what-is-bioinformatics/. 116 FDA Sentinel Initiative, FDA.Gov, http://www.fda.gov/safety/ FDAsSentinellnitiative/ucm2007250.htm (last visited Apr. 22, 2013).2013 533 INDIANA HEALTH LAw REVIEW blood sugar.\" 117 Their methodology was to \"[d]etermine people who searched for both drugs during the 12-month period\" and found that searchers \"were significantly more likely to search for terms related to hyperglycemia than were those who searched for just one of the drugs. (About 10 percent, compared with 5 percent and 4 percent for just one drug.)\"118 But where is this information and how can the FDA access it? Members of the IOM advisory panel had several answers to the first question and few to the second. As a first principle, in order to identify patterns of adverse events a system would have to monitor a large number of people. One member of the IOM advisory committee estimated that the minimum number of people monitored in order to have sufficient statistical power would be 100 million.119 They pointed out that the federal government already tracks the health of millions of Americans through Medicare, the Veteran's Administration, the Department of Defense, Federal Employee health care and, to a lesser extent, Medicaid. 120 While the government itself could decide to share this information with the FDA, the bigger issue relates to the private sector. Health insurance companies have long maintained their own proprietary databases of claims information, which, if accessed, could provide early indications of potential problems.121 One way into that information is to incorporate sharing of deindentified data into the current HIPAA-HiTECH laws that mandate nearly all hospitals and physicians to use interoperable electronic medical record systems. Thus, the FDA could have access to the claims health care providers are making to insurance companies rather than getting the information from the companies themselves. 117 Markoff, supra note 74.

First, it can directly monitor the health of individuals who are taking a specific drug and second it can create a safe way for whistleblowers to report suspicions of wrongdoing without fear of retaliation. An anonymous reporting system obviates the need for relying on traditional anti-retaliation measures because it prevents the whistleblower from ever needing this protection. He or she can be anonymous. The best way to encourage whistleblowing and to avoid retaliation is to provide a secure channel for anonymous reporting as well as to set up self-monitoring systems that reduce the need for relying on individual reportingl24.This technology has also been used for both public health and biodefense purposes.125 122 See THOMAS L.

This is not a new idea. However, in order for such a system to work, all entities that collect health information must invest in systems which can share the information. 5. Technology to Encourage Information Sharing The best way to encourage whistleblowing and to avoid retaliation is to provide a secure channel for anonymous reporting as well as to set up self-monitoring systems that reduce the need for relying on individual reporting.130 This 128 Noam N.

And once reports are entered, they are littered with misspellings, misclassifications, incomplete entries, and incompatible file formats that make it extremely difficult to search the database. Those barriers have made it tough for the FDA, or anyone else, to spot the early warning signs of a dangerous drug until millions of people have been exposed, creating front-page scandals and highly litigious cases like the ones with the pain reliever rofecoxib (Vioxx) and the diabetes drug rosiglitazone (Avandia).\"). 130 See Segala, supra note 124.

These are the kinds of systems which promise to recognize patterns long before large numbers of patients are affected.133 This is consistent with the federal goal that electronic health information should serve the function of \"improving health or reducing health care costs, protocol development, case management and care coordination, contacting of healthcare providers and patients with information about treatment alternatives; and related functions that do not include treatment.\"134 This could be a feature of the new laws requiring the development of interoperable health systems records. 135 Because this software will have access to complete medical records it will be possible to identify specific factors which correlate with side-effects such as co-morbidities or other drugs being taken. In time, this may well rise to the level of monitoring the effectiveness of newly released drugs depending on specific genetic characteristics of future patients. A self-executing monitoring system overseeing newly- approved drugs would work like a public health surveillance system which alerts responders to clusters of unusual symptoms which could indicate an outbreak of a serious disease whether natural or launched as a bio-weapon.136 133 See e.g., Sharona Hoffman & Andy Podgurski, Improving Health Care Outcomes Through Personalized Comparisons of Treatment Effectiveness Based on Electronic Health Records, 39 J.

The first is that, like any method of compiling information, the quality of the results will only be as good as the information put into them.137 The advantage of using these interoperable health records is that the software would be scanning the real time health information from hospitals as well as doctor's offices, clinics, and other locations. It could then send warning alerts to investigatory units of the designated agency.138 7 Barriers to Expanding Access to Information A post on the popular blog Pharmalot reporting a recent case in which an employee at Merck was awarded $555,000 for retaliation she suffered after refusing to use her company credit card to pay for another employee's adverse-events-social-media-pharmas-biggest-brands/ (discussing how the number of reportable adverse events is manageable and less common than people think and for many pharmaceutical companies, it would be difficult, but not impossible to do this monitoring in house, as some automatic filtering could simplify things.

Even the largest brands have manageable numbers of adverse events, eliminating the fear companies have that it may be a daunting task to monitor everything.). 137 There is an extensive literature on the dangers posed by electronic medical records system.

Accepting Anonymous Complaints If the goal of implementing a whistleblower protection system is to improve the public's health by bringing to light safety concerns about new drugs, then it is important to create a system where those with knowledge can come forward without fear of retaliation One of the most effective ways of protecting whistleblowers is to permit anonymous reporting. 144 Yet, both the government and private industry have been very reluctant to do so. None of the federal whistleblower programs overseen by the Office of Special Counsel accept anonymous reporting. 145 The Office of Special Counsel, http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(11)70180- 2/fulltext.; Rich Daly, Grassley Queries FDA Chief on Retabation Violations, MODERNHEALTHCARE.COM (Feb. 2, 2012, 5:15 PM), http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20120202/NEWS/302029962#. 143 Withdra wal from the Market of Vioxx Arthritis Pain Medication.

The issue is not one of logistics. Technology to provide anonymous electronic complaint boxes is easily available and not expensive.147 Rather, the reasons given have been substantive. Anonymous reporting has come under considerable criticism from those who argue that anonymity encourages reporting by those motivated to harm the company, not necessarily to benefit the public. 148 In contrast, commentators focused on health & safety concerns are less concerned about motives.149 under the penalty of perjury.

Normative Arguments Reviewing the arguments of those objecting to these proposals on normative, as opposed to operational, grounds requires the creating of a taxonomy of protesters which sifts out those with general objections to increased governmental regulations or who are satisfied with the safety standards achieved by existing regulation from those who believe that regulating human subject research and drug safety is an appropriate activity for the Federal Government and that the current system is not working in a way they find acceptable, but still disagree with strengthening and extending whistleblower protections for those with inside knowledge. Any such effort at anticipating and addressing normative objections must start with the existence of a serious problem: adding layers of regulation costs money. I know of no political theory or moral code endorsing the imposition of expensive regulation in the absence of a proportionately serious harm. Therefore, the need for expanded regulation is based on the proposition that neither current regulation nor the free market is providing sufficient protection to consumers of prescription drugs from dangers that emerge after FDA approval. It is further based on the fact that a large portion of the public in the United States has or will take prescription drugs. Therefore, the cost of this regulation satisfies what Russell B. Korobokin describes in Libertarian Welfarism the \"the requirement of Kaldor-Hicks efficiency otherwise known as cost-benefit analysis. That is, the beneficiaries of the regulation should gain enough so that they could fully compensate those who are burdened.\"154 154 See Russell B. Korobkin, Libertarian Welfarism, 97 CAL. L. REV. 1651, 1671-72 (2009) (citing RICHARD A. POSNER, ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF LAW 13 (7th ed.2007) and Matthew D. Adler, Beyond Efficiency and Procedure: A Welfarist Theory of Regulation, 28 FLA. ST. L. REV. 241, 244-46 (2000)) (laying out the principles of this theory in the process of developing his own theory of reducing paternalism while still providing a welfare state).545 2013 INDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW To effectively provide sufficient protection it is necessary to first identify and set aside general objections that apply to any kind of increased regulation, and then confront those specific to this proposal. The state's general authority to regulate prescription drugs comes from the social contract theory as advanced by John Stuart Mill, which asserts that when individuals seek the benefit of living together in a society, they give up some of their individual rights. Applying this theory to justify a state's right to prohibit access to pornography, Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote that \"our Constitution establishes a broad range of conditions on the exercise of power by the States, but for us to say that our Constitution incorporates the proposition that conduct involving consenting adults only is always beyond state regulation, is a step we are unable to take.\"55 The question then becomes how to identify the least intrusive method of regulation that results in acceptable standards of safety for those involved in drug testing or for consumers. Having cleared the conceptual hurdle of federal regulation of medical research, these proposals face the far more specific concerns of those espousing the kind of free market views increasingly ascribed to the late President Ronald Reagan. These critics may accept the need for some regulation and may even be dissatisfied with current levels of safety, but still believe that this is the kind of problem best left to the marketplace. While the objections listed above reflect the reasoned views, I suggest to them that their philosophical objections to government regulation and the value they put on an orderly work-place do not outweigh the greater claim of measures to reduce unnecessary deaths in the process of developing and marketing the very products which are supposed to improve health. Whatever interests are balanced on the side of less regulation are weak in comparison to the extent of the harm. Because of the enormous amount of money involved, drug research is a paradigm of an activity where serious inequality of 155 Paris Adult Theater I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 68 (1973).546 Vol. 10:2 PUTTING PATIENTS FIRST resources makes it impossible for any single consumer to exercise the kind of power needed to force improved safety. 1. Positivist Arguments The proposals made in this article are vulnerable to all the general arguments against increased governmental regulation as well as ones specific to medical research.156 These can be summarized as objections based on cost, constitutionality, efficacy157, as well as normative concerns about the desirability of increased whistleblower protection. The discussion below goes beyond the general concerns that could be raised about any new regulatory proposal; but further considers requiring that applicants for permission to market new drugs certify that they have provided accessible and effective methods for anyone with information about a possible danger to the public's health to bring these concerns to the FDA's attention. 2. Cost-Benefit Analysis While it is beyond the scope of this article to engage directly in a cost-benefit analysis of a law to increase the protection of pharmaceutical company employees in order to encourage them to bring forward information about potential dangers from drugs and devices, it is important to review what such an analysis would involve and who would 156 For a discussion of the intrinsic difficulties of changing the law without considering information from other disciplines about its likely effect on human behavior see Peer Zumbansen, Rethinking The Nature Of The Firm: The Corporation As A Governance Object, 35 SEATTLE U. L. REV. 1469, 1479-80 (2012) (\"We must remain aware of the continuously mounted challenges of law's empire, as they are promulgated by economists, sociologists, geographers, or anthropologists, just to name a few of the disciplines with a keen interest in law as a governance tool.\"). 157 Kristin E. Hickman & Claire A. Hill, Concepts, Categories, and Compliance in the Regulatory State, 94 MINN. L. REV. 1151, 1154 (2010) (arguing that it is difficult to predict whether or not a new regulation will result in the desired effect because \"[rlegulated parties then adjust their behavior, but again not necessarily in ways that regulators expect or want.\").2013 547 INDIANA HEALTH LAW REVIEW conduct it. All proposals to change the law must address the issue of the cost of change in relation to the benefit achieved. 158 Congress sends proposed laws to federal agencies and to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) which \"provides formal written estimates of the cost of virtually every bill 'reported' (approved) by Congressional committees to show how it would affect spending or revenues over the next 5 or 10 years, depending on the type of spending involved.\"159 This law would fall under the category of a \"life-saving\" regulation. 160 A cost-benefit analysis, then, requires the balancing of human lives saved that can be attributed to a drug versus lives lost. Second, there are two different sources of cost. The first issue is the cost of administering and enforcing a new whistleblower protection program. Whether this is done by an existing federal agency, a new federal agency, or contracted to a private organization, the cost of running this program should be shouldered by those who stand to profit from the drugs developed. Developing pharmaceutical products for sale on the U.S. market is such a profitable activity that a whistleblower monitoring and protection program could be funded by the pharmaceutical companies themselves as part of the cost of getting FDA approval.161 Also, pharmaceutical companies already pay the FDA 158 Richard 0.

Steele, Wy Drugs Cost So Much, TIME (Feb. 2, 2004), available at http://www.time.com/time/magazine/ article/0,9171,993223-2,00.html (\"[Tihe pharmaceutical industry is--and has been for years--the most profitable of all businesses in the U.S. In the annual FORTUNE 500 survey, the pharmaceutical industry topped the list of the most profitable industries, with a return of 17% on revenue.\").548 Vol. 10:2 PUTTING PATIENTS FIRST directly to fund extra staff in order to provide expedited review of their applications and can well absorb the costs of a whistleblower program.162 The second issue involving cost is that any cost to the pharmaceutical companies will be passed on to the consumer in the form of higher drug prices. This is a serious concern and an unfortunate consequence of the U.S.'s decision not to control the price of pharmaceuticals or even, in the case of Medicare, to bargain for lower costs. However, a 2010 study commissioned by the New England Journal of Medicine concludes that whistleblowers at pharmaceutical companies are not motivated by money, but rather a genuine interest in the public's welfare and the success of the company.163 If true, it is likely that greater protection will encourage whistleblowers and it will not be necessary to provide substantially increased amounts of money. Finally, many of these new federal programs providing financial incentives have come under attack by the business community for interfering with internal compliance operations. 164 The argument goes that if employees have federal monetary incentives to \"blow the whistle\" they will by-pass existing quality assurance programs operated by the companies themselves. Recent research has disproved this concern.165 162 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), 21 USCA \u00a7 379(h) (2000); see also Prescription Drug Fee Act (PDUFA), FDA.GOV (Dec. 12, 2012), http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/UserFees/Prescription DrugUserFee/default.htm. 163 Aaron S.

Criticisms Based on Efficacy Just as drugs must be both safe and effective, any system to improve post-market safety must also demonstrate efficacy. In other words, if granted this power can the FDA make use of them to effectively to protect the public's health? Professor Peter Schuck has described this question as \"the 800-pound gorilla in the room\" in that \"many critics denounce the agency's enforcement activity as lax and inadequate\" with \"some go[ing] so far as to claim that the regulated industries have \"captured [the FDA]\" thus making it impossible for it to regulate effectively.166 Facts support this suspicion. A recent analysis of industry influence over Congress found pharmaceutical companies first on the list.167 Pharmaceutical companies spent over $250 million lobbying Congress in 2009 Americans for Campaign Reform reports that in 2008 these contributions were distributed widely with each \"member of the House ...received an implementing the Whistleblower provisions of Section 21F of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the National Whistleblowers Association, not of course an impartial source, submitted a report based on a study considering its likely \"impact on corporate compliance programs.\" Id.

First, the actual amount of information about dangers to the public's health has to increase and second, the FDA has to make use of the information. There is no guarantee that simply providing information will increase safety. Indeed, a study at Johns Hopkins found that 96% of warnings issued by a hospitals' internal prescription monitoring software were ignored.169 These sums are not surprising given the profitability of the industry and the fact that these profits depend directly on the decisions Congress makes in the area of patents, consumer protection, health and safety. It is reasonable to assume that any legislation that erodes their profits will be met with full force opposition of the pharmaceutical industry through their lobbyists. However, seeking reforms will educate consumers about the dangers they face and lay a foundation for future reform efforts. Stricter laws protecting whistleblowers in the United States might also backfire by encouraging the already prevalent practice of exporting medical research overseas. It is therefore important that any proposed legislation close this loophole by requiring the FDA to monitor companies seeking to market drugs, vaccines or medical devices in the United States to make sure they have a documented program for protecting scientists conducting basic research. V.

Since the first cases challenging the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 (PFDA), which is the precursor of today's laws granting regulatory authority to the FDA, the Supreme Court has consistently upheld Congress' authority to preempt state regulation of food and drug safety.170 A. Federalism The classic argument opposing all efforts to extend federal regulation is essentially one based on the concept of federalism which means that states, rather than the federal government, are in the best position to protect the health and safety of their citizens.171 As Dean Erwin Chemerinsky explains, \"throughout American history, and especially in the 1990s, federalism has been used by conservatives as a way of trying to limit government power. In other words, conservatives have used federalism as a procedural way of blocking substantive reforms with which they disagree.\"172 Ours is a nation where the federal, or central, government has limited powers and cannot impose its will on the states.173 Congress has the authority to act under limited 170 See generally, Schacter supra note 43 at 15-20 (recounting history of how the FDA came to regulate human drugs); see also Howard L.

Brophy, Presumption of Innocence: FDA's Authority to Regulate the Specifics of Prescription Drug Labeling and the Preemption Debate 61 Food & Drug Law Journal 585 (2006)(history of Supreme Court upholding Congress' authority to regulate food and drugs). 171 See generally Erwin Chemerinsky, Reconceptualizing Federalism, 50 N.Y.L. SCH. L. REV. 729, 735, 754 (Strongly rejecting interpreting the Constitution in a way that blocks government action, stating that \"[c]onstitutional doctrines about federalism should focus on how to empower each level of government with the necessary authority to deal with the complex problems of the 21st century.\"). 172 Id. at 735. 173 See Buckley v.

First, Congress may act if it is directly authorized by the Constitution. If not, Congress may only act if the Supreme Court has recognized the proposed exercise of power, or one very like it, as a permissible exercise of federal power. Because there is nothing in the Constitution about protecting the public's health, the Supreme Court found that the police powers of the States, not the federal government, may embrace legislation designed to promote the public's health and welfare. 174 Therefore, we must look to the more general provisions regarding what Congress can do in the face of objections by one or more states. The most likely source of congressional power to regulate prescription drugs is found in the power the Constitution gives Congress in Article I, Section 8 to regulate commerce.75 In other words, Congress has the authority to protect against the dangers of prescription drugs by requiring compliance with regulations intended to provide that protection. Congress' power under the Constitution to regulate the pharmaceutical companies is even more direct than its spending power because the entire pharmaceutical industry depends on having exclusive access to particular drugs through the patent system over which Congress has direct authority.176 Congress' first power is to award patents, a power enumerated in the Constitution.77 other\"). 174 Chicago B. & 0.

B. Conflict with Existing State Laws: Pre-emption Since regulation of prescription drugs and devices is subject to federal, not state, regulation the FDA's adoption of further protections against post-approval harm cannot run afoul of any state law. States have no say in how the FDA oversees drug safety. However, a series of decisions by the Supreme Court interpret the availability of a private right of action based in state law should a patient be harmed by either a device or drug after FDA approval.178 In Riegel v. Medtronic, the Court held that in granting the FDA exclusive jurisdiction over medical devices, Congress intended to deprive plaintiffs of state tort remedies caused by a defective product.179 Therefore, a patient who claims promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries\"); see generally, Michael W.

The Court in Wyeth v. Levine, however, found a lack of a specific preemption of state action in the FDCA, which gives the FDA authority to regulate prescription drugs. 180 It reached the conclusion that in granting the FDA authority to regulate prescription drugs, but not explicitly precluding a state law remedy Congress did not intend to limit the remedy of patients harmed by them.181 In the absence of Congress explicitly adding Medtronic type preclusion language, patients who are harmed by prescription drugs can pursue a private right of action. In extending whistleblower protection to pharmaceutical company employees, then, Congress could resolve this conflict by making clear that it intends to include information about all products developed, manufactured or requirement applicable to the device under this chapter.\"). 180 Wyeth v.

VI. CONCLUSION It is inevitable that information about the safety and efficacy of prescription drugs approved for sale to the public by the FDA will emerge once larger numbers of patients start taking the drugs outside the controlled setting of a clinical trial. The short time in which most prescription drugs are tested before they go on the market effectively transforms those patients prescribed drugs newly approved by the FDA into research subjects. Yet unlike research subjects who are protected by laws which monitor their safety, there are no special legal protections for patients taking newly approved drugs. This article has considered the concerns of regulators, the medical community, patient advocates and academics and proposes several additional ways to increase safety by increasing the amount of information available to the FDA. This article proposes shifting the burden of identifying post-market problems to drug sponsors. It also proposes steps to increase the flow of information from the health care community and patients themselves. Sponsors must take on more responsibility for gathering information and bringing it to the FDA. This includes providing explicit protections for their employees and contractors with inside information, whistleblowers, to bring their knowledge directly to the FDA. It also proposes that healthcare providers take on affirmative obligations to report adverse events from new drugs. Although this may seem burdensome, in fact most prescribing physicians receive weekly visits from drug sponsors and can easily meet their obligations by reporting the information, which in turn the sponsor would then be 182 See Kostecka, supra note 180.556 Vol. 10:2 PUTTING PATIENTS FIRST required to report to the FDA. This reporting requirement should include any decision to stop prescribing a drug either because it was not effective or because of an emerging side effect. For patients, this article suggests that they be explicitly informed both that they are taking a newly approved drug and that they either be required or at least strongly urged to agree to increased surveillance of their interactions with the health care system, including purchases of non- prescription drugs. While simply advising patients to be aware of the likelihood that information about the drug they are taking will emerge after it is prescribed can increase awareness, it may not be possible for any individual to appreciate that ostensibly unrelated symptoms, such as leg cramps, might be an emerging, and perhaps dangerous, side effect of the new drug. Finally, it proposes creating an official period of post- market surveillance for all newly approved products, not just ones which the FDA determines may pose particular risks.183 Without structural change that shifts the burden of drug safety onto the sponsors, we cannot have a system of regulation that puts patients first. 183 Margaret Z.
