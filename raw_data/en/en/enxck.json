Introduction Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a group of diverse medical and health care interventions,practices, products or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine. 1Scientic literature indicates an increased interest in complementaryand alternative medicine (CAM) among the general public and a tendency towards increased use, especially in patients with chronic diseases. 2Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a growing industry in the health caresystem, and the use of CAM in health care is rapidly evolving. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the USA (NCCAM) denes CAMas a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine. 3A national survey in the United States in 1993 stated that one in three adults use some sort of CAM.4More recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for HealthStatistics reported that 62% of 31,044 adults surveyed usedsome form of CAM in the previous 12 months. 2 A study conducted in Malaysia showed that there was a high prevalence of CAM use by the population, particularlythe use of herb-based therapies for health issues. 5 A study conducted in Ajman, United Arab Emirates, showed that approximately one-third of the seekers of modernmedicine care also use CAM, mostly without physician advice. 6CAM is used widely for treatment of chronic diseases in many parts of the world. In a study conducted in theMuscat region of Oman, almost half of the patients used CAM therapies for diabetes mellitus, and they had a strong faith in its effectiveness in treating patients. 7 Attitudes and perceptions of medical students towards CAM in many countries were generally positive, and many stated that CAM includes ideas and methods from whichWestern medicine could benet. The lack of evidence sup- porting CAM practices was considered to be the major barrier toward more students using CAM and advising their patients to use CAM in the future.8e10Involving CAM in the medical student curricula is a growing concern worldwide; in a study conducted in Washington, more than 75% of medical students stated that CAM should be included in the medicalcurricula, and 79% agreed that clinical care should integrate conventional medicine and CAM practices. With gradual scientic development and increased popularity, thereappears to be a need for coordinated policy in integratingCAM into all medical curricula by taking the expectations and feedback of medical students into consideration in setting educational standards. In the United States ofAmerica, many CAM-based therapies, such as dietary sup- plements, massage, herbs and homoeopathic medicines, were used by medical students. Signicant gender differences inattitude were observed, with male students having more conservative attitudes toward CAM use; however, a high percentage of students desired more training in CAM. 10 In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, little research has addressed the satisfaction, use and perceptions of medical students towards complementary and alternative medicine. In the kingdom, there is no CAM-specialized track or post-graduate education in any health college. Eleven (12.2%) colleges offer CAM courses in their curricula. Fifteen (16.7%) colleges teach topics related to CAM in differentstudy subjects. Five (5.6%) colleges conducted continuous medical education (CME) activities related to CAM. Among faculty members, there were only 16 CAM specialistsworking in seven colleges and 84 interested staff members working in 20 colleges. 11 In a study conducted in KSA among pharmacists, 72.6% were satised with CAM and 79.4% indicated that theywould recommend CAM to family and friends. Eighty-one per cent of pharmacists felt that they had inadequate skills and knowledge to counsel patients and 90.5% felt the pro-fessional curricula should have more components on CAM. 12Introduction of CAM in the curricula of medical colleges is new in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, soknowledge about students' perception and satisfaction regarding CAM is important for planning and setting priorities and strategies. The objectives of the study were to determine the level of medical students' satisfaction with studying CAM, to assess their perceptions towards studying CAM and to determinetheir self-use of different CAM modalities. Materials and Methods The study used a descriptive institutional-based design. The population was the rst and the second batches ofmedical students in the College of Medicine, Majmaah University, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Majmaah, which is located in the centre of the kingdom, is one ofRiyadh region's provinces and lies 180 km from the capital Riyadh. 13The college of Medicine was established in 2010 and adopted an innovative outcome-based curriculum inmedical education. 14The college introduced CAM as a core module in the curriculum for semester six students. The course is introductory and in intended to provide anM.A. Al Mansour et al. 75overview of CAM practices that have been conducted with the cooperation of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). The sample size included total enumeration (69) of the rst and second batches of medical students who studded the module on CAM. The data were collected using a pre-tested questionnaire after obtaining written informed consents. Thequestionnaire was composed of questions regarding percep- tions, use and satisfaction of the students with studying CAM; it also included their suggestions to improve the module. TheSPSS for Windows software, version 20 (SPSS, Chicago, Illi-nois, USA) was employed to analyse the data. Frequencies and percentages were used for qualitative variables. Results Figure 1 shows the satisfaction of the students about studying CAM. Thirty (43%) students were satised withstudying CAM. Seventeen (25%) and 22 (32%) were neutral and dissatised, respectively. Regarding use of CAM modalities by medical students, results showed thatthe most important modalities used were prayers (46students or 66.7%), herbal products (42 students or 60.9%), massage (32 students or 46.4%), nutritional supplements (29 students or 42.0%), acupuncture (24students or 34.8%) and aromatherapy (17 students or 24.6%), as shown in Table 1 . In response to the perceptions of the medical students about studying CAM, 43 (62%) will utilize CAM knowledge in the future, 29 (42%) stated that knowledge gained improved their ability of thinking and problem solving, 35(51%) improved their skills in team working and 35 (51%)improved their effective communication. The mean of the perceptions was 52%, as shown in Table 2 . Discussion The level of satisfaction of the medical students in studying CAM was 43%. This seems to be low and may bedue to the new experience because this was the rst time that CAM was studied by medical students within the curriculum in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Students are familiar withWestern medicine; therefore, they may not accept studyingCAM, which they think is related to traditional medical practices. Lack of evidence supporting CAM practices wasconsidered to be the major barrier towards studying and using CAM. 15These ndings are in line with Yildirim Y et al., who found that the satisfaction of medical students regarding CAM is low among medical students and lowercompared with nursing students. 16This level of satisfaction is also lower than the nding among pharmacists in the KSA, of whom 72.6% were satised with CAM.12 Regarding the staff members, they were more satised with the CAM training offered at their schools.17Comparing medical students' satisfaction with patients' satisfaction regarding CAM, although the patients' perceptions of itsoverall effectiveness is low, those who do use CAM still have high levels of satisfaction. 18e20 The results showed that the most common CAM mo- dalities used by the medical students were prayers, herbal products, massage nutritional supplements and acupuncture. These ndings are in line with the ndings of a survey con-ducted to explore the use, knowledge and attitudes towardcomplementary and alternative medicine (CAM) among pharmacy students at the college of pharmacy, King Saud University, where herbal medicine, nutrition, massage,relaxation exercises, yoga and mega-dose vitamin were the most CAM used by the students. 21This may be explained by the fact that all students are Muslims and prayers are justiedas the rst modality used by the students.

These ndings contradict the results of a study conducted in University of Texas, where the most common therapies used weremassage, deep breathing exercises, yoga, chiropractic care and meditation. 22 The results showed that 43 (62%) of the students will utilize the CAM knowledge that they learned in the future. This nding is less than the ndings of a study conducted in Ireland, the United States, Turkey and Saudi Arabia, wheremost medical students had positive attitudes towardsstudying CAM and are willing to utilize CAM in the future. 8e10In studies conducted in Canada and Malaysia, medical students showed lower propensities for futureutilization of CAM compared with students from other disciplines. 23,24 The results showed that 29 (42%) of the medical students stated that the CAM module helped them improve their ability to think and solve problems. The present study showed that the CAM module improved the skills of half ofthe students in team-work. Thirty-ve (51%) of the studentsstated that the CAM module helped them to improve effective communication and team-work. This may be explained by the challenges facing CAM education: thedifculty in specifying measurable objectives, identifying valid indicators and evaluatin g the attainment of desired outcomes. 25 Conclusion This study has shown that there is an overall low satis- faction among the medical students regarding CAM as a partof the medical curriculum. The most commonly self-usedCAM modalities by the medical students were prayers, herbal products, massage, nutritional supplements and acupuncture. The perception of the medical students towardsstudying CAM is average because more students still need to accept CAM for CAM to be considered as an important part of the healthcare system.
