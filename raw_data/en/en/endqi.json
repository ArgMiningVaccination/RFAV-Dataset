And the second wished that he might ever remain where he was to behold the land and the beauty of it, and to do naught else. And the third wished to live to an exceeding old age. . . . When Glooskap had heard what these visitors wished for, he called Earthquake, and bid him take them all three and put them with their feet in the ground. And he did so, [and] they at once became three trees.1 Wabanaki identity is embedded in the natura l world - as suggested by this legend and many others, including a creation story that tells how Wabanaki people sprang out of an ash tree when Glooskap shot arrows at the tree. Traditional Wabanaki belief held that all of creation was sacred, filled with a spiritual force known as manitou (variously spelled). Some plant and animal species were especially valued because they were used for food, medicine or to make things needed in everyday life. With great inventiveness, Wabana kis utilized an array of flora and fauna as raw materials to create a host of items fundamental to their material culture - from sinew thread and bone needles to rope made from plant fibers, canoes constructed of birchbark or moosehide, snowshoes framed with ashwood and corded with rawhide or gut, deerskin clothing decorated with moosehair embroidery, and sealskin or moosehide moccasins trimmed with porcupine 1 Illustration and legend excerpt from Leland 1884, pp.94-98. Several variations of this story exist. Chapter 14: Material Culture Uses of Plants & Animals 386 Among animal species, the moose (Alces alces ) was especially valued for its many uses. From food to medicine, from mooseskin clothing, moccasins, boats and sails to rawhide straps, moosehair embroidery and moosebone pipe bowls, a moose was a veritable department store on hooves. Among plants, no species figured more pr ominently and enduringly in Wabanaki material culture than the bark of the white birch (Betula papyrifera). Before, during and after European contact it met a vast array of needs. A 1957 study lists 100 distinct and ingenious uses of this bar k, ranging from canoes, wigwam s and burial wraps to maps, moosecalls, medicines and magic, plus cooking pots and a great variet y of containers and utensils. In the words of the authors: \"The white birch forest was [the Wabanaki's] supermarket. They depended on it to furnish material for all sorts of permanent and temporary equipment and supplies essential to daily living from cradle to grave.\" 2 Also, because strips of white birch bark had a sm ooth inner side, they could be embroidered with dyed quills or moosehair; or, thanks to this bark's light and dark layers, it could be etched with designs or scenes such as th e one on this page. Thus the tree influenced Wabanaki art forms. Given its many important roles in Wabanaki life, it is not surprising that the white birch is an inte gral part of Wabanaki mythology. In addition to Butler and Ha dlock's detailed publication about Wabanaki uses of birchbark, excellent wide-ranging works have been written about Wabanaki material culture by Frank Speck, Fannie Hardy Eckstorm, Ruth Whitehead and Wilson Wallis, among others. Here we offer just a brief ove rview of the Wabanaki's material culture uses of flora and fauna. Where possible, we focus on historical records about Wabanaki material cultural practices observed in the M ount Desert Island area. However, these are relatively rare, except where they concern th e making and marketing of certain traditional wares utilized by Wabanakis and desired by others - such as ax handles, birchbark canoes, moccasins, snowshoes, woodsplint fishing creels and pack baskets. That said, all of the plant and animal species mentioned he re are present in or near Acadia National Park areas. The discussion is divided in to categories: Ceremonies, Body Care & Adornment, Clothing, Tools & Utensils, Transp ortation, Shelter, Containers, and Trade & Sale Items. More information appears in the flora and fauna inventories of chapters 17 and 18, describing each species, its habitat and uses, plus related Wabanaki legends. CEREMONIES Certain plants and animals ha ve long figured in Wabanaki ceremonies and rituals. Animal fat of various kinds, mixed with charco al, was used to blacken the face to signify mourning. 3 Sweetgrass, braided and dried, was and still is used for smudging and prayer fires. (When the new, in-town Abbe Museum opened in 2001, the celebration began with a sweetgrass smudging in the building.) In fo rmer years Wabanakis also used northern white cedar in this way.4 Tobacco, both wild ( Lobelia inflata (Passamaquoddy medicine man), personal communication, June 2004. Chapter 14: Material Culture Uses of Plants & Animals 387rustia ) has had an enduring role in ceremonial events - scattere d into a sacred fire and traditionally smoked in pipes made of bone, horn or stone.5 BODY & HAIR CARE and ADORNMENT Animal fat topped the list of traditional groom ing needs for Wabanakis. Boiled in water, skimmed off, and stored (see containers section on p. 395), it was used as body and hair oil. While the grease of various land and s ea mammals sufficed, harbor seal oil was especially favored, for it could be hunted most of the year and a mature animal yielded some 4-5 gallons of oil. Beyond keeping hair shiny and skin moist, oiling one's skin provided protection against cold and rain. Photos of 19th-century Indian encampments on Mount Desert Island show seal and porpoise skins being stretched and dried. Other records reveal that Indians encamped in Bar Harbor went porpoising in Frenchman Bay and seal hunting in the vicinity. But it is quite likely that during that era the gutting and oil ex traction took place on nearby Ironbound Island, since the odor could have disc ouraged visitors from coming to the encampment to buy baskets and other crafts or rent a canoe. For hair washing , Wabanakis used ground juniper stem s. The berries of this plant were crushed and rubbed on skin as an insect repellant.6 Animal fat was also used to protect against insects. Traditional Wabanaki adornment included face and body painting .7 Red and yellow ochre, charcoal, graphite and clamshel ls were also used for color, ground in a stone mortar and mixed with bear fat or sea mammal oil as a binder for body painting. Various berries added to the available palette of colors.8 Beyond painting themselves for adornment and mourning rituals, Wabanaki warriors used paint to distinguish themselves in battle: \"When they goe to their warres, it is their custom e to paint their faces with a diversitie of colours, some being all black as jet, some red, some halfe red and halfe black, some blacke and white, others spotted with diver kinds of colours, being all distinguished to their enem ies, to make them more terrible to their foes.\" 9 For personal ornamentation , Wabanakis hung pendants of birds, beasts and fishes, beautifully carved from bone, shells, and stone.10 With shellfish beads they made wampum necklaces, bracelets and ear ornaments. Some dangled feathers from their pierced ears. Men wove feathers into the topknots they made w ith their long hair, or they made more elaborate headdresse s using beads, feathers and dy ed moose hair or porcupine quills. Sakoms (chiefs) sometimes favored headdresses made of an entire bird - usually an aggressive one, such as the eastern king bird - dried and stretched and affixed to a topknot. Women tied back their hair with leat her cords, sometimes decorated with shell 5 violet; or...rays of colour...on the nose, over the eyes, and cheeks\"); (re. painting,' now known as 'Shad Rips.' Here the women were allowed to stop and paint them selves before entering the village'\"). 8 Among others see Material Culture Uses of Plants & Animals 388 beads and/or dyed quills or moosehair. Boys , who commonly wore thei r hair pulled into two side tufts, used similar cords.11 From Speck we have this headdress description: The decorated headband with gull, great blue heron, eagle or hawk feathers fastened stiffly upright all around was a common article of fancy dress - the coronet with rigid feathers. . . . The beaded headband also sometimes had partridge wings, one on each side, or a part ridge tail in front of behind. The most typical ornamental headdress was, however, a circlet of feathers or a single large feather upright at the rear.12 CLOTHING Traditionally, Wabanakis wore clothing made of animal hides and furs - especially moose, caribou, beaver, bear and seal. Usually, before these could be cut and sewn, they had to be prepared - stretched, scraped, oi led, washed and smoked to make them supple and durable. Fannie Eckstorm, whose grandfathe r and father were furtraders based near the Penobscot reservation at Ol d Town, wrote that after being stretched and dried on a frame, a hide had to be \"soaked out\" in water. After that, the shaved and scraped hide was dried again and then rubbed w ith oil. What was used in very early times is not known, but later cod oil was bought by the gallon for oiling moosehides.... The next process was washing in soap s uds, after which the hide was wrung to squeeze the water out.... by hanging the hi de between two posts or trees and twisting it.... Then it was washed a sec ond time in soap suds and again dried. After this it was 'beamed,' as curriers beam leather, by throwing it over a pole and working down the skin with a knife to make it of even th ickness and pliable. The hide was at this stage a white skin, ready for the final process of smoking it. It was sewed together, wrong side out, to make a long bag which was stood up over a small fire of rotten rock-maple wood long enough to give it a rich golden-brown color.... Formerly the Indians used a fire of the outer bark of white cedar, but the smoke from this had such acridity that the leather never lost the smell of it and any quantity of the leather would cause smarting of the eyes. When the smoking was done, the stitches were rippe d out and the hide was ready for use. 13 Men usually stretched the skins onto drying frames and wo men often did the scraping. If winter clothing was being made, they left th e fur on, creating robes of beaver and other richly furred animals. The sewing of animal skins was done with gut or sinew. A brief inventory of traditional Wabanaki clothes includes loincloths of soft, well-worked animal skin (often deerskin) with the ends fastened to a belt at the waist. Both men and women had a pair of leggings of thicker moosehide or sealskin for warmth and to protect the legs from scratchy underbrush. Their moccasins were also pp.130-132; pp.411-13 (noted that de-haired skins were treated with \"bird's liver and a little oil\" while \"skins dressed with the hair\" were \"well rubbed by hand\" with bird's liver only. He also described the painting of skin clothing). Winter moosehide moccasins. (Canadian Museum of Civilization.) Chapter 14: Material Culture Uses of Plants & Animals 389 sealskin (or caribou) sewn with very fine stitches to help keep water out. Wintertime moccasins, usually made of unshaved skins, were often high - commonly fabricated from a long tube of skin from a moose's hind le g, pulled off whole then sewn up across the toe.14 Both men and women wore a pair of sleeves to cover each arm and shoulder. These were tied together at the back and front. For winter season, each person had a large robe of suede-like leather or warm beaver fur (o r sometimes marten, lynx or otter fur), worn over the shoulders. These were tied rather than sewn, so they could be spread out at night as bedcovers. Women had a skin that tied around them like a dress, belted at the waist. Boys and girls had similar clothing and babi es were wrapped in the soft furs of fox, beaver or marten or in feathered skins of swans.15 Also of note are birchbark apparel items. It was \"a matter of tradition among old people that conical hats of birch bark were worn in rainy weather, and that similarly made birch-bark capes went with them. . . . Plain conica l bark hats for protection in the woods against inclement weather and snow are still occasionally made by hunters.\"16 By the time Mount Desert Island resi dents began making note of Wabanaki apparel, few wore animal hides. In fact, trade cloth began edging out many pieces of animal-skin apparel long before Abraham So mes became the first permanent settler on the island. His grandchild, Adelma Somes Joy, writing about the Penobscot women who camped near her family home in the 1840s, desc ribed their dress like this: \"These Indian ladies always, when they came out to the houses, wore red plaid shawls and shiny beaver [hats].\" And in 1881, the Mount Desert Herald commented, \"One would suppose that the gay colors and fantastic costumes, so gene rally worn by our summer visitors, would make the Indians anxious to return to war pa int and feathers. Yet th ey continue to wear felt hats, frock coats, and other civilized toggery, and move their household goods about in Saratoga trunks.17 Several years later another writer, menti oning that many Indians at the Bar Harbor encampment were Roman Catholic and attended \"t he little Church of St. Sylvia nestling beneath the crest of Malden Hill at Bar Harbor,\" recalle d how the women dressed for Sunday service: \"I remember we met an Indian maiden once upon her way home from mass, and, in her fashionably-made polonais e of ruby velvet, and Gainsboro' hat and plumages, she looked like a bird-of-paradise in a barn-yard, beside the island girls.\" 18 Despite all these changes, remnants of traditional apparel continued to be made and wo rn by Wabanakis, including those who spent time on Mount Desert Island. Southwest Harbor resident Ralph Stanle y recalled one such garment from his childhood in the 1940s: \"There was an Indian, Mr. [Sylvester] Francis, I remember as a boy. He lived up in the woods somewhere. . . . He got my father to take him out to 14 Speck mentioned several types of footwear: \"the l oose slipper worn indoors and when the wet moccasins are drying after a day's journeying, the low heavy shoe-pack or oiled mooseh ide moccasin worn in the woods, and the entire moose hock serving as a boot for winter wear\" (1940, p.147). Denys, p.412, noted that moccasins were also made of \"their old robes of Moose skin, wh ich are greasy and better than new.\" 15 Whitehead and McGee, p.28. also also Speck 1940, 18 Sealskin belt and attached purse (Mi'kmaq/NSARM 250.21) Chapter 14: Material Culture Uses of Plants & Animals 390Cranberry Island to shoot seal . My father had a sealskin belt he made.19 Similarly, Passamaquoddy Frank Tomah (born in the late 1940s) recollected: I had a sealskin belt that was given to me by my grandmother. It had the fur on, black and shiny, with parts that we re gray or white. I remember Joe Socoby, [known as] Joe Harry, tanned seal hides. They used to make leggings with the hair on they were very warm. Lots of things were made from seal hide, belts, hats, and coats.20 TOOLS & UTENSILS Up until the late 19th century, Wabanakis continued th eir age-old practice of making utensils such as spoons, ladles, dippers, dishes and funnels out of birch bark.21 Before obtaining metal cooking pots from European s, Wabanaksi boiled food in birchbark kettles as well as in hollowed out logs - doing so by placing heated rocks into the water with the food. Sometimes a thick bark kettle was soaked and then hung above or even placed directly on coals. And throughout the 19 th century certain traditional tools, carried in traditional ways, continue d to comprise part of the traveling kits of most Wabanaki men. As described by Eckstorm: Every man wore a leather belt girding hi s long buttonless coat. On this left side, at the back of the belt, where it could be drawn with his left hand, hung his sheath knife. On his right side, at back, toward the front where he could grasp it with his right hand, was stuck hi s belt-hatchet. On the left side, well toward the front was the...long pocket, in which were all his smaller necessities, such as flint, steel, tinder, tobacco, mone y, and the small seal-skin pouch in which he carried an awl, a f ile, bullet-moulds and whetstone.... The [long pocket ] was made of tanned skin of one of the smaller mammals, a sable, mink or woodchuck skinned out thr ough a cut from the back of the head to the shoulders, the skin being left enti re and the skull cleaned and returned to its place. This served as a knob to keep the pouch from sliding under the belt. Sometimes a whole skunk skin was used. At one time loons' skins were in such demand that two dollars apiece were paid for them.... For a knife sheath , one man used a porcupine's tail, another the leg of a car ibou with the hooves cut off.... Probably a plain leather sheath and a [tough] woodchuck skin longpocket were the ones most used. 22 An important Wabanaki tool is the crooked knife , used since time immemorial for cutting and shaving woodsplints and a host of other materials. This knife, created with a unique grip and bent thumb-rest, is held and used with the blade toward the body. The handles are typically made of rock maple, but other woods are also used, as is antler. 23 19 Personal communication, Jan. 2004. 20 In Soctomah, 2003, p.23. This noted hunting guide, b.1880, is on Indian Township's 1920 federal census with wife Agnes (b.1885) and children Jerome (b.1922), Mabel (b.1923), 1932, pp18-19; Speck 1940, pp105-106. Chapter 14: Material Culture Uses of Plants & Animals 391 For sewing , Wabanaki women traditionally used sharp bone awls to pierce leather and stitched animal-skin clothing with bone or copper needles. (Joseph Nicolar noted the use of sable bone for needles.) Bone awls we re also used to sew together birch bark pieces, and special, large-bone needles were us ed to weave the wide-holed, gut mesh of snowshoes.24 For stitching bark work, including wigwams, canoes and an array of containers, Wabanakis used (a nd still use) tough plant ma terials - strands of rolled basswood bark, Both white and black spruce roots and al so cedar roots coul d be used, but the white spruce roots were preferred. . . . Root digging was the work of women. . . . They dug until they found a good root about an inch in diameter near the butt end, worked it out of the ground while still attached to the tree and then cut it off and trimmed it of side roots. It wa s split before being scraped of the outer bark. . . . The split root was scraped of its bark and thinned down to the desired size by scraping both sides and then wound up in a coil . . . in pieces from 3-5' long. Fresh root was best, but it could be kept dry and soaked. 25 Wabanakis also used sinew, gut or babiche - thread, thong or lacings made of rawhide (uncured animal skin). Frank Speck described babiche as \"the commonest thong material for sewing, snowshoe netting, w ood sewing, lines, and wrapping stuff, except for splint basket-stuff.\" To make it, he wrote, the skin is cleaned of hair . . . then sp read out on a board and cut with a knife around the edge, the cut follo wing the border of the skin all around. Or the cuts are made zigzagging in from the side of the skin, a number, often seven, parallel to one another, so that when they are cut apart at the ends the whole hide is separated into one long strip or thong of the thickness, usually somewhat less than a quarter of an inch. The thong is then rolled up into a ball or skein and kept green in a receptacle until needed. Before being used, however, it is left in a vessel of water and soaked until soft. To stretch the thongs, two deer tibia are used as grips for the twisting. 26 To weave ropes, straps and tumplines (such as the one pictured above), Wabanakis braided the stringy inner bark of bassw ood, valued for its strength and elasticity.27 24 Eckstorm 1932, p.63; Denys, pp.406, bone a detailed description of how basswood bark was harvested and prepared, see Speck 1940, pp.135-37. 26 Speck 1940, p.132. 27 Speck 1940, p.136. The strap pictured above is from the \"Additional Photographs\" section in the back of the 1997 reprint of Speck's 1940 book - identified as photo #13018. Chapter 14: Material Culture Uses of Plants & Animals 392TRAPS, WEAPONS, SNARES & LURES The inner bark fiber of basswood was also used to weave fishnets ,28 as were the barks of elm, cedar and leatherwood, all twisted or braided. Fish lines were also made of basswood bark or, according to a 1634 report, of Indian \"'hempe more curiously wrought, of stronger materials than ours, hooked with bone hookes.'\"29 Joseph Nicolar wrote of fishhooks made by using a stone to sharpen one end of a bird's breast bone (the wishbone), tied to a basswood lin e attached to a hardwood pole.30 And well into the 20th century, according to Passamaquoddy Frank To mah, fishhooks were \"carved from wood or bone or whatever we had\" and seal whiskers were used as fishhook ties.31 Wabanakis used splints from the brown ash tree ( fraxinus nigra) to make fish traps (especially for catching eel) 3-5' in length, such as the one pictured above.32 In addition, they fashioned fish weirs , typically of willow rods filled in with brush of various sorts.33 As described by Nicolas Denys in the 17th century: At the narrowest place of the rivers, wher e there is the least water, they make a fence [weir] of wood clear across the river to hinder the passage of fish. In the middle of it they leave an opening in which they place a bag-net. . . . so arranged that it is inevitabl e the fish should run into them. These bag-nets . . . they raise two or three times a day, and they always find fish thereon. It is in spring that the fish ascend, and in autumn they descend and return to the sea. At that time they placed the opening of their bag-net in the other direction.34 Large fish and sea mammals were usually taken by spears, including leisters and harpoons , commonly made of American Beech.35 Like arrows, these were traditionally fitted with sharply pointed flint or moose bone tips. Bows were typically fashioned out of spruce, rock maple or sugar maple, then po lished with oyster shells and strung with bowstrings of twisted moose sinew. Arrow shafts , usually made of white ash, young alder or northern white cedar, were fitted with eagle feathers as flight stabilizers. French 28 Speck 1940, pp.86-87 . In her reminiscences, Adelma Somes Joy recalled her grandfather John Somes telling her that during his boyhood years (c1770s) one Indian camped near the family's Somesville home taught him how to make a scoop net for fishing. 29 William Wood 1634, in Eckstorm 1932, p.11; see also p.33. 31 In Soctomah, 2003. 14: Material Culture Uses of Plants & Animals 393observer Marc Lescarbot, writing in the early 160 0s, noted that Mi'kmaqs in Nova Scotia \"'kept half a dozen tame eagles about their cam ps, all without tails, which they used to pluck to obtain feathers for their arrows.'\"36 Knife handles were typically made out of rock maple or white ash. Common snares consisted of a noose (made of pounded ash strips, rawhide or leather) \"attached to a tough stick about three-f eet long, set in runways of rabbits or other small animals.\"37 Wabanakis attracted animals to va rious kinds of traps with castor - smearing beaver testicles \"raw or preserved in alcohol\" on traps as a lure. According to Speck, \"The castoreum may also be draw n over the ground by a string from some distance away leading toward the trap, as a lure.\"38 Traditionally, Wabanakis shredded birchbark to make night-hunting torches . They also made various instruments or \" calls \" to lure animals into target range. Among these was the muskrat call - two pieces of wood 2-2.5 inches long, \"mortised together and between them an openi ng with a shred of birchbark between. Blowing through this produces a resonant buzzing which resembles the call of the muskrat.\" Birchbark was also used to make foot-long moose ca lls, conically shaped like megaphones.39 TRANSPORTATION Summer visitors who came to Mount Desert Island during the Rusticator Era from the mid-1850s to the early 1900s were fascinated by birchbark canoes made and used by Wabanakis. Many rented canoes from Wab anakis at the Bar Harbor Indian encampment(s) (often hiring an Indian paddler -guide). Many others purchased them from Indian craftsmen (often with custom-made pa ddles inscribed with the owner's initials) and joined the Mount Desert Canoe Club, devoted to the fine art of birchbark canoeing. Sporthunters of the era, who often hired Indi an guides for wilderness adventures, were equally enamored with birchbark canoes. Traditionally, these swift, lightweight vessels Unidentified men in Penobscot canoe. (UPenn.Museum Archives #14282) were among the most essential items in Waba naki culture, making it possible to travel Maine's vast network of inland and coasta l waterways and gain access to nature's seasonally shifting bounty. Lightwe ight and portable, the boat usually had a white cedar frame covered with white birch bark ( Betula papyrifera ), sewn with black spruce root, sealed in the seams with spruce gum or pitch, and lined with Northern white cedar slats. As noted by Eckstorm in her detailed 1932 de scription of canoe manu facture, \"The best canoe barks were those peeled in winter, wh en the tree was free from sap and the bark 36 Speck 1940, pp.114-16; Eckstorm 1932, pp.12-13. Denys, pp.435-36 re. birchbark torches. Chapter 14: Material Culture Uses of Plants & Animals 394 about as thick and tough as so le leather.\" Discussing how Wa banakis sealed the seams of these versatile vessels, she wrote, Until the whites came, the Indians had no pitch, and Nicholas Denys says that they used to fill the seam s with spruce gum, which the women chewed until it was the right consistency. The French ta ught them how to 'box' pine trees to obtain the resin and how to boil it down with grease to make pitch. More recently, commercial resin has been used. . . . in summer pitch should be harder than in winter; in winter it shou ld be soft enough not to be brittle from cold nor to be cut by ice. Pitch for winter use could be made from beaver oil or tallow.\" 40 [Tallow is hard fat obtained from cattle, sheep or horses.] Wabanakis powered their canoes with paddles (usually made of rock maple, spruce or American beech)41, 10-foot poles made of various woods or sails made of moosehide or birchbark. Also of note are moosehide canoes . According to Speck, in former times Wabanakis commonly constructed these \"moos e crafts\" before leaving their hunting grounds. These boats, Speck wrote, were made of two mooseskins tanned waterproof with grease. The skins were sewed together head to tail, and the seams were covere d with moose tallow boiled with pitch. About a dozen ribs, the keel, thwarts, and gunwales, over which the skin covering was stretched, completed the framework. The returning hunters could then load their craft with moose meat and peltries from the winter hunt and drift down to the village. The canoe coul d finally be taken apart and the hides used otherwise, for moccasins or cut up for rawhide thongs or babiche.42 Penobscots building a moosehide canoe on Indian Island in Old Town, Maine, 1911. \"The wet dehaired hide is being stretched and sewed over the elm-pole gunwales. Split cedar in the foreground will be used for the canoe's ribs and lining strips. Usually made after a hunt to carry home game, the canoe would later be taken apart and the hides used for other purposes.\" (Photo by Frank Speck. American Philosophical Society Colls.) 40 Eckstorm 1932, pp.55-64. Among many other sources see Speck 1940, pp.65-68. Chapter 14: Material Culture Uses of Plants & Animals 395 For Wabanakis, snowshoes were as essential for winter travel as canoes were for the rest of the year. The frames (usually made by men) were formed from a single length of white ash or American beech bent into shape. The shoe's two cross bars were al so typically made of white ash - or white or rock maple. The frames were filled (often by women) with a mesh of woven rawhide from moose or deer (or caribou in earlier days), and it was common to decorate the outer edges of the rim with several little tufts of dye d moosewool, moosehair or leather fringe. Speck noted that while proportions have varied slightly among differe nt Wabanaki groups, the \"type of snowshoe of the whole region occupied by Wabanaki tribes is about the same.\" 43 On average they were \"about three times long as wide, rounded or square at the toes, and having a tail of five inches or more to hold down the rear end. . . .\" 44 The pair held by Passamaquoddy George \"Big John\" Soctomah in this photo is typical. (Notably, Soctomah frequented the Gouldsboro area, a traditi on carried on by his son John who went there to gather swee tgrass and to sell baskets and other crafts .)

To transport heavy loads over snow a nd ice in wintertime, Wabanakis used toboggans and sleds, pulled with the ai d of \"drag\" or \"burden\" straps (tumplines ), traditionally made of braided basswood fiber. Toboggans were of wide flat planks split from the trunk of a rock maple tree and curved upward at one end. Sleds had runners and were made from rock maple or yellow birc h. Equipped with a sled and snowshoes, \"a person could pull 200 kilograms (440 pounds), or half a moose, on a sled.\"45 Drag sled for big game, with shoving sticks and ( Speck 1940, p72) 43 Speck 1940, p.68. Speck provides a fairly detailed, illustrated discussion of Wabanaki snowshoes on pp.68-72. See also Eckstorm 1932, pp.52-55 44 Eckstorm 1932, p.52. Whitehead Rand, n1; Speck 1940, pp.72-74. Chapter 14: Culture Uses of Plants & Animals 396SHELTER Traditional Wabanaki homes were covered with sheets of \"the rectangular, permanent camp of the villages, made of logs and heavy barks; the circular, round-toppe d camp of heavy bark (elm, hemlock, spruce), used by a single fam ily as a hunting lodge in winter, or when birch-bark was unobtainable; an d the circular, conical, por table lodge of heavy birch- bark, which was the ordinary summer camp of the tribe.\" Offering details on the latter she went on to say: The birchbark wigwam resembled the we stern tepee in shape and type of construction. The frame was of long, slender poles, probably by preference peeled white cedar saplings or slen der young spruce. Both were so easily procured that it is hardly likely they were often transported by the family when moving, who could easily have anot her set kept in reserve on their favorite camping grounds. Ceda rs not over two in ches in diameter at the butt and about 12 feet long . . . would make the foundation. The smaller Penobscot birchbark wigwams were only 6 or 8' in height inside and perhaps 10' in diameter, and 3 poles, bound together by a strip of bark near the top ends and placed equi -distant at the butts would make the foundation of the frame work. Two more poles, placed between each of these and locked together at the tops, or 9 poles in all, were sufficient for a small camp. . . . The covering of the camp was the heavy winter bark of the white canoe-birch cut in pieces to fit the places they were meant for and bound around with thin strips of white cedar, se wed on with spruce roots to keep the bark from curling. 46 Penobscot birckbark village, World's Fair, Chicago 1893 (Authors' coll.) Besides bark, Wabankis used animal skins or woven mats to cover their dwellings. Well- matted inside, these wigwams were sometimes lined with \"mats made of Rushes painted with several colours.\" 47 For added warmth, they lined their winter abodes with deerskins. Adelma Somes Joy of Mount Desert Island described yet anothe r type of wigwam in her recollection of Penobscots camped n ear her childhood home in Somesville in the 46 Eckstorm 1932, pp.64-67. pp.297-98. Uses of Plants & Animals 397mid-1800s: \"I loved the Indian when he built his wigwam by the Pond. . . . No canvas wigwam had he, But one of boughs.\"48 Speck offered details on this type of dwelling: The conical wigwam was often made of balsam fir boughs laid upon the poles, tips downward. . . . I was also to ld of an interior lining of deerskin between the inner poles and back covering for additional protection during the coldest weather. Betw een this and the bark, qua ntities of fir boughs were packed. In winter camps, besides eart h piled up about th e edges, fir boughs were leaned against the outside. 49 Speck also noted the temporary shelter or lean-to , still used by hunters and others for short camping stopovers: It consists simply of a sloping flat roof, either of slabs of birch bark, or spruce boughs piled thickly w/the twig ends down, supported on several pairs of crotched supports bearing crosspieces tied on, upon which the roofing is laid. The two sides and back are filled in sim ilarly, the high front si de is left open and the fire is before it.\" Simpler still, he noted were windbreaks made of \"evergreen boughs, head-high, long enough to shelter the pa rty, erected on the windward side of the fire, cleared away and banked with snow in winter; and then the inverted canoe under which a couple of hunters may bivouac, sheltered from frost or rain. 50 Wabanaki usually carpet ed the floors of their dwellings with spruce or fir boughs covered with tanned skins or woven mats made of basswood or sweetgrass or rushes. Topped by fur robes in the cold season, this floo ring - along with a hearth in the center of the abode - kept them warm and dry. CONTAINERS Hanging from the poles and tucked around the inner edges of the wigwam's perimeter were containers of various sorts - from seal bladder sacks for storing and carrying oil to sealskin gun cases , basswood shoulder bags , and baskets made of woodsplints and/or sweetgrass, plus boxes made of birchbark. As mentioned on the second page of this chapter, the bark of the white birch tree had many uses, not the least of which was to make an array of containers - from cradles to funeral biers , buckets to pack baskets . As summarized by Butler and Hadlock, birchbark boxes (made of folded sheets of bark) and baskets (made of woven bark strips), \"were used for ga thering fruit and berries and for storage of clothing, maple sugar, and other articles, as well as for carrying possessions from one place to another. Gookin said that, using birch-bark, the Indians made 'several sorts of baskets, great and small. Some will hold four bushels, others more, and so downward to a pint.\" Wabanakis constructed a wide assortment of woven items - mats as well as containers - with a variety of plant materials beside birchbark, including basswood, cattails, spruceroot and sweetgrass, as well as cedar and ash sp lints. For untold 48 Joy, A. Sect. 24, p1. 49 Speck 1940, pp31-33. 50 Speck 1940, pp32-33. Chapter 14: Material Culture Uses of Plants & Animals 398 generations, the inner bark of the basswood tree seems to have been the most widely used weaving material - until woodsplint basket ry came to the fore in the early1800s.51 Penobscot woman weaving a basswood carrying bag. \"Strips of the inner bark of the basswood tree are boiled with wood ashes to soften the fiber and shaved down to the desired width to be used in weaving. (Photograph by Frank Speck, c1911.\" Anthropology Museum, U of Penn.) Wabanakis make woodsplint baskets primarily out of brown ash ( Fraxinus nigra ) - also known as black ash, and often refe rred to by Wabanakis as \"the basket tree.\" There has been considerable debate about the origins of this cr aft. Some claim that it was introduced by Swedish colonists to Indians in th e Delaware valley about 1700, spreading northward to Wabanaki peoples by the early-1800s. Howeve r, most Wabanakis say their people have been making woodsplint baskets since time immemorial. Certainly they had the technological wherewithal to cons truct them much earlier, for they had been lining their canoes with narrow, quarter-inch-th ick cedar ribs since l ong before the arrival of Europeans.52 Traditionally Wabanakis turned to nature 's storehouse to color their woodsplint baskets, as well as the porcupine quills and moosehair with which they embroided birchbark crafts and animal skin clothing. Among their dyes, a range of reds came from speckled alder bark, bloodroot, hemlock root, stiff marsh bedstraw, Solomon's seal (eel berries) and cranberries (large, mountain and highbush). Low- and hi gh-bush blueberries were used to make a (quickly fading) reddi sh-pink, and hemlock bark yielded a reddish- brown. Beech bark was used for blue, while sugar maple bark produced violet. Several plants provided shades of green : princess pine root, Canada yew leaves, and white cedar leaves and bark (sometimes combined with American elm bark). Yellow dyes came from 51 Speck 1940, p.135. 52 McBride 1990, pp.10-11. Chapter 14: Material Culture Uses of Plants & Animals 399goldthread (especially strong, clear, enduring) and white ash bark.53 As mentioned several pages earlier, ochre, charcoal and clamshells were also used for color, ground in a stone mortar and mixed with egg as a binder for painting leather or bark.54 TRADE & SALE ITEMS Whatever its origins, in the 19th century woodsplint basketry seized the interest of Maine's year-round and seasonal residents - and nowhere more significantly than on Mount Desert Island. There, farmers, fishers and privileged \"cottagers\" alike found uses for a full range of Wabanaki baskets - from u tilitarian laundry, pack and picnic baskets to \"fancy\" baskets made to hold everything from combs to embroidery to handkerchiefs and hats. According to Rand and Redfield's 1894 Flora of Mount Desert Island brown ash was \"frequent\" in the island's swamps and damp woods in the 1800s.55 And other accounts make it clear that Wabanakis who so ld woodsplint wares on the island also made them on location and often gather ed the necessary ra w materials there.56 Wabanaki basketmakers Down East, 1943. (By John Wallace.57 Courtesy Donald Soctomah) 53 Eckstorm 1932, Wiseman, p.50. See also Whitehead & McGee, pp.30-31. 55 Rand and Redfield referred to brown ash as black ash and used the scientific term of the day: Fraxinus sambucifolia , p.129. 56 See \"Proximity to Resour ces\" section of Chapter 10. 57 In Village Down East , published by Stephen Daye Press, Brattleboro, VT, 1943. Chapter 14: Material Culture Uses of Plants & Animals 400 Wabanakis also made and sold sweetgrass baskets, second in demand only to those made of wood. Sweetgrass appears to have been even more abundant than brown ash on Mount Desert Island. Noting that it grew in \"borders of salt or brackish meadows and marshes,\" Rand and Redfield identified lo cations where it could be found in the late 1800s (\"Bass Harbor; Southwest Harbor; Little Harbor; Seal Harbor ; Thomas Bay; Cranberry Isles; Duck Islands and elsewhere\"), tioned its particular importance to Wabanaki basketmakers: \"Much used by the Indians for basket work.\"58 Given its importance for weaving, as well as ceremonial purposes, sweetgrass figures in Glooskap tales, such as this: As skunk walked through the grass the grass became evil-smelling. But Glooskap breathed on the bad-smelling grass and it became sweet-smelling - the sweetgrass of t oday. Since that time Skunk must hide in the daytime and is seen about at night. As the commercial market for fancy bask ets and other Wabana ki goods soared in the late 19 th century, those who made their livi ng selling handicrafts began using commercial dyes. In 1893 a long article a bout Cushing's Dyes appeared in the Lewiston Journal , making specific note of Penobscots selli ng crafts in Bar Harbor and providing the following overview of craft producti on and the shift from traditional dyes: In all matters relating to Indian life on salt or fres h water, in wood craft, hunting, trapping and imitating nature, the Penobscot Indian leads the red men of the world. Hiawatha never made a canoe so firm and true as those of the Penobscots. They know the fibres of wood as book-keepers know the pages of their ledgers, while the women, in basket work of wood are far beyond . . . all other workers in these lines. The Penobscots can go into the woods and cut ash logs; go to the salt water marshes along the sea coast and pull sweet grass, and then with the aid of a pocket knife can produce from these materials which they color with Cushing's dyes, hats that are eagerly purchased by the wives and daughters of the millionaires who visit Bar Harbor and Kineo in summer; make ornament al pieces such as an anchor and shield, picture frames, card and photograph holders, napkin rings and all known shapes and styles of basket work. The men even weave fishing nets from roots and they colo r, with Cushing's dyes, the strands a dark purple, giving th em, to the telescopic eye of the fish, the exact hue of water. They blend shell and basket work beautifully, decorate plain birch bark on the brown in side with animals of the forest and fish of the lakes. . . . Once they took alder bark from the shores of the stream for a red color, white [sugar] maple bark for purple, su mac for brown, white birch bark for a cross between orange and yellow, ceda r boughs for green and butternut bark for black. . . [Today they] have the 70 colors of Cushing's dyes and the exhibit which they will make with the colors at the World's Columbian 58 Rand and Redfield, p.176. Among numerous additional sources, see Joy, B.E., 1974, p.62, and Lerner's interview with Innes MacPike. Chapter 14: Material Culture Uses of Plants & Animals 401Exposition at Chicago will astonish visitors. . . . To use the expression of an old Indian who first took me to the [P enobscot Indian Agency store in Old Town], \"you see basket stuff the squaws make. Everything looks like peacock.\"59 In addition to baskets, Wabanakis sold and traded a range of other goods, finding innovative and marketable ways to use the fl ora and fauna that had sustained them in their traditional lifeways before Europeans arrived on their shor es. As described in Chapter 10 on \"Wabanakis and Rusticators,\" In dians frequenting the Mount Desert Island neighborhood and Maine's other summer coas tal retreats from the mid-1800s onwards, also sold birchbox items (including boxes, picture frames, toys and canoes) , as well as birds, feathers, animal skins, sealskin moccasins and mitts , and seal and porpoise oil . In the early 1900s, when the population of fish-consuming seal s presented serious competition for the ever-growing number of white fishermen, the state placed a bounty on the seal, paying $1 for each nose turned i n. For Wabanakis, seals became a double- earning creature, winning them bounty money as well 75 cents per gallon of seal oil, used in mixing paint. With mature seals yielding 4-5 gallons apiece, the earning potential of seal hunting was pretty good. 60 WABANAKI MATERIAL CULTURE & EC ONOMIC SURVIVAL IN THE MDI NEIGHBORHOOD: The Phillips Family, 1942-1957 The following oral history excerpt touches on the typical material culture and economic survival strategy of Wabanakis in the Mount Desert Island area during the mid-20th century. It comes from an interview with the late Elizabeth Phillips (1920-1999), grandmother of William Phillips, former chief of the Aroostook Band of Micmacs: After our first summer raking [blueberri es in Cherryfield, my husband] Noel and [his brother] Andrew went to find Irving Layton, the lumberman. Irving bought us brand new lumber and tarpaper and we built a camp in Prospect Harbor, near Gouldsboro. It was a nice big camp - big enough for one double bed and one single. Two rooms. Andrew st ayed in the kitchen. One day I said to Noel, 'I can't stand this; I got to go back to St. John to have the baby.' Well, a Gouldsboro doctor came to our place and said, 'This place is awful nice and big and clean.' He laughed, and said, 'You're healthy and you can have that baby right here in this camp. . . . So on Nov. 15, 1942, Billy was born right there in that camp.\" After we had Billy, I told Noel to make a private camp just for us. So we and our kids had our own log cabin ri ght by the road. Noel and Andrew cut pulp and fire wood all winter for Layton. And they made baskets too. 59 \"Colors the World.\" 60 \"Seal Hunting,\" Bar Harbor Record , 23 Sept. 1904. See also Manville, pp.394-95. To read about the \"seal nose conspiracy\" brought on by Wabanaki economic struggles combined with the state's bounty on seals, see Soctomah 2002, p.89. See also Lillian Loring Trott's 1904 article \"Micmac and Mohawk: in New England Magazine vol.30, pp.591-96, which offers details of Passamaquoddy \"Lewy Soccotoma\" selling baskets in Bar Harbor, hunting seals, and participating in the seal-nose conspiracy. Chapter 14: Material Culture Uses of Plants & Animals 402Come spring, Noel met Eldon Y oung, a Gouldsboro road maintenance foreman. Eldon told Noel and Andrew, 'I see you guys make baskets. Why don't you move over to Ashville [on th e coast between Sullivan and W. Gouldsboro] where you can sell 'em good by the road. And you can clam and also cut pulp. Always jobs for pulp cutte rs.' It was nearby, so we moved. Eldon found this big shingled garage - part of a rich woman's house. He bought the garage for $60 and give it to us. We made it into two rooms. We lived there till 1954. Noel cut pulp for Eldon in the fall and spring, when it wasn't snowing. In the winter he work ed on the road maintenance crew. . . . During summer months we made basket s, raked berries and dug clams. Our camp was next to the water. Andrew and Annie [his and Noel's mother] moved to Newport [25 miles west of Bangor], but she would come over when she got lonely. Every time she came she sent me to work, saying the place wasn't big enough for two women. So she'd cook and wash and I'd go cut pulpwood for Eldon, or cedar for barrels for another guy, or I'd clam. . . . After my father died, my mother come over and joined us. Her and Annie'd make baskets. . . . After a while, Noel made another camp - the 'lodging cam p' we called it. We had three or four beds in that lodge, and it was ri ght near our garage camp....We did a lot of clam digging when we lived there. You can dig clams all year down there, but I did it mostly in the summer. . . . [Sold a pail-full for $1.25.] 61 61 Elizabeth Phillips interview by McBride. Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 403 CHAPTER 15: WABANAKI FOOD USES OF PLANTS & ANIMALS All about [the mouth of the Penobscot River] is an infinite number of [islands], of varying sizes, but the largest is that of Mount Desert. The fishing for different kinds of fish is very good there, as is also the hunting for game (Champlain, 1604, p86). There is . . . a certain beast, that the Nati ves call a Mosse, hee is as big bodied as an Oxe, headed like a fallow Deere, with a broad Palme, which hee mues every year. . . . his skinne maketh very good Buffe, and hi s flesh is excellent good food, which the Natives use to jerkin and keepe all the yeere. . . . There have beene many of them seene in a great Island upon the Coast, called by our people Mount Mansell1 [MDI], whither the [Indians] goe at certaine season s to hunt them; the manner where of is, by making of several fires, and setting the Country with people, to force them into the Sea, to which they are naturally addicted, an d then there are others that attend them in their Boates with bowes and weapons of several kinds, wherewith they slay and take their pleasure (Gorges 1622, ppD2-3; Etching by Matthe\u00fcs Merian in DeBry, 13:15). The hunting by the Indians in old times was easy for them. They killed animals only in proportion as they had need of them. When they were tired of eating one sort, they killed some of another. If they did not wish longer to eat meat, they caught some fish (Denys, 1672, p419). Wabanakis relied on a wide variety of wild animals and plants for food and drink. Most of the species they turned to for sustenance have long been present in A cadia National Park and adjacent lands. Countless references point out the seasona l importance of food 1 Here Gorges used the English name for Mount Desert Island, as did John Winthrop who made note of the island in his journal 9 June 1630. Merian's engraving was based primarily on Gorges' description. Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 404resources common in seaside areas such as Mount Desert Island. For instance, Fannie Eckstorm's 1919 article, \"The Indians of Main e,\" includes a brief summary of traditional coastal food collection practices : clambakes; catching eels in weirs and drying them in \"great quantities;\" collecting/ drying shellfish to store in birchbox boxes; hunting seal and porpoise and extracting/storing th e oil in seal \"pokes;\" the \" bold\" hunting of whales; plus picking, drying and storing berries.2 Here, we offer an histori cal overview of traditional Wabanaki food and beverage resources found in Acadia National Park areas, highlighting references to food collecti ng activities on and near MDI. Our narrative includes information on hunting, trapping, fishing and ga thering methods, plus food preparation. It also touches on Wabanaki attit udes toward flora and fauna, some of which are revealed in legends featuring particular plants or animals. In chap ters 17 and 18, annotated and illustrated inventories of specific species f ound in our research area provide additional information concerning their nomenclature, descri ption, habitat, use, and related legends. OVERVIEW Before Europeans landed on their shores, Waba nakis fit themselves entirely to nature's seasonal storehouse, moving as needed to tap into shifting coastal and inland food resources. After contact, the arrival of European fishermen and sea-mammal hunters, combined with the perils of colonial warfare and opportunities for trade in furs, hides and feathers, had to be factored into Wabanaki su rvival strategies. Yet, overall, their seasonal hunting, fishing, and gathering prac tices continued well into the 19th century - and remnants of these practices continue to this day. Since traditional Wabanaki homelands c over a vast geographic expanse, from Newfoundland south to New Hampshire and from St. Lawrence Valley east to the Atlantic seaboard, they include varied habitats. Moreover, there have been ecological changes in the course of centuries. Creativel y responding to the ecol ogical challenges and opportunities of their particular tribal terr itories, each indigenous community adapted to its particular environment. In the process, the various Waba naki tribal nations developed their own unique ideas and pr actices, albeit within the more general cultural repertoire and framework they shared as north eastern Algonquian-speaking groups. Based on ethnohistorical, cult ural ecological and archaeological information, we can try to reconstruct the Wabanaki seas onal cycles and movement patterns for the central Maine coast, including Mount Dese rt Island: Typically, moving up and down river passages from inland regions to the sea, the region's first peopl es hunted seal from December-February (especially January); moos e, deer, caribou, bear, beaver, otter muskrat October-March (especially February-March and September-October). They pursued waterfowl (and their eggs) April-June, and picked off fledglings and molting adults with relative ease in late July/ear ly August; eels from September-October; and anadromous salmon, sturgeon a nd alewife from April-June. Usually they went after cod, mackerel, flounder and s quid during the summer months, but caught tomcod and smelt through the ice in the cold season. Shellfish (clams, mussels, crabs, lobsters) were consumed primarily April-Octo ber. However, since clams could be dug in coastal mudflats year-round, they were an important winter food to fall back on in times of scarcity. 2 Eckstorm 1919, p.57. Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 405Plants, like animals, had their seasons. In spring, sugar maples and yellow birch trees were tapped for sap to make into syrup and sugar. As the weather warmed an array of wild edible plants bloomed. In the course of the summer, Wabanakis harvested and ate milkweed pods and flowers, roots/tubers of plants such as Queen Ann's lace and Jerusalem artichoke, and the green leaves of a host of flora, including lambsquarters, black mustard and common burdock. Berries were among the most favored plant foods and ripened in a series of waves from summ er through fall: strawberries matured between mid-June and mid-August, followed by raspbe rries from mid-July-August, blueberries August-September and cranberries Septembe r-October. Then came various edible nuts (acorn, hazelnut, beechnut, etc.), gathered each autumn when they dropped to the ground. Numerous plants were steeped to make tea-like beverages: the bark of sugar maple or striped maple; the leaves of checkerberry or wild mint, and the fruit of barberry, black cherry or many other berry-bearing plants. Although regional variations and periodic changes occu rred, the chart below, based on archaeological and ethnohistorical research on Eastern Wabanaki foraging patterns, provides a generalized overview of the seasonal hunting and gathering cycles of coastal Etchemins in the Mount Desert Island area. 3 EASTERN WABANAKI SEASONAL HU NTING & GATHERING CYCLE 3 Prins 1996, p.26. Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 406 ANIMAL FOODS Moose White-tailed deer Beaver, Muskrat Porpoise, Salmon, Flounder Grouse, Clam Meat was the primary food for Wabanakis - th e meat of land and sea mammals, as well as fish (including shellfish) . Archaeological evidence and written records show that, whatever the species, Wabanakis boiled, smoked or roasted the meat before consuming it. As mentioned by Rosier in his account of Waymouth's 1605 voya ge along the Maine coast, \"'I noted they wo uld eat nothing raw, either fish or flesh.'\"4 In addition to fresh-cooked meat, meat preserved by smoking comprised an important part of the Wabanaki diet - especia lly deer and moose, but also fish, clams and eels. When Italian botanist Luig i Castiglioni traveled to the United States to study plants in 1785, he visited the Penobscot village at Old Town and observed meat being preserved \"by drying and smoking it.\" 5 Beyond storing jerky - dried stri ps of moose and deer meat (and in earlier times cari bou) - for later eating, Penobs cots and other Wabanakis commonly pounded the strips, mixing the mash with fat and dried berries to make pemmican cakes. Speck, a close observer of Penobscot life during the first half of the 20 th century, made note of meat-smoking practic es many generations after Castiglioni. Writing about moose and deer meat in pa rticular, Speck said : \"Whatever was not consumed fresh in camp was cut into st rips several inches thick and hung over a horizontal pole supported by two upright cr otches under which a fire was built lengthwise, and smudged. The meat is smoked un til it is dried like le ather. Sometimes an extemporized roofing of birch bark is built over the rack to keep off rain and to confine the heat and smoke. This smoked meat . . . can be kept narrative, Speck offered the following first-hand description of a meat -smoking camp seen on a Penobscot River island: Several moose and deer had been killed nearby, and occasion was taken to preserve the surplus flesh on the spot. Some yards in front of the tent, which had a banking of logs heaped with earth several feet high around the sides, two rows of boulders had been placed about five feet apart. In this enclosure a continuous fire of birch bark had been kept going for several days. At each end a support, either a tripod or crotch ed stick, had been erected for a stout green sapling extended over the fire bed for not less than ten feet. Over this the slices of meat were suspended, hanging close together. The location of this camp was in several respects well chosen since it was only a few steps 4 Rosier, p.10, in Kania, p.26. 5 Cited in Uses of Plants & Animals 407from the river, where the meat could be loaded into canoes, and water was convenient for regulating the smudge and satisfying the thirst of the laborers.6 Speck also described traditional methods of boiling meat: \"Cut porti ons of meat of any kind are boiled in water with fat . . . making a kind of stew [Penobscots] called kwa'kwzu.\" Before contact with Europeans, Waba nakis boiled food in watertight buckets made of birchbark or great wooden kettles made from hollowed-out logs. French trader and entrepreneur Nicholas Denys compar ed the latter to \"a huge feeding-trough.\" 7 Because the wooden kettles were too heavy to move, they were made and left at seasonal campsites frequented by Wabanakis - making th em, in Denys' words, a \"chief regulator\" of Native lives. Boiling was done by using w ooden tongs to place fire-heated stones in a kettle containing water and meat. As the st ones cooled they were replaced with newly- heated ones, until the contents of the pot cam e to a boil and the stew was well-cooked. After contact, metal kettles became avai lable and were prized among Wabanakis as portable, fire-proof cooking pots.8 According to Denys, writing in 1672, \"At the present time. . . they have good axes, knives more convenient for their work, and kettles easy to carry. This is a great convenience for them, as they are not obliged to go to the places where were their kettles of wood, of which one never sees any at present, as they have entirely abandoned the use of them.\"9 In traditional Wabanaki life, animal fat wa s valued nearly on a par with meat, and it was commonly extracted by boiling. Another method was to melt chunks of fat on a grooved stone heated in the fire and then ca tch the grease in a birc hbark box held at the end of the groove. 10 Roasting techniques typical of all Wabanaki s included skewering meat or fish on a sharp stick and positioning it near the fire, or placing small pieces on a grill of green wood atop a bed of coals. Larger pieces were cooked on a spit compri sed of a stick laid across the forks of two split sticks planted in the ground (or suspended from the poles of the wigwam when cooked indoors). The stick could be hand-turned or a rotisserie could be made by wrapping it with spruce root in such a way th at it turned as the twine unwound. In some cases, as in roasting porpoise steaks, the chunks of meat were laid directly on the coals. 11 6 Speck 1940, pp.103-104. 7 Denys, pp.401-402. Describing how such kettles were made, Denys wrote: \"To make it they took the butt of a huge tree which had fallen; they did not cut it down, not having tools fitted for that, nor had they the means to transpor t it; they had them ready-made in nearly all the places to which they went. For making them, they employed stone axes, well-sharpened, and set into the end of a forked stick well tied. With these axes they cut a little into the top of the wood at the length they wished th e kettle. This done they placed fire on top and made the tree burn. When burnt about four inches in depth they removed the fire, and then with stones and huge pointed bones, as large as the thumb, they hollowed it out the best they could, removing all the burnt part. Then they replaced the fire, and when it was again burnt they removed it all from the interior and commenced again to separate the burnt part, continuing this until their kettle was big enough for their fancy.\" Of course, these great wooden pots ha ve all disappeared in the course of time, leaving Wabanakis and archaeologists with no remnant of a piece of cooking ware vital to traditional culture. 8 Speck 1940, pp.95, 11 Speck, 1940, p.95. Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 408 Before fauna could be prepar ed, it had to be caught. To obtain the animals they consumed, Wabanakis used a variety of hunting and trapping methods: weapons, nets, weirs, snares, deadfalls (crushing traps) and even bare hands. Traditional weapons included bows and arrows, bone-t ipped spears and ha rpoons, stone knives, axes and clubs (and slingstones, mentioned only by Speck12). Europeans traded iron harpoon and arrow heads, as well as sword blades which Waba nakis fitted to short wooden pikes to hunt moose and other big game. Guns, intr oduced by Europeans in the early 17th century gradually eclipsed use of spears and bows. Decoys and torches were used to attract some species in night hunting. Weirs - fences made of stakes driven into the floor of the ocean, lake, or watercourse and twined together with brush and/or twigs - were used to capture salmon, sturgeon and other fish, as well as por poises. Some fish were caught with baited bone gorges (and later with hooks) and sea mammal s were often slain with arrows, spears or harpoons by hunters in birchbark canoes. Game birds and small mammals were commonly caught by children in snares typica lly made of basswood or brown ash strips. Children also gathered the eggs of nesting wild fowls. 13 Notably, Wabanakis often hunted with domesticated dogs, described by Denys as \"a kind of Mastiff, but more li ghtly built,\" having \"the head of a Fox\" and \"long sharp teeth.\"14 The importance of these hunting companions is evident in Joseph Nicolar's recounting of the journey in which the Wabanaki culture hero \"Klose-kur-beh\" (Glooskap) learned about food. The story begins when he awakes to the sound of a barking dog, which comes to him \"s haking its tail . . . a nd having in his mouth large fragments of meat which he laid at the feet of [Glooskap], and said, 'I have come to say with you. . . . When you are in hunger I wi ll find game for you to kill that you may be filled. . . . I know where you and I are going this day, although the food I have brought is only enough for a little while, yet it will last dur ing our goings, though long it be. And as there is a spirit in all things, the united spirit of myself and those th at have sent me will have power in this matter. I fear not hunger.\" 15 In the next few pages, we offer detail s on several hunting and trapping methods in descriptions of specific animal food sources found in the MDI area. But before doing so, it is important to say a bit more about the tr aditional Wabanaki belief that all life is infused with a spirit, as mentioned by Glooskap's dog. Gi ven this belief and their absolute dependence on wild fauna and flora for food (and numerous other needs), it is not surprising that Wabanakis had a distinct respect for the creatures and plants that shared their habitat. This is reflected in the way most Waba naki kin-groups or clans are symbolically identified by \"totem\" animals ( n'tutem meaning \"relative of another kind\"). Wabanaki attitudes toward other life forms, Mi'kmaq scholars Whitehead and McGee wrote the following: They thought of these plants and animals - and even some minerals - as persons with whom they could communicat e. This belief affected the manner 12 Speck, 1940, 13 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 409in which they hunted and used animals a nd plants. For instance, . . . animals . . . killed for food and for skins were believed to be giving up their lives so that the people could live. The Micmac developed rituals and an etiquette to show their respect for this exchange of lives. One such ritual was to hang the bones of slain animals in trees or place them in rivers and thus prevent dogs from gnawing on them. The Micmac believed that the souls of animals honoured in this way would choose to be reborn near their bo nes. If the bones were shown any disrespect, the souls would leave the region and the people would go hungry. 16 This given, it makes sense that traditionally Wabanakis \"never made an accumulation of skins of Moose, Beaver, Otter, or others, but only so far as they needed them for personal use.\"17 Of course, this changed with the onset of fur trad e with the Europeans. MAMMALS From rabbits to moose and muskrats to whales, land and water mammals have comprised a vital part of the traditional diet of Maine's indigenous peoples. Some were much valued for their fat content, as well as their fles h. Flavorful stews were made by boiling meat and/or vegetables with one fat or another - especially that of moose, raccoon and harbor seal. Certain fats were treats in and of them selves: raccoon and bear grease were kept in bark vessels to be eaten at any time, someti mes mixed with maple sap; even more special (and very rich in vitamin D) was a crea my fat boiled out of crushed moose bones. 18 Moose, Deer & Caribou In the centuries following Wabanaki-Europe an contact, numerous newcomers penned descriptions of Native ways of hunting large game, in particular moose, the biggest of them all. Among these is Sir Ferdinando Gorges' 1622 account of seasonal moose hunting practices on Mount Desert Island, featur ed in the illustrated box at the start of this section. The large-scal e moose hunts he wrote about were not unlike those of more recently-described sub-arctic indigenous groups such as the Inuit, who engage in seasonal hunting of caribou, killing these large herbivor es at traditional water-crossing places. Typically, individuals who observed and wrote about Wa banaki moose hunts noted seasonal differences in techniques used to pursue the animal. In the warmer months, Wabanakis stalked the prey, wounded it and then endeavored to drive it as close to camp as possible before it dropped. In September, wh en moose retreated to lakes and rivers to escape bothersome flies, Wabanaki hunters fo llowed them, often \"still-hunting\" from their canoes at night. During mating season (mid-September through mid-November), hunters lured bulls into spearing or shooting range by im itating the cry of the cow with birchbark moosecalls. In the winter, the hun ters used dogs and wore snowshoes when stalking a moose. The more snow the better, since the heavy animal sank in the snow with each step and grew weary while the lightweight dogs and snowshoed hunters could move with relative ease. In the spring and summer, when the quality of moose hide and meat were less appealing and Wabanakis were busy going after othe r game, active pursuit 16 Whitehead & McGee, pp.7-8. 17 Denys, p.426. 18 Speck, 1940, pp.95-96. Concerning Rand, p.107. Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 410 of moose was uncommon - although no hunter would ignore an opportunity to take a moose any time of year if in need of food.19 One reason why there are so few early written records about Wabanakis at Mount Desert Island is th at the European market for moose hides resulted in thinning the Main e coastal herds. This not only forced Wabanakis to abandon these large-scale moose drives, but also may have affected their seasonal hunting patterns. In the late 1600s, for example, moose hunting at MDI seems to have turned into a small-scale enterprise in the winter months. During that season, of course, European fishermen and merchant s were rarely on the Maine coast and, accordingly, very little of such wintertime activities at MDI are documented. Several early writers noted creamy white \"moose butter,\" stor ed in birchbark containers and used to season food or eaten alone. Denys described how it was made: [Women] collected all the bones of the Moose, pounded them with rocks upon another of larger size, [and] reduced them to a powder; then they placed them in their kettle and made them boil well. This brought out a grease which rose to the top of the wa ter, and they collected it with a wooden spoon. They kept the bones boiling until they yielde d nothing more, and with such success that from the bones of one Moose, without counting the marrow, they obtained five to six pounds of grease as white as snow, and firm as wax. It was this which they used as their entir e provision for living when they went hunting. We call it Moose butter; and they Cacamo.20 In addition to this much favored fat, Wa banakis considered moose noses to be a delicacy and relished the rich marrow found in the animal's bones.21 The bones figure in a Glooskap legend linked to MDI and told in various versions, including the following: At Moose-tchick [\"moose rump\" - Cape Rosier] he killed a moose; the bones may be seen at Bar Harbor turned to stone. He threw the entrails of the Moose across the bay to his dogs, and they, too, may be seen there to this day, as I myself have seen them; and there, too, in the rock are the prints of his bow and arrow. 22 Beaver Wabanakis ate beaver and thought of its tail as an especially tasty tidbit.23 As with moose, their methods of hunti ng this animal varied seasonally. Denys wrote the following description of traditiona l beaver-hunting practices observed among Mi'kmaqs: The hunting of beaver took place in summer with arrows, when they were taken in the woods, or else in the la kes or ponds, where the Indians placed themselves in canoes at a proper spot to watch until they came to the surface 19 Denys, pp.428-430; Speck, 1940, pp.35-36. 1935, pp.8-9. Varied versions of this legend have been connected to landscape features in numerous places. Among other ve rsions, see Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 411of the water to take air. But the co mmonest and most certain way was to break their dam, and make them lo se water. Then the Beavers found themselves without water, and did not know any more where to go; their houses showed everywhere. The Indians took them with blows of arrows and of spears; and, having a sufficiency, they left all the rest. . . . In winter the hunting of them was done differently, the dams and the lakes being all frozen. Then the Indians have their Dogs, which . . . smelled the Beavers through the ice. Having found [t he beaver house], the Indians cut through the ice and made a hole large enough to let through a Beaver. Then they made another hole 25 or 30 paces away, on the open surface of the lake. In this place an Indian or two took their stand with a bow and an arrow which has a harpoon of bone at the end, made like a barbed rod, like that which was used in fishing the Sturgeon, but smaller. It has also a cord to which it is attached at one end, and th e Indian took hold of the other. Everything being ready, another Indian went to the othe r hole near the house of the Beavers. Lying down on his belly upon the ice, he placed his arm through the hole to find the Beavers' opening, that by which they place their tail in the water. There they are all arranged one against the other. . . . Having found them, the Indian passed his hand very gently al ong the back of one several times, and, approaching little by little to the tail tried to seize it. I have heard it said by the Indians that they have ke pt the arm so long in the water that the ice froze all around the arm. When they once seized the tail they drew the Beaver all at one swoop out from the water upon the ice, and at the same time gave it the axe upon the head. . . . Having th us drawn one out, they tried to obtain anot her, which they did in the same way, rubbing them gently. That does not put them to fli ght, for they imagine they are touching one another. But nevertheless three or four of them having been removed, the remainder take flight and throw themselves into the water. Not being able to remain long without breathing, the dayli ght which shows over the hole out on the surface leads them to go there to get the air. The other Indians who are there in ambush, so soon as they appear, give them an arrow shot; the harpoon, which has teeth, holds in some part of the Beaver from which it cannot be drawn out. The cord is then pulled and the Beaver is drawn out through the hole; then they raise it upon the ice and kill it. Some time after there comes another which is taken in the same way.\" 24 Muskrat Muskrats, Speck wrote, \"are hunted and trapped in the spring and fall; their pelts are sold, and every portion of their flesh is eaten wi th great relish by the Indians, who esteem muskrat meat most highly.\" Indeed, muskrat, like moose, continues to be a favored food among Wabanakis. Even when living in the cu linary paradise of Paris in the 1930s, the famous Penobscot dancer Molly Spotted Elk wrote in her diary th at she longed for muskrat stew. Speck described this stew, sikpe'su , as \"a staple diet in the spring when the ice has gone out of the rivers and quantitie s of muskrat are brought in by the hunters. When eating, they say whoever takes the muskrat head from the dish has to tell a story.\" 24 Denys, p.433. See also LeClercq, p.356. Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 412Listing other ways of preparing this aquatic rodent, he wrote: \"Muskrats, when skinned and cleaned, are stuck on a forked stick, the forks being pushed into the legs so that the carcass hangs down, while the end is stuck into the ground near the fire. The carcass is turned until it is nicely roasted. The entrails of muskrats and other animals eaten in camp are thrown on the smoldering ashes and raked off when brown. They are then washed and eaten.\" Finally, he noted, \"A fa vorite tidbit is muskrat tails fr ied between layers of fat. The tails become soft and juicy and are very sweet.\" 25 Like moose, muskrats were sometimes hunted with the aid of a calling devise. Short blows on a \"muskrat-call\" (made of a strip of birchbark sandwiched between two 3- long rectangles of wood), mimic the buzz-squeak call of this animal. According to Speck, \"By paddling along the banks of the river near deadwater, where muskrats are plentiful, the animals can be lured out to the canoe by manipulating the calls. When they are near enough they are hit with the paddle.\" 26 Harbor Seal Among sea mammals hunted by Wabanakis (including grey seal, porpoise, walrus and small whales), the harbor seal was an es pecially significant food source. Wabanakis found the meat tasty, and the fat provided va lued food flavoring and drink. Boiled in water, its fat floated to the surface as an oily substance that could be ladled into bladder skins for storage. Writing about harbor seals, Denys noted, \"They are good to eat. An oil is obtained form them unlike that of any of the other seals. This oil is to the Indians a relish at all the feasts they make among themselves.\" 27 Relatively easy prey, large herds of harbor seals congrega ted in coves, \"hauling out\" in pl easant weather to sun themselves on sandy beaches or rock slabs. In 1672 De nys described how Wabanakis hunted them: This kind of seal comes out on land in all kinds of season. . . . in good weather they are found ashore on a sa ndy coast, or indeed upon the rocks where they sleep in the sun. . . . There are places where they land with two to three hundred in a band. If they find ro cks along the land, or in cul-de-sacs where they usually resort, one finds them thereon asleep in the sun. It is there they are easy to kill, being but two or three on a rock, without a sentinel. They are easily approached with a canoe. If they are mortally injured they fall into the water and thrash about, and there they are taken. But if they are killed instantly, and fall into the water they go to the bottom like a stone. . . . all the oil they can yield is about their bladde r-full, and in this the Indians place it after having melted it. This oil is go od to eat fresh and for frying fish. 28 Porpoise Denys wrote that porpoise was \"good to eat. \" Speck gave a more nuanced assessment that Passamaquoddy were \"extremely fond of it, \" while \"many Indians, especially the Penobscot,\" disliked it due to its \"rank greas y smell.\" To cook it, he noted, Indians cut the meat into steaks and put them on \"the embers of a fire\" until \"partly roasted.\" While hunted for food, porpoise was valued especially for the quantity of oil it yielded, \"almost 25 Speck, 1940, p.95. 26 28 Denys, pp.349-350. Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 413a barrel to each one,\" according to Denys in 1672.29 Two centuries late r, a Bangor paper reported, \"An average porpoise yielded six to seven gallons of oil; a half-pint of prime watchmaker's oil dripped out of the jaws.\"30 Valued as a lubricant for clockworks and fuel for lamps (in great demand for lighthouses), porpoise oil sold for 90 cents a gallon in 1880, providing Wabanakis with money to purchase other kinds of food.31 Numerous descriptions have been writt en of porpoise hunting, usually marveling at the Wabanakis' ability to haul these unwie ldy animals into their canoes. For example: I made inquiries about the porpoise s and the [Passamaquoddy's] mode of catching them. . . . Their custom is to shoot th em with a rifle, and, before they have time to sink, paddle up and make fast with a lance, when the creature is dead taking him into the canoe. I afte rwards saw them at their work. One Indian sat at the stern of the canoe, using his paddle as easily as a fish does his fins, and another, rifl e in hand, stood at the bow. 32 Porpoises were shot with a long barreled gun loaded with a handful of powder and a heavy charge of double B s hot. In high seas the shooter had to fire while standing. The wounded porpoise was then killed with a long-handled spear. The feat of safely wrestling a slipper y, 300 to 500-pound porpoise corpse into a canoe, especially if the canoe was already well laden with others, almost defies belief. Sharks were ofte n about, and the water was always cold. 33 The Porpoise Fishery, 1887. Indian porpoise hunters of Passamaquoddy Bay canoe, rifle, and lance for capture of porpoise.

For a detailed description of porpoise hunting, see Ward. Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 414Typically, porpoises were butchered on the beach and the oil \"tried\" (extracted) there as well. The bones and whatever else wa s left of the carcasse s were picked at by gulls and washed out to sea in the tide, leav ing no trace of the processing of the animal. According to an account by a man who sp ent six summers porpoise-hunting in both Penobscot and Passamaquoddy bays with Passamaquoddy men in the late 1860s/early 1870s: When ashore, the porpoises are pelted off, by being first split down the back. Skin and blubber are removed together , the under jaw usually being left attached to the pelt. In the summer the pelt is about 2 inches thick. Porpoise pelts look like immense split salmon. Th ey are laid over poles raised on crotches and left for several days to dr y the water out of th e blubber. Then the pelt is cut into pieces 8 or 10 inches square for convenient handling; these pieces are laid on a board and cut into cubes not over \u00bc of an inch in diameter. Then this hash is put into a kettle and rendered ov er a slow fire. A porpoise in summer usually affords about 2 gallons of light straw colored oil, which in oil lamps used to burn about as well as sperm oil. It was used for oiling wool in woolen fact ories. The Indians someti mes mixed seal oil with it, which though lighter colored, is stic ky and would gum up the wool so that it was difficult to cleanse it. What is known as porpoise jaw oil does not come from the jaw, but from a fatty ma ss at the root of the lower jaw. The lower jaw is hung up in the sun, and the o il, which the sun dries out, is the so- called jaw oil much used by watchmakers. 34 Passamaquoddies alongside drying porpoise skins.

Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 415 Whale One night Glooskap's magician-giant friend Kitpooseagunow said, \"'Let us go on the sea in a canoe and catch whales by torchlight;' to which Glooskap, nothing loath, consented, for he was a mighty fisherman, as are all the Wabanaki of the seacoast. . . . Then Glooskap asked, 'Who shall sit in the stern and paddle, and who will take the spear?' Kitpooseagunow said, 'That will I.' So Glooskap paddled, and over a mighty whale . . . [and] he who held the spear sent it like a thunderbolt down into the waters, and as the handle rose again to sight he snatched it up, and the great fish was caught. . . . Then, taking him from the point, the fisher tossed him into the bark as if he had been a trout. And the giants laughed. . . . [Next,] the host took a stone knife and split the whale, and thre w one half to the guest Glooskap, and they roasted each his piece over the fire and ate it.\" 35 Beyond legends such as this, the historic record shows that Wabanakis killed and ate whale, especially whale blubber. A vi vid description of Wabanakis harpooning a whale comes from James Rosier in his account of Captain Weymouth's 1605 voyage to Monhegan Island and on to St. George's River on the west side of Penobscot Bay. There, meeting Indians belonging to the same ethnic group as those at MDI, Isle au Haut and Schoodic Point, at the time, Rosier heard how the Indians went about killing a whale: One especiall thing is their maner of killing the Whale, which they call Powdawe;36 and will describe his forme; how he bloweth vp the water; and that he is 12 fathoms long [72 feet]; and that they go in company of their King with a multitude of their boats, a nd strike him with a bone made in fashion of a harping iron fastened to a rope, which they make great and strong of the barke of trees, which they veare out after hi m; then all their boats come about him, and as he riseth aboue water, with their arrowes they shoot him to death; when they haue k illed him & dragged him to shore, they call all their chiefe lords together, & sing a song of joy: and those chiefe lords, whom they call Sagamos, divide the spoile, and giue to euery man a share, which pieces so distributed they hang vp about their houses for prouision: and when they boile them, they blow off the fat, and put to their peaze, maiz, and other pulse, which they eat. 37 If Rosier's Wabanaki informant did not exaggerate the size and Rosier did not misunderstand what he was being told, this would have been a fin whale. Common in the 35 Leland 1884, pp.74-76, including illustration. 36 Putep Rosier, p.33, in Kania, p.72. Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 416 MDI area, fin whales swim the inshore wa ters and grow to lengths of 60-70'. If exaggeration or misunderstanding did occur, the true story would have involved one of several smaller whale species that come at l east seasonally to inshor e waters and estuaries in the region - most likely the beluga, but possibly the pygmy sperm or long-finned pilot whales (both under 20 feet long), or perhaps th e minke and killer (or ca) whales (under 30 feet long). The humpback whale, which also swims the inshore waters, is another candidate for the story told to Rosier, particularly if it had not yet reached adult size of 40-50 feet in length. Yet another possibility is that two stories were conflated here: one about hunting smaller whales and another ab out slaying and feasti ng on a larger whale found stranded in shallow water.38 Nicholas Denys' mention of Mi'kmaqs eating whale may suggest that they feasted on these great creatures primarily on occasions when they found one of them stranded along the shore: \"[They] ate the Whale which frequently came ashore on the coast , and on the blubber of which they made good cheer. Their grea test liking is for grease; they eat it as one does bread, and drink it liquid.\" 39 Also noteworthy is a Wabanaki legend about Glooskap tricking a whale into shallow water where it runs aground. Told in abbreviated form below, it may imply that Indian hunters in canoes surrounded whales that entered waters too shallow to dive and then drove them ashore - a kind of reverse ve rsion of the way they drove moose into the water: When the time had come [for Glooskap] to pursue the enemy, he took his dogs and went to the shore and looked far out to sea over the waves and sang the magic song which whales obey. . . . [Then] there came the largest, a mighty female, and she bore him well and easily over to Kes-poog-itk. But she was greatly afraid of getting into shoal water, or of running ashore, and this was what Glooskap wished her to do that he might not wet his feet. So as she approached she asked him if land were in sight. But he lied, and said \"No.\" So she went on rapidly. . . . and suddenly found herself high on the s hore. Then she lamented. . no fear, noogumee , you shall not suffer, you shall swim in the sea once more.\" Then with a push of his bow against her head he sent her off into deep water. And the Whale rejoiced greatly. But ere she went she said, \"Oh my grandson . . . Has thou not such a thing as an old pipe and some tobacco?\". . . So he gave her a short pipe and some tobacco. . . . And the Whale, being of good cheer, sailed away, smoking as she went. 40 38 Eckstorm 1919, p.57. See also Reeves et al. 39 Denys, p.403 (emphasis added). 40 Leland 1884, pp.33-36, including illustration. Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 417 Looking at comparative, cross-cultural ex amples of indigenous whale hunters, we see that trapping or driving whales into wa ters where they cannot dive or maneuver was an established hunting strategy. For instance, co ncerning the Inuit of Quebec, we read of \"the existence of marine traps for bowhead whales, like that adjoining Ukiivik Island, which is a small bay almost closed at low tid e, of which the entrance was blocked so that whales trapped inside could be safely har pooned. . . . [being] easier to approach.\" These Inuit also hunted beluga whales which \"stayed in shallow water, preferring river es tuaries, small bays, a nd the proximity of the shore. The Inuit made use of these habits, tr apping entire herds inside bays that turned into lakes at low tide, where remarkable hunt s then took place.\" In addition, \"hunters in kayaks forced bowhead whales into coastal shallows where they were more easily harpooned, killed, and butchered at low tide.\"41 SHELLFISH From coastal mudflats, shallows and tide pools, Wabanakis harvested an array of shellfish, including clams, mussels, oysters, wh elks, crabs, lobsters and periwinkles. Soft-shell Clams & Oysters Penobscot legend has it that Wabanakis learned about eating clams from dog. As told by Nicolar, after woodpecker led Glooskap on a l ong journey to show all that he and his dog could eat among animals and plants, the bird fl ew away into the night. The next morning, the dog got up and shook himself and said, 'I have eaten the last of my food, I took it while you were in your sleep, and this day my work for your sake begins; whatever you want I shall find, but you must prepare it to your own liking - Give me not of it, but give me the crumbs, that is my portion.' Straightway the dog went until he came near to the edge of the water and there put his head down a nd began to dig the wet earth with his two paws, and soon brought out of it a shell fish and brought it to the man and laid it as his feet saying, 'Take a nd eat, and be filled,' and [Glooskap] did break the shell and did eat the Aiss - Clam. 42 However Wabanakis discovered th e clam's food value, it be came a staple in their diet, along with several other shellf ish, especially oysters. Clam s were harvested on beaches during low tide, but oysters were often \"hand- tonged\" from the wate r, sometimes through the ice. In 1672 Denys described Mi'kmaqs catching and cooking oysters in the winter: They are a great manna for the winter when the weather does not permit going on the hunt. They are in the coves or on the shore near the land. To obtain them the ice is broken and a large opening is made. Then one has little poles long enough to reach to the bottom of the water. Two of them are tied together about half-way up; then this [arrangement] is opened and closed like pincers. The Oysters are drawn from the water and thrown upon the ice. Men 41 Bernard Saladin d'Aglure, pp.489, 479. See also Robert F. Spencer, North Alaska Eskimo: Introduction , pp.278-308 about specialized whale-hunting group Margaret Lantis' Aleut , pp.161-184, 42 Nicolar, pp.52-53. Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 418never go to this fishery except there are several of them. Some fish, another makes the fire, another shells Oysters fo r a fricassee [stew], others place them upon the coals, two or three in a large sh ell with their water, crumbs of bread and little pepper or nutmeg. . . . When the men are sated, each one takes a load; and the dogs, harnessed like horses, draw each one a bagful on a little sledge which is made very light. 43 Two centuries later, Nicolar wrote about gathering and preparing oysters - and clams - along the Maine coast, noting their plentitude and describing how they were preserved: These oyster beds were so productive that . . . the shells of th is food fish were piled up almost mountain high on the shore of a river bank for a long distance. And the oyster period was enjoyed to within quite recently, so that the mounds of these shells can now be plainly seen on the coast of Maine. Clam beds were also found later, pretty near the spot of the oyster beds, a little toward the di rection of the rising sun. . . . The oysters and clams were dried in the sun, and when they have been sufficiently dried are packed in 'Mik-nur-queh - birch bark packing box,' in which th ey can be kept until winter. The 'Ar-nass-cum-nal'\u2014acorns, we re also gathered in their season and dried; and in the winter time, a family wishing to have a fashionable dinner, cooks the dried oyste rs in water, well seasoned with the bear or seal oil, and after the oysters are well soaked and boiled, the pounded acorns were added enough to give it good flavor. The clams were s ecured, cooked and served precisely the same way. 44 Speck echoed these descriptions, based on obs ervations in the first decades of the 20th century: \"Oysters and clams,\" he wrote, \"are gathered and dried either in the sun or in smoke and put away in bark vessels. To be used they are simply soaked or boiled and eaten in the shape of the usual stew or soup.\" Then, tying past to present, he added, \"The shell heaps in Penobscot Bay are universally said by the older Indians to be the accumulations where oyster- and clam-dryin g operations were carried on in former days.\"45 Later that century, based on archaeological finds at Mount Desert Island's Fernald Point, archaeologist David Sanger noted that soft-shell clams \"were probably opened by steaming them on the rock hearths we found at the site; there are few signs of damage to shells resulting from deliberate breakage. While most shellfish were probably eaten almost immediately, some may have been dr ied for future use, although there is no evidence for that practice in the archaeological record.\"46 Despite the apparent absence of shellfish-drying practices at the Fernald Point site, evidence from other sites, along with written and oral history records, es tablish that the practice was common. 43 Denys, p.359. 44 Nicolar, p.118. See also Eckstorm 1919, p.57. extraordinary in size were the shell heaps of Damariscotta, described by Wilson (pp.28-29) as \"a serp ent's tail of shallowly-mounded oyster shells [that] twisted and turned for nearly a mile along the riverbank. . . . the head of the serpent was a massive mound . . . nearly four hundred feet long, one hundred and twen ty-five feet wide, and as much as thirty feet high.\" 45 Speck, 1940, p.96. 46 In McMullen and Kopec 1994, pp.10-11. Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 419FISH Speck, and many others writing before and afte r him, made it clear th at Wabanakis ate an array of fresh and saltwater fish. 47 In shallow coastal waters they found flounder, smelt, shad, sculpin and skate. For sturgeon and sw ordfish, they ventured farther from shore.48 Passamaquoddy Wayne Newell, now in his sixtie s, speaks reverently of fish and has memories of fishing to put food on the fam ily table as a youngster in the early 1950s: Our culture has a special reverence for fish. To this day, although I am a full grown man, my mother will still remind me of this reverence by speaking of the haddock. It is very difficult to express in English what our Passamaquoddy name for haddock says. It refers to the markings at the haddock's head. I suppose the word means 'picked up by,' or the 'imprint left when something has been picked up.' Im plicit in the word, partly from the intonation when it is spoke n, is that the markings show that the fish was picked up by the hand of the creator, a reminder that the fish are given to us by the creator. The reminder applies mo re broadly, but everyone agrees the haddock is the sweetest fish. I started to fish when I was twelve years old or so. My mother would send me and my younger brother out to fish fo r dinner. We didn't have a boat, but we would use one that belonged to someone else, that was understood to be ok, as long as you took care of the boat and put it back where it belonged. I learned how to catch flounder just by being down along the shore and watching. I remember too just taking a pan down to the beach when the whales would come into the Bay and ch ase the fish towards the shore. We would gather them from the beach, or someone would stand in the shallows and toss fish onto the beach. Flounder was a staple food for us. Haddock and pollock were the prize fish. Cod was the last choice, but it would be used for a stew, often cooked with heads and all. 49 After being cleaned and split fr om head to tail, fish were also roasted, smoked, dried and sometimes salted. For smoking they were t ypically hung on a horizon tal pole over a fire. For roasting, wrote Speck, \"Fresh fish ar e planked on a flat piece of wood by a peg through the head [and] leaned before a hot fire. . . . \"50 Roland Newell, now in his fifties, has personal and passed-down recollections of Passamaquoddy families drying fish: In the fall of each year, we all knew that we needed to dry fish if we were going to survive the winter. Every hous ehold was drying fish. That was our survival for the winter. We dried flounde r by just taking the heads off, gutting the fish out and nailing it to the side of a building, to dry in the sun. Pollock and cod were split whole and dried on cl otheslines. Herring were salted down for winter in a barrel. 51 47 Speck, 1940, p.82. 48 See Haviland 2003 (np); and Sanger 1989, in McMu llen & Kopec, p.11. Prehistoric remains of swordfish at Blue Hill Bay, MDI and Isle au Haut show that Wabanaki maritime hunting skills were impressive. 49 Quoted in Soctomah, 2003, pp.20-21, 14. 50 Speck, 1940, p.96. 51 Quoted in Soctomah, 2003, p.20. Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 420 Salmon Each spring, salmon (and various other anadromous fish) left coastal waters and swam up rivers through rapids and over small falls to lay their eggs in fresh water. They were trapped at fish weirs or speared in the pools where they rested - sometimes at night, by torchlight. Then they were split and roasted for immediate eating or hung on smoking racks above a smoldering fire to be preserved for later consumption. Plentiful and easy to catch during spawning season, salmon were considered a source of bountiful culinary pleasure. Speck noted that children would \"greedily . . . suck the raw fish for the spawn.\" Among numerous descriptions of traditional salmon hunting/trapping methods is the following, written by Speck about Penobscots: To these Indians, practically all of whom lived near the Penobscot River, the spearing of salmon in their annual run up-stream in June, July, or Aug, was one of the great seasonal events. When the lightning bugs begin to appear in June, they say it is the sign for salmon spearing. The Penobscot salmon sometimes attain a weight of 40 lbs. During the run, just above falls or rapids, the men would occupy some ledge and spear the fish as they came by. Camps were established in such vicinities. At other times they went in canoes, the bow man with a spear watching for fish. At night a torch consisting of a green stave, split at the end to hold a bundle of folded birch-bark strips wound with splints and frayed at the ends, was fastened in the bow of the canoe. These methods of catching salmon were practiced until about 1912, when spearing was prohibited by the makers of the game laws. 51 Birchbark Torch Passamaquoddy Joe Mell night-fishing, c1910. (In Carle, p.3) About 250 years before Speck wrote the above, Denys penned a similar description about Mi'kmaqs and the annual salmon run: The Indians used [birchbark torches also for fishing the Salmon.... [which] 51 Speck, 1940, pp.82-83. Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 421come from the sea and ascend the rivers in spring. There occur many pools in these rivers, in which the Salmon pl ay after having as cended, which they have trouble in doing because of the fa lls which are found th ere. . . . Having remained there some time they ascend again still higher. To these places of rest the Indians went at night with their canoes and their torches. . . . The Salmon . . . seeing the fire which sh ines upon the water, come wheeling around the canoe. He who is standing up has in his hand a harpoon . . . and soon as he saw a fish passing he speared at it, and rarely missed. . . . taking a hundred and fifty to two hundred in a night. 53 In the mid-1800s a newspaper article about Passamaquoddy life also described taking salmon by torchlight, making particul ar note of the spear commonly used - a leister: \"[It] was from two to three fathoms long, and had an iron spik e in the center, with two spreading jaws of wood fastened with a st ring, that closed and held the fish to the spike.\"54 Leisters were also used to spear ot her fish, including flounder, a tasty and relatively easy catch found in coastal shallows in low tide.55 Most chroniclers of Wabanaki life also wrote about the catching salmon (and other fish) in weirs. In the words of Denys: They make use also of another device. At the narrowest place of the rivers, where there is the least water, they ma ke a fence of wood clear across the river to hinder the passage of the fish. In the middle of it they leave an opening in which they place a bag-net . . . so arranged that it is inevitable the fish should run into them. These bag-nets . . .they raise two or three times a day, and they always find fish therein. It is in spring that the fish ascend, and in autumn they descend and return to th e sea. At that time they placed the opening of their bag-net in the other direction. 56 Eel Another favored meat came from eels, also caught in weirs as they made their \"fall exodus . . . down to salt water.\" Speck described eeling parties in which hundreds of these fish were taken in a night. \"In places where weirs are set for eels,\" he wrote, \"pits are dug along the shore some three or four feet wide and about three deep, the number of the pits depending upon the quantity of eels caught. These pits are made for the freshly caught eels to be thrown into, so that they will free themse lves of slime, for otherwise they could not be handled conveniently.\" Usua lly, the eels were split, dried or smoked at the site. In Speck's words: \"Eels are split open, the backbones being taken out and saved to put into corn soup, and the carcasses hung up on a frame like the smoking rack to dry or to be smoked. In winter they are frozen. Boiled over again they make excellent soup. 57 Speck also recounted one particularly in teresting eye witness account of a week- long eeling party of five families at Sunkhaze Meadow (slightly northeast of Indian 53 Denys, p.436. 54 Eastport Sentinel, 18 Sept. Speck 1940, p.96. Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 422Island, Old Town) in the fall of 1900 - intere sting because it desc ribes preparing and spreading a poisonous flora compound in th e stream to render the eels torpid: They began by poisoning the stream with decoctions of pokeberry and Indian turnip root. The Indians' time for securi ng enough eels to last a year is at low water in August. Then the Indian turn ip root, which grows in moist ground along streams, and the berries of the poke plants are richest and contain the most poison, which stupefies the fish. The party carried bags of berries and baskets of salt, depending upon game and fish for thei r sustenance during the trip. The first two days were spent in digging the roots and crushi ng them with the purple pokeberries upon the surface of flat stones. When a sufficient quantity of the mixture had been prepared, they stripped to the skin and, distributing themselves along the stream for a distance of a mile , plunged into the water, strewing the poisoned pulp thickly upon the surface and diving to the bottom, where they stirred up the muddy sediment with sticks and poles. When the water was so strongly impregnated with the juices that the workers were dr iven ashore with inflamed and smarting skins, half an hour was spent in dressing and rubbing the inflamed spots with fresh plantain leaves. By this time the agitate water had settled. Torpid eels began to appear upon the surface, and before an hour had passed the top of the water was spotted with the bodies of dead or dying fish, which floated belly up, unable to escap e. The children of the party, having recovered from their hurts, were then forced to enter the water and bring the fish ashore, where they were skinned and salted by the women. After this the eels were placed upon dead limbs and laid in the sun to dry for two days. Then they were hung up in a tent and smoked until there was no drip from the suspended bodies. 58 Sturgeon Larger fish were taken by harpoon. This incl uded the sturgeon, a large fresh and saltwater fish, described by Denys as up to \"12 feet in length . . . as thick in body as a sheep . . . [with] flesh is as good as beef.\" The challenge of sturgeon hunting from a canoe seems to have been even greater than porpoise hunting. As relayed by Denys: That fish comes to the entrances of the rivers. It throws itself in a leap its height above the water. It is taken with a harpoon, which is made like a barbed rod, of 8 to 10\" long, pointed at one end and with a hole at the other in which is attached a line.Then it is fastened at the end of a pol e so that it may be used as a dart. The fishery is made in the night. Two Indian s place themselves in a canoe; the one in front is upright, with a harpoon in his ha nd, the other is behind to steer, and he holds a torch of birch bark, and allows the canoe to float with the current of the tide. When the Sturgeon perceives th e fire, he comes and circles all around, 58 Speck, 1940, p.89. Linked to the Penobscot River, Sunhaze Stream was part of a favored inland canoe route between Indian Island and points eastwar d, including Union R and Mount Desert Island. Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 423turning from one side to the other. So soon as the harpooner sees his belly, he spears it below the scales. The fish, feeling himself struck, swims with great fury. The line is attached to the bow of the canoe, which he drags along with the speed of an arrow. It is necessary that the one in the stern shall steer exactly as the Sturgeon goes, or otherwise it will overturn the canoe, as sometimes happens. It can swim well, but with all its strength it does not go with fury more than a hundred and fifty or two hundred paces. That being over, the line is drawn in, and it is brought dead against the side of the canoe. Then they pass a cord with a slip-kno t over the tail, and they draw it thus to land, not being able to take it into the canoe because it is too heavy. 59 BIRDS & BIRD EGGS For Wabanakis, birds were a significant f ood source that children helped secure. From the nests of larger birds, youngsters collected eggs, which were \"much relished raw or boiled.\"60 Also, using loop snares, children seized smaller birds such as the ruffed grouse. According to Denys, they even managed to take wild geese, sneaking up on the birds as they grazed and then clubbing them. Adults, he wrote, usually hunted geese at night: \"Two or three men in a canoe would drift silently into the middle of a flock of sleeping birds; then they would light birchbark torches and make a lo t of noise. The startled geese would awaken and fly into the air. In their confusion they would circle around the bright torches. The men would club the birds, then wring their necks. The Micmac could fill a large canoe in a night in this way. After feasting on fresh roast goose, they would smoke the rest.\" They also took ducks this way. 61 As noted earlier in this section, Wabanakis would come to the seashore for fowling dur ing molting season in late July and early August, when young seabirds are not yet able to fly and adults are hampered in flight because they are molting - losing their old feathers and getting new ones. Josselyn described how Wabanakis hunted cormorants, another food source: \"[The birds] roost in the night upon some rock th at lies out in the sea; thither the Indian goes in his birch canoe when the moon shin es clear.\" After quickly identifying and killing \"the watchman\" bird, the hunter co uld then, by \"walking softly\" among the birds, pluck them one-by-one and wring their necks.62 Speck's older Penobscot informants told hi m that waterfowl of various kinds were also taken with \"slingstones attached to a leather line\": These slingstones were, it is claimed, carri ed in the canoe ready to be thrown at birds or other small animals when espied in the water. The plummet- shaped stones found commonly throughout New England and numerous also in the Penobscot valley are identified by the Indians as the slingstones. Several were obtained, one having been fixed to a thong to illustrate the complete object. They average from 2.75\" -3\" long and l.25-1.75\" wide. The pear-shaped stones, or slingstones, as they probably were, must have formed part of the paraphernalia of almost every man.\"63 59 Denys, pp.353-354. Illustration from p.132. 63 Speck 1940, pp.46-47. Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 424 Among seabirds, gulls were especially va lued for meat and eggs. Commonly, they nested on offshore islands, and Wabanakis cano ed to these sites seasonally to harvest the birds at various stages of development. On e description of a late -1860s outing to Grand Manan Island reveals that even hatchlings were seen as valuable food sources: \"Around the cliffs on the Southern Head is a favorite nesting place for gulls. . . . The Indians take the young gulls and carry them away. I saw seve ral of them at Pleasant Point that had been thus torn from the parental nest at Grand Manan. They were tamer than chickens, and were being fattened on porpoise oil for some future feast.\"64 REPTILES While nearly every animal was fair game in starvation times, snakes and frogs were generally not eaten. Turtles, however, compri sed part of the Waba naki diet - although clearly not a favored part. Painted and snap ping turtles were boile d, skinned, cut into pieces and served as stew. As Speck put it, \"Turtles are boiled until tender, although it is rarely that they get so, and eaten.\"65 PLANT FOODS Wild Carrot Raspberry Beaked Hazelnut Suga r Maple Sarsparilla When woodpecker led Glooskap on a long journey to show what he and his dog could eat among animals and plants, he point ed out the roots of the groundnut and the Canada lily, plus various berries - strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, huckleberries, and gooseberries .66 Taken on the whole, the plant world figured mode stly in the traditiona l diet of Wabanakis compared to the animal world. Nonetheless, vegetation provided valued and significant nutrition sources, including numerous kinds of berries, nuts, roots and tubers, as well as leaves and flowers, most of which are pr esent in the Mount Desert Island area. Various species of blueberries, cranberries , strawberries, raspberries and cherries were relished fresh or dried. These, accordi ng to Speck, \"were spread out and dried, then put away in baskets or bark ve ssels and kept until wanted. Thus in all seasons a fine dish of stewed fruit was possible, either to be eat en alone or mixed with meat and vegetables. Or dried fruit could be soaked in wa ter until soft again and eaten raw.\" 67 64 DeCosta, 1871, p.262. 15: Uses of & Animals 425Nuts - acorns, beechnuts and beaked hazelnuts - were gathered and stored when they fell to the ground each autumn.68 The bulbs of Jerusalem artichokes and several other species, in addition to groundnuts and wild lilies, were eaten, as were the roots of wild carrots and the leaves of wild lettuce.69 Interestingly, although young, unfurled ostrich ferns (\"fiddleheads\") were common greens in the Wabanaki diet, they have never been recorded in any parts of Acadia Na tional Park or anywhere on Mount Desert, apparently due to the island's acidic soil.70 Tea-like beverages were made by steeping various plants - roots of sweetflag and sarsaparilla; leaves of hemlock, spruce, sweet fern, willow herb and wintergreen; twigs of fir balsam, birch (black and yellow), labrador tea, maple (striped and sugar), sassafras, wild cherry and witch hazel. Other plants were used as seasonings - such as wild mustard seed and berries. Most chroni cles that touch on food habits among Wabanakis have a fair amount to say about the white or sugar maple, noting that the sap was used as a beverage and also boiled down to a liquid sweetener or sugar.71 Numerous other edible plants located on Mount Desert Island were probably used by Wabanakis, even if not noted by observers who apparently were more interested in medicinal than nutritional uses. These include lambsquarters greens, the young leaf stems and peeled stalks of seaside angelica, the young roots/leaves/l eaf stems of common burdock, and the young leaves and stalks of willow herb.72 WABANAKI FOOD COLLECTION ON AND NEAR MOUNT DESERT ISLAND Archaeological data, especially several hund red shell middens scattered along the coast and offshore islands between Penobscot a nd Gouldsboro bays - including on Mount Desert Island and its neighbor islands - make it clear th at Wabanakis utilized food resources all across this region for thousands of years. The pl entitude and size of certain shellfish species impressed early explorers, including Captain John Smith, whose account of his 1614 survey of the Main e coast included this observa tion: \"You shall scarce find any Baye, shallow shore, or Cove of sa nd, where you may not take many Clampes or Lobsters, or both at your pleasure; and in many places load your boat if you please.\"73 Of particular note for this study is the fact that Waba naki names for Bar Harbor translate as \"clam gathering place\" or \"clambake place.\"74 In 1913 some 75 shell middens were mapped within a 15-mile radius of the town by archaeologist Warren Moorehead,75 and some of these sites were excavated in the years that followe d. In 1985 archaeologist Diane Kopec of the Abbe Museum led a survey focusing on Mo unt Desert Island, Trenton and smaller off-shore islands, visitin g a total of 62 middens. Half of these had been previously recorded, a nd the other half were \"locat ed 'in route.'\" 68 Moorehead was with the Robert S. Peabody Foundation for Archaeological Research at Phillips Academy. Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 426reported that many sites noted in the past had become barely visible or vanished altogether due to \"severe erosion, compounded by human activity.\" Of the 62 sites Kopec visited, 52 percent were less than 25 meters long, but a few ranged in size from 80 to 160m - and the largest was lo cated in Northeast Harbor.76 Maine archaeologist David Sanger led the 1977 excavation of Mount Desert Island's Fernald Point - the area where Chief Asticou and many other Etchemin chiefs gathered in early 1600. Reporting on the results of this work, Sanger stated that the site was occupied seasonally (likely by ancestors of today's Wabanakis) for about 2300 years (from 3000-700 years ago) and \"quite h eavily\" for 1300 years (from 2000-700 years ago). 77 Discussing diet indicators found at the site, Sanger wrote: Buried in the various she ll layers at Fernald Poin t are bones of sea and land mammals, birds, and fish. Not repres ented, perhaps due to preservation factors, were the results of gathering wild vegetable foods, like berries, roots, and nuts. Simply because evidence of these foods is not present does not mean that they were not consumed. We a ssume that they were part of the diet of the Fernald Point people. 78 Sanger went on to list and describe 48 species of animal remains found at the site, indicating \"a diet that balan ced land and sea species.\" Am ong shellfish, soft-shell clam remnants were most plentiful. \"Strangely,\" he noted, Native inhabitants \"seem to have avoided lobsters; we have found only one claw in twenty years of excavation in coastal Maine sites.\" Flounder and sculpi n bones topped the list of fi sh remains; seals \"and a few porpoises\" were also present. \"Birds, while not common,\" were \"mostly sea-oriented species, such as eiders and great auk\" (a penguin-like bird, now extinct). Among the bones of land species found at the site, were beaver, deer, bear \"and an occasional moose.\" While present, muskrat remains were \"rare, probably due to the lack of a suitable local habitat.\" 79 DeCosta's Rambles on Mount Desert offers a peek at shell middens about 1870 - and reveals how these storehouses of info rmation concerning Wabanaki eating habits were being destroyed by amateur weekend di ggers using tools such as clam rakes. Writing about Gouldsboro (east of MD I, north of Schoodic), he noted: The chief interest gathers around the shell-heaps, the relics of multitudinous dinners eaten during the old times by the Indians who dwelt around the harbor. These shell-heaps are often several feet deep, and sometimes cover acres of ground. They are mixed more or less with earth and ashes and contain antiquities such as arrowheads, stone hatchets and chisels, together with pieces of rude potte ry, and the bones of birds a nd animals that were used as food. At the mouth of the harbor, the banks on either side are whitened by them. A sort of clam rake with long teeth is the best thing to use in turning over the shells. In heaps like these may be found the bones of moose, the deer and the bear, with those of birds. . . . 76 Kopec, 1987. See Spiess maps in Chapter 19 for more details on sites in the area. 77 In McMullen and Kopec, p.10. 78 In and Kopec, pp.10-11. Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 427 Describing middens nearer MD I, DeCosta wrote: \"The most accessible heaps from Bar Harbor are those on Bar Island and at Hull's Cove, and all of them require much patience and perseverance on the part of the digger, as the relics are not so plenty as some suppose; though in the cart-track at the form er place I found a spot where the natives evidently made their arrows, as the half-s haped fragments were dug out all around it. The stone used was a variety now found near Katahdin, from wh ere it was brought.\"80 In contrast to archaeological records, written records concerning pre-19th-century Native hunting and gathering practices pertaining specifical ly to Mount Desert Island are relatively rare. Among ear ly notations of Wabanakis securing food on MDI is Champlain's 1604 mention of encountering two Indians (probably Newport Cove) when he followed the smoke of what turned out to be a campfire. Making note of the me n in his journal, he wrote that \"they had come to hunt beaver and to catch fish, some of which they gave us.\" 81 (Drawing at left: Native men fishing in a Mi'kmaq-style canoe, early 1600s. From Les Raret\u00e9s des Indes by B\u00e9card de Granville. Gilcrease Museum, Tulsa, Oklahoma .) The French missionary Biard, writing in 1613 about the site of Chief Asticou's early summer village on the west side of Some's Sound, commented on the plentitude of fish to be found in Mount Desert Island's stre ams: \"His place is a beautiful hill, sloping gently from the sea-shore, and supplied w ith water by a spring on each side. The ground comprises from twenty-five to thirty acres, cove red with grass. . . . It fronts the south and east, towards Pentegoet [Penobsco t] Bay, into which are discha rged the waters of several pretty streams, abounding in fish.\"82 Nicholas Denys' 1672 description of the Penobscot Bay area, including MDI, revealed one of many fish species available to Wabanakis as a food source: \"In front of the entrance of th e [Penobscot] river there are many islands a little way off, around which the English take a gr eat number of Mackerel as well as at the mouth of the river, where lies the Isle des Mont Deserts.\"83 Some three centuries later, DeCosta noted that \"At Mount Desert [Indian s] occasionally . . [in] the weir.\" And in 1940 anthropologist Frank Speck reiterated the ongoing importance of fish harvested from th e Penobscot Bay: \"The Penobscots at all times depended to a large extent upon the many fish of their lakes, river, and bay for a food supply. Some of the old capturing devices are at times still employed.\"84 In 1677 a young Englishman was taken to Mount Desert Isla nd by his Wabanaki captors, who usually hunted there during the winter months. One 19th-century recounting of this story, reads as follows: 80 DeCosta, English edition. 84 Speck, 1940, p.82. While published in 1940, Speck' s book was based primarily on his 1909-14 research. Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 428In coming here [to MDI] the Indians simply followed the custom of their ancestors. The old chroniclers occasionally mention their visits, as is the case with Hubbard who connects it with the captivity of young Cobett, son of the minister at Ipswich, Massachusetts, who was taken prisoner by the Indians, near Portland, in 1677. He was afterwards take n by his 'pateroon,' or master, to Mount Desert, where he was accustomed to spend his winters, and arrange his hunting expeditions. Hubbard says: 'In that desert-like condition was the poor young man forced to continue nine weeks in the service of a savage miscreant who sometimes would tyrannize over him, because he could not understand his language, and for want thereof might occasion him to miss his game, or the like.' At the end of nine weeks 'on a sudden he took a reso lution to send this young man down to Penobscot to Mr. [Jean Vincent d'Abbadie de St.] Casteen to procure more powder to kill moose and deer, which it seems is all their way of living at Mt. Desert.' This journey led to his ransom, which was finally effected by being exchanged for a good co at. Hubbard tells us how that on one occasion while a prisoner on the island he went out to hunt, and was so overcome by the cold that he became senseless, and that the Indians were obliged to take him on their shoulders and carry him to the nearest wigwam. Formerly, also, the beaver was plenty here [on MDI], as is still attested by the remains of their dams. 85 In 1831, the well-known Penobscot Lt. Governor John Neptune (1767-1865) sent a letter to the state governor complaining that settlers were obstructing Native use of three islands commonly used by his people as stopovers in the much traveled Eggemoggin Reach route between the Penobscot River and Mount Desert Island: There are three islands west erly of Mount Desert, not far from Naskeag point in Sedgwick called White Island, Black Island and Wawkeag Island, which the Indians have always used for landing, stopping and fishing. But lately some white men have come upon the Islands, built one house there and say to us they will not let the Indians haul up their canoes there, nor camp, nor do anything in these any more. We pray that all white people may be told to go away from these three Islands, let the Indians use them as their fathers have always done. 86 We have not been able to id entify Wawkeag Island, but it is interesting to note that in 1786 White and Black islands were granted by treaty to the Penobscots in return for surrender of certain claims on the Penobscot River. 87 Shell middens there, in addition to Neptune's comment about fishing, show that these islands were food stations for Wabanakis in their regular coastal migrations. Virginia Somes-Sanderson's memoir about Somesville offers a peek at Wabanaki hunting and gathering activities on MDI in the 18th and 19th centuries. Her summarizing narrative draws heavily from an account by her \"A unt Dell\" (Adelma Somes Joy), great grand-daughter of Abraham Somes who town's first settler in 1761: 85 DeCosta, 1871, pp.97-98. For more on this, see Chapter 7. 86 25 Jan. 1831 letter to \"His excellency Governor Smith...\" from John Neptune, Lt. Gov. & Joseph SocBasin, delegate.\" MSA, Box 36, folder 29. For more on this, see Chapter 9. 87 MHS, Farnam Papers, cited in McLane & McLane, p.331. Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 429 For years the Penobscots had made Mount Desert Island their special place. In the mountains of the Island they had hunted bear, wildcats, [moose], and deer; in the meadows and marshes, beaver, otte r, and musquash (muskrats); in the waters, alewives, bass, salmon, and shad; on the shores, they dried clams, oysters, and cod for winter use. It was their custom to spend late spring and summer on the Island hunting and fish ing. . . . To Abraham Somes and his family, the Indians were both friends and teachers. . . . It was from the Indians that he learned that the looping together of flax fibres could be used to make a 'netting' to catch fish and to hold ma ny objects too large to slip through the meshes. . . . 'Aunt Dell' recalled her gr andfather, John, telling her that when he was a boy, one of the Indians taught him how to make a scoop net for fishing.88 Penobscots were still hunting deer and other game on Mount Desert Island in 1871 when DeCosta published his Rambles in Mount Desert: \"Deer are still found in the mountains [on MDI],\" he wrote. \"The Oldtow n Indians resort here every season to hunt them in connection with the otter, fox, w ild-cat, muskrat and mink. The law allows the deer to be hunted for three months, ending w ith the fifteenth of D ecember.\" But in 1887, a new law passed further restri cting deer hunting. As the Mount Desert Herald reported on the first day of that year, \"The Fish and Game Laws of Maine st ate the following laws now enforce Game Chap.30; Fish Chap. 40, Spec ial Act for the protection of deer on the island of Mt. Desert. No person, except duri ng the months of November and December, shall in any manner, hunt or kill any deer on the island of Mt. Desert. Indians are liable to the foregoing penalties the same as any other person.\" Various historic records note the importance of fowl (and their eggs) in the diets of Wabanakis who frequented Ma ine's coastal islands. In the 17 th century Rosier wrote of \"the remnants of an Indian encampment on the shores of Allen Island in Muscongus Bay - where 'fire had been made; and about the place were very great egg shells.'\" In 1724 fisherman Ebenezer Hall of Matinicus Island was killed by a group of Indians when he ignored a Massachusetts Court order pr ohibiting him from burning over nearby Green Island at the outer reaches of Western Penobscot Bay. Hall, who supplemented his fisherman's livelihood by sel ling hay, burned the island to stimulate a flush of new growth and thereby wreaked ha voc on a traditional Wabanaki fowling and egg collection site.89 Further east, on Isle au Haut , at the southern end of Mount Desert Island's offshore island neighborhood, Wabanakis drove ducks up the narrow head of Duck Harbor, killing them \"by the hundreds in the molting season, and then smok[ing] them for winter provisions.\" 90 And right on the doorst ep of MDI, according to an 1889 newspaper notice, \"John Bear [Mitchell] and Peal Sockose came home from Ar-bes-son-nuck, 'Mt.

Mitchell (Penobscot, b.1851) is listed on the 1880 Federal census for Indian Island as married to Maria Newell (Penobscot, b1858) with one child, Martha (b.1878). On the 1900 census he appears with 4 children in addition to Martha - Elizabeth (b.1889), Theodore (b.1890) , Clara (b.1892) and Sabattis (b.1897). By this time he had remarried Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 430Penobscots of Indian Island, Old Town, were hunting for the gul l feather market, but it is likely they also ate the birds and their eggs during this spring hun ting expedition. Perhaps they even brought home a few live young birds, for Passamaquoddy were known to keep young gulls and fatten them on porpois e \"for some future feast.\"92 During this time Wabanakis continued ag e-old traditions of fishing and clamming along the coast and offshore islands. Penobscot Ted Mitchell (b.1919), whose father, and great-grandparents, as well as his grandfather Jo hn Bear Mitchell (not ed just above) spent summers on Mount Desert Island in the 19th and early 20th centuries, recalled that in addition to being there during the summer, \"they went there for fish and clams during wintertime. They would salt the fi sh and bring it home for winter.\"93 A late 19th-century survey of Hancock County94 includes details about natural resources, including fish and shellfish, in that era. From it we le arn the plentitude of marketable fish in the region, which gi ves us a window on species available to Wabanakis as sources of both food and income at the time. Codfish and mackerel top the list of deep-sea fishes, netted by the tons from commercial vessels . In addition, cod, haddock and hake were being taken by coun tless men and women living on outer and offshore islands and engaged in line-fishi ng from small, open, hand-powered boats. Locals set harbor weirs for he rring (\"scarcely second to any in commercial importance\") and also pursued these fish in wintertime at Grand Manan (in the Bay of Fundy) and in summertime at the Magdalen Islands (in the Gu lf of St. Lawrence about 65 miles north of Prince Edward Island). Other harbor fish no ted in the survey in cluded flounder, smelt, frost-fish and eels, as well as clams, scall ops and Porgy were also found (\"in illimitable numbers\") in harbors; however, this migratory fish was caught not for food but for oil and \"chum\" (the \"residuum left af ter expressing the oil), which had been recognized as a \"fertili zer without a peer.\" The survey noted that the demand for the \"luxurious fl esh\" of lobsters had soared by 1878, and numerous canning factories had been established from Castine to Gouldsboro, including on Mount Desert Island. Smelt fishing through th e ice, carried out by individual fishers, each typically situated in a \"'seven by nine ' cotton cloth covered fish-house, with a floor and a stove,\" usually yielded a day catch worth about $2.50 - twice factory wages of the day. Concerning salmon, the survey noted: \"Until a comparatively recent period, the rivers of this country fairly swarmed with them,\" and Union River was a \"favorite haunt\" for the species. But commercial \"salmon fishing is now confined to the Penobscot and Bagaduce ri vers.\" Moreover, river fishing of salmon, well and shad, \"is almost conf ined to weirs.\" Weirs yielded anywhere from 50 to 1600 pounds of salmon per year. Also signifi cant was the growth of fish farming at this time. The Penobscot Salmon Breeding Works was established on Spofford's Brook in Bucksport in 1872. Three years later, 2 m illion salmon eggs were distributed from these works into various waters in Maine. \"Fish-farming,\" proclaimed the Hancock Survey, \"is big with promise. It is said that four Indians took 2,000 pounds of pickerel from Scammon's pond in Eastbrook [12 miles northeast of Ellsworth] , in one week.\" a young woman named Mary (b.1873). He was the grandfather of Ted Mitchell (b.1919) and great great grandfather of John Bear Mitchell (b.1968). 92 DeCosta, 1871, p.262. 93 Ted Mitchell, interview by McBride, 23 June, 2004. 94 Wasson, 1878, pp.38-43. Chapter 15: Food Uses of Plants & Animals 431 Numerous reports of porpoise hunting in wa ters near Mount Desert Island can be found for the period between the mid-1800s and early 1900s. According to one local account, \"In the olden days, or from about 1860 to 1900, I well remember that in the early Spring, Indian encampments or 'villages' were the order of things in Bar Harbor, and indeed, when we saw the first of their little tents being set up, and the hunters racing in the Bay for porpoises, we were sure that the 'season' had really begun.\"95 DeCosta also noted Wabanaki porpoise-hunting in Frenchman Bay during that era: \"At Mount Desert they occasionally find a good-sized shark or horse mackerel, but oftener the porpoise thus comes into the weir. Schools of these continually gambol about the bay for the edification of visito rs, or as a prize for the Indians who hunt them for oil. I started once across Frenchman's Bay for their camp on Iron-bound Island to see them at home, paddling with an old trapper in his bark canoe; but when we got halfway over, a hard rain-storm set in, and we thought it best to return at once. Still the trip afforded an opportunity of testing the qualities of the 'bark' on the long ocean swell. No boat could have behaved more admirably.\" 96 Another mention came from the Passamaquoddy Indian ag ent in 1875: \"Quite a number of the tribe who live at this place [Calais] are away for the summer . . . . About 20 families are at Bar Harbor, selling their wares and catching porpoises.\"97 Residents of Eagle Island (in East Penobscot Bay between A cadia National Park conservation easements on Butter and Bald islands) reported that Passamaquoddies and Penobscots visited various islands in the area during the 1880s and 90s. Arriving by canoe and landing at Lighthouse Cove, they cam e to collect shellfish and gull's eggs, and also to hunt sea mammals. Among the vi sitors were Passamaquoddy Joe Dana (b1852) and the well-known Penobscot chief and showman, Frank Loring, known as \"Big Thunder.\" Typically, Loring (b1827) went to the light and asked the keeper, Captain John Ball, for permission to camp. The group set up camp near Lighthouse Beach close to a spring that marked the boundary line of the lighthouse property and Samuel Quinn's farm. Although Capt. Ball granted permission, th e site was actually on Quinn's property. Ball's son Harold (Howard?), who took ove r as keeper in 1898, remembered how the Wabanaki visitors speared seal s that basked on the rocky shor e or nearby ledges. He also recalled their porpoise hunting activities, as did another re sident, Laura Dodge Brown, who said she was told by eye-witnesses that the Indians added to their food supply by shooting porpoises from their canoe s while paddling along the shore. 98 In addition to 95 Higgins, 1934. 96 DeCosta, 1871, p.172. 97 Hobart, Passamaquoddy Agent.

(U.S. Coast Guard Photo/ www.lighthouse.cc/eagleisland ) Along with pursuing porpoise and seal for their own f ood and oil needs, in the latter 1800s Wabanakis commonly took white residents on hunting outings or shot significant numbers of the animals to obtain oil and pelts for sale - as indicated in these historical excerpts: [Advertisement] Louis Mitchell [b 1847], of the Passamaquoddy tribe of Indians, will have during the seaso n, at the shore between Suminsby's and Steamboat wharf, Bar Harbor, a number of Birch-Bark Canoes, in which he will take parties to the several Isla nds in the bay and around Mount Desert island. Carrying sporting parties to pl aces where porpoise and seal may be shot. Guns and ammunition furnished when desired. Reliable and experienced paddlers will be provided. Lewis Mitchell recently paddled his canoe entirely around the island of Mt.

He got my father to take him out to Cranberry Island to shoot seal.102 While Wabanaki porpoise and seal hunti ng in the Mount Desert Island area diminished in the course of the 20th century, clamming continued. Among various recorded recollections of th e practice is that of Penobscot Frank Loring's granddaughter Hattie Loring Gordius (b.1892). Hattie lived in Bass Harbor and worked in Underwood's Cannery there beginning in 1907. Widowed after giving birth to nine children, she relied on nature's storehouse to help feed her br ood. \"If you have nine children, you have to do something,\" she said, so she put food on the table by tapping into \"fish in the ocean, clam on the shore, and potato in the field.\" 103 Passamaquoddy Susan Snow Holmes (b.1919) has similar memories. The daughter of we ll-known basketmakers Alice Sockabasin Francis and John Snow, she grew up in Northeast Harbor and well remembers how her family's diet included lots of seafood - and wild plants. In her words: We lived on seafood quite a bit. Us children...used to go over at the steamboat wharf, sit there and go fishin '. We had this old fishing line - we never had the warden [catch us] - and we used to get cod and haddock. We had a lot of haddock for our meals. We had every kind of fish. [Mother] would fry it or make fish chowder.... My father used to go clamming right down there where the steamboat wharf was when the tide was out. It was for our use. . . . I used to pick strawberries , raspberries, blueberries, blackberries, so my mother could make pies [for us.] They were all right near us, just a little ways up town...a little ways up the hill from where we lived.... [And] I used to pick a lot of dandelion greens. My mother used to boil 'em [with] salt pork. In those days Native Ameri cans practically lived on salt pork. 104 Numerous other recollections of food colle ction in the Mount Desert Island area in the 20th century can be found among contemporary Wabanakis. For example, Penobscot John Bear Mitchell recalled his grandfather Ted Mitchell telling him that when he was a boy in the 1920s he left the reservation with his father to \"go down to MDI and spend a couple of days just eating clams and mussels.\" That tradition continues in the Mitchell's extended family today; at least once a year they all drive to MDI for a picnic of (purchased) seafood at Seawall.105 According to Ted, whose grandparents and great- grandparents clammed in the area in the 19th century, the annual fam ily trip to MDI is Mitchell is likely John B. Mitchell (b.1851), listed on In dian Island's 1880 Federal census with wife Maria Newell (b.1858) and child, Martha (b.1878). On the 1900 census John B. Mitchell appears with 4 additional children: Elizabeth (b.1889), Theodore (b.1890), Clara (b.1892) and Sabattis (b.1897). By this time he had remarried a young woman named Mary (b.1873). 102 Ralph Stanley, interview by McBride, Jan. 2004.

Lizzie and her Mi'kmaq husband Noel Phillips (1914-1959) harvested clams for personal use and to sell from 1944-1954, when they lived in Ashville (near West Gouldsboro, just east of MDI, above Schoodic Point). As she recalled, \"During summer months we made baskets, raked berri es and dug clams. Our camp was next to the water. . . . We did a lot of clam digging when we lived ther e. You can dig clams all year down there, but I did it mostly in the summer.\"107 Mi'kmaqs Mary Lafford Sanipass (1935-) and her husband Donald Sanipass (1928-2000) remember clamming nearby in Sullivan in the early 1950s and meeting up with the Phillips family. In Donald's words: We could get 10-12 bushels in low tid e in one-and-a-half hours. Sometimes you'd get two tides a day. . . . I also cut pulp [wood] in Gouldsboro. Noel [Phillips] and his brother and sons were also there working in the woods. And they dug clams there. They were just a step away from us. You could see Bar Harbor from there. We'd go sight seeing at Bar Harbor and Schoodic.108 Mi'kmaqs Sarah & Abe Harquail (center) clamming with family members, c1948.

(McBride/Prins Collection) Today, restrictions abound in Maine when it comes to hunting, fishing and gathering - ranging from strict prohibition in protected park lands to laws designating what species can be pursued during which ti me of year in which areas. That said, Wabanakis now have both tribal and privat e land parcels - a tiny fraction of their aboriginal range - where they set their own hunting and fishing codes. 106 Ted Mitchell, interview by McBride, June 2004. 107 Personal communication, 1982. 108 Personal communication, 1982 and summer 2002.

They also used parts of several animal species in their treatments. A vast majority of these flora and fauna are found within and around Acadia Nati onal Park. Here, we o ffer an historical overview of traditional Wabanaki medicinal practices, ending with a commentary about such activities on and near M ount Desert Island. In chapters 17 and 18, annotated and illustrated inventories of specific species f ound in our research area provide additional information concerning their nomenclature, desc ription, habitat, use and related legends. TRADITIONAL WABANAKI APPROA CHES TO TREATING ILLNESS Early European observers of Wabanaki peopl es made particular note of their relative health and the absence among them of many illnesses th at were common in Europe (where higher human population densities and close associati on with domesticated animals facilitated the multiplication and spread of diseases). However, Wabanakis were not without suffering. Common ailments amo ng them included rheumatism, arthritis, 1 In Lacey 1977, p.v. Chapter 16: Medicinal Uses of Plants & Animals 436digestive disorders and intestinal worms, along with skin and eye irritations and accidental problems such as burns, cuts, wounds , bruises and broken bones. Illnesses that had a clear physical cause warranted treatment in the form of herbal medicines, prepared and administered by both women and men. Illn esses without an appa rent physical cause were viewed as supernatural - brought on by sorcerers, spirits of the dead or other unearthly forces. Considered more serious, they called for shamanic intervention, which usually included herbal treatm ent along with shamanic actions (described below). Almost invariably, shamans were men.2 In addition to various cures for exis ting ailments, Wabanakis also practiced preventive medicine - dancing to maintain health, carrying charms and amulets thought to protect them from accidents and illness, and taking long sweats to purify the body as well as to treat some specific problems. Am ong several accounts of tr aditional sweats is one by French trader Nicholas Denys, describing what he observed among Mi'kmaqs in the first half of the 17th century. \"In old times,\" he wrote, \"their general remedy was to make themselves sweat, something which they did every month and even oftener.\" For this, he explained, they constructed a small round bark wigw am \"entirely closed up with the exception of a little opening for entering, and the w hole was covered besides with their garments. Whilst this was being done, large rocks were gathered and placed in the fire, and made red-hot. After this those who wished to sweat placed themselves wholly naked in the wigwam, seated on their buttocks on the gro und.\" Then the heated rocks were brought inside along with a \"big dish full of water and another small dish for pouring the water upon the rocks, which were placed in the middle of the circle. This water which they poured upon the rocks made a steam which filled the cabin.\" With new hot rocks brought in as needed, people stayed in the sweat lodge \"as long as they could and they stuck to it an hour and a half or two hours. During this time they chanted songs, and told stories to make themselves laugh.\" Upon exiting, they jumped into the sea or a river, then came out of the water and donned their robes. 3 Shamanic Treatments Having the ability to manipulate unseen for ces made Wabanaki shamans invaluable in solving a range of problems - from illness to a shortage of game. Individuals recognized as having shamanic powers or motewolon (magic) gained that power in various ways: \"by inheritance through a long family line of shamans; in a dream; as a gift bestowed by another shaman; from a power spirit within a 'mystic herb' or plant; or through a 'power quest' which involved going and living by oneself in the forest and fasting until a spirit helper appeared and bestowed the seeker with shamanic powers. . . . Upon receiving power, Micmac shamans usually adopted an animal or some natural object as a benefactor and ally of physic ians in their work. . . . represented by fetishes, which the shaman kept hidden in a sack.\" 4 As noted by Nicholas Smith in his shor t article on Wabanaki herb medicines, non- exceptional problems - from cuts to burns a nd skin irritations - were treated with 2 Vogel, also LeClercq, pp.221-122. Chapter 16: Medicinal Uses of Plants & Animals 437 medicine plants. A shaman was not called fo r such problems unless infection set in, which was seen as a signal that \"bad spirits had entered the ailing one . . . . To retain his coveted position as a doctor, [a shaman] had to prove that there was something more to healing than an herb. This was a special some thing which he and only he was able to add through the preparation and presentation of the brew. If one medicine man's power couldn't cure, perhaps another's could. There were always the personal spirit-helpers backing up each wizard. In some cases when an important man or chief became ill, several shamans might be called to wo rk their magic at the same time.\"5 Several Europeans wrote early, first-ha nd descriptions of Wabanaki shamanic curing rituals, each mentioning common elements such as chanting, dancing, and sleight of hand. The following excerpt comes from a 17 th-century account by Jesuit priest Chrestien LeClercq: [The shaman] chants some song in praise of the Ouhaiche [spirit helper], and makes some postures and frightful cont ortions: he comes near to, and draws back from, the sick man; he blows severa l times upon the affected part; he plants and drives deep with in the ground a stic k, to which he at taches a cord, and through this he passes his head as if he would strangle himself. Here he makes his invocations until he has worked hims elf all into a sweat and lather, making believe that, because of all these shamef ul and violent contortions, the Devil has at length come out, and that he even hol ds him bound in order that he may grant health to the sick person. He then calls the Indians and makes them enter the wigwam; and he shows them the cord, which, says he, holds the Devil enchained. He cuts from it a piece, and t hus lets him escape, promising that the sick man will infallibly get well. 6 Herbal Treatments In contrast to shamans, Wabanaki physicians who treated ailments thought to be brought on by purely physical causes did so with medici ne prepared out of wild plants, sometimes used in compounds with animal parts. Frank Speck, like other chr oniclers of Wabanaki cultures through the centuries, noted \"the wi despread use of herbs as medicines apart from the practice of magic.\"7 A person who healed in this way was known as a \"maker of medicine\" or \"one who cures with 'medicines.' \" Over the years, va rious inventories have been made of the plant and animals species used by Wabanakis to make medicine. These catalogs are informative, but tend to be incomp lete - typically listing species as having medicinal value for treating a particular problem, but comm only excluding detailed information about which part of the plant was used or how it was prepared. Nonetheless, it is clear that since time immemorial Wabana kis have had what Speck referred to as \"an extensive pharmacopoeia\" drawn from nature's storehouse.8 The origin of these medicines is told in several versions of a Wabanaki legend about a strange child (usua lly a boy). In one account, the child wanders into a 5 Smith 1966, p.2. 6 LeClercq, pp.216-218. 7 Speck 1917, p.303. 8 Speck 1917, p.307. Chapter 16: Medicinal Uses of Plants & Animals 438Penobscot village and moves in with a wo man and her husband. In another, he metamorphoses from a rare medicinal root hi dden in his mother's bosom. Once the child is present, other children in the village begin to die. One af ter the other, they are found dead, with their tongues cut out (in some vers ions, it is the liver). Some people notice that the strange child wanders at night and return s to the wigwam to roast a small piece of meat on the fire. When they realize that the meat is the tongues (or livers) of the dead children, it becomes apparent that the strange child is the murderer. The villagers then try to do away with him, first by drowning, then by burning him to ashes. Both times, the child returns alive. In one version, he prom ises to stop the murders if recognized as a great chief. In another, women in the villag e step forward, offer th e child gifts and beg him to stop. Once an agreement is reached, th e child lies down for a rest, removing the bones from his body. While he rests, medi cine plants grow under his body. In Penobscot Joseph Nico lar's version of the story (included in his 1894 book, The Life and Traditions of the Red Man ), before resting the child announces: \"I want seven young maidens to attend me during my rest, each maiden shall attend me for one year . . . and at the end of seven years, all the seven maidens will come together and turn my body so I may lay on the other side of my body fo r another seven years. In turning my body in the first seven years, you shall find where my body laid, seven sprouts of plants star ting from the ground; let them grow seven moons, when the young maidens shall name what disease each plant shall cure; then they shall gather the seed from them and shall scatter it to the four winds . . . and the seed shall grow all over the land, and it will be the medicine for the sick\" 9 Joseph Nicolar, c1887 (Courtesy Charles Shay) The main character in Nicolar's telling of the story is referred to as \"Bone Handler.\" In other accounts, including one recorded by Fr ank Speck, he is called \"Turn Over.\" In Speck's rendition, when the ch ild is rolled over, \"various herbs are found beneath him, and any Indians who go to visit him . . . may obtain the gift of healing and the knowledge of the herbs by asking for them and rolling him over on his other side.\"10 Among Wabanakis, general knowledge con cerning medicinal plants was common, but women especially were long regarded as ef fective herbal healers. Telling an old story about how winter came to Wabanaki Country bringing certain ailments, Nicolar wrote: Many [were] made sick by undergoing the long exposure, but these were soon made comfortable by the mother s who took care [of] the medicinal 9 Nicolar, p.75. 10 Speck 1935, pp.79-81. See also See also Jack, p.193; Speck 1917, pp.307-308; Smith 1966. Chapter 16: Medicinal Uses of Plants & Animals 439plants that had been gathered by the ma idens previous to th e changing of the color of the plants [winter]. The gather ing of the medicinal plants and putting them in the care of the mothers made the people look upon them as the healers of the sick, who when called upon went to their work with willing hands. . . . Thus having conducted the me dical department so faithfully and well, the duty of dealing out medicine fell to the women, therefore there was no man doctor among them. This arrangement continued until the coming of the white man. To deal out medicine to the sick was looked upon as below the sphere of man; surgical profession was not known and the practice of surgery was not needed, because those who dealt out medicine were able to heal all kinds of diseases, bones and fl esh were healed alike. Men's minds were entirely absorbed in the art of spiritual works. A good hunter was also considered useful, more so when th e country became thickly populated. But the spiritual men were considered indi spensable beings. No matter how great a hunter man may be, he is bound to consult these men upon all occasions; therefore the services of them were c onstantly sought after and were always busy. 11 An intriguing entry in the 1910 Register of the Towns of Sedgwick, Brooklin, Deer Isle, Stonington and Isle Au Haut , suggests Wabanakis may have kept herb gardens for medicinal purposes: \"Not far from 'The Oakland House,' Herricks, now within the limits of Brooksville, though formerly a part of Sedg wick, may be seen still a few plants and herbs alien to the soil, marking the lo cation of an ancient Indian garden.\" 12 Other remnants found in the vicinity (shellmidde ns, stone artifacts) also establish Native presence there. IMPACT OF EUROPEAN CONTACT ON WABANAKI MEDICI NAL PRACTICES Before Europeans arrived on the shores of northeast America, Wabanakis used healing herbs to treat common ailments noted above, including sprains, burns, frostbite, broken bones, skin and eye irritations, as well as respiratory problems and stomach ailments. While there is no doubt that herbal treatment s changed over the generations, particularly after contact, which introduced new forms of illness as well as imported medicinal plants, clearly certain herbal treatments were used before, during and after contact. Among early-mentioned medicinal plants still in use today are two that are basic to Wabanaki curing traditions and present in Acadian National Park: balsam fir a nd sweet flag. In the 17 th century, Denys described balsam fir gum as the Mi'kmaqs \"greatest remedy\" for wounds.13 In the same century French colonist and author Marc Lescarbot mentioned the medicinal value of Calamus odoratus - surely referring to sweet flag ( Acorus calamus), a Wabanaki panacea used for general hea lth and to treat a host of problems. Confidence in the far-reaching effectiveness of sweet flag even carried over to the treatment of illnesses brought from abroad, as evident in this story recorded by Speck: 11 Nicolar, pp79-80. 12 Chatto & Haviland. 13 Denys, p449. Chapter 16: Medicinal Uses of Plants & Animals 440 Long ago all the people were dying off with a kind of cholera.... All medicines failed. One night during these times a man had a dream. He dreamt that a person came to him and said, 'All the people are dying and nobody can cure them. But I will show you a cure. I am Muskwessuwesk, Muskrat Root, and when you take me and steep me in water for medicine, you and everyone who drinks me will be cured. Now come with me and I will show you where I am to be found.' So he took the man to a swamp and showed him the root; then disappeared. When the dreamer awoke he went to the place he had visited in his dream. As he knew just where to go he found the root, took it back and made medicine. The people took it and were cured.14 During the contact era, Wabanaki faith in shamanism suffered due to missionizing and the failure of shamans to cure the myst erious diseases brought on by alien pathogens carried across the ocean from Europe. In th e wake of the \"great dying\" of the 1600s, which claimed the lives of 75-90% of their people, Wabanakis gradually came to rely more extensively on the expert herbalists among them when it came to treating long- familiar ailments, as well as the new infectious diseases, which included cholera, diphtheria, measles, scarlet fever, smallpox, typhoid, syphilis MEDICINAL TREATMEN TS: CONTENT & PREPARATION Plant-based Treatments By the time Speck wrote his 1917 article on Native medicinal practices, traditional Wabanaki pharmacopoeia had expanded and al so included an array of non-Native plants (such as barberry, dandelion, lamb's quarters, yarrow and tansy) carried across the ocean by the newcomers and gradually naturalized in and beyond Maine. Barberry Dandelion Lamb's Quarters Yarrow Tansy In addition to sweet flag, plants having a wide range of medicinal applications among Wabanakis include(d) boneset, goldthre ad, pipsissewa, purple pitcher plant, sheep 14 Speck 1935, p..95. See also Smith 1966.

Boneset Goldthread Pipsissewa Purple Pitcher Sheep Laurel Some plants were used green, while others were dried. Typically, medicine makers kept a supply of dried plants, roots, leav es and bark on hand. The plant material was prepared in various ways. Some species, such as sweet flag root, could be dried and chewed. Others required more extensive prepar ation to be turned into various medicinal forms: decoctions (liquid made of plant ma terial boiled in water), infusions (tea made of plant material steeped in boiled water), tinctures (alcoholic solutions containing low concentrations of the active prin ciples of herbs and plants), poultices (compresses made of plant material prepared in various ways), salves (balms/liniments made of plant material boiled with oil/fat/ointment of some kind), and powders (dried plants or roots reduced to powder with mortar and pes tle). Abenaki Fred Wiseman summarized preparation as follows in his book Voice of the Dawn: The customary practice to prepare plants is to handpick and clean or rinse the leaves, twigs, bark to rem ove any extraneous plant part s, insects, dirt, etc. The plant material is usually added to a specific amount of water and boiled or steeped in hot water. The theory is that the power in the plant is liberated and transferred to the hot water. The herbal tea can be drunk or applied to the offending element. Another technique is to mash or shred the plant material, perhaps mix it with a little water or sap, and apply it as a poultice to the affected area, where the spirit will pass directly from the plant to the body. Occasionally the plant is chewed, releasing more of the power directly. The Penobscot people use another technique: sweet flag is steamed through the house to keep away disease. . . . External medicinal plant treatments usually consist of poultices of crushed leaves, or saps applied directly to the affected area. However, an infusion is sometimes used, as in the cas e of common juniper needles, which are steeped to make an antiseptic. 15 Animal-based Treatments Overall, fauna played a relatively modest role in Wabanaki medicinal practices compared to flora. That said, Wabanakis commonly used animal fat/oil as a lubricant and as a 15 Wiseman, pp201-203. Chapter 16: Medicinal Uses of Plants & Animals 442 healing balm for such problems as rheumatism or chest colds. Often, liniments were a fat and plant(s) mixture. For example, Old To wn pharmacist Horace Burham wrote in 1916 that Wabanakis made an ointment of fir bals am and animal fat. Other than salves, the most widely used animal-based cures featured beaver parts and eel skins. Burnham noted the use of beaver castor, mentioning that an Indian woman told him it was given \"mostly to young women from fifteen to eighteen years of age [as] an emmenagogue.\"16 According to Speck17: \"Beaver castor (testicles) is a panacea for all kinds of female troubles. For such use it is steeped and often mixed with brandy. In cases of measles, the Indians used to fix a half-dried castor on the end of a needle and stick it up each nostril to relieve the congestion and infla mmation. Merely to carry beaver castor about w ith one is beneficial, they think. . . . Others put a little scraped castor into nearly every medicine brew to add to its efficacy.\" Beaver gall bladder also figured in the Waba naki pharmacy - its contents imbibed to treat \"stones,\" according to a Mi'kmaq informant. 18 And the gall bladder content of any animal was used as a massage lubricant for rheumatism.19 As for eelskins, Wabanakis wrapped them around troubled parts of the body to cure (or prevent) cramps, rheumatism and headaches. In Speck's estimation, the skins may have served largely in the way of amulets - providing the sort of psychological relief that sometimes translated into physical relief. Writing about Mi'kmaqs, Speck also noted that the \"lixivium from the ashes of deers' bones is drunk as an astringe nt. The yolk of eggs and turpentine, equal parts, or vary the proportion with the nature of the sore, applied as a salve, is said to have effected cures in desperate cases of ulcers.\" 20 Among a handful of other fauna-based treatments: rubbing skunk greas e on the scalp was thought to stimulate hair growth; imbibing grease extracted from moose leg bones through boiling was considered good for the chest; and applying goose fat to the ches t and/or throat was believed to relieve the common cold. 21 Compound Treatments Often, Wabanaki treatments cons isted of more than one speci es. Of special note are those comprised of seven herbs. The significance of this number has been noted by various writers of Wabanaki culture, including Joseph Nicolar in his telli ng of the origin of medicine. In this story, \"Bone Handler\" refers to seven as the \"true number,\" and the figure appears repeatedly in the story. For instance: \"The young maidens went through the task of turning the body of No-chi-gar-neh [\"Bone Handler\"], and in doing so did see the seven plants coming through the ground in the place where th e boy's body had been laying which they left to grow. And when the seven moons have passed and after 16 Burnham, p.70. 17 Speck 1917, p.312. 18 Lacey, p.56. 19 57; Van Wart, p.574. Chapter 16: Medicinal Uses of Plants & Animals 443gathering the seed and having named each plant and what disease they will cure, did cast the seed in the four winds, which en ded the work of the seven maidens.\"22 Among the seven-species compound medicines is one that, according to Speck, was used by Penobscots to treat gonorrhea, as well as for kidney trouble \"spitting up blood.\" It consisted of a boneset. a \"concoction of seven herbs . . . taken [sweat inducement] before entering the [sweat lodge].\" However, he follows this statement with a list of eight species rather than seven: kind of brake\" (all present in Acadia Nationa l Park). This error may be explainable by Speck's comment that \"the components were f ound to vary a little\" - perhaps he inserted one of the variables in the primary list by mistake. Whatever the explanation for the miscount, Speck elaborated that af ter drinking the compound sudorific, The patient seats himself, usually i ndoors (in former times in a specially constructed bark hut), over a vessel of water into whic h heated stones have been dropped by an assistant, and a blanket is put over him, reachi ng to the floor all round. With the draft in his stomach and the heat confined under the blanket, a profuse sweat is soon induced; after a shor t period the patient goes to be in his blankets and sleeps. This they do to break up fever.23 NOTABLE WABANAKI HERBAL DOCTORS Knowledge concerning plants remained common among Wabanaki peoples into the 20th century. Speck, writing in the early 1900s, co mmented that \"an almost unexhaustible [sic] fund of knowledge exists on the subj ect\" in the Native community. Beyond the mundane use of basic traditional medicine in most Wabanaki households, by the mid- 1800s, a significant number of Wabanaki women, as well as men, had come to the fore as professional herbal practitione rs. Wabanakis and Euramerican settlers alike turned to them in times of illness. Perhaps the best known forerunner of thes e individuals in the historical memory of today's Mainers is Molly Ockett (c1740-1818). She is often referred to as \"the last of the Pigwackets,\" a Waba naki group traditionally based along the Saco River. Numerous signposts of her presence ar e scattered about the state in the form of places carrying her name: Molly Ockett's Cave, Molly Ockett Mountain, Molley Ockett Trail, Moll's Rock, Mollywocket Brooke. Bu t many others whose names and lives have disappeared in the minds of contemporary Mainers were well known in their day, as revealed in various 19th-century publications. For exam ple, Reverend Elijah Kellogg, who lived with the Passamaquoddy at Pleasant Point as a Protestant missionary in the 1820s, noted in his journal that the Governor's Joseph Neptune Franci s' \"eldest daughter, a doctress, speaks good English.\"24 An 1833 Maine newspaper article offered more information about another healer - \"Mary, an Indian Doctress of the Penobscot Tribe.\" The following excerpt is relevant for this particular study: 22 Nicolar, p.80. See also Rand, pp.211, 424. 23 Speck 1917, p.311. 24 22 Sept. 1821. Chapter 16: Medicinal Uses of Plants & Animals 444 [This] is a representation of the everyday dress of a female Penobscot. It is well known that a remnant of that once powerful tribe of Indians still occupy the island in the Penobscot river. Their principal residence is the ancient village, now called Old Town, from whence they annually set forth, in summer, to the ocean. . . . Mary, whose portrai t is very correctly given, was a grave Doctress well skilled in roots, herbs and HUMAN NATURE. In their medical practice they of course have no great [discrim ination?] of dis-eases, but they seldom do harm, and oftentimes much good. Compelled by necessity to resort to the vegetable kingdom for their supplies of medicine, they have ascertained the properties of many vege-tables before unknown, and which might be advantageous ly used by Doctors of a higher grade. Faith, however, is a valuable auxi liary to them, and they well know the reliance which many have on 'Indian doctors and Indian specialties' and make use of it accordingly. 25 Although Wabanaki healers such as the pi pe-smoking \"Mary\" pi ctured above were typically self-appointed , certain individuals were view ed as \"gifted.\" For instance, tradition held that a seventh son or da ughter possessed special healing power and knowledge of medicines. Also, although genera l knowledge about herbal treatments was common, such individuals were recognized as having uniquely powerfu l healing abilities, which often included secret cu res that were self devised, purchased or handed down to them. The very secrecy of these cures wa s thought to strengthen their potency. 26 One Wabanaki thought to possess such power was Philomene Saulis Nelson (1888-1977), mother of the famous Penobscot dancer known as Molly Spotted Elk (who performed in Bar Harbor at the Abbe Muse um in August 1935 after garnering fame in New York and Paris). Philomene was the seve nth daughter of a seve nth daughter, and her healing gift became apparent early in life. When she was just a child, her mother frequently pulled her from play to take her to someone's sickbed. Philomene used psychic insights and the laying on of hands in her healings, and gradually took up collecting wild herbs and preparing various conc octions to heal a range of ailments from stiff joints and headaches to gall st ones.\" Her youngest daught er Eunice (1915-2004) recalled going out with Philomene to gather flag root and balsam blisters. And her eldest daughter Molly, who kept diar ies during much of her life, sometimes mentioned her mother's healing activities on those pages\u2014such as succe ssfully treating one of her children for peptitus, another for a severe burn, and yet another for tuberculosis. Philomene continued using traditional methods with her grandchildren, as noted by Molly in a diary entry about her ow n daughter's bout with whoo ping cough and influenza in 1934: \"Mama resorted to Indian medicine.... applied onions and pork on Gee-gis' chest and head.\" 27 25 Maine Farmer , July 1833, vol.1:24, n.22, pp.20-21, 25, 219. Chapter 16: Medicinal Uses of Plants & Animals 445 Well before Philomene Nelson's birth, Indi an agent records showed that many Wabanaki \"doctors\" were using mainstream medicines acquired thr ough the agents or directly from doctors. For example, Penobsco t agent Hayford's 1848 re cords include lists of payments made to various white doctors covering a range of medicinal aids for members of the tribe: especi ally sweet oil, camphor, liniment, salts & senna, and various alcohols - brandy, gin, wine. Also noted were plasters, Richardson's Bitters, and nondescript items such as \"pills \" and \"bot. of medicine.\" Indian doctors also appear on agent books as being paid for trea ting fellow tribal members. For instance, Agent Hayford's 1847 records show that he requested and received authorization to provide small pox vaccinations for tribal members - and hired a Penobscot doctor for the task. Six months later Penobscot Govern or Joseph Attean submitted a $25 bill for \"the vaccination of 100 persons, men, women and children at .25,\" noting, \"This is to certify that Doctor Newel has done our vaccination to our entire satisfaction and that the above account is corr ect and it is our request that the Indian Agent pay the above bill.\" Similarly, Pa ssamaquoddy Indian Agent Nutt' 1859 report mentioned the need for a special \"appropr iation\" of funds to pay Passamaquoddy \"Doct Joseph Lolar Selmor\" for his \"kind and careful treatment\" of 17 tribal members inflicted with small pox. Furthermore, in the 1860s an d '70s, the receipts of the Penobscot Agent Dillingham include many signed by Penobscot men and women identified as doctors and paid for giving \"medical attendance on Penobscot Indians.\" These Native Sarah Tomer. Some of these individuals, as well as various others, including Sockalexis by their names on tribal censuses. Other Penobscot doctors of the day are identifiable by surviving copies of their calling cards, placards, or newspaper ads. Among them were Joseph Newell and John Porus (a.k.a. Polis, b.1830), whose calling card is pictured right (authors' collection). At times, Porus associated with the Newell family (described below) as they traveled around Maine and other New England states in the 1850s, setting up camp on the edge of towns to practice medicine, sell crafts and offer \"entertainments.\" He became less mobile after losing his leg in the Civil War. Passamaquoddy agent reports include similar information, although the number of Native doc tors mentioned is notably smaller than among Penobscots. Am ong several illustrations, is this excerpt from the Passamaquoddy agent's 189 2 annual report to the State of Maine: I have continued through sub-agent Gove the service of Dr. Rodgers at Pleasant Point and at the same salary, $150 per year . . . . We have also paid one Indian doctor, Sabattis Joseph, whom many of the Indians have confidence in, five dollars per month for his services, and believe the results have been good. 28 Also spelled Attien or Atien and Lola or Loler, he was married to Sarah Polasses, daughter of the famous pair, Molly \"Molasses\" Nicola and Lt. Gov. John Neptune. 29 Also appears on tribal censuses as Pielis and Peter. Brother of Joseph Nicolar. Chapter 16: Medicinal Uses of Plants & Animals 446WABANAKI HERBAL DOCTORS IN THE MOUNT DESERT AREA Although historical record s are thin concerning Indian docto rs in the Mount Desert Island area, several specific names have been lo cated. Earliest among th em is Joseph Cook, mentioned in a September 1796 letter to the Hancock County Sheriff from one Thomas Phillips Clark: \"We command that you summon Joseph Cook of said Blue Hill, Indian man & physician . . . to appear before the Court . . . at Castine\" to give evidence on the trial of William Fletcher, William Fletcher jr., and James Fletcher.\"30 As discussed in an earlier chapter, in all lik elihood, Cook was an Ir oquois who married into one of several Penobscot families living (seas onally) on the margins of the Blue Hill community. His medicinal skills were noted by the town's first resident pastor, Jonathan Fisher, who moved there in 1795. Rev. Fisher was interested in herbal medicine and sometimes treated locals himself. \"'Dr. C ook,'\" he wrote, was \"'very skilful as a physician'\" who \"could write and 'cipher a litt le,'\" and \"concocted efficacious remedies from cedar twigs for sores and bruises.\"31 East of Blue Hill, according to des cendents of Abraham Somes, founder of Somesville on Mount Desert Island, the villa ge's first white doctor, Kendall Kittredge, arrived there in 1799 and learned many of hi s medicinal \"formulas and mixtures\" from \"the Indians.\" His great grands on relayed that Dr. Kittredge was convinced that some of the Indian panaceas were more effective than treatments he learned in medical school.32 Abraham Somes' grand-daughter, Adelma (\"Dell\") Somes Joy, recounted fond memories of Indians encamped on her family's property alongside Lily Pond (now Somes Pond). Born in 1837, she had childhood r ecollections reaching back to the 1840s: \"Indians used to come and camp around the ponds for the purpose of trapping mink and muskrat. They made baskets too, and did beau tiful work. . . . The camps were made of spruce boughs and the women told fortunes.\" In particular she noted \"Mary Ann the fortune teller,\" who may well have also pract iced herbal medicine since fortune-telling was often done in tandem with herbal ism among Wabanaki women involved in traditional healing arts at the time. She also mentioned a Penobscot woman named \"Mrs. Glassene\" [Glossian] and her son Newell w ho were connected to the Somes family during Adelma's growing up years. Apparently this mother and son were more than summer visitors to the area, for the boy and Adelma attended the same little red school. Adelma noted skills that her grandfather, John Somes, learned from Indians - including how to make woodsplint baskets and scoop nets for fishing. According to another descendent of Abraham Somes, th e Indians encamped by the pond were both friends and teachers [and] it is reasonable to suppose that [the Somes family] gained some knowledge of [medicinal plants from] them. The Indian woman who lived in the Abraham Somes household, presumably to work there and help in the care of the children must have taught Hannah Somes something of Indian remedies. Did Hannah learn that elderberry leaves, cleaned, dried, and made into a tea with wild peppermint l eaves would help in cases of baby colic; that an ointment made from the leaves of the elderberry was good for sprains 30 MSA, Hancock County Court of Sessions, Box 2, folder 58. 31 In Chase, M.E. pp.56-57. 32 Somes-Sanderson, p.69. S ee also Pugh et al, p.42. Chapter 16: Medicinal Uses of Plants & Animals 447 and bruises; that the dried inner bark was a purgative; that an infusion of the fine dried leaves of the wild strawberry wa s of special use for diarrhea in children?33 Adelma Somes Joy's reminiscences of Somesville also include mention of a winter -time Indian \"exhibition\" presented in the local woolen mill circa 1855. In her words, it featured the \"Indian chief fr om Old Town and fifteen or twenty members of the Tribe. . . . dressed like real savages, fringes, beads, feathers and painted faces, arms and legs. The war dance was awe-inspiring a nd crowds from everywhere came to see the show.\" In all likelihood, the event was organized by Penobscot Frank \"Big Thunder\" Loring (pictured left, c1900/authors' collection). Loring became one of the most familiar Wabanakis on and around Mount Desert Island - known as a provider of \"Indian entertainments,\" as well as hunting guide services, canoe lessons in Bar Harbor, and medicinal treatmen ts wherever he happened to be. According to historical notes collected by Joy's niece, Barbara Ellen Joy: Professional doctoring was hard to co me by, so the mothers had their own remedies. At one time they had help from an Indian, Big Thunder, who had a camp [on Mount Desert Island]. For a sore throat, he would put pepper in a pipe and blow it down over the tonsils. Tans y worn in a bag around the neck was a good preventative for worms. The childre n gathered and dried pennyroyal, good for many troubles. Baked onions in a bag on the chest were used for pneumonia. Skull cap was used for medicinal tea. 34 Two generations later, Big Thunder's grand-da ughter Hattie Gordius, who lived her long lifetime on Mount Desert Island, told a journalist that her father gargled with goldenseal for a sore throat. In the same interview she t outed the virtues of tansy with an enthusiasm that echoed that of Big Thunder: \"Dry tansy w ill 'drive out the measles' she said. 'I wish someone would use my tansy; I've got a whole field of it.'\" 35 Something else significant in the story of the c 1855 performance organized by Big Thunder is the mention of a \"handsome young man\" who \"could play the violin with considerable skill\" and stole the heart of a wh ite girl. Various accounts of this incident identify the young man as Johnny Newell, son (or nephew) of the well-known Penobscot doctor, Joseph Newell. Several members of the Newell family were doctors at the time, and others were known as fine fiddlers. They went town to town, practicing medicine, hawking baskets, and giving musical perfor mances. Johnny Newell's love interest was identified in the Palmer [Mass.] Journal as the \"daughter of a w ealthy merchant living in Harrison square\" and belonging to the \"upper ten.\" It seems that Johnny encountered her when encamped in East Boston as well as when on Mount Desert Island. A relationship between the two was clearly unacceptable to her father. It was also against Maine's 33 Somes-Sanderson, pp.69-70. 34 Joy, vol. 3, p.63 35 Cartwright. 1982. \"'When the Lord's ready for me, I'll go' Penobscot woman packed sardines 75 years,'\" Wabanaki Alliance, July. Chapter 16: Medicinal Uses of Plants & Animals 448miscegenation laws at the time, which forbade marriages between Indians and whites. It was the stuff of gossip and ballads, and in fact gave birth to the ballad, \"The Indian Elopement.\" Several versions were collected by Fannie Hardy Eckstorm, including one from Mrs. Rose Robbins of Northeast Harbor. 36 While the story of these star-crossed lovers is fascinating for numerous reasons, wh at is significant for this discussion of Wabanaki medicinal practices is the fact th at the story points to the likelihood that the Newells practiced their medicinal, mu sical and basketry arts on MDI. Often, upon coming to a new location, Indi an doctors and entertainers posted placards or newspaper ads announcing their a rrival and services and programs. Although these historical placards (such as those pict ured center and right be low) are exceedingly rare, the Acadia National Park Archives has one that Big Thunder had printed to announce his 1884 performance in Bar Harbor (see Chapter 9). A local placard or newspaper ad by one of the Newell doctors ha s yet to surface for the MDI area - but the newspaper ad pictured and transcribed below appeared in The Union and Eastern Journal of Biddeford in Joseph Newe ll, the NATIVE INDIAN DOCTOR most respectfully offers his services in the Orig inal Indian Healing Art, to the sick and afflicted in this vicinity. Dr. Newell may be consulted at the Indian Encampment in this place, where he will remain for a short time and furnish those in want of Medicine enough to cure them. Dr. N's he aling skill is orig inal, having come down many generations. Should Physicians speak evil of the Doctor's practice, pay no attention to what they say, for in so doing they speak evil of what they do not understand. What does the white man know of the original Indian practice as it existed 400 years ago, and as it no w exists! They know but little. . . . The center placard pictured here may have a link to Mount Desert Island. It announces an \"Indian Exhibition\" featuri Indians,\" 36 Eckstorm, 1960. 37 Image courtesy of Maine Antique Digest, where it appeared Dec. 1989, p.23A. 38 Special Collections, F ogler Library, UMO. Chapter 16: Medicinal Uses of Plants & Animals 449 presenting dances and \"many Indian relics,\" including moosehide canoes, watertight A ppearing with them was \"Dr. Peales, the celebrated Indian doctor of the Penobscot Tribe, \" rendering \"his services in the Original INDIAN HEALING ART.\" Anyone who has read Adelma Somes Joy's memoir cannot help but wonder if Newell Glassi on, the lead player in this 1851 performance, was related to \"Mrs. Glassene,\" who, with her son Newe ll, associated with the Somes family. The man identified as Dr. Peales is likely Peal Nicola (b1812), identified as \"Dr.\" on the 1868 Penobscot census (and in some records referred to as Pielis or Peter Nicola39). This placard, like others, has a blank space in whic h the location and date of the event were written by hand. The place noted on this particul ar copy of the placard is difficult to read (perhaps Waltham, Mass.), but no doubt other copies of the poster were inscribed with towns in Maine. Turning from placards to anthropologi sts, one especially interesting account of Wabanaki doctors on Mount Desert Island comes from the well-known folklorist, Charles Godfrey Leland (see profil e of Leland in Chapter 10). In the early 1880s, Leland went to Bar Harbor to gather Wabanaki legends among Penobscots and Passamaquoddies. Like many others, he was aware that they spent summers on MDI making and selling crafts. He wrote the following about an unnamed Indian doctress he encountered there who had motewolon (magic or spirit power): Women are sometimes m'teolulin. There is one at Psesuk (Bar Harbor) now, this summer. You have met her. She is _____'s wife.40 If you offend her she can hurt you in strange ways. She is a good doctor. Once she cured a man. When he got well he could not pay her for the medicine. His name is Louis____. She asked for her money . . . many times; she could not get it. He was going to the woods, far away, to trap; he said he would pay her when he returned, but she wanted it then. She said, 'I will never forget this; I will be revenged.' He went far up the St. John River with his traps; he set them in the stream for beaver. All he caught that wi nter was sticks, and sometimes an eel. Then at the end of the day he would say to his man, 'It is of no use.' And then they could hear the witc h laughing behind the bushes, and tittering when he came home. So it went on long. Then he was sorry, and said, 'I wish I had paid that woman what I owed her.' A nd at once they heard a voice from the bushes, or rocks, say, 'Louis, that will do. It is enough.' And the next day they caught two beaver, and every da y two, and so on, till the season was over. This happened in 1872, in the Miramichi Waters. 41 It should be mentioned that summers on Mount Desert Island were not always healthy for Wabanakis in the latter half of the 19th century when they lived in restricted and crowded encampments with poor sanita tion. Reports of illness were common. For example, in his 1892 report for the state, the Penobscot Indian Agent noted that the tribal 39 See entry 295 of the 1971 Penobscot census, which lists him as Dr. Peter Nicola, age 59. 40 The two name deletions in this excerpt are Leland's. 41 Leland 1884, pp.342-43. Chapter 16: Medicinal Uses of Plants & Animals 450community had suffered from measles brough t back from Bar Harbor. The disease, combined with a winter flu epidemic (referr ed to as the \"grippe\" in those days), had claimed the lives of 10 members of the community. Among the most respected Indian doctors of the period was Sabattis Mitchell, trained in conventional medical methods of the day in addition to traditional Penobscot herbal practices. He also spent time on Mount De sert Island, and one of his visits earned this mention in the Mount Desert Herald in September 1886: \"Dr. Mitchell, the only Indian college graduate in New England is stopping for a few days at the Indian encampment. Dr. Mitchell graduated from th e Portland medical school two years ago, and has practiced in Po rtland since that time.\"42 Horace Burnham, an Old Town pharmacist who often supplied Indian doctors with mainstream medicines that they used in conjunction with trad itional ones, wrote a paper on the pharmacy of the Native healers he had come to know in the course of 40 years of association with Penobscot doctors such as Mitchell. Read before the Maine Pharmaceutical Association in 1916 (and published two years later in Sprague's Journal of Maine History ), Burnham's paper offers a useful overview that places in historical context Wabanaki medicine as practiced between 1875-1916: In the case of the Indian, the Physician and Pharmacist are one, as prescribing and preparing medicine are done by th e medicine man or woman. The Indian believes that certain [individuals] are endowed by nature with qualities not possessed by all which enable them to diagnose and treat disease with greater success than their fellows. There is a trad ition that in early days before the coming of the white man it was necessary for the would-be medicine man to undergo some trying ordeal to prove his fitness for the office. . . . They had infusions, decoctions, poultices, ointment s and plasters. Oils and fats were also used as liniments. Boiling was done in dishes of birch bark placed on coals, hot ashes, or stones heated by fire beneath or heated stones were dropped into the liquid. In the case of infusions and decoctions, the drugs were steeped singly or in combinati on. . . . Today both male and female attend and prepare medicine for the si ck, but the campfire has given way to the cook stove and the bark dish to those of earthen and metal. . . . Although at the present time the treatment of dis ease among the Indians is largely in the hands of regular practitioners and medi cines of the white man are generally used, there are those of the tribe w ho prefer and employ the native doctors and their old time remedies. General awareness of basic traditional me dicinal practices remained quite common among Wabanakis into the 1930s when Penobs cot Roland Nelson (b.1895) put together a written list of some 120 medicinal plants used by Indians in Maine. Among other places, 42MDH , 9/10/1886, p.3; also in The Daily Herald 9/3/86, [Note: This is not Sabbatis Mitchell, born in 1824 and identified as \"Dr\" in the 1868 Penobscot census. Rather it is Passamaquoddy Joseph Mitchell, profiled a year earlier as follows: \"A Pleasant Point In dian, named Joseph Mitchell, is practicing medicine in Portland, Maine. He graduated r ecently from the Lewiston Eclectic Medical College. This is the first instance of a member of the Passamaquoddy Tribe entering one of the learned professions\" ( Eastport Sentinel 2/19/1885. In Soctomah 2005). Chapter 16: Medicinal Uses of Plants & Animals 451 Nelson worked as the \"resident Indian\" at Pinewood Camps, a swanky resort on Anasagunticook Lake in Canton, Maine. Known as Needahbeh (friend), he had - and used - numerous showman skills. Like many the Wabanaki who frequented MDI, he guided fishing and hunting parties, sold vari ous crafts and demonstrated how to make them. In addition, he could be coaxed to dance and sing fo r a fee. His lengthy medicine list suggests that he also practiced and taught traditional medicine. But intricate knowledge of the full range of age-old reme dies was fading, and before long only a handful of individuals had what one might call significant know-how in the art of traditional healing. Among those who stayed well-versed on the subject was Passamaquoddy Fred Tomah, who traveled to Bar Harbor in the summer of 1979 specifically to share his knowledge about tr aditional healing methods. His trip was chronicled by the Wabanaki Alliance: Fred says he is excited a bout an invitation to display his knowledge [about the art of Indian medicine] at a Bar Harbor fair this m onth. 'Did you know flagroot cures coughs, colds, the flue and blood poisoning? Rockbrake, a moss, is good for kidney trouble.... Lady slipper plants can stop convulsions.... Did you know that balsam fir pitch speeds healing of wounds? A pine pitch plaster well-cooked, can mend a broken bone when applied for a period of time. I've had a broken rib a number of times and sore back. The pine pitch works,' Fred says. Fred boasts that Sonja Dana, a Passamaquoddy Nurse asked him to cure a sore throat. 'Use the roots of golden th read,' he said.... 'Everyone knows about arthritis, but what to do? Boil cedar boughs a minute or two, then you let it steep. You strain it and drink it three or four times a day. You've got nothing to lose but your arthritis,' Fred says, adding, 'I've been taking it right along.' 43 Wabanaki herbal traditions c ontinue today, with most trib al members still aware of a few basic remedies (such as flagroot) and a ha ndful of individuals committed to retaining the wider knowledge of the age-old heali ng art. Among them is Passamaquoddy herbalist Fredda Paul at Pleasant Point. He be gan the effort as a boy, gaining foundational knowledge for his practice from his gra ndmother, Grace Lewey. In his words: As a child, I used to go out and pick dandelions and blossoms and took them to my grand-mother. I did it to show appreciation for the things she did for me. I didn't know until later what dandelion was for\u2014that it was good for eating and medicine. My mom would te ll me some things about medicines and I'd go talk about it to my grandm other and she'd think I was smart, so she'd send me out to get it. Then I'd get the wrong thing. By the time I was a teenager I was aware of what plants we re. When people were n't well, I'd say, oh, you have this problem; my grandmother says this is what you need to heal 43 Cartwright, 10 July 1979, p.10. Chapter 16: Medicinal Uses of Plants & Animals 452that. And they'd say, well, go get it. I've been harv esting and preparing wild plants for medicine for 40 years now. Chapter 17: Inventory of Plants Used by Wabanakis 453CHAPTER 17: INVENTORY OF PL ANTS USED BY WABANAKIS IN ACADIA NATIONAL PARK AND ADJACENT AREAS This inventory lists over 125 plant species in Acadia National Park and adjacent areas that Wabanakis have used for food, material culture pur poses, and/or to treat internal and external illnesses. A good number of these plants are still used by Wabanakis today. The catalog is based on a variety of Wabanaki-speci fic sources (listed below), in cluding: notes made by early explorers/travelers/missionaries in Wabanaki territories, inventories and narratives by anthropologists working among Waba naki tribes, reminiscences of residents in the Mount Desert area, and lists made by 20 th-century and contemporary Wabana kis who practice(d) traditional medicine. Compiling such a list presented numerous problems. Notably, source materials are sometimes frustratingly incomplete, citing certain flora as having medicinal or food value, but not delineating which part of the plant was use d, how it was prepared and/or what particular problem it was used to treat. Moreover, scientif ic names have shifted over the generations as botanists have reclassified species, and co mmon names change with time and vary across regional and sometimes ethnic lines . Such tangles were sorted ou t with the aid of some key general sources (historical and contemporary) that discuss medicinal plants in the region (listed below under \"General Sources\"). These general sources have been used for clarification and fact checking purposes only; rather than imposing modern-day Western knowledge concerning medicinal properties and uses of the plants noted in this inventory, we feature only information definitely attributed to Wabanaki from their own lists or those compiled by anthropologists and others based on interviews with tribespeople. Born of a comparative review of multiple lists, descriptions , drawings, and commentaries concerning flora used by Wabanakis, this inventory is alphabeti zed according to the scientific name appearing in the Acadia National Park 2 003 species list. The preferred common name and synonyms are noted, along with medicinal uses and (when mentioned in Wabanaki-specific sources) the portion of the plant used and the form of treatment. The source(s) noting these uses are indicated by their author's/a uthors' initials. The inventory also notes food and material culture uses and features a verbal description and thumbnail illustration of each plant, its degree of frequency in the park and adjacent areas, and its habitat. Because historic mentions of wild fruits such as strawberries, raspberries and bluebe rries, are often done in a broad stroke as simply \"berries,\" the some specific species on this list have few author initials cited after them as sources indicating their use. But, obviousl y, they were all consumed in volume. Various medicinal forms are mentioned: decoctions (liquid made of plant material boiled in water), infusions (tea made of plant material steeped in boiled water), poultices (compresses made of plant material prepared in various ways), salves (balms/liniments made of plant material boiled with oil/fat/ointm ent of some kind), and powders (dried plants or r oots reduced to powder with mortar and pestle). No t appearing on the list are tinctures (alcoholic solutions containing low concentrations of the active principles of herbs and plants). Curiously, these are missing from the Wabanaki-specific sources, even though financial records of 19 th-century Penobscot and Passamaquoddy Indian agents frequently menti on various alcohols am ong the supplies sold to Indian doctors, which suggests that these traditional tribal healers made tinctures. Their absence in inventories consulted for this study may be because the sources were biased against alcohol-based medicines as \"non-traditional.\" Chapter 17: Inventory of Plants Used by Wabanakis 454Warning: The plants in this inventory need to be prepared and applied in particular ways and dosages not delineated here. Thus, readers should not attempt to use any of them for medicinal purposes without the guidance of expe rts. Several generic (non-Wabanaki specific) books provide actual recipes and at least one Wabanaki traditio nal healer in Maine offers workshops on the subject\u2014Passamaquoddy Fr edda Paul in the town of Perry.

Chapter 18: Inventory of Animals Used by Wabanakis 505CHAPTER 18: INVENTORY OF AN IMALS USED BY WABANAKIS IN ACADIA NATIONAL PARK AND ADJACENT AREAS This inventory lists fauna species in Acadia National Park and adjacent areas that Wabanakis have used for food, material culture purposes and/or to treat physical ailments. Based on a comparison of Acadia National Park (ANP) speci es lists and a variety of Wabanaki-specific sources, it features primarily those species defined as \"common\" or \"abundant\" during at least part of the year. The Wabanaki-specific sources (listed below) include notes made by early explorers/travelers/missionaries in Wabanaki territories, inventories and narratives by anthropologists working among Waba naki tribes, reminiscences of residents in the Mount Desert Island area, plus information in various form s from Wabanaki people themselves. Several general sources (also listed below) were consulte d for descriptive information. Initials alongside entries signify the source(s) that identify each particular use. We encountered several obstacles in creating this list - most significantly, the frequent lack of specificity in records on the subject. For example \"oil\" and \"rawhide\" appear as the material used for one thing or another without mention of the sp ecific animal fr om which they are obtained. A similar vagueness is found in references to \"birds\" used for meat, eggs, decoration. Also, ANP's fauna species lists are in complete in terms of information on present- day abundance and historical/prehi storical presence in the park itself, not to mention adjacent areas. In short, the sources we located (all listed below) do not cont ain the full scope of information needed to help this inventory meet its potential. To give some idea of presence (or lack there of) over time, we indicate species identified by Dr. David Sanger in his 1977 excavation of the Fernald Point Site, which obta ined dates ranging from about 2000 to 700 years ago. Our inventory tags these species as \"On DS list. \" Finally, while this list covers a majority of fauna used by Wabanakis, it should not be viewed as an exhaustive inventory of species and their uses. For de tails on uses, see the correlative narratives in this study on Wabanaki foods, material culture and medicinal practices. A few useful terms to help the reader interpret this list: Rawhide = uncured animal skin. Babiche = thong, thread or lacings made of rawhide, gut or sinew. Leather = tanned animal skin. Tanned = animal hide treated to make it suppl e. (A description of Wabanaki tanning techniques can be found in the na rrative section on Wabanaki uses of flora & fauna for material culture.)

Chapter 19: Indigenous Archaeological Sites 537CHAPTER 19: MAPS & INVENTORY OF INDIGENOUS ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES IN THE MDI AREA At the end of the Ice Age, American Indian hunting groups followed the retreating line of melting glaciers and moved into Maine's coastal region, which was then a tundra teeming with fish, fowl, and game. They were especially attracted by herds of caribou and muskox and probably hunted mammoth as well. Material remains of some of their base camps and kill sites date as far back as about 10,500 y ears ago. During the next few thousand years, climatic warming transformed tundra into w oodland, and rising sea-levels slowly flooded the lower coastal plains. Hundreds of higher hills and mountains in the coastal plains became islands in the Gulf of Maine. The warmer waters and emerging woodland ha bitat\u2014featuring a wi de variety trees, such as birch, pine, spruce, and later also ash, beech, elm and oak, as well as many smaller plants\u2014created an attractive natural habitat for land and water animals moving in from warmer southern regions. This environmental ch ange forced human inhabitants to leave or make cultural adaptations. It also attracte d human newcomers already adapted to woodland survival. Coastal territories like Mount Dese rt Island and its surr oundings provided ample opportunities for fishing and hunting land and marine animals, including moose, deer, bears, beavers, seals, otters, ducks, and geese . Clams were an especi ally important seasonal food source, evidence of which can still be f ound in the presence of nearly 2,000 larger and smaller shellmiddens near tidal mudflats on Maine's coast. There were also nuts, roots and fruit, as well as other plant foods to gather. In the course of generations, humans in the region developed a well-established survival strategy, adapting their subsistence mo de to the seasonal cycles of their maritime woodland habitat. For their st rategy to succeed, they had to be mobile and flexible, periodically relocating to find food and comfor t according to nature's seasonal offerings. Although many ancient camping grounds have di sappeared by forces of nature and modern development, still-existing prehistoric sites have been researched by archaeologists and provide insights into the traditional lifeways of Wabanaki peoples during several thousand years prior to the European invasi on. Research indicates not only a complex cultural pattern of seasonal movement but also a considerable degree of variation between different prehistoric coastal sites. Dr. David Sanger, a specialist in the region's archaeology, notes that many coastal sites we re periodically occupi ed during the warmer season, but that numerous others were primarily inhabited during the cold weather months. These sites, he notes, were clustered within easy distance of prim e fishing locations, in addition to being around special types of mudflats with good intertidal shellfish resources. Large mudflats, such as those found further up the estuaries, were not selected for habitation. These locations would necessitate long carries over the soft mud to get a canoe and its contents in and out of the water. Instead, sites were chosen with reference to shorter, but still gently sloping beaches, better suited to canoe landing and launching. These intertidal flats also offered clams and other mollusks, and could be used to situate brush weirs and fi sh traps.... Finally, many of the sites, especially those with primary cold-season occupation, faced Chapter 19: Indigenous Archaeological Sites 538south and southeast, where they would simultaneously receive some sun and shelter from the prevailing nor th and northwest winter winds.1 Introduction to the Sites Maps: There are 625 known American Indian archaeolog ical sites along Maine's coast from Little Deer Isle to Gouldsboro Bay, 71 of which ha ve Ceramic (beginning 2,700 years ago) or Historic Period components. Maps prepared for our study by Dr. Arthur Spiess of the Maine Historic Preservation Commission, give an overview of site density without precisely delineating and there by jeopardizing locations needi ng protection. He offered the following guidelines for interpreting the maps: Each square is a \u00bd km square within which there is one or more prehistoric and/or Contact period archaeological site . The squares that are cross-hatched and numbered contain sites with confirmed Ceramic period and/or Historic Period components. Most of the \"unknown\" sites are simply small shell middens that are of unknown age - most likely Middle Ceramic period based on known survey data. Sites with confirmed historic /contact period components include: 30.67, 30.73, 31.13, 42.56, 'L ate Ceramic' means having cord- wrapped stick impress or incised ceramics, which would be after 1200 AD. The sites listed with name s have a substantial amount of further information, either in published format or unpublished reports. 2 Another archaeologist (and third generation Deer Isle resident), Dr. William Haviland, has navigated the waters of our research area fo r many decades checking for sites. He has also sought archival and oral source material, sort ing through an array of questions concerning the region's Wabanakis - from canoe routes to food habits to in teraction with white communities. He notes that ther e are \"at least 296 known sites for the town of Deer Isle Proper [and] 261 for Stonington.\" Making note of Eggemoggin Reach, he says \"In the Reach 12 islands have known sites, some as many as 4 (I do not know about Chatto and Hog islands in Brooklin). Most of these sites are included in the 296 listed for Deer Isle.\" 3 Interesting for this study is Haviland's comment concerning continuity of use: Noteworthy is that some middens show con tinuity of use up into historic times: notably Campbell's Island and the Asborns en site on Deer Isle. And let's not forget the copper kettle burials at Naskeag [across Blue Hill Bay, directly opposite Dodge Point at MDI] . In addition we have r ecord of Indians around 1800 processing porpoises on or near a la rge midden in Crockett Cove. Then there are Conary and White Islands, each with several middens, given by treaty to the Indians.... Off Stoningt on [a few miles north of Isle au Haut], Russ and Camp are islands with middens, and in the 1800s these were frequented by 1 Sanger 1988, p92. 2 Spiess, letter to McBride & Prins, 10/27/04. Emphasis added. 3 Haviland, letter to McBride, 10/15/04. 19: Indigenous Archaeological Sites 539[Wabanaki] families. . . . Finally, I'll bet there is at least one midden on Saddleback Island. This continuity is confirmed when one looks at the following Spiess maps in connection with the historic written record. Doing so show s that the encampments of 19 th-century Wabanakis who came to MDI seasonally (especially to sell sealskins, market their traditional skills of craftm aking, hunting/guiding, herbal doctoring, and canoeing to locals and vacationers) were located in places frequented by Native ancestors - including Southwest Harbor, Northeast Harbor, Somesville, Bar Harbor, and Hulls Cove, as well as Bar Island, th e Cranberry Isles, and Isle au Haut.

Southwest Harbor: 1847-1925 Clark Point, Southwest Harbor, opposite Parkers \"In the year of 1847 came a trib e of Indians from Old Town, some fifteen or twenty, and camped on the salt water shore opposite Parkers.

Surely it is but the tip of the full, usually unrecorded story of Wabanaki presence in the area during this period. As such, we see it as a starting point - a list to which others may add their bits and pieces of information. 2 Deering in A.Joy 14:1 Chapter 20: Wabanaki Encampments on MDI lived in tents. . . .\"3 \"Ten or twelve years ago [1860/62] Southw est Harbor was the principal place of resort upon the Island of Mount Desert, and several houses entertained those who came to fly from the summer heats of the warmer regions south.\"4 1884 Southwest Harbor [probably the Parker/Clark Point site] \"Only one Indian, a woman of the Passamaquoddy tr ibe, is reported at Southwest Harbor.\"5 1889 Southwest Harbor [probably the Parker site, Clark Point] \"It now appears that the Indian woman, Elizabet h Francis, who was burned to death at Oldtown recently, was not 'Queen Frances' but another E lizabeth Francis, who summered at Southwest Harbor. Queen Francis is yet at Bar Harbor.\"6 1893 Southwest Harbor [probably the grandfather Sabbatis Mitchell [Penobscot, b1829] and his sister and her family stayed over in Southwest Harbor in the summers.

They lived in Southwest Harbor in th e summer selling baskets and getting sweetgrass for winter basketmaking. . . . They used to go down to the coast every spring.\" 7 \"Traditionally our family has always been there and summered there and had traditional family land there. It was said that we had gone back there at one point and there was a fence and we couldn't get there anymore. We couldn't get on the shore, because we always come by water but we couldn't get on to the shore because of the fences. It was just basically the tidal zone. So we could stay there al l low tide but at high tide ther e was no land there. So, it was disappointing and disheartening, an d I guess our family had gone down and tried to camp out in many different areas and set up villages, but we were not allowed at one point. It's where a navy base or a coast guard base used to be. I heard that in other times we used to camp out on the corner of downtown Bar Harbor where now there's a ferry or a whale riding boat.\" 8 1907-82 Southwest Harbor [unknown location/Cannery camps?] Hattie Loring Gordius (b1892) began her first of 75 years working in canneries in the vicinity of Southwest Harbor where she lived. \"For y ears, widowed and bringing up nine children, Hattie walked from her Bass Harbor job [at U nderwood's Cannery] to work another edge of] Southwest Harbor.\" In the earl y years she wintered over on th e Penobscot reservation in Old Town, but eventually she lived year-round in Bass Harbor. 9 3 Parker, p40. Note: Judy and Pete Obbard, now living in a cottage built on this site by Judy's great uncle PG Rhoads in the mid-1920s, have a hand-drawn map of Clark Point dated \"about 1890.\" Comparing it to an 1881 map of the point, plus historic information on when buildings were erected, it appears to have captured the scene c1885. It has to pre-date 1886 since it includes the lobster cannery which was relocated from that site that year, and it has to post-date 1883 since it includes the Congregational church was constructed between 1883-85 and dedicated in '85. Combining Deering's comment that c1847 some 15 or 20 Indians from Old Town camped opposite Parker's with the 1885 Clar k Point map and Judy's statement that PG Rhoads said Indians were still coming to camp there at the time he built the house in 1925, we have recorded use that spans 80 years. 4 Nichols, 1872. 5 MDH 8/8/1884, p3. 6 MDH 9/27/1889, p3. 7 Theodore (Ted) Norris Mitchell, interview with McBride, 2004. 8 John Bear Mitchell (Ted's grandson ), interview with McBride, 2004. 9 Cartwright, July 1982.

Additional references to the Ledgelawn site can be found in the Timeline of this report. As the years passed, some Wabanakis began wintering over in the town when they could find a \"good rent.\" Some took on odd jobs during the co ld seasons, while others work ed on crafts to sell in the summer. Some Wabanaki indivi duals and families appear on local censuses for 1900, 1910 and 1920, typically renting low-price dwelling space in locations su ch as the Edgewood St. and lower School St. area. 1893 Indian encampments formally banned on shore property on corner of West & Bridge streets, Bar Harbor: \"'All rights, privileges and bene fits derived under and all rights whether in law or equity to enforce certain restrictions upon other lands, which restrictions are so imposed for the benefit of the land herein described as conveyed, in and by a certain warranty deed thereof from Sylvanus Jordan to Charles F.

Chapter 20: 1840s-1920s 560 CLARK POINT MAP 1885. (Courtesy Judy & Pete Obbard.) As listed on the map's accompanying key (see opposite page), site 20 was the location of an Indian encampment. Today, Judy & Pete Obbard live in a cottage built on this site by Judy's great uncle PG Rhoads in the mid-1920s. Comparing this map with the 1881 map of the point, plus historic information about when buildings were erected, this map appears to have captured the scene as it was in 1885\u2014despite the 1890 date inscribed on it. (It has to pre-date 1886 since it includes the lobster cannery which was relocated from that site that year, and it has to post-date 1883 since it includes the Congregational church was constructed between 1883-85 and dedicated in '85.) Combining Eunice Deering's recollection of 15 or 20 Indians from Old Town camped opposite Parker's in 1847 (in A.Joy, 14:1) and Judy Obbard's statement that PG Rhoads said Indians were still coming to camp there at the time he built the house in 1925 (p.c. 2004) establishes that Wabanakis used the site as an encampment over an 80-year time span. And it is quite possible that the encampment was established pre-1847. Chapter 561 Key to 1885 Clark Pt. Map (page opposite). (Courtesy Judy & Pete Obbard.) Chapter 20: Wabanaki Encampments on 1881.

Chapter 21: Native Canoe Routes 569CHAPTER 21: MAPS & INVENTORY OF NATIVE CANOE ROUTES TO AND ON MOUNT DESERT ISLAND Maliseets on St. John River. By Patrick Campbell, 1791. (Canada Pub.Archives) The following inventory is based primarily on interviews with Mike Krepner,1 founder of Native Trails, Inc., in Waldoboro. Krepner has devoted himself to researching, paddling, mapping and writing about the age-old Native ca noe routes. Asked what he looks for in identifying these routes, he menti oned three points in particular: Feasibility/Practicality. There's a certain ratio of energy expenditure as to whether carrying something on your back or in your canoe. If you can carry 60 lbs on back for a mile you can carry 350-400 lbs, perhaps more, in a canoe with same amount of energy output. You'd portage the items separately. Portages are no big deal. But there's a cut o ff point: if it's more than 1/7th portages it starts to become impractical as a route. Historic records. There's not a lot but you find some documentation in writings of the 1800s when they're still using the routes. Then there's oral information and retention of place names. Physical evidence . This exists in some places. I can take you to a place in eastern Maine where there's notch that cu ts about 12' deep into the bank of a peat bog. It's about 4-5' wide, 3- 4' high. That's the western term inus of 2-mi portage connec ting the Grand Lakes with the Passmadumkeag River. However, some routes haven't been used for hundreds of years and that, on top of logging, can ma ke it tough to identify. Als o, portage routes can vary significantly over time\u2014the terminus is more constant but the route through the woods is variable, unless defined by a st ream or other obstruction. Beaver damming was a key factor in the navigab ility of Maine's waterways. This given, some routes that are not navigable t oday were viable routes in the past. Asked how he weighs this factor in determining whether a particular rout e would have been navigable, Mike commented: \"Other than in the occasi onal record\u2014such as the 1820 Geology of Maine, which notes beaver streams\u2014it's tough to gage whether or not a st ream was dammed. In some places you see old dams but can't tell when they were built. Th ere is an oral tradi tion among Native Americans that beavers were carefully tended because they were so important for routes. Fur trade wars wreaked havoc on the system; killing off beaver was like chewing up the interstate so you can make gravel.\" 1 In this inventory, direct quotes from Krepner are prefaced with his initials, MK. See also Cook, 2007. Chapter 21: Native Canoe Routes 570 Traditional Canoe Routes Between the Penobscot River and MDI Penobscot River Penobscot Bay MK: As Fannie Eckstorm noted, on the Penobscot Ri ver the Narrows along Verona Island can be really bad, so Indians would avoi d it; they would take S. Branch Marsh River and short carry to Sandy Point and there re-enter the Penobs cot River and continue on to the bay. Indian Island/Old Town Marsh River Sandy Point Verona Island Penobscot River Penobscot Bay Castine/Bagaduce R Walker Pond portage Punchbowl Eggemoggin Reach Blue Hill Bay Continuing from the Penobscot Bay on to MDI, Wabanakis commonly a voided the rough seas around Cape Rosier by paddlin g/portaging across the cape to Eggemoggin Reach via the Goose Pond - Weir Cove route, or Bells Marsh/Flat Landing - Horseshoe Cove or Orcutt Harbor. To avoid Cape Rosier entirely, one could travel the Bagaduce River, accessed from the Penobscot R. at Morse Cove, or Wadsworth and Hatch coves, or by paddling around Castine. Once on the Bagaduce (the Minnewokun or \"Many Directions Route\"), one could follow the river to present-day Brooksville, paddle to the south end of Walker Pond, and make a short portage to the \"Punchbowl\" in Eggemoggin Re ach opposite Little Deer Isle. Canoeing east in the R each, one could take any of several routes to Blue Hill Bay and from there continue on to various MDI entry point s. The rough waters around Naskeag Point could be avoided by taking Benjamin River through Great Meadow and on to Salt Pond and Blue Hill Bay. From there, one could paddle past Long Island and on to MDI, entering the great island at Squid Cove or Pretty Marsh Harbor. (See map on next page.) Chapter 21: Native Canoe Routes 571This map encompasses routes described on the previous page, including going from Eggemoggin Reach to present-day Sedgewick on the Benjamin River, and from there on through Salt Pond to Blue Hill Bay. MK: Blue Hill is loaded with old routes in addition to the Blue Hill Harbor-Salt Pond- Benjamin River-Eggemoggin Reach. I've seen photo of Native American canoes being wagoned from Blue Hill [northwest] to Penobsco t [town on the Bagaduce R.] in the late 1800s early 1900s, along what might be an old po rtage\u2014rather lengthy, but that wouldn't be intimidating. This path roughly followed what is now Route 177. Blue Hill also links up with the inland route between the Penobscot and Union rivers. Chapter 21: Native Canoe SunkhazeIndian Brook Probably a preferred inland ro ute to MDI was to go upstream from Indian Island 1.5 miles to Sunkhaze Stream, navigate upstream to Indi an Brook, portage about 2 miles east to Dead Stream and on down to Great Pond and Union River. Then it's a piece of cake to Western Bay. One reason the inland rout e would be taken is that it offere d a diversity of habitat and one was more likely to find moose, deer and beaver alon g the way than going to the sea directly by way of the Penobscot. Another advantage of this ro ute is that once in Great Pond you can head up Main Stream to Brandy Pond and from there go to Guagus Stream and Nicatous Lake and access all of eastern Maine. Sunkhaze Stream Sunkhaze Str. cont'd Great Pond & Union River Western Bay Chapter 21: Native Canoe Routes 573 Traditional Canoe Routes between the St. Croix and MDI Paddling from Lewy Lake at Princeton westward across Big Lake and West Grand Lakes, then south on Pocumcus, Wabasis, Third Machias a nd Second Machias lakes, brings you to the Machias River, which offers links to a range of watercourses bringing one closer to MDI. Another option is to take Fourth Machias Lake to Gassabias Lake and Stream, into Nicatous Lake, which, with a short portage, gives access to Narraguagus River, which spills into the ocean at Millbridge, several miles up the coast from Schoodic Peninsula. Schoodic Point Portages MK: Weather can be really bad around Schoodic Point. It is wide open, exposed - not good canoe country. MITA maintains the old portage across the neck. (It's the only real thing they've done as far as native trails.) Just north of that at the park boundary was another carry between Wonsqueak Harbor and Birch Harbor [due north], which makes it possible to avoid going around the head. And from Winter Harbor it is short haul over to Schoodic Harbor. There are good landings along there at Big Moose by Pond Island. There's another route between W. Gouldsboro and Gouldsboro that basically follows Rt. 1; You can easily get into Jones Pond with a short carry from W Gouldsboro... then into whole network of relatively protected water. Chapter 21: Native Canoe Routes 574 Possible Breakneck Brook & Ponds Eagle Lake carryLong Pond Bracy Cove (Hulls Cove is at MDI's Pt. & Canoe Pt.) MK: Hulls Cove is a much better starting point than Duck Brook. A little steep at the beginning, then a long stretch that would be flooded and then steep again. Breakneck Brook is a possibility, although it gets unnavigable before you get to the ponds. [The decision to use it or not] would depend where I'm coming from. This [Hulls Cove-Bracy Cove] route is okay but Seal Harbor is a better destination than Bracy Cove. Seal Cove has a sand beach, springs/fresh water. Bracy Cove is a major sea wall, a big boulder beach, but that is caused in part by the causeway. However, the portage from Jordan Stream to Long Pond to get to Bracy is much shorter than the portage from Jordan pond to Stanley Brook to get to Seal Harbor. It's questionable how far Stanley Brook is navigable\u2014it's a 2-mile carry, but the grades aren't bad. One thing to think about is that going in or out of Seal Harbor, you have to go around Crowninshield Pt, fairly exposed. Wind is very important\u2014in a strong southeast wind, it would be quite hazardous to go to Seal Harbor. On the east side of the island most of the trails are foot trails that could be traversed in a day. Everything depends on need, purpose. If you were at Hunter's Beach and had killed several seal and wanted to get them north, you'd want to use your canoe\u2014but it would be easier to wait for good weather and take them by sea than to go inland. Bracey Seal Otter Cove Harbor Cove / Duck Brook - Bracy Cove Duck Brook Eagle Lake and the rest same as above (Duck Brook roughly follows Eagle Lake Rd.) Rebecca Cole-Will: \"There is archaeological evidence for use of the mouth of Duck Brook, but nothing beyond that and I've done walkover survey up that way. I can't imagine that anyone would use D.B. to access Jordan Pond. Walk it sometime -- it's straight up hill from the mouth until you get up to the tableland area.\"] MK: Becky's exactly right. There's a 275' drop in 4 miles , [including] a 60' drop from Eagle lake outlet to Duck Brook. You'd portage up the canyon part where it hits the sea to New Mill Meadow which likely would have been totally flooded by beaver. Cromwell Cove - Otter Cove Cromwell Cove Cromwell Brook Great Meadow TarnOtter Creek Otter Cove MK: This is a good route, parts beavered today. Lower part of Cromwell Brook [entrance at Cromwell Cove, southeast coast of Bar Harbor] is difficult today because of development. Otter Creek [entrance at Otter Cove, southeast edge of MDI] has a lot of beaver at present. Chapter 21: Native Canoe Routes 575 Squid Cove Somes Sound Squid Cove unnamed stream carryRound Pond Long Pond carry over N. Neck Long Pond Ripple Pond Somes Pond c a r r y Somes Sound (Squid Cove is \u00bd\" below the \"B\" in \"Western Bay.\") MK: I looked at this some years ago. It's quite a good route\u2014and there are lots of variations on it. From Indian Pt. for instance, you can canoe/portage east to Kitteridge Brook and then paddle south to Somes Sound. Just above Indian Point, between NW Cove and Clark Cove, is Aunt Molly's Beach, which is part sandy, some rock, mixed grav el. It could have been an Indian camping area given the name and the location. Starting near there, you can almost draw a straight line to Kitteridge Brook. I've gone there just about to the forks. In beaver time you could go further. You're looking at a 1.25-mile portage to get to the navigable part of Kitteridge Brook today. Here again, it depends on wher e you are when you're starting and the weather conditions. You wouldn't try to get to Aunt Molly's Beach or south to Pretty Marsh in a big westerly wind. There's a good possibility that from Thomas Bay you can get to Salisbury Cove by way of Fresh Meadow today. The gradient is quite low, a lot of meadow. And along the way you have access to Aunt Betsy's Brook. From there, it's just short portage and you're at Kitteridge Broo k and on to Somes Sound. Squid Cove - Bass Harbor Squid Cove unnamed stream carryRound Pond Long Pond carryMarshall Brook Bass Harbor (Bass Harbor is in the lower right-hand portion of this map.) MK: Bass Harbor: Very, very bad water. There's a bar that runs out. It's nasty. Put any wind across a running tide and you have 4-5' waves. Generations have avoided that. The whole southwest section of the MDI coast can be rough\u2014not as bad as Bass Harbor Head, but rough. If you're at Seal Cove and want to get to Bass Harbor you have to watch weather, or portage 2 mi from from the southeast end of Seal Cove Pond over to Marshall Brook, which fl ows right into Bass Harbor. Also, the stretch of sw amp between Seal Cove and Marshall Brook is navigable if the streams are beavered. To go from Bass Harbor to Southwest Harbor, you go up Buttermilk Brook, do a 3/4mi portage and come out at downtown SWH (the sw corner of SWH). Then you're on the lee side of Somes Sound with a lot of distan ce you can travel. Buttermilk Brook runs just north of the Bass Harbor Road, then doglegs south to Route 102. It was probably beavered about to 102, which says to me that the first version of that road followed the portage. Chapter 21: Native Canoe Routes 576 Across the Bay from Bass Harbor is the town of Bernard and below there a narrow neck that can be portaged across to reach Mitchell Cove. That saves going around Lopaus Point, which can be rough. Pretty Marsh - Seal Cove Pretty Marsh Harbor Hodgdon Cove carrySeal Cove Pond carrySeal Cove (Pretty Marsh Harbor is just south of S quid Cove on MDI's northwestern flank.) Going from Pretty Marsh to Seal Cove by way of Hodgdon Pond and Seal Cove Pond is no problem. Or, in good weather, you can make Hodgdon Cove in a short carry right over to Hodgdon Pond. A route like that implies the wind would be coming strong out of the southwest.

This focus is evident wh en we consider that Asticou, Saint-Sauveur, nor Mount Desert Island are listed in the index and that the period after 1763 is covered in a brief chapter titled \"Epilogue.\" A problem is that it confuses the ethnicity issue of the Canibas, incorrectly equating Aben aki-speakers with Etchemins.

After this the identity of the Etchemins with the modern Maliseets and the antiquity of the Passamaquoddy tr ibe can hardly be denied\" Notes the \"Jesuit Relation of 1677, in which Pessemonquote (Passama quoddy) is mentioned as a river on which the Indians were settled. Villebon wrote that the Maliseets live on the St. John and along the sea- shore, occupying 'Pesmonquadis, Majais (Machias) , les Mont Deserts and Pentagoet' (Castin).\" Eckstorm goes on to discuss the identity of the Indians among whom the Baron St. Castin lived, noting that \"Villebon, the governor of the province, called them Maliseets. They were a considerable tribe, as is shown in the census, ta ken November 1780, by Father de la Chasse. He enumerates twenty-six long houses, containing 388 men, women and children, including 126 men and boys able to bear arms. The French 'Gen eral Memoirs' of 1686, say: the Sieur de Castin, who trades with the savages and with the English...and there are two very considerable nations in the re gion which recognize France are enemies of the English.' The two nations are clearly the Etchem ins and the ancestors of the present Penobscots. In all likelihood Villebon was correct in calling the Castin Indians Etchemins (that is 'Quoddies'), but considering their numbers and isolation fo r a long time, it is safe to recognize them as Pentagoets. They occupied the region from Cas tine to Naskeag Point, and perhaps beyond and deserve a sub-tribal status by virtue of thei r location.\" Page 57 briefly notes traditional seashore food collection, preparation and storage practices. _____. 1926.
