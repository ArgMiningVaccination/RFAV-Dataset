The ads, which started April 1, will run for at least 12 weeks on radio, television and elsewhere, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which launched the Tips from Former Smokers initiative. This marks a continuation of 2012's national ad campaign, which generated 192,000 calls to a toll-free number (800-QUIT-NOW). The hotline helps people access support to stop smoking. The 2013 effort includes more details about the negative health consequences of secondhand smoke, the CDC said. The initiative also features medical conditions that were not part of last year's campaign, such as asthma in adults, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and smoking-related complications among people with diabetes ( [link](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/)). Despite the known dangers of tobacco use, nearly one in five adults in the U.S. smokes and almost 90% start the habit before age 18, the CDC said. More than 440,000 Americans die each year of smoking-related diseases. For every death, 20 more people live with at least one serious illness from smoking. "}
