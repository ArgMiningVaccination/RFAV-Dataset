Background: The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes in India is a cause for national concern, particularly the spiraling cost burden to the country. As one approach to stop its increase, Yoga medicine has been widely implemented, finding popularity with all social strata. Here, we report a study suggesting that treatment with fresh herbal juices and Yoga can improve the levels of blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in people with pre-diabetes. Methods: Study design: 3-arm controlled trial 3 months in duration. Participants: 157 male prisoners with newly diagnosed, high fasting blood sugar (FBS) and postprandial blood sugar (PPBS) levels. Group interventions: (1) Rasahara and Yoga, (2) Yoga, (3) no intervention. Assessments: FBS and PPBS levels were measured every 2 weeks; HbA1c and blood lipids were determined pre- and post-intervention. Results: Significant decreases occurred in the FBS (-21.13 \u00b1 21.16 mg/dl) and PPBS levels (-15.02 \u00b1 14.89 mg/dl) in group 1 (both p < 0.0001) and in the FBS level (20.62 \u00b1 32.68 mg/dl) in group 2 (p = 0.0005), while the increases in group 3 attained significance only for the PPBS level (9.62 \u00b1 21.83 mg/dl) (p = 0.0022). Observed changes in HbA1c were: group 1, -0.044 \u00b1 0.059 mg/dl; group 2, +0.024 \u00b1 0.456 mg/dl (not significant); and group 3, +0.365 \u00b1 0.369 mg/dl (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: This study of Yoga for the treatment of diabetes shows that all male prisoners could benefit from the Yoga prison programs. Addition of Yoga programs to state and federal activities at all levels is now national policy in India. Follow-up studies should be carried out to obtain more robust results.", "sitename": "Karger Publishers", "date": "2018-02-28", "cleaned_text": "Summary Background: The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes in India is a cause for national concern, particularly the spiraling cost burden to the country.
