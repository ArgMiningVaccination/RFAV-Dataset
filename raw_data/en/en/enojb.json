She is also the Chair of the [Society of Homeopaths](https://homeopathy-soh.org/), the largest register of professional homeopaths in the UK. When did you first become interested in homeopathy? When my daughter was a baby, she developed a nasty cough which started at the same time every evening. I wanted a safe, gentle way of treating my children and read that homeopathy might help. There was a remedy which fitted her symptoms perfectly, so I gave her a dose and she improved instantly. Naturally, I wanted to know more and started to read about this fascinating medicine. I also began to buy more remedies - Chamomilla to help with difficult teething, Arnica for bumps and bruises, Belladonna for fevers. I soon had quite a collection and a growing interest! And when did you decide to train as a homeopath? I read an article about a man who, like me, had begun using homeopathy with his family, become more interested and gone onto train and qualify as a homeopath. After checking the Society of Homeopaths for accredited courses and colleges, I discovered there was a college just 15 miles away from my home. I joined Purton House School of Homeopathy in 2000 and after training for four years, qualified as homeopath in 2004. With a handful of patients to start my practice, I joined a clinic in Thame, Oxfordshire and - mostly by word of mouth - my practice began to grow. Around this time, I also began working as a volunteer with a supported housing group. I was running a clinic for people with drug and alcohol problems alongside homeopathy students. This was challenging work due to the chaotic nature of people's lives, but I found it so rewarding. I enjoy the teamwork, working with students and everyone learning from each other, as well as the fact that we are working with people who probably wouldn't see a homeopath. What has been your proudest moment to date - professionally or personally? One of the things I am most proud of is SidebySide, the low-cost community clinic I helped to start in London as a response to the tragic fire at Grenfell Tower in 2017. The day after the fire, homeopaths were in the area offering support to those who were shocked and traumatised by the terrible event. We were given space by a generous community centre and it evolved into SidebySide, the drop-in clinic we have today. W10 is a diverse area of London - it is one of wealthiest but also one of the poorest and this is reflected in people's health. We work alongside the community centre's Health Champions who promote healthy lifestyles by inspiring people to take a more active role in their health. They run regular events - Men / Women's health days, regular diabetes and blood pressure checks and cultural events, which SidebySide is part of, so it's a wonderful opportunity to spread the word about homeopathy and health. If you weren't a homeopath, what career would you have chosen? As a child I danced for thirteen years - ballet, tap and modern - and always loved being on the stage. Looking back, I would have loved to have been in a chorus, singing and dancing in shows. Whenever I see a show at the theatre, I have the urge to jump up on the stage and join in. I haven't done it....yet. Name one remedy you couldn't live without. That's a tough one as I use so many different remedies every day in clinic. I looked in my personal remedy kit to see which one had been used most and Nux Vomica had the least number of pills in it. I guess after the overindulgence of Christmas and New Year, that's not surprising! Aside from work, do you have any interesting hobbies or interests? I love being outside in my garden where I grow veg, flowers and weeds in abundance. It's my happy place where I love to potter at any time of year. My other happy place is my kitchen as I love to cook. I find it really relaxing to be chopping, stirring and mixing with the radio on. My favourite cuisines are Mediterranean and Middle Eastern - I have to restrain myself from impulsively buying the latest cookery book. I'm also a keen tennis player and play in the doubles team for my local tennis club. What attracted you to the H-UK Trustee role? I believe that homeopathy should be part of an integrated, collaborative health system which gives people choice about their healthcare, just as it is in many other countries. H-UK is doing a great job in helping to make homeopathy accessible for all through its network of free and low-cost clinics and I wanted to get more involved in this - and other aspects - of their work.
