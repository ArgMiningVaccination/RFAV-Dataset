ECEP provides quality early care and education services to over 250 children (ages range from three months to five years old). The program is designed to serve young children of the UCB community, including students, staff, faculty and post-docs. Community families are also eligible to apply. We have high expectations for all children and believe parents, teachers and the broader community are necessary for their success in school and life. We view parents as critical partners in supporting children's optimal development while their children are in group care. Through partnerships with students and various campus departments, ECEP continues to serve the mission of the University with teaching, research and public service. We hope you enjoy your time with us, and look forward to working with you and your child(ren). PURPOSE OF THIS HANDBOOK Please use this handbook to familiarize yourself with our program, what to expect for your child in a group care environment and the policies and procedures which help us function at a high level. It is your responsibility to read and follow the policies outlined and to ask for help or explanation if needed. ABOUT THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROGRAM (ECEP), UC BERKELEY ECEP is a department within Residential and Student Service Programs (RSSP), under the leadership of Student Affairs. Our program provides quality care and education for children of the UC Berkeley community, including faculty, students and staff. Our mission is to provide high quality early childhood education and child care services to enhance optimal growth and learning for your child. We believe high expectations for all children and positive attitudes and support from parents, teachers and the broader community are necessary for student success in school and life. We view parents as critical partners in supporting children's optimal development while their children are in our care. ECEP serves children ages three months through preschool. The hours of operation are from 7:45 a.m. to 5:30 p.m, Monday-Friday. We are licensed by Title 22 of Community Care Licensing, and since we also serve low income students across our program with funding from the Department of Education, Title 5, we follow their requirements as well.We are proud of our child development programs, and realize that it is you, the parent, who has the most influence on your child's development and education. Therefore, in order for your child to obtain the maximum advantage from our program, your help, participation and opinions are encouraged. We invite you to become an active participant in your child's program through the Parent Advisory Committee (PAC) that exists at each Center, fundraising and/or volunteering. We encourage you to talk to your child's teacher or call ECEP if you have any concerns or questions. Thank you for supporting your child's early development and the UC Berkeley Early Childhood Education Program. OUR PHILOSOPHY ECEP believes in building a working partnership with parents, family and the community to provide a child development program that nurtures a healthy sense of self-worth, fosters the development of skills in all developmental domains, encourages the development of independence and promotes diverse cultural values and acceptance. We believe in providing a loving, supportive environment where well-trained, sensitive staff appreciate the uniqueness of each child. Staff should encourage children to feel empowerment over her or his life through independence, trial and error and successful challenges. Our program is based on sound early childhood education child development theory and practices, which are developmentally appropriate and child centered. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PROGRAM UC BERKELEY9 8 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DAY CARE AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT We value the importance of Early Childhood Education in our programs, as well as the staff who work here. Care is provided by teaching staff trained in developmentally appropriate practices for children. This means that the children are engaged in learning throughout the day, including lunch time, rest time, outside play, etc. In order for children to learn and be ready for school and life, staff must provide a safe, nurturing environment where children experience activities including sharing, exploring, testing limits, making mistakes and trying again. CURRICULUM ECEP believes children learn best through play, and our curriculum incorporates both teacher initiated and child-initiated activities as well as small/large group activities. Teaching staff in our infant and toddler classrooms support the primary care practices of the PITC philosophy (Program for Infant and Toddler Care). We feel that a child-centered program is most appropriate for children in our infant, toddler, and preschool programs. Our classrooms provide rich learning environments with age- appropriate yet challenging play equipment and materials, learning centers that encourage exploration and discovery, discussion, and child and adult interaction. Teachers plan activities based on children's interests and our goals for their learning of content and skills. Primary caregivers are assigned to infants and toddlers. All teachers and teacher assistants work to develop positive relationships with you and your child. It is the teacher's responsibility to keep you informed of your child's progress and keep the lines of communication clear and open. Teachers will conduct your parent conferences, your child's assessments and transitions to your child's next educational setting. OUR GOALS FOR CHILDREN Daily activities are designed to provide age-appropriate experiences in the following early childhood developmental areas: Social/Emotional Getting along in groups Learning responsible behavior (e.g. sharing, cooperation) Respecting ethnic, cultural and age differences Expressing feelings appropriately Gaining positive self-image Developing independence, initiative and trust Cognitive/Language/Pre-Literacy Acquiring early language and literacy skills, including pre- reading and early writing skills for older children Learning numeracy (pre-math) and science concepts Increasing curiosity about the world through observation, exploration and experimentation Enhancing language skills and self expression through music, movement and interactive dialogue between peers and adults Promoting experimentation, inquiry, observation and exploration through play Health Modeling good eating habits and nutrition Practicing good hygiene habits (including hand washing and toileting) Learning to balance adequate rest periods with activity times Sharing healthy, nutritious food throughout the day Physical Development Developing large and small muscle skills Improving eye-hand coordination and perceptual skills Increasing body awareness Exploring and participating in rhythm and movement activities DAILY PROGRAM ROUTINE AND SCHEDULES Children thrive in a program environment that offers a variety of activities in a rich, well-equipped classroom with a consistent but flexible daily schedule. They depend on predictable routines and look forward to different parts of the day. Learning opportunities are available to them in unstructured and structured formats including free play/choice times, small or large group activities and routines such as eating, dressing and toileting/washing. Throughout all types of activities, the interactions between teachers and children are critical to children's learning, social, self-image and communication skills. Teachers strive to get to know each child's unique strengths and needs so they can provide individualized learning opportunities and guidance in a caring, supportive atmosphere. During free play/choice periods, children may select one or more activities from the many learning centers, such as block building, dramatic play, art, music, books, manipulatives (like puzzles, building sets), science and nature study, outdoor activities and much more. They may play/work alone, with a friend or in a small group, with a teacher's guidance or independently. As they finish, they may choose another activity after putting away their materials or toys. Circle time is conducted by the teacher or teacher assistant and may consist of planning or discussing the day's activities or special events in school or the community, sharing experiences and belongings from home, singing songs and sharing an interactive story. Children have opportunities to get to know all their classmates as they learn new concepts and practice communication and social skills, such as taking turns. Music and movement activities may also be conducted during circle time. Small group learning activities are planned and directed by teachers related to curriculum topics in the areas of language arts (e.g. letter recognition and sounds), mathematics (e.g. counting and sorting objects, measuring liquids), science (e.g. properties of magnets), art projects, cooking projects and sensory exploration for younger children. Outdoor play is an essential part of the children's day, too. Children get vigorous exercise and gain physical strength, coordination and skills through running, climbing, ball play and cooperative games. For younger children this would include walks, exploring the environment and taking activities outside. Routine activities such as snack or rest time, toileting and hand-washing are important opportunities for children to learn self-care skills, good health habits and independence. As an urban city, Berkeley has many opportunities for exploration and excitement. As part of our program and curriculum, teachers may go on walks and field trips with children. Walking trips through our urban community include nature walks, trips to campus and locations in our neighborhood. We may also experience heavy traffic. Parents must sign a consent form at the beginning of each year for walking trips of 30 minutes or less. Field trips to specific locations must be planned in advance and parents will be given a consent form to sign for the specific field trip event. Children who are not ready, cannot follow instructions to stay with the group, have difficulty keeping up with the group, become easily distracted for walking trips or field trips or children whose parents have not given consent will stay at the center under the supervision of one of our teachers. Teachers will assess the readiness for children to attend walking and/or field trips. Infants and young toddlers are cared for in a nurturing and stimulating environment using some of the primary care practices of the PITC (Program for Infant and Toddler Care) model of responsive caregiving, which incorporates observation, documentation and interpretation of a child's experiences. Their needs are attended to throughout the day, providing food, sleep, comfort and play as needed according to their temperament and comfort level. As children grow, more activities are added to provide stimulation and fun for children's developmental growth. Infants and toddlers learn through exploring their environment, interacting with peers and adults, and expression of wants and needs through verbal and non-verbal cues. Our infant programs provide rich learning environments with nurturing staff who are in tune with the individual needs of each infant in their care. All of the types of activities described above are planned during the children's day. See below for a typical classroom schedule: PRESCHOOL AND OLDER TODDLER PROGRAM SCHEDULE 7:45 Greet children & parents, wash hands, health check, quiet play 8:45 Wash for breakfast, eat, clean up 10:00 Circle time/large group time 10:30 Small group activities/outdoor play/clean up 11:15 Outdoor play/set up for lunch 12:00 Lunch 12:30 Story/outdoor play 12:45 Nap/rest time 2:30 End of rest time 3:00 Snack, free play, clean up 3:30 Large or small group time/project time 4:00 Outdoor play time 4:30 Large group/circle/story time 5:00 Games or quiet play/clean up 5:30 Center closes CHILD ASSESSMENTS Teachers and teacher assistants make observations and create portfolios for every child. All children are assessed using the California Department of Education Desired Results Developmental Profile. Our curriculum is reflective of the State's required learning goals: Children are personally and socially competent Children are effective learners Children are safe and healthy Children show physical and motor competence 11 10 After each assessment, the results are shared with the family during a parent-teacher conference. Parents are encouraged to continue the children's learning activities in the home with stories, outings, songs and helping around the house to teach important skills. Assessments are then used in program planning to assure optimal developmental growth of each child. RESEARCH/OBSERVATION Our programs incorporate a research component which may or may not apply to your child's classroom. If you are asked to have your child involved in any research activities, you will be notified ahead of time and you may choose to be involved. Qualified substitute teachers accompany the researcher and the child while they are involved in a research activity, typically described as \"playing a game.\" Informal observations of classrooms by Early Childhood, Psychology, Sociology or Education students or University representatives may occur at any time without parent notification. BEHAVIOR MANAGEMENT AND DISCIPLINE An important aspect of learning in early childhood is how to interact appropriately with others, control one's own behavior and understand social rules. As children learn about the world and acquire social interaction skills (such as how to approach others and join play), they may exhibit \"mistaken behavior\"\u2014 trying a strategy that's not suitable; may not be intending to \"misbehave.\" At other times, children may act inappropriately to gain attention or for other reasons. In any case, we will not allow a child's behavior to continue if it appears that a child will hurt him/ herself, someone else or if property will be damaged. We believe that children learn acceptable behaviors by modeling the actions of those around them, including parents, teachers and other children. We expect our teachers to implement this policy with techniques that help children learn positive strategies for interaction and problem-solving, understand the perspectives of others and why a specific behavior is not acceptable and to gain self-control. Discipline used by the ECEP teachers includes a variety of constructive techniques such as, redirecting children to other activities, counseling the child in a calm but firm voice about the situation, offering positive alternatives for behavior or gently separating the child from the group for a brief period of time. Physical punishment and humiliation are never permitted at our school, by staff, children or parents. Discipline in our classrooms must be free from corporal or unusual punishment, infliction of pain, humiliation, intimidation, ridicule, coercion, threat, mental abuse, or other actions of a punitive nature, including but not limited to: interference with the daily living functions, including eating, sleeping, toileting, or withholding of shelter, clothing, medication or aids to physical functioning. This is the policy of UCB ECEP and California law. Children with significant behavior difficulties, such as repeated hitting or biting other children or staff, will be observed and their behavior documented. Staff may confer at times with a mental health consultant to help determine causes and possible solutions to inappropriate behaviors. We will do our best to work with you and your child to improve any inappropriate behavior. Usually, a conference will be requested with parents to discuss possible methods of dealing with problem behaviors once staff has made several observations. Working with a child's behavior consistently at home and school is essential for improvement. Parents and staff must have shared understanding of the reasons for the behavior and strategies for managing it. Referral to support services may be made by the teaching staff if unacceptable behaviors continue to occur. Parents may be asked to seek counseling or attend parenting class as a condition for their child to continue in the child development program. However, we do consider it in everyone's best interest to exclude a child or parent who exhibits a continuing problem that threatens the safety of other children, staff or the child. Classroom settings and group activities are not appropriate for all children. If we determine that our program is not appropriate for your child, or that you or your child constitutes a safety or legal hazard, we reserve the right to withdraw services. HEALTH, COMMUNITY AND SOCIAL SERVICES The ECEP staff will review your family's needs with you upon enrollment and on an annual basis in order to help you find resources you and your family may need. Berkeley has many resources both on the school site as well as near your child's school. Please feel free to discuss any needs for health (physical/ mental), social services, recreational or other needs with the teacher, site coordinator, or center director. University Health Services are available to faculty, staff and students. These may include services for mental health, behavior, elder care, gender and equity and work/life issues. Please access the UC Berkeley website for more information. TEACHING STAFF All teachers and teacher assistants, including substitutes who are needed for planned and unplanned leaves, are hired based on their education, experience, creativity, warmth and caring for children. We want to assure the highest quality care and education for your child. All teachers hold California Child Development permits and many have A.A., B.A. or Masters degrees. We encourage all staff to continue their professional development through college coursework, conferences and in- service training. We receive a limited amount of funding from the California Department of Education and the federal government. In classrooms that serve low income students, we meet Education Code (Title 5) staffing requirements that exceed those in Community Care Licensing regulations (Title 22). Title 5 requires that for the majority of the day we maintain a 1:3 adult-to-child ratio in the infant rooms, 1:4 adult-to-child ratio in the toddler rooms; and 1:8 adult-to-child ratio in the preschool rooms. Our classrooms are typically staffed with two fully qualified teachers, one teacher assistant and student assistants. For the safety of your child, references, physical health report (including T.B. clearance) and criminal record check are gathered upon hire for all paid staff. SCHOOL CALENDAR AND HOLIDAYS We operate year-round centers and observe university holidays. We also schedule professional development, clean-up/training days and allow for staff to transition during certain times of the year. A calendar for the year is provided to all parents upon enrollment and is subject to change with prior notice to parents. Please contact your child's teacher or the enrollment office for any questions you may have regarding the ECEP calendar. Our calendars and instructions on how to add the calendar onto your Google calendar are on our website: https://ece.berkeley.edu/ resources. PARENT PARTICIPATION AND INVOLVEMENT Your direct involvement with your child's classroom will increase the benefits he/she derives from the program. ECEP has an open door policy to encourage parents to participate in the daily activities whenever possible. Please offer your time, your talents and donations to the classroom and attend evening or weekend activities with other families. We also require that parents maintain standards of confidentiality towards other families and children enrolled in the program, respecting individual differences and working to help provide a safe and supportive environment for children, families, teaching and administrative staff. All parents who choose to participate in the classroom are required to provide vaccination records for influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis (whooping cough) as well as proof of TB clearance. Here are some ways parents can be involved: Parent participation in the classroom can be scheduled through your classroom's teacher. One hour per week in your child's classroom can be beneficial to your child as well as help the teachers to create a stimulating and fun environment for all of the children. All volunteers work under the direct supervision of teachers. Please ask how you can become involved in the program. If you are unable to participate directly due to scheduling conflicts or other circumstances, you may be able to take materials home or contribute in another way. Please consult your child's teacher or the site coordinator for scheduling. Parent-teacher conferences are held at least twice per year. Teachers are also available to meet with you more often at your convenience to discuss your child's progress or address a concern that may arise. We encourage ongoing communication between the staff and parents. Please feel free to ask questions about our program, or make suggestions, which you feel would enrich your child's experience at school. The parent-teacher conference is a time to learn more about your child's activities in school, developmental progress and ways you can support your child's learning and readiness for kindergarten. Matters regarding child and parent conferences are to be kept confidential. Parent Advisory Committee (PAC) consists of parent representatives who meet at each ECEP center approximately once per month. They make recommendations regarding the operation of the program to the center director. They also may plan ceremonies, family activities, fundraising and other events. See your center director if you are interested in serving as a PAC representative.13 12 CODE OF CONDUCT FOR PARENTS When parents are volunteering, visiting classes or assisting with meal service or field trips, they are expected to: Treat children with respect, compassion and empathy Understand how to support children's rights Support an environment that promotes health and safety Model cooperation and concerned communication Promote children's self-esteem through positive guidance Respect children's choices and self-expression Lead child activities only in coordination with teaching staff Parents are expected to respect children's rights by not expressing physical affection or disciplining children other than their own. Please remember that it is the teacher's role to manage the classroom. If you are volunteering, check with the teacher for guidance and protocol. POLICIES AND PROCEDURES Arrival and Departure from the Classrooms Children must always be brought into the classroom by a parent or an authorized adult and be signed in. You must record the correct time and legibly sign your name on the signature page in the sign-in binder when you bring your child in and at the end of every day. We will ask you to provide us with a sample of the signatures that will be used to sign-in and sign-out your child from our program. Licensing requests that parents sign a full name, or first initial and last name. We encourage you to spend a few minutes in the classroom with your child before you leave for the day. Never leave your child unattended. Please inform the teacher of any medication or special circumstances that may affect your child during the day (e.g. poor night's sleep, upsetting event at home). If medication is provided, the child's name must be on every item and a current prescription is required for every item, including over-the-counter medicine, with a written doctor's note describing the procedure for staff. Please note that smoking and pets (other than classroom pets) are never allowed on the premises (medical alert dogs are the exception). Children are expected to arrive by 9:00 a.m. in order to participate in the organized learning activities, and so we can get an accurate count for lunch and snacks. If your child will be late or absent, please notify the classroom before 9:00 a.m. This allows us to accurately plan for meals and staffing. If your child will be out for a period of time (e.g. vacation or illness) you should notify your child's teacher. Please leave your child home if he/she is ill (see Policy Regarding Sick Children). Any absence of 5 or more consecutive days due to illness will require a doctor's note to return to school.Sign out at the end of the day and let staff know that you are taking your child home. Take a few minutes to look over your child's work and talk with the teacher about your child's day. Please do not leave your child unattended, once you have signed out. Anyone who is not known by the staff will be asked to show a valid driver's license or other photo identification. Persons not authorized by you on your child's emergency card will not be permitted to take your child from the center. Children will not be released to anyone under the age of 18, or to anyone who is suspected to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol or who may be considered a danger to the child. Those parents who may have custody issues should consult with an attorney regarding legal protection for their children. Parents must provide us with any court orders so that we can call the police to enforce their legal rights should the need arise. Late Pick-Up Our centers close promptly at 5:30 p.m. It is imperative that your child be picked up by the end of your child's class session for staffing reasons. Parents who pick up their children after the center closes, regardless of reason (traffic, etc.) will be assessed a late fee of $5.00 per minute. Excessive and/or continual late pick- up may lead to termination from the program. Staff have their own personal commitments to meet and need to leave on time. If you expect to be late picking up your child, call the center immediately. You will need to arrange for another approved adult to come for your child. Children left at the center a significant time after closing are considered, by state law, to be abandoned. We will make every attempt to call those persons listed on your Emergency Card if you haven't picked up your child or called the center. Check the program calendar for early closure dates and times.Rules for Driving/Riding Safety and Conduct All drivers should drive slowly and park only in legal curb-side or parking lot spaces. Do not double park or park in neighborhood driveways, restricted, handicapped and no parking (red) zones. It is against the law to leave children alone in parked cars. Also, do not leave purses or valuables in open or unlocked cars. Please respect the needs of all parents by making your time at drop off/ pick up as brief as possible. Please be aware of the parking options at your child's center. Each center may or may not have drop-off/pick-up areas designated and available for parents. ECEP is not responsible for any citations given to parents for parking violations. Most of our centers are easily accessible by public transit. Bicycle parking and stroller storage is also available at most sites. Child Safety Seats Children under 2 years of age shall ride in a rear-facing car seat unless the child weighs 40 or more pounds -or- is 40 or more inches tall. The child shall be secured in a manner that complies with the height and weight limits specified by the manufacturer of the car seat (California Vehicle Code Section 27360). Children under the age of 8 must be secured in a car seat or booster seat in the back seat. Pedestrian Safety Be aware that the University of California is a student environment with both experienced and inexperienced drivers and many distractions. Give the right of way to cars or bicyclists that may exhibit unsafe behavior such as speeding, rolling stops, ignoring traffic signs, etc. Look both ways before crossing the street. Watch for distracted drivers (cell phones, texting). Make eye contact with drivers prior to crossing. Be aware of your surroundings. Make sure you are in control of your child. NUTRITION PROGRAM & MEAL SERVICE Providing nutritious meals, snacks and introducing new foods to the children are important aspects of our nutrition program. As part of our curriculum, we do food preparation activities and teach basic nutrition information. Infants are provided with breast milk or formula and age appropriate baby foods. In our toddler and preschool programs, we serve breakfast, lunch and an afternoon snack. Parents who do not want to participate in our meal programs are welcome to provide lunch and snacks from home. Menus are posted in the centers and on our website (https://ece.berkeley.edu/menus). Meals and snacks must meet minimum requirements for food components and quantities under the USDA Child Care Food Program. Children are not allowed to bring \"junk food\" such as gum, donuts, chips or candy. For the safety of your child, you must indicate any food allergies on your child's medical form and bring a note from the child's doctor upon entrance to the program. Due to severe peanut allergies, our centers adopted a Zero Nut Policy. We do not serve any foods that contain nuts (e.g. peanut butter) or coconuts and discourage foods coming into the centers that contain nuts or coconut. BIRTHDAYS AND SPECIAL EVENTS Birthdays and holidays are special times for children and for our program. We encourage you to take part in the celebrations if you wish by bringing a treat (food item) for all of the children in the classroom. Please talk with your child's teacher in advance to find out what is appropriate to bring. Let the teachers know if it is your wish for your child not to celebrate events due to religious, cultural or other reasons. If you prefer that your child not participate in a planned activity (such as Halloween, birthdays or Valentine's Day), you should make other arrangements for the care of your child. Our teachers respect individual diversity, and will do their best to make your child comfortable in the classroom regardless of their participation in celebrations. CLOTHING AND NAP EQUIPMENT Dress your child for comfort and for active play. It is likely that your child will come home with dirty, painted or torn clothes at times. Children's freedom to play and learn is more important to us than clean, neat and tidy clothes at the end of their day. Children are required to bring a change of clothing to keep at the center. This will ensure that your child will have dry clothes available after water play or an accident that may occur during the day. Provide tennis shoes or other closed shoes so that your child may climb and run safely. Please be sure your child's shoes and In accordance with Federal law and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) policy, this institution is prohibited from discriminating on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, age, or disability. To file a complaint of discrimination, write USDA, Director, Office of Civil Rights, 1400 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, D.C. 20250-9410 or call 800-795-3272 or 202-720-6382 (TTY). USDA is an equal opportunity provider and employer. If you expect to be late picking up your child, call the classroom immediately. 15 14 clothing fit well, as poorly-fitting shoes and clothes can cause accidents. For safety reasons, open-toed, plastic, backless shoes, slippery soles, and thongs/flip flops are not allowed. Label the inside of your child's clothing with permanent ink or name labels (especially jackets, sweaters, gloves and hats). We encourage children to care for their clothing, but we do not take responsibility for clothing that is lost at the center. Occasionally, your child may wear another child's clothing or shoes home by mistake. If this should happen, please return the clothing the next day. All preschool and toddler children must either take an afternoon nap or rest quietly on cots/mats we provide. Each child is provided with a sheet for nap time. If your child has a special toy/pillow or blanket, please discuss this with the teacher in the classroom, and we will do our best to accommodate your needs. Children's Personal Belongings Your child may bring special items (toy, stuffed animal, photograph, etc.) to share on the teacher's designated Share Day. Talk with the teacher about the appropriateness of an item if you're not sure. Shared items will be stored in children's cubbies when not in use. Items in a child's cubby are limited to what will fit without touching items in the adjacent cubbies. Candy, gum, money, balloons, and violent toys (such as guns) must be left at home. We will not be held responsible for lost jewelry, toys, or other personal items. Children often take small things home with them to remind them of their school. If you find any small toys, Lego's, puzzle pieces or other items that belong to the school, please help your child return them to his/her classroom. CHILD ABUSE REPORTING Our staff is required to report to the University of California Police Department (UCPD) and Children's Protective Services any unusual marks or injuries on a child, and statements made by, or behavior of a child that may indicate abuse or neglect. Please understand that this is not an option for our staff. It is our obligation as mandated reporters (California Penal Code Section 11166) and all staff must sign forms indicating their understanding of the requirement. Our staff complete an online Mandated Reporter training course upon hire and also sign and follow UC Berkeley's CANRA policy. PREVENTION OF ILLNESS Young children in group settings tend to be exposed to colds and other contagious illnesses since they haven't developed immunities yet and are still learning good health habits. Most illnesses are spread by hand contact, not from cold weather. Hand washing has been shown to be the most effective means of keeping children and adults healthy. We help children to practice good habits of hand washing, using and disposing properly of tissues, covering the mouth when sneezing, etc. Families can assist by doing the same at home as well as by keeping the child home if they are showing symptoms of illness. Please thoroughly wash your hands and your child's hands when entering your child's classroom each day. POLICY REGARDING SICK CHILDREN California law (Section 81075.1) states: \"The licensee shall be responsible for ensuring that children with obvious symptoms of illness, including but not limited to fever or vomiting are not accepted...\" ECEP Policy: Children may not attend the program if: A. An illness prevents the child from participating comfortably in facility activities; B. An illness results in a greater care need than the child care staff can provide without compromising the health and safety of the other children; C. The illness poses a risk of spread of harmful diseases to others; or D. The child has any of the following conditions: a. Temperature: Oral temperature of 101\u00b0F (or ear 100.4\u00b0F) or greater; accompanied by behavior changes or other signs and symptoms of illness until medical evaluation indicates inclusion, or child is 24 hours fever free. b. Symptoms and signs of severe illness such as unusual lethargy, uncontrolled coughing, irritability, persistent crying, difficulty breathing, wheezing or other unusual signs until medical evaluation indicates inclusion. c. Uncontrolled diarrhea, that is, increased number of stools, increased liquid, or decreased form that is not contained in the diaper, until a normal bowel movement occurs. d. Vomiting illness (two or more episodes of vomiting in the previous 24 hours) until vomiting resolves or until a health provider determines the cause to be non-communicable, and the child is not in danger of dehydration. e. Mouth sores with drooling unless a healthcare provider or health official determines the condition is noninfectious. f. Rash with fever or behavior change, until a health care provider determines that these symptoms do not indicate a communicable disease. g. Scabies, head lice, or other infestation, until treatment has been initiated. For lice, head inspection at arrival must show child to be nit-free. h. Tuberculosis, or positive TB test result, until a health care provider or health official states that the child can attend child care. i. Impetigo (bacterial skin infection), until treatment has been initiated. j. Strep throat or other streptococcal infection, until 24 hours after antibiotic treatment of condition and 24 hr fever free. k.

Purulent conjunctivitis (defined as pink or red conjunctivitis with white or yellow discharge) until 24 hours after treatment has been initiated. s. Unspecified respiratory illness, severely ill children with the common cold, croup, bronchitis, pneumonia, and otitis media (ear infection). t. Respiratory syncytial virus, must be kept from infant and toddler classrooms until medically released by a physician. Children may return when no longer contagious. They must be able to participate in normal class activities including outdoor play. A child who appears to staff to show signs of illness may be excluded from class and may have to be taken home. Staff should communicate with parents through daily notes or posting exposure notices. It is our program policy to post exposure notices on classroom doors when we discover that children may have been exposed to a contagious illness at the center. Please check for these notices, since you will need to watch for symptoms in your child, and may want to consult with your doctor if you are pregnant regarding your exposure. In the very rare circumstance that a contagious outbreak occurs causing the majority of a classroom to be out sick at one time, the program reserves the right to close a classroom, to maintain the health and well being of other children/staff at that center. Please call your child's teacher by 9:00 a.m. if your child will be out for the day. Parents are required to call the center immediately to report contagious conditions. Any absence of 5 or more consecutive days due to illness will require a doctor's note to return to school.Clothing Reminders: Dress your child for comfort and for active play. Children are required to bring a change of clothing to keep at the center. Provide tennis shoes or other closed shoes Label the inside of your child's clothing 17 16 ECEP MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION POLICY ECEP follows the recommendations of both the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics. ECEP requires that parents/guardians assume the responsibility of administering any necessary medications their child may require and informing the teaching staff what they have been given prior to drop-off. We further expect that the first dose of any new medication given at home be observed at home so that side effects (i.e. drowsiness, diarrhea etc.) can be identified and communicated to us prior to care. We discourage the use of over the counter medications that only treat symptoms of illness, when a day or two of rest at home might be what is needed most. We do realize that during the long child care day we may need to administer some medications in your absence with a written doctor's note describing the procedure for staff. Medication Administered in All of Our Child Care Centers: 1) Medication Card signed and completed a) Requires Parent/Guardian to complete and sign an ECEP Medication Card and hand it directly to the child's teacher/caregiver together with the medication and an administration device (spoon, cup) with clearly marked measurements, if in liquid form. 2) Original labeled container 3) Requires that all medication must be in original, child-proof container and every item must be labeled with the child's name and stored out of reach of children a) Requires medication containers and dispensers will be stored out of the reach of children and in a lockable cabinet/ container, or refrigerator if necessary. 4) Maintain Written Records a) Requires a written record (on white card) of administration times, amount given and confirmation to the parent that the medication was given. Completed medication cards will be kept in the child's record file. 5) Medication Administered as Prescribed a) Requires prescription medication to be administered in accordance with the pharmacy label directions as prescribed by the child's health care provider. Instructions from the child's parent/guardian shall not conflict with the label directions as prescribed by a health care provider. If possible, parent/guardian should provide patient information sheets, available at the pharmacy, for each prescribed medication listing side effects and what to do if a dose is forgotten. 6) Written Procedures for Special Medications a) Requires special medications authorized by a health care provider's order for acute or chronic conditions such as allergic reactions and asthma should in addition to the above be accompanied by a written plan of administration, as well as step by step procedures for staff to follow in identifying reactions to be alert for in the child's behavior or physical condition. Special Community Care Licensing (CCL) forms for nebulizer/inhaled meds are available for parent/ guardian to complete at the center. 7) Permission Required for Over-the-Counter Medications a) Requires that non-prescription (over-the-counter) medications only be administered with approval or written instructions from the child's health care provider. The health care provider can provide this approval by fax or in writing to the center if necessary. OTC medications will only be dispensed in accordance with the product label directions. Instructions from the parent/guardian shall not conflict with above directions. 8) Returned or Disposed of when No Longer Needed a) When no longer needed by the child, or when the child withdraws from the program, all medications should be returned to the child's parent/guardian or disposed of after an attempt to reach a parent/guardian. Program Safeguards to Prevent Medication Errors Each classroom will assign a primary teacher, if possible, to administer medications at the specified time. This staff person will be designated to handle all medication administration and record keeping. Student staff will not dispense medication. A second staff person will be designated to confirm that administration occurred. All center personnel who administer medication to children will receive special training, as necessary, to assure safety is maintained. If a medication is crucial (i.e. prescription medication) and has been left at home, the parent/guardian will be required to bring it in before the child will be admitted for the day. Sunscreen and Topical Ointments Sunscreen, diaper creams, lotions, and insect repellent will be administered with the advance written & dated permission of parent/guardian. The child's name must also be labeled on these items. Sunscreen will be reapplied as needed. Handling Emergencies If a child becomes sick or is injured while at the center, parents will be notified immediately. If your child needs immediate medical attention and you cannot be reached by phone, a staff person will call 911 for immediate medical attention. It is important that you provide us with an up-to-date list of contacts for people who are available to pick up your child in case of emergency. For your child's health and safety, it is important that you notify us immediately if there are changes during the year in your work or home phone numbers or contact information for others listed on the emergency card. In the event of an earthquake or other major disaster, parents may not be able to contact the center by phone. Staff will remain with the children at the center until they are picked by you or an adult designated on the emergency card unless they have been evacuated from the center. A Center Disaster Plan is posted in each classroom, and fire and earthquake drills are conducted regularly with the children so they will know how to respond and follow instructions in emergency situations. Please become familiar with the evacuation location listed in your classroom in case of relocation of the center. Family emergency forms are also kept at the ECEP office, and list-serves for each center are created using the e-mail addresses from this list. Parents and staff may be sent information by e-mail in an emergency or regarding a health or safety issue concerning the center. We recommend that parents sign up for the UCB Warn Me alert system (https://warnme.berkeley.edu/). ECEP WELCOMES ALL CHILDREN, REGARDLESS OF DISABILITY. ECEP will make reasonable accommodations as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act in order to serve all children and their families. Children with special needs are encouraged to integrate into the classrooms. Please provide us with your child's Individualized Education Plan/Individualized Family Service Plan (IEP/IFSP) or other documentation regarding his/her special needs to help us provide the best services possible to meet his/ her needs. Children are accepted into the center as long as the staff is able to accommodate his/her needs.Reasonable accommodations, to meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, will include but are not limited to the following: Classrooms and bathrooms will be made accessible to all children and adults Equipment would be obtained to meet the physical, social and psychological needs of the child Meals would be served and prepared to meet the needs of individual children, including substitutions for food allergies and blending for children who cannot tolerate whole pieces Consultation with Speech, Mental Health Specialist or Educators will arranged when there is a concern about a child enrolled in ECEP ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT Enrollment is open to University faculty, staff, students and community members. Children and parents are welcome to all services regardless of sex, sexual orientation, gender, ethnic group identification, race, ancestry, national origin, religion, color, mental disability or physical disability. We are also open to full participation to families with limited English proficiency. As a public agency, our programs refrain from religious instruction and worship. Eligibility for subsidized spaces is determined by guidelines for state and federal funding sources (see More Information about State Subsidized Spaces (Financial Assistance)). We are required to obtain documentation from parents seeking to qualify for subsidized fees. Documentation may be requested to determine eligibility and need, including but not limited to: income verification (e.g. tax return), family size, birth certificates, place of residence, class schedules, verification of successful completion of classes and verification of employment. Availability of openings in our program is dependent on the following: Age of the child Family/program eligibility requirements Place on the waiting list Licensed capacity at the center19 18 PAYMENT OF FEES Fees are due on the 1st of each month, in advance of service, and are considered late if paid after the 5th of the month. Late fees will be charged at the rate of up to $50 per month for (full fee families) each month fees are delinquent. After 30 days, any unpaid fees will be subject to collection fees. Chronic late payment may result in termination of your child(ren)'s placement in our program. It is your responsibility to contact ECEP if you have not received a monthly invoice. PARENTS REQUESTING WITHDRAWAL If a child is withdrawn from the program at any time before the end of the ECEP school year for any reason, other than medical (in such a case a written note from a licensed medical provider stating that withdrawal from center-based childcare is recommended due to a child's serious illness or injury), parents must provide a minimum of 30-day advance written notice to both the center director and Admissions Coordinator. Email notification is highly recommended to ensure date and time notation. Please note that such a withdrawal automatically cancels the child's place for the next school year even if an advance payment was already made. EXCUSED ABSENCES Excused absences include: sickness of the child or sibling, sickness of parent, doctor's appointment, family emergencies (see below), quarantine, court ordered visitation (documentation required). Parent or teacher signature and specific reason for absence is required for all excused absences. BEST INTEREST DAYS Families (except Children's Protective Services referrals) may be allowed up to 10 best interest days per year. Best interest days include: 1. Vacation 2. Cultural holiday or events 3. Religious service or events 4. Spending time with grandparents, aunts, uncles 5. Special trips, museums, zoos, other cultural experiences or travel 6. Any day the child stays home and is not sick FAMILY EMERGENCY ABSENCES Family emergency absences are allowed only upon approval from the ECEP Executive Director. The Executive Director may extend the family emergency absence on a case by case basis. Family emergencies include, but may not be limited to: 1. Death or illness of child's close relative that would take the child out of the home. Be prepared to provide verification upon return to school, if requested. 2. Natural catastrophes (flood, fire, earthquake, etc.) 3. Transportation difficulty or car accidents 4. Funeral or memorial serviceUNEXCUSED ABSENCES Unexcused absences are days when the child does not attend the program and is not sick, is not using best interest days, nor has a family emergency. The program does not receive state reimbursement for unexcused absences. For this reason, the ECEP will not accept more than 3 unexcused absences per school year, and this may constitute grounds for termination. TERMINATION OF SERVICES Termination of services can occur for the following reasons: Failure to pay child care fees, including late pick-up fees, on a timely basis Aggressive or abusive behavior by a parent or child, either physical or verbal (ie: threats, slander, or obscene language) towards children, staff or other personnel Failure to adhere to UC Berkeley policies, to follow policies as outlined in the parent handbook, or to comply with Community Care Licensing requirements Failure to provide necessary documentation and paperwork as mandated by the government, funding sources or by our program Failure to provide verification of child's physical exam within 30 days or to provide updated immunization records as needed Fraud including falsifying any documentation presented to the program regarding eligibility Group program settings and activities are not appropriate for all children. If we determine that our program is not appropriate for a child or that the parent or child constitutes a safety or legal hazard to the child, other children, staff, or the program, we reserve the right to terminate services. UC Berkeley ECEP shall give a minimum of 14 calendar days notice of termination of services for subsidized families. Please refer to the Notice of Action form for a full explanation of the procedures for parent's to appeal.
