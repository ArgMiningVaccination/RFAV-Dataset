Specially designed to be ADA compliant & wheelchair accessible. The UCSB campus labyrinth is a place of calm that encourages meditation, reflection, and rejuvenation. The beautiful location of the labyrinth - on the bluff above the Pacific Ocean - invites an appreciation of nature in a very special way. There are sights, sounds, and scents of nature with tremendous restorative power. Hours: It is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Location: Located on the lagoon island via a path southeast of Manzanita Village, located on the southwest portion of the campus (see directions below with map). History: Labyrinths are ancient symbols that have been used by various cultures and religions around the world for more than 4,000 years. Many of their patterns are based on spirals and circles mirrored in nature. Some people come to contemplate questions or to simply relax, while other come during time of grief or loss, seeking solace. Unlike a maze, it has a single path in full view that lead to the center and back out the same way. There are no tricks or trap. This powerful process of moving toward the center and back out can provide an opportunity for the traveler to move mindfully, focus intentionally, open the heart, and find their center. Today, labyrinths are being used worldwide as a way to gain self-awareness and insight by encouraging meditation, self-reflection, and stress reduction. The practice of labyrinth walking integrates the body with the mind. They are open to all people as a non-denominational, cross-cultural blueprint for well-being. Instructions: - Reflect: Before entering the labyrinth, think about what you are grateful for and any questions or problems you wish to receive guidance on. - Release: As you slowly walk the path to the center, let go of any unwanted thoughts, feelings, attitudes, etc. that no longer serve you. Notice where your mind wanders and be mindful of bringing it back to the present moment. - Receive: Once in the center, meditate/pray/be silent as you receive what is there for you. - Return: When ready, follow the path out of the labyrinth. You may feel a sense of renewal. - Remember: Once out of the labyrinth, take a full, deep breath and a moment to reflect on your experience. All of the walks benefits may not unfold to you immediately. Continue to be mindful as your answers may come with time. There is no right or wrong way to walk the labyrinth; honor your own pace and process. Please respect the experience of others as they walk the labyrinth. Directions from Off-Campus: - Take the Los Carneros exit from the 101 and head towards the ocean side. - When Los Carneros ends in a \"T\" at El Colegio - turn left. - Once you are on campus, turn right on Ocean Road (by the event center) - There is public parking in Lot 23 (you will need to pay a fee). - Continue walking down Ocean Road after parking until you get to the walking path along the bluffs - turn left. - Follow the path and enjoy the walk. You will be going down some stairs and back up a small hill before getting to the labyrinth, which will be on your right.
