Vandenbroucke,* Erik von Elm, Douglas G. Altman,\u00a7 Peter C. G\u00f8tzsche,\u00b6 Cynthia D. Mulrow, /H20648Stuart J. Pocock,** Charles Poole, James J. Schlesselman, and Matthias Egger,\u00a7\u00a7 for the STROBE Initiative Abstract: Much medical research is observational. The reporting of observational studies is often of insufcient quality. Poor reportinghampers the assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of a studyand the generalizability of its results. Taking into account empiricalevidence and theoretical considerations, a group of methodologists,researchers, and editors developed the Strengthening the Reportingof Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) recommen-dations to improve the quality of reporting of observational studies. The STROBE Statement consists of a checklist of 22 items, which relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results anddiscussion sections of articles. Eighteen items are common to cohortstudies, case-control studies and cross-sectional studies and four arespecic to each of the three study designs. The STROBE Statementprovides guidance to authors about how to improve the reporting of observational studies and facilitates critical appraisal and interpre-tation of studies by reviewers, journal editors and readers. This explanatory and elaboration document is intended to en- hance the use, understanding, and dissemination of the STROBEStatement. The meaning and rationale for each checklist item arepresented. For each item, one or several published examples and,where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and meth-odological literature are provided. Examples of useful flow diagramsare also included. The STROBE Statement, this document, and theassociated web site (http://www.strobe-statement.org) should behelpful resources to improve reporting of observational research. (Epidemiology 2007;18: 805-835) Rational health care practices require knowledge about the etiology and pathogenesis, diagnosis, prognosis and treat- ment of diseases. Randomized trials provide valuable evidenceabout treatments and other interventions. However, much ofclinical or public health knowledge comes from observationalresearch. 1About nine of ten research papers published in clinical speciality journals describe observational research.2,3 The STROBE Statement Reporting of observational research is often not de- tailed and clear enough to assess the strengths and weak-nesses of the investigation. 4,5To improve the reporting of observational research, we developed a checklist of items thatshould be addressed: the Strengthening the Reporting ofObservational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement(Table 1). Items relate to title, abstract, introduction, meth-ods, results and discussion sections of articles. The STROBEStatement has recently been published in several journals. 6 Our aim is to ensure clear presentation of what was planned,done, and found in an observational study. We stress that therecommendations are not prescriptions for setting up orconducting studies, nor do they dictate methodology or man-date a uniform presentation. STROBE provides general reporting recommendations for descriptive observational studies and studies that investigateThe initial STROBE workshop was funded by the European Science Foundation (ESF). Additional funding was received from the Medical Research CouncilHealth Services Research Collaboration and the National Health ServicesResearch & Development Methodology Programme. The funders had norole in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, orpreparation of the manuscript.

We chose the present terminology be- cause it is in common use. Unfortunately, terminology is oftenused incorrectly 7or imprecisely.8In box 1 we describe the hallmarks of the three study designs. The Scope of Observational Research Observational studies serve a wide range of purposes: from reporting a rst hint of a potential cause of a disease, toverifying the magnitude of previously reported associations.Ideas for studies may arise from clinical observations or frombiologic insight. Ideas may also arise from informal looks atdata that lead to further explorations. Like a clinician who hasseen thousands of patients, and notes one that strikes herattention, the researcher may note something special in thedata. Adjusting for multiple looks at the data may not bepossible or desirable, 9but further studies to conrm or refute initial observations are often needed.10Existing data may be used to examine new ideas about potential causal factors, and may be sufcient for rejection or conrmation. In otherinstances, studies follow that are specically designed toovercome potential problems with previous reports. The latterstudies will gather new data and will be planned for thatpurpose, in contrast to analyses of existing data. This leads to diverse viewpoints, eg, on the merits of looking at subgroupsor the importance of a predetermined sample size. STROBEtries to accommodate these diverse uses of observational re-search\u2014from discovery to refutation or conrmation. Wherenecessary we will indicate in what circumstances specic rec-ommendations apply. How to Use This Paper This paper is linked to the shorter STROBE paper that introduced the items of the checklist in several journals,6and forms an integral part of the STROBE Statement. Our inten- tion is to explain how to report research well, not howresearch should be done. We offer a detailed explanation foreach checklist item. Each explanation is preceded by anexample of what we consider transparent reporting. This doesnot mean that the study from which the example was takenwas uniformly well reported or well done; nor does it meanthat its ndings were reliable, in the sense that they were laterconrmed by others: it only means that this particular itemwas well reported in that study. In addition to explanations Epidemiology \u007f Volume 18, Number 6, November 2007 STROBE Initiative \u00a9 2007 the authors 807and examples we included boxes with supplementary infor- mation. These are intended for readers who want to refreshtheir memories about some theoretical points, or be quicklyinformed about technical background details. A full under-standing of these points may require studying the textbooksor methodological papers that are cited. STROBE recommendations do not specically address topics such as genetic linkage studies, infectious diseasemodeling or case reports and case series. 11,12As many of the key elements in STROBE apply to these designs, authors who report such studies may nevertheless nd our recommenda-tions useful. For authors of observational studies that specif-ically address diagnostic tests, tumor markers and geneticassociations, STARD, 13REMARK,14and STREGA15rec- ommendations may be particularly useful. The Items in the STROBE Checklist We now discuss and explain the 22 items in the STROBE checklist (Table 1), and give published examplesfor each item. Some examples have been edited by removingcitations or spelling out abbreviations. Eighteen items applyto all three study designs whereas four are design-specic.Starred items (for example item 8*) indicate that the infor-mation should be given separately for cases and controls incase-control studies, or exposed and unexposed groups incohort and cross-sectional studies. We advise authors toaddress all items somewhere in their paper, but we do notprescribe a precise location or order. For instance, we discussthe reporting of results under a number of separate items,while recognizing that authors might address several itemswithin a single section of text or in a table. TITLE AND ABSTRACT 1(a) Indicate the Study's Design with a Commonly Used Term in the Title or theAbstract Example \"Leukemia incidence among workers in the shoe and boot manufacturing industry: a case-control study.\"18 Explanation Readers should be able to easily identify the design that was used from the title or abstract. An explicit, commonlyused term for the study design also helps ensure correctindexing of articles in electronic databases. 19,20 1(b) Provide in the Abstract an Informative and Balanced Summary of What was Done andWhat was Found Example \"Background: The expected survival of HIV-infected patients is of major public health interest.Objective: To estimate survival time and age-specic mortality rates of an HIV-infected population compared withthat of the general population. Design: Population-based cohort study.Setting: All HIV-infected persons receiving care in Denmark from 1995 to 2005. Patients: Each member of the nationwide Danish HIV Cohort Study was matched with as many as 99 persons fromthe general population according to sex, date of birth, andmunicipality of residence. Measurements: The authors computed Kaplan-Meier life tables with age as the time scale to estimate survival fromage 25 years. Patients with HIV infection and correspondingpersons from the general population were observed from thedate of the patient's HIV diagnosis until death, emigration, or1 May 2005. Results: 3990 HIV-infected patients and 379 872 per- sons from the general population were included in the study,yielding 22 744 (median, 5.8 y/person) and 2 689 287(median, 8.4 years/person) person-years of observation.Three percent of participants were lost to follow-up. Fromage 25 years, the median survival was 19.9 years (95% CI,18.5 to 21.3) among patients with HIV infection and 51.1years (CI, 50.9 to 51.5) among the general population. ForHIV-infected patients, survival increased to 32.5 years (CI,29.4 to 34.7) during the 2000 to 2005 period. In the subgroupthat excluded persons with known hepatitis C coinfection(16%), median survival was 38.9 years (CI, 35.4 to 40.1)during this same period. The relative mortality rates forpatients with HIV infection compared with those for thegeneral population decreased with increasing age, whereasthe excess mortality rate increased with increasing age. Limitations: The observed mortality rates are as- sumed to apply beyond the current maximum observationtime of 10 years. Conclusions: The estimated median survival is more than 35 years for a young person diagnosed with HIV infection in the late highly active antiretroviral therapy era.However, an ongoing effort is still needed to further reducemortality rates for these persons compared with the generalpopulation.\" 21 Explanation The abstract provides key information that enables readers to understand a study and decide whether to read thearticle. Typical components include a statement of the re-search question, a short description of methods and results,and a conclusion. 22Abstracts should summarize key details of studies and should only present information that is pro- vided in the article. We advise presenting key results in anumerical form that includes numbers of participants, esti-mates of associations and appropriate measures of variabilityand uncertainty (eg, odds ratios with condence intervals).Vandenbroucke et al Epidemiology \u007f Volume 18, Number 6, November 2007 \u00a9 2007 the authors 808We regard it insufcient to state only that an exposure is or is not signicantly associated with an outcome. A series of headings pertaining to the background, design, conduct, and analysis of a study may help readers acquire theessential information rapidly. 23Many journals require such structured abstracts, which tend to be of higher quality and more readily informative than unstructured summaries.24,25 INTRODUCTION The Introduction section should describe why the study was done and what questions and hypotheses it addresses. Itshould allow others to understand the study's context andjudge its potential contribution to current knowledge. 2 Background/Rationale: Explain the Scientific Background and Rationale for theInvestigation Being Reported Example \"Concerns about the rising prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents have focused on the well docu-mented associations between childhood obesity and increasedcardiovascular risk and mortality in adulthood. Childhoodobesity has considerable social and psychological conse-quences within childhood and adolescence, yet little is knownabout social, socioeconomic, and psychological consequences inadult life. A recent systematic review found no longitudinalstudies on the outcomes of childhood obesity other than physicalhealth outcomes and only 2 longitudinal studies of the socio-economic effects of obesity in adolescence. Gortmaker et alfound that US women who had been obese in late adolescencein 1981 were less likely to be married and had lower incomesseven years later than women who had not been overweight,while men who had been overweight were less likely to bemarried. Sargent et al found that UK women, but not men, whohad been obese at 16 years in 1974 earned 7.4% less than theirnonobese peers at age 23. (. . .) We used longitudinal data fromthe 1970 British birth cohort to examine the adult socioeco-nomic, educational, social, and psychological outcomes of child-hood obesity.\" 26 Explanation The scientic background of the study provides impor- tant context for readers. It sets the stage for the study anddescribes its focus. It gives an overview of what is known ona topic and what gaps in current knowledge are addressed bythe study. Background material should note recent pertinentstudies and any systematic reviews of pertinent studies. 3 Objectives: State Specific Objectives, Including Any Prespecified Hypotheses Example \"Our primary objectives were to 1) determine the prev- alence of domestic violence among female patients present-ing to four community-based, primary care, adult medicinepractices that serve patients of diverse socioeconomic back- ground and 2) identify demographic and clinical differencesbetween currently abused patients and patients not currentlybeing abused.\" 27 Explanation Objectives are the detailed aims of the study. Well crafted objectives specify populations, exposures and out-comes, and parameters that will be estimated. They may beformulated as specic hypotheses or as questions that thestudy was designed to address. In some situations objectivesmay be less specic, for example, in early discovery phases.Regardless, the report should clearly reflect the investigators'intentions. For example, if important subgroups or additionalanalyses were not the original aim of the study but aroseduring data analysis, they should be described accordingly(see also items 4, 17 and 20). METHODS The Methods section should describe what was planned and what was done in sufcient detail to allow others tounderstand the essential aspects of the study, to judgewhether the methods were adequate to provide reliable andvalid answers, and to assess whether any deviations from theoriginal plan were reasonable. 4 Study Design: Present Key Elements of Study Design Early in the Paper Example \"We used a case-crossover design, a variation of a case-control design that is appropriate when a brief exposure(driver's phone use) causes a transient rise in the risk of a rareoutcome (a crash). We compared a driver's use of a mobilephone at the estimated time of a crash with the same driver'suse during another suitable time period. Because drivers aretheir own controls, the design controls for characteristics ofthe driver that may affect the risk of a crash but do not changeover a short period of time. As it is important that risks duringcontrol periods and crash trips are similar, we comparedphone activity during the hazard interval (time immediatelybefore the crash) with phone activity during control intervals(equivalent times during which participants were driving butdid not crash) in the previous week.\" 28 Explanation We advise presenting key elements of study design early in the methods section (or at the end of the introduction)so that readers can understand the basics of the study. Forexample, authors should indicate that the study was a cohortstudy, which followed people over a particular time period,and describe the group of persons that comprised the cohortand their exposure status. Similarly, if the investigation useda case-control design, the cases and controls and their sourcepopulation should be described. If the study was a cross-Epidemiology \u007f Volume 18, Number 6, November 2007 STROBE Initiative \u00a9 2007 the authors 809sectional survey, the population and the point in time at which the cross-section was taken should be mentioned.When a study is a variant of the three main study types, thereis an additional need for clarity. For instance, for a case-crossover study, one of the variants of the case-control design, a succinct description of the principles was given in the exampleabove. 28 We recommend that authors refrain from simply calling a study 'prospective' or 'retrospective' because these termsare ill dened. 29One usage sees cohort and prospective as synonymous and reserves the word retrospective for case- control studies.30A second usage distinguishes prospective and retrospective cohort studies according to the timing of data collection relative to when the idea for the study wasdeveloped. 31A third usage distinguishes prospective and retrospective case-control studies depending on whether the data about the exposure of interest existed when cases wereselected. 32Some advise against using these terms,33or adopt - ing the alternatives 'concurrent' and 'historical' for describ-ing cohort studies. 34In STROBE, we do not use the words prospective and retrospective, nor alternatives such as con- current and historical. We recommend that, whenever authorsuse these words, they dene what they mean. Most impor-tantly, we recommend that authors describe exactly how andwhen data collection took place. The rst part of the methods section might also be the place to mention whether the report is one of several from astudy. If a new report is in line with the original aims of thestudy, this is usually indicated by referring to an earlierpublication and by briefly restating the salient features of thestudy. However, the aims of a study may also evolve overtime. Researchers often use data for purposes for which theywere not originally intended, including, for example, ofcialvital statistics that were collected primarily for administrativepurposes, items in questionnaires that originally were onlyincluded for completeness, or blood samples that were col-lected for another purpose. For example, the Physicians'Health Study, a randomized controlled trial of aspirin andcarotene, was later used to demonstrate that a point mutationin the factor V gene was associated with an increased risk ofvenous thrombosis but not of myocardial infarction orstroke. 35The secondary use of existing data is a creative part of observational research and does not necessarily make results less credible or less important. However, briefly re-stating the original aims might help readers understand thecontext of the research and possible limitations in the data. 5 Setting: Describe the Setting, Locations, and Relevant Dates, Including Periods ofRecruitment, Exposure, Follow-up, and DataCollection Example \"The Pasitos Cohort Study recruited pregnant women from Women, Infant and Child clinics in Socorro and SanElizario, El Paso County, Texas and maternal-child clinics of the Mexican Social Security Institute in Ciudad Juarez, Mex-ico from April 1998 to October 2000. At baseline, prior to thebirth of the enrolled cohort children, staff interviewed moth-ers regarding the household environment. In this ongoingcohort study, we target follow-up exams at 6-month intervalsbeginning at age 6 months.\" 36 Explanation Readers need information on setting and locations to assess the context and generalizability of a study's results.Exposures such as environmental factors and therapies canchange over time. Also, study methods may evolve over time.Knowing when a study took place and over what periodparticipants were recruited and followed up places the studyin historical context and is important for the interpretation ofresults. Information about setting includes recruitment sites or sources (eg, electoral roll, outpatient clinic, cancer registry, ortertiary care centre). Information about location may refer tothe countries, towns, hospitals or practices where the inves-tigation took place. We advise stating dates rather than onlydescribing the length of time periods. There may be differentsets of dates for exposure, disease occurrence, recruitment,beginning and end of follow-up, and data collection. Of note,nearly 80% of 132 reports in oncology journals that usedsurvival analysis included the starting and ending dates foraccrual of patients, but only 24% also reported the date onwhich follow-up ended. 37 6 Participants: 6(a) Cohort Study: Give the Eligibility Criteria,and the Sources and Methods of Selection ofParticipants. Describe Methods of Follow-up Example \"Participants in the Iowa Women's Health Study were a random sample of all women ages 55 to 69 years derived fromthe state of Iowa automobile driver's license list in 1985, whichrepresented approximately 94% of Iowa women in that agegroup. (. . .) Follow-up questionnaires were mailed in October1987 and August 1989 to assess vital status and address changes.(. . .) Incident cancers, except for nonmelanoma skin cancers,were ascertained by the State Health Registry of Iowa (. . .). TheIowa Women's Health Study cohort was matched to the registrywith combinations of rst, last, and maiden names, zip code,birthdate, and social security number.\" 38 6(a) Case-Control Study: Give the Eligibility Criteria, and the Sources and Methods of CaseAscertainment and Control Selection. Give TheRationale for the Choice of Cases and Controls Example \"Cutaneous melanoma cases diagnosed in 1999 and 2000 were ascertained through the Iowa Cancer RegistryVandenbroucke et al Epidemiology \u007f Volume 18, Number 6, November 2007 \u00a9 2007 the authors 810(. . .). Controls, also identied through the Iowa Cancer Registry, were colorectal cancer patients diagnosed duringthe same time. Colorectal cancer controls were selectedbecause they are common and have a relatively long survival,and because arsenic exposure has not been conclusivelylinked to the incidence of colorectal cancer.\" 39 6 (a) Cross-Sectional Study: Give the Eligibility Criteria, and the Sources and Methods ofSelection of Participants Example \"We retrospectively identied patients with a principal diagnosis of myocardial infarction (code 410) according tothe International Classication of Diseases, 9th Revision,Clinical Modication, from codes designating discharge di-agnoses, excluding the codes with a fth digit of 2, whichdesignates a subsequent episode of care (. . .). A randomsample of the entire Medicare cohort with myocardial infarc-tion from February 1994 to July 1995 was selected (. . .). Tobe eligible, patients had to present to the hospital after at least30 minutes but less than 12 hours of chest pain and had tohave ST-segment elevation of at least 1 mm on two contig-uous leads on the initial electrocardiogram.\" 40 Explanation Detailed descriptions of the study participants help readers understand the applicability of the results. Investiga-tors usually restrict a study population by dening clinical,demographic and other characteristics of eligible participants.Typical eligibility criteria relate to age, gender, diagnosis andcomorbid conditions. Despite their importance, eligibilitycriteria often are not reported adequately. In a survey ofobservational stroke research, 17 of 49 reports (35%) did notspecify eligibility criteria. 5 Eligibility criteria may be presented as inclusion and exclusion criteria, although this distinction is not alwaysnecessary or useful. Regardless, we advise authors to reportall eligibility criteria and also to describe the group fromwhich the study population was selected (eg, the generalpopulation of a region or country), and the method of recruit-ment (eg, referral or self-selection through advertisements). Knowing details about follow-up procedures, including whether procedures minimized nonresponse and loss to fol-low-up and whether the procedures were similar for allparticipants, informs judgments about the validity of results.For example, in a study that used IgM antibodies to detectacute infections, readers needed to know the interval betweenblood tests for IgM antibodies so that they could judgewhether some infections likely were missed because theinterval between blood tests was too long. 41In other studies where follow-up procedures differed between exposed and unexposed groups, readers might recognize substantial biasdue to unequal ascertainment of events or differences innonresponse or loss to follow-up. 42Accordingly, we advisethat researchers describe the methods used for following participants and whether those methods were the same for allparticipants, and that they describe the completeness of as-certainment of variables (see also item 14). In case-control studies, the choice of cases and controls is crucial to interpreting the results, and the method of theirselection has major implications for study validity. In general,controls should reflect the population from which the casesarose. Various methods are used to sample controls, all withadvantages and disadvantages: for cases that arise from ageneral population, population roster sampling, random digitdialling, neighborhood or friend controls are used. Neighbor-hood or friend controls may present intrinsic matching onexposure. 17Controls with other diseases may have advan - tages over population-based controls, in particular for hospi-tal-based cases, because they better reflect the catchmentpopulation of a hospital, have greater comparability of recalland ease of recruitment. However, they can present problemsif the exposure of interest affects the risk of developing orbeing hospitalized for the control condition(s). 43,44To rem - edy this problem often a mixture of the best defensiblecontrol diseases is used. 45 6(b) Cohort Study: For Matched Studies, Give Matching Criteria and Number of Exposed andUnexposed Example \"For each patient who initially received a statin, we used propensity-based matching to identify one control whodid not receive a statin according to the following protocol.First, propensity scores were calculated for each patient in theentire cohort on the basis of an extensive list of factors poten-tially related to the use of statins or the risk of sepsis. Second,each statin user was matched to a smaller pool of nonstatin-usersby sex, age (plus or minus 1 year), and index date (plus or minus3 months). Third, we selected the control with the closestpropensity score (within 0.2 SD) to each statin user in a 1:1fashion and discarded the remaining controls.\" 46 6(b) Case-Control Study: For Matched Studies, Give Matching Criteria and the Number ofControls Per Case Example \"We aimed to select ve controls for every case from among individuals in the study population who had no diagnosisof autism or other pervasive developmental disorders (PDD)recorded in their general practice record and who were alive andregistered with a participating practice on the date of the PDDdiagnosis in the case. Controls were individually matched tocases by year of birth (up to 1 year older or younger), sex, andgeneral practice. For each of 300 cases, ve controls could beidentied who met all the matching criteria. For the remaining994, one or more controls was excluded . . .\" 47Epidemiology \u007f Volume 18, Number 6, November 2007 STROBE Initiative \u00a9 2007 the authors 811Explanation Matching is much more common in case-control studies, but occasionally, investigators use matching in cohort studies tomake groups comparable at the start of follow-up. Matching incohort studies presents fewer intricacies than with case-controlstudies. For example, it is not necessary to take the matching intoaccount for the estimation of the relative risk. 48Because match - ing in cohort studies may increase statistical precision investi-gators might allow for the matching in their analyses and thusobtain narrower condence intervals. In case-control studies matching is done to increase a study's efciency by ensuring similarity in the distribution ofvariables between cases and controls, in particular the distribu-tion of potential confounding variables. 48,49Because matching can be done in various ways, with one or more controls per case, the rationale for the choice of matching variables and the detailsof the method used should be described. Commonly used formsof matching are frequency matching (also called group matching)and individual matching. In frequency matching, investigatorschoose controls so that the distribution of matching variables be-comes identical or similar to that of cases. Individual matchinginvolves matching one or several controls to each case. Although intuitively appealing and sometimes useful, matching in case-con-trol studies has a number of disadvantages, is not always appropri-ate, and needs to be taken into account in the analysis (see box 2). Even apparently simple matching procedures may be poorly reported. For example, authors may state that controlswere matched to cases 'within ve years', or using 've year agebands'. Does this mean that, if a case was 54 years old, therespective control needed to be in the ve-year age band 50 to54, or aged 49 to 59, which is within ve years of age 54? If awide (eg, 10-year) age band is chosen, there is a danger ofresidual confounding by age (see also box 4), for examplebecause controls may then be younger than cases on average. 7 Variables: Clearly Define All Outcomes, Exposures, Predictors, Potential Confounders,and Effect Modifiers. Give Diagnostic Criteria,If Applicable Example \"Only major congenital malformations were included in the analyses. M inor anomalies were excluded according to Vandenbroucke et al Epidemiology \u007f Volume 18, Number 6, November 2007 \u00a9 2007 the authors 812the exclusion list of European Registration of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT). If a child had more than onemajor congenital malformation of one organ system, thosemalformations were treated as one outcome in the analysesby organ system (. . .). In the statistical analyses, factorsconsidered potential confounders were maternal age atdelivery and number of previous parities. Factors consid-ered potential effect modiers were maternal age at reim-bursement for antiepileptic medication and maternal age atdelivery.\" 55 Explanation Authors should dene all variables considered for and included in the analysis, including outcomes, exposures,predictors, potential confounders and potential effect modi-ers. Disease outcomes require adequately detailed descrip-tion of the diagnostic criteria. This applies to criteria for casesin a case-control study, disease events during follow-up in acohort study and prevalent disease in a cross-sectional study.Clear denitions and steps taken to adhere to them areparticularly important for any disease condition of primaryinterest in the study. For some studies, 'determinant' or 'predictor' may be appropriate terms for exposure variables and outcomes maybe called 'endpoints'. In multivariable models, authors some-times use 'dependent 'indepen-dent variable' or 'explanatory variable' for exposure andconfounding variables. The latter is not precise as it does notdistinguish exposures from confounders. If many variables have been measured and included in exploratory analyses in an early discovery phase, considerproviding a list with details on each variable in an appendix,additional table or separate publication. Of note, the Interna- tional Journal of Epidemiology recently launched a new section with 'cohort proles', that includes detailed informa-tion on what was measured at different points in time inparticular studies. 56,57Finally, we advise that authors declare all 'candidate variables' considered for statistical analysis, rather than selectively reporting only those included in thenal models (see also item 16a). 58,59 8 Data Sources/Measurement: For Each Variable of Interest Give Sources of Data and Details ofMethods of Assessment (Measurement).Describe Comparability of Assessment MethodsIf There is More Than One Group Example 1 \"Total caffeine intake was calculated primarily using US Department of Agriculture food composition sources. In thesecalculations, it was assumed that the content of caffeine was 137mg per cup of coffee, 47 mg per cup of tea, 46 mg per can orbottle of cola beverage, and 7 mg per serving of chocolatecandy. This method of measuring (caffeine) intake was shown tobe valid in both the NHS I cohort and a similar cohort study ofmale health professionals (. . .). Self-reported diagnosis of hy- pertension was found to be reliable in the NHS I cohort.\" 60 Example 2 \"Cases and controls were always analyzed together in the same batch and laboratory personnel were unable todistinguish among cases and controls.\" 61 Explanation The way in which exposures, confounders and out- comes were measured affects the reliability and validity of astudy. Measurement error and misclassication of exposuresor outcomes can make it more difcult to detect cause-effectrelationships, or may produce spurious relationships. Error inmeasurement of potential confounders can increase the risk ofresidual confounding. 62,63It is helpful, therefore, if authors report the ndings of any studies of the validity or reliability of assessments or measurements, including details of thereference standard that was used. Rather than simply citingvalidation studies (as in the rst example), we advise thatauthors give the estimated validity or reliability, which canthen be used for measurement error adjustment or sensitivityanalyses (see items 12e and 17). In addition, it is important to know if groups being compared differed with respect to the way in which the datawere collected. This may be important for laboratory exam-inations (as in the second example) and other situations. Forinstance, if an interviewer rst questions all the cases andthen the controls, or vice versa, bias is possible because of thelearning curve; solutions such as randomizing the order ofinterviewing may avoid this problem. Information bias mayalso arise if the compared groups are not given the samediagnostic tests or if one group receives more tests of thesame kind than another (see also item 9). 9 Bias: Describe Any Efforts to Address Potential Sources of Bias Example 1 \"In most case-control studies of suicide, the control group comprises living individuals but we decided to have acontrol group of people who had died of other causes (. . .).With a control group of deceased individuals, the sources ofinformation used to assess risk factors are informants whohave recently experienced the death of a family member orclose associate - and are therefore more comparable to thesources of information in the suicide group than if livingcontrols were used.\" 64 Example 2 \"Detection bias could influence the association be- tween Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and primaryopen-angle glaucoma (POAG) if closer ophthalmic surveillance than women withoutthis condition. We compared the mean number of eyeEpidemiology \u007f Volume 18, Number 6, November 2007 STROBE Initiative \u00a9 2007 the authors 813examinations reported by women with and without diabe- tes. We also recalculated the relative risk for POAG withadditional control for covariates associated with morecareful ocular surveillance (a self-report of cataract, mac-ular degeneration, number of eye examinations, and num-ber of physical examinations).\" 65 Explanation Biased studies produce results that differ systematically from the truth (see also box 3). It is important for a reader toknow what measures were taken during the conduct of astudy to reduce the potential of bias. Ideally, investigatorscarefully consider potential sources of bias when they plantheir study. At the stage of reporting, we recommend thatauthors always assess the likelihood of relevant biases. Spe-cically, the direction and magnitude of bias should bediscussed and, if possible, estimated. For instance, in case-control studies information bias can occur, but may bereduced by selecting an appropriate control group, as in therst example. 64Differences in the medical surveillance of participants were a problem in the second example.65 Consequently, the authors provide more detail about the addi- tional data they collected to tackle this problem. When investi-gators have set up quality control programs for data collection tocounter a possible \"drift\" in measurements of variables in lon-gitudinal studies, or to keep variability at a minimum when multiple observers are used, these should be described. Unfortunately, authors often do not address important biases when reporting their results. Among 43 case-controland cohort studies published from 1990 to 1994 that inves-tigated the risk of second cancers in patients with a history ofcancer, medical surveillance bias was mentioned in only 5articles. 66A survey of reports of mental health research published during 1998 in 3 psychiatric journals found that only 13% of 392 articles mentioned response bias.67A survey of cohort studies in stroke research found that 14 of 49 (28%) articles published from 1999 to 2003 addressed potentialselection bias in the recruitment of study participants and 35(71%) mentioned the possibility that any type of bias mayhave affected results. 5 10 Study Size: Explain How the Study Size was Arrived at Example 1 \"The number of cases in the area during the study period determined the sample size.\"73 Example 2 \"A survey of postnatal depression in the region had documented a prevalence of 19.8%. Assuming depression in Vandenbroucke et al Epidemiology \u007f Volume 18, Number 6, November 2007 \u00a9 2007 the authors 814mothers with normal weight children to be 20% and an odds ratio of 3 for depression in mothers with a malnourished childwe needed 72 case-control sets (one case to one control) withan 80% power and 5% signicance.\" 74 Explanation A study should be large enough to obtain a point estimate with a sufciently narrow condence interval tomeaningfully answer a research question. Large samplesare needed to distinguish a small association from noassociation. Small studies often provide valuable informa-tion, but wide condence intervals may indicate that theycontribute less to current knowledge in comparison withstudies providing estimates with narrower condence in-tervals. Also, small studies that show 'interesting' or'statistically signicant' associations are published morefrequently than small studies that do not have 'signicant'ndings. While these studies may provide an early signalin the context of discovery, readers should be informed oftheir potential weaknesses. The importance of sample size determination in obser- vational studies depends on the context. If an analysis isperformed on data that were already available for otherpurposes, the main question is whether the analysis of thedata will produce results with sufcient statistical precision tocontribute substantially to the literature, and sample sizeconsiderations will be informal. Formal, a priori calculationof sample size may be useful when planning a new study. 75,76 Such calculations are associated with more uncertainty thanimplied by the single number that is generally produced. Forexample, estimates of the rate of the event of interest or otherassumptions central to calculations are commonly imprecise,if not guesswork. 77The precision obtained in the nal anal - ysis can often not be determined beforehand because it willbe reduced by inclusion of confounding variables in multi-variable analyses, 78the degree of precision with which key variables can be measured,79and the exclusion of some individuals. Few epidemiological studies explain or report deliber- ations about sample size.4,5We encourage investigators to report pertinent formal sample size calculations if they were done. In other situations they should indicate the consider-ations that determined the study size (eg, a xed availablesample, as in the rst example above). If the observationalstudy was stopped early when statistical signicance wasachieved, readers should be told. Do not bother readers withpost hoc justications for study size or retrospective powercalculations. 77From the point of view of the reader, con - dence intervals indicate the statistical precision that wasultimately obtained. It should be realized that condenceintervals reflect statistical uncertainty only, and not all uncer-tainty that may be present in a study (see item 20).11 Quantitative Variables: Explain How Quantitative Variables were Handled in theAnalyses. If Applicable, Describe WhichGroupings Were Chosen, and Why Example \"Patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) less than 8 are considered to be seriously injured. A GCS of 9 or moreindicates less serious brain injury. We examined the associ-ation of GCS in these two categories with the occurrence ofdeath within 12 months from injury.\" 80 Explanation Investigators make choices regarding how to collect and analyse quantitative data about exposures, effect modi-ers and confounders. For example, they may group a con-tinuous exposure variable to create a new categorical variable(see box 4). Grouping choices may have important conse-quences for later analyses. 81,82We advise that authors explain why and how they grouped quantitative data, including the number of categories, the cut-points, and category mean ormedian values. Whenever data are reported in tabular form,the counts of cases, controls, persons at risk, person-time atrisk, etc. should be given for each category. Tables should notconsist solely of effect-measure estimates or results of modeltting. Investigators might model an exposure as continuous in order to retain all the information. In making this choice, oneneeds to consider the nature of the relationship of the expo-sure to the outcome. As it may be wrong to assume a linearrelation automatically, possible departures from linearityshould be investigated. Authors could mention alternativemodels they explored during analyses (eg, using log trans-formation, quadratic terms or spline functions). Several meth-ods exist for tting a nonlinear relation between the exposureand outcome. 82-84Also, it may be informative to present both continuous and grouped analyses for a quantitative exposure of prime interest. In a recent survey, two thirds of epidemiological pub- lications studied quantitative exposure variables.4In 42 of 50 articles (84%) exposures were grouped into several ordered categories, but often without any stated rationale for thechoices made. Fifteen articles used linear associations tomodel continuous exposure but only 2 reported checking forlinearity. In another survey, of the psychological literature,dichotomization was justied in only 22 of 110 articles(20%). 85 12 Statistical Methods: 12 (a) Describe all statistical methods, including those used to control for confounding. Example \"The adjusted relative risk was calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel technique, when evaluating if confoundingEpidemiology \u007f Volume 18, Number 6, November 2007 STROBE Initiative \u00a9 2007 the authors 815by age or gender was present in the groups compared. The 95% condence interval (CI) was computed around the ad-justed relative risk, using the variance according to Greenlandand Robins and Robins et al.\" 93 Explanation In general, there is no one correct statistical analysis but, rather, several possibilities that may address the samequestion, but make different assumptions. Regardless, inves-tigators should pre-determine analyses at least for the primarystudy objectives in a study protocol. Often additional analy-ses are needed, either instead of, or as well as, those origi-nally envisaged, and these may sometimes be motivated bythe data. When a study is reported, authors should tell readerswhether particular analyses were suggested by data inspec-tion. Even though the distinction between pre-specied andexploratory analyses may sometimes be blurred, authorsshould clarify reasons for particular analyses. If groups being compared are not similar with regard to some characteristics, adjustment should be made for possibleconfounding variables by stratication or by multivariableregression (see box 5). 94Often, the study design determines which type of regression analysis is chosen. For instance, Cox proportional hazard regression is commonly used in cohortstudies, 95whereas logistic regression is often the method of choice in case-control studies.96,97Analysts should fully describe specic procedures for variable selection and notonly present results from the nal model.98,99If model comparisons are made to narrow down a list of potential confounders for inclusion in a nal model, this processshould be described. It is helpful to tell readers if one or twocovariates are responsible for a great deal of the apparentconfounding in a data analysis. Other statistical analyses suchas imputation procedures, data transformation, and calcula-tions of attributable risks should also be described. Nonstand-ard or novel approaches should be referenced and the statis-tical software used reported. As a guiding principle, weadvise statistical methods be described \"with enough detail toenable a knowledgeable reader with access to the originaldata to verify the reported results.\" 100 In an empirical study, only 93 of 169 articles (55%) reporting adjustment for confounding clearly stated howcontinuous and multi-category variables were entered intothe statistical model. 101Another study found that among 67 articles in which statistical analyses were adjusted for confounders, it was mostly unclear how confounders werechosen. 4 12 (b) Describe Any Methods Used to Examine Subgroups and Interactions Example \"Sex differences in susceptibility to the 3 lifestyle-related risk factors studied were explored by testing for biologicalinteraction according to Rothman: a new composite variable Vandenbroucke et al Epidemiology \u007f Volume 18, Number 6, November 2007 \u00a9 2007 the authors 816with 4 categories /H20849a/H11002b/H11002,a/H11002b/H11001,a/H11001b/H11002, and a/H11001b/H11001/H20850was rede- ned for sex and a dichotomous exposure of interest wherea /H11002andb/H11002denote absence of exposure. RR was calculated for each category after adjustment for age. An interaction effect isdened as departure from additivity of absolute effects, andexcess RR caused by interaction (RERI) was calculated: RERI/H11005RR/H20849a /H11001b/H11001/H20850/H11002RR/H20849a/H11002b/H11001/H20850/H11002RR/H20849a/H11001b/H11002/H20850/H110021 where RR /H20849a/H11001b/H11001/H20850denotes RR among those exposed to both factors where RR /H20849a/H11002b/H11002/H20850is used as reference cate- gory (RR /H110051.0). Ninety-ve percent CIs were calculated as by Hosmer and Lemeshow. RERI of 0 meansno interaction.\" 103 Explanation As discussed in detail under item 17, many debate the use and value of analyses restricted to subgroups of the studypopulation. 4,104Subgroup analyses are nevertheless often done.4Readers need to know which subgroup analyses were planned in advance, and which arose while analyzing the data. Also, it is important to explain what methods were usedto examine whether effects or associations differed acrossgroups (see item 17). Interaction relates to the situation when one factor modies the effect of another (therefore also called 'effectmodication'). The joint action of two factors can be char-acterized in two ways: on an additive scale, in terms of riskdifferences; or on a multiplicative scale, in terms of relativerisk (see box 8). Many authors and readers may have theirown preference about the way interactions should be ana-lyzed. Still, they may be interested to know to what extent thejoint effect of exposures differs from the separate effects. There is consensus that the additive scale, which uses abso-lute risks, is more appropriate for public health and clinicaldecision making. 105Whatever view is taken, this should be clearly presented to the reader, as is done in the example above.103A lay-out presenting separate effects of both expo - sures as well as their joint effect, each relative to no exposure,might be most informative. It is presented in the example forinteraction under item 17, and the calculations on the differ-ent scales are explained in box 8. 12 (c) Explain How Missing Data were Addressed Example \"Our missing data analysis procedures used missing at random (MAR) assumptions. We used the MICE (multivariateimputation by chained equations) method of multiple multivar-iate imputation in STATA. We independently analyzed 10copies of the data, each with missing values suitably imputed, inthe multivariate logistic regression analyses. We averaged esti-mates of the variables to give a single mean estimate andadjusted standard errors according to Rubin's rules.\" 106 Explanation Missing data are common in observational research. Questionnaires posted to study participants are not alwayslled in completely, participants may not attend all follow-upvisits and routine data sources and clinical databases are oftenincomplete. Despite its ubiquity and importance, few papersreport in detail on the problem of missing data. 5,107Investi - gators may use any of several approaches to address missing Epidemiology \u007f Volume 18, Number 6, November 2007 STROBE Initiative \u00a9 2007 the authors 817data. We describe some strengths and limitations of various approaches in box 6. We advise that authors report thenumber of missing values for each variable of interest (ex-posures, outcomes, confounders) and for each step in theanalysis. Authors should give reasons for missing values ifpossible, and indicate how many individuals were excludedbecause of missing data when describing the flow of partic-ipants through the study (see also item 13). For analyses thataccount for missing data, authors should describe the natureof the analysis (eg, multiple imputation) and the assumptionsthat were made (eg, missing at random, see box 6). 12 (d) Cohort Study: If Applicable, Describe How Loss to Follow-up was Addressed Example \"In treatment programs with active follow-up, those lost to follow-up and those followed-up at 1 year hadsimilar baseline CD4 cell counts (median 115 cells per /H9262L and 123 cells per /H9262L), whereas patients lost to follow-up in programs with no active follow-up procedures had consid-erably lower CD4 cell counts than those followed-up(median 64 cells per /H9262L 123 cells per /H9262L . were excludedfrom subsequent analyses.\" 116 Explanation Cohort studies are analyzed using life table methods or other approaches that are based on the person-time of fol-low-up and time to developing the disease of interest. Among individuals who remain free of the disease at the end of theirobservation period, the amount of follow-up time is assumed to be unrelated to the probability of developing the outcome.This will be the case if follow-up ends on a xed date or at aparticular age. Loss to follow-up occurs when participantswithdraw from a study before that date. This may hamper thevalidity of a study if loss to follow-up occurs selectively inexposed individuals, or in persons at high risk of developingthe disease ( /H11032informative censoring'). In the example above, patients lost to follow-up in treatment programs with noactive follow-up had fewer CD4 helper cells than thoseremaining under observation and were therefore at higher riskof dying. 116 It is important to distinguish persons who reach the end of the study from those lost to follow-up. Unfortu-nately, statistical software usually does not distinguishbetween the two situations: in both cases follow-up time isautomatically truncated ('censored') at the end of theobservation period. Investigators therefore need to decide,ideally at the stage of planning the study, how they willdeal with loss to follow-up. When few patients are lost,investigators may either exclude individuals with incom-plete follow-up, or treat them as if they withdrew alive ateither the date of loss to follow-up or the end of the study.We advise authors to report how many patients were lost tofollow-up and what censoring strategies they used. Vandenbroucke et al Epidemiology \u007f Volume 18, Number 6, November 2007 \u00a9 2007 the authors 81812 (d) Case-control Study: If Applicable, Explain How Matching of Cases and Controlswas Addressed Example \"We used McNemar's test, paired ttest, and conditional logistic regression analysis to compare dementia patients withtheir matched controls for cardiovascular risk factors, theoccurrence of spontaneous cerebral emboli, carotid disease,and venous to arterial circulation shunt.\" 117 Explanation In individually matched case-control studies a crude analysis of the odds ratio, ignoring the matching, usuallyleads to an estimation that is biased towards unity (see box 2).A matched analysis is therefore often necessary. This canintuitively be understood as a stratied analysis: each case isseen as one stratum with his or her set of matched controls.The analysis rests on considering whether the case is moreoften exposed than the controls, despite having made themalike regarding the matching variables. Investigators can dosuch a stratied analysis using the Mantel-Haenszel methodon a 'matched' 2 by 2 table. In its simplest form the odds ratiobecomes the ratio of pairs that are discordant for the exposurevariable. If matching was done for variables like age and sexthat are universal attributes, the analysis needs not retain theindividual, person-to-person matching: a simple analysis incategories of age and sex is sufcient. 50For other matching variables, such as neighborhood, sibship, or friendship, how- ever, each matched set should be considered its own stratum. In individually matched studies, the most widely used method of analysis is conditional logistic regression, in whicheach case and their controls are considered together. The con-ditional method is necessary when the number of controls variesamong cases, and when, in addition to the matching variables,other variables need to be adjusted for. To allow readers to judgewhether the matched design was appropriately taken into ac-count in the analysis, we recommend that authors describe indetail what statistical methods were used to analyse the data. Iftaking the matching into account does have little effect on theestimates, authors may choose to present an unmatched analysis. 12 (d) Cross-sectional Study: If Applicable, Describe Analytical Methods Taking Account ofSampling Strategy Example \"The standard errors (SE) were calculated using the Taylor expansion method to estimate the sampling errors ofestimators based on the complex sample design. (. . .) Theoverall design effect for diastolic blood pressure was found tobe 1.9 for men and 1.8 for women and, for systolic bloodpressure, it was 1.9 for men and 2.0 for women.\" 118 Explanation Most cross-sectional studies use a pre-specied sam- pling strategy to select participants from a source population.Sampling may be more complex than taking a simple random sample, however. It may include several stages and clustering of participants (eg, in districts or villages). Proportionate strati-cation may ensure that subgroups with a specic characteristicare correctly represented. Disproportionate stratication may beuseful to over-sample a subgroup of particular interest. An estimate of association derived from a complex sample may be more or less precise than that derived from asimple random sample. Measures of precision such as stan-dard error or condence interval should be corrected usingthe design effect, a ratio measure that describes how muchprecision is gained or lost if a more complex samplingstrategy is used instead of simple random sampling. 119Most complex sampling techniques lead to a decrease of precision, resulting in a design effect greater than 1. We advise that authors clearly state the method used to adjust for complex sampling strategies so that readers mayunderstand how the chosen sampling method influenced theprecision of the obtained estimates. For instance, with clus-tered sampling, the implicit trade-off between easier datacollection and loss of precision is transparent if the designeffect is reported. In the example, the calculated designeffects of 1.9 for men indicates that the actual sample sizewould need to be 1.9 times greater than with simple randomsampling for the resulting estimates to have equal precision. 12 (e) Describe any Sensitivity Analyses Example \"Because we had a relatively higher proportion of 'missing' dead patients with insufcient data (38/148 /H11005 /H110053.4%) (. . .), it is possible that this might have biased the results. We have,therefore, carried out a sensitivity analysis. We have assumedthat the proportion of women using oral contraceptives in thestudy group applies to the whole (19.1% for dead, and 11.4%for live patients), and then applied two extreme scenarios:either all the exposed missing patients used second generationpills or they all used third-generation pills.\" 120 Explanation Sensitivity analyses are useful to investigate whether or not the main results are consistent with those obtained withalternative analysis strategies or assumptions. 121Issues that may be examined include the criteria for inclusion in analy- ses, the denitions of exposures or outcomes,122which con - founding variables merit adjustment, the handling of missingdata, 120,123possible selection bias or bias from inaccurate or inconsistent measurement of exposure, disease and other variables, and specic analysis choices, such as the treatmentof quantitative variables (see item 11). Sophisticated methodsare increasingly used to simultaneously model the influenceof several biases or assumptions. 124-126 In 1959 Corneld et al famously showed that a relative risk of 9 for cigarette smoking and lung cancer was extremelyEpidemiology \u007f Volume 18, Number 6, November 2007 STROBE Initiative \u00a9 2007 the authors 819unlikely to be due to any conceivable confounder, since the confounder would need to be at least nine times as prevalentin smokers as in non-smokers. 127This analysis did not rule out the possibility that such a factor was present, but it did identify the prevalence such a factor would need to have. Thesame approach was recently used to identify plausible con-founding factors that could explain the association betweenchildhood leukemia and living near electric power lines. 128 More generally, sensitivity analyses can be used to identifythe degree of confounding, selection bias, or information biasrequired to distort an association. One important, perhapsunder recognized, use of sensitivity analysis is when a studyshows little or no association between an exposure and anoutcome and it is plausible that confounding or other biasestoward the null are present. RESULTS The Results section should give a factual account of what was found, from the recruitment of study participants,the description of the study population to the main results andancillary analyses. It should be free of interpretations anddiscursive text reflecting the authors' views and opinions. 13 Participants: 13(a) Report the Numbers of Individuals at Each Stage of the Study\u2014eg, NumbersPotentially Eligible, Examined for Eligibility,Confirmed Eligible, Included in the Study,Completing Follow-up, and Analyzed Example \"Of the 105 freestanding bars and taverns sampled, 13 establishments were no longer in business and 9 were locatedin restaurants, leaving 83 eligible businesses. In 22 cases, theowner could not be reached by telephone despite 6 or moreattempts. The owners of 36 bars declined study participation.(. . .) The 25 participating bars and taverns employed 124bartenders, with 67 bartenders working at least 1 weeklydaytime shift. Fifty-four of the daytime bartenders (81%)completed baseline interviews and spirometry; 53 of thesesubjects (98%) completed follow-up.\" 129 Explanation Detailed information on the process of recruiting study participants is important for several reasons. Those includedin a study often differ in relevant ways from the targetpopulation to which results are applied. This may result inestimates of prevalence or incidence that do not reflect theexperience of the target population. For example, people whoagreed to participate in a postal survey of sexual behaviourattended church less often, had less conservative sexualattitudes and earlier age at rst sexual intercourse, and weremore likely to smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol than peoplewho refused. 130These differences suggest that postal surveys may overestimate sexual liberalism and activity in the popu- lation. Such response bias (see box 3) can distort exposure-disease associations if associations differ between those eli- gible for the study and those included in the study. As anotherexample, the association between young maternal age andleukemia in offspring, which has been observed in somecase-control studies, 131,132was explained by differential par - ticipation of young women in case and control groups. Youngwomen with healthy children were less likely to participatethan those with unhealthy children. 133Although low partici - pation does not necessarily compromise the validity of astudy, transparent information on participation and reasonsfor nonparticipation is essential. Also, as there are no univer-sally agreed denitions for participation, response or fol-low-up rates, readers need to understand how authors calcu-lated such proportions. 134 Ideally, investigators should give an account of the num- bers of individuals considered at each stage of recruiting studyparticipants, from the choice of a target population to theinclusion of participants' data in the analysis. Depending on thetype of study, this may include the number of individualsconsidered to be potentially eligible, the number assessed foreligibility, the number found to be eligible, the number includedin the study, the number examined, the number followed up andthe number included in the analysis. Information on differentsampling units may be required, if sampling of study participants is carried out in two or more stages as in the example above(multistage sampling). In case-control studies, we advise thatauthors describe the flow of participants separately for case andcontrol groups. 135Controls can sometimes be selected from several sources, including, for example, hospitalized patients and community dwellers. In this case, we recommend a separateaccount of the numbers of participants for each type of controlgroup. Olson and colleagues proposed useful reporting guide-lines for controls recruited through random-digit dialling andother methods. 136 A recent survey of epidemiological studies published in 10 general epidemiology, public health and medical journalsfound that some information regarding participation wasprovided in 47 of 107 case-control studies (59%), 49 of 154cohort studies (32%), and 51 of 86 cross-sectional studies(59%). 137Incomplete or absent reporting of participation and nonparticipation in epidemiological studies was also docu- mented in two other surveys of the literature.4,5Finally, there is evidence that participation in epidemiological studies may have declined in recent decades,137,138which underscores the need for transparent reporting.139 13(b) Give Reasons for Non-participation at Each Stage Example \"The main reasons for nonparticipation were the par- ticipant was too ill or had died before interview (cases 30%,controls /H110211%), nonresponse (cases 2%, controls 21%), 29%), and other reasons (refusalVandenbroucke et al Epidemiology \u007f Volume 18, Number 6, November 2007 \u00a9 2007 the authors 820by consultant or general practitioner, non-English speaking, mental impairment) (cases 7%, controls 5%).\"140 Explanation Explaining the reasons why people no longer partici- pated in a study or why they were excluded from statisticalanalyses helps readers judge whether the study populationwas representative of the target population and whether biaswas possibly introduced. For example, in a cross-sectional health survey, non-participation due to reasons unlikely to berelated to health status (for example, the letter of invitation wasnot delivered because of an incorrect address) will affect the precision of estimates but will probably not introducebias. Conversely, if many individuals opt out of the surveybecause of illness, or perceived good health, results mayunderestimate or overestimate the prevalence of ill healthin the population. 13(c) Consider Use of a Flow Diagram Example See Fig. 1. FIGURE 1. Child recruitment and follow-up flow diagram. From Hay et al.141Epidemiology \u007f Volume 18, Number 6, November 2007 STROBE Initiative \u00a9 2007 the authors 821Explanation An informative and well-structured flow diagram can readily and transparently convey information that might oth-erwise require a lengthy description, 142as in the example above. The diagram may usefully include the main results, such as the number of events for the primary outcome. Whilewe recommend the use of a flow diagram, particularly forcomplex observational studies, we do not propose a specicformat for the diagram. 14 Descriptive data: 14(a) Give Characteristics of Study Participants (eg, Demographic, Clinical, Social) andInformation on Exposures and PotentialConfounders Example Explanation Readers need descriptions of study participants and their exposures to judge the generalizability of the ndings.Information about potential confounders, including whetherand how they were measured, influences judgments aboutstudy validity. We advise authors to summarize continuousvariables for each study group by giving the mean andstandard deviation, or when the data have an asymmetricaldistribution, as is often the case, the median and percentilerange (eg, 25th and 75th percentiles). Variables that make upa small number of ordered categories (such as stages ofdisease I to IV) should not be presented as continuousvariables; it is preferable to give numbers and proportions foreach category (see also box 4). In studies that comparegroups, the descriptive characteristics and numbers should begiven by group, as in the example above. Inferential measures such as standard errors and condence intervals should not be used to describe thevariability of characteristics, and signicance tests should be avoided in descriptive tables. Also, P values are not anappropriate criterion for selecting which confounders toadjust for in analysis; even small differences in a con-founder that has a strong effect on the outcome can beimportant. 144,145 In cohort studies, it may be useful to document how an exposure relates to other characteristics and potential con-founders. Authors could present this information in a tablewith columns for participants in two or more exposure cate-gories, which permits to judge the differences in confoundersbetween these categories. In case-control studies potential confounders cannot be judged by comparing cases and controls. Control personsrepresent the source population and will usually be differentfrom the cases in many respects. For example, in a study oforal contraceptives and myocardial infarction, a sample ofyoung women with infarction more often had risk factors forthat disease, such as high serum cholesterol, smoking and apositive family history, than the control group. 146This does not influence the assessment of the effect of oral contraceptives, as long as the prescription of oral contraceptives was not guidedby the presence of these risk factors - eg, because the risk factorswere only established after the event (see also box 5). Incase-control studies the equivalent of comparing exposed andnon-exposed for the presence of potential confounders (as isdone in cohorts) can be achieved by exploring the sourcepopulation of the cases: if the control group is large enough andrepresents the source population, exposed and unexposed con-trols can be compared for potential confounders. 121,147 14(b) Indicate the Number of Participants with Missing Data for Each Variable of Interest Example Explanation As missing data may bias or affect generalizability of results, authors should tell readers amounts of missing data for exposures, potential confounders, and other important charac-teristics of patients (see also item 12c and box 6). In a cohortstudy, authors should report the extent of loss to follow-up (withreasons), since incomplete follow-up may bias ndings (see alsoTABLE 2. Characteristics of the Study Base at Enrollment.

Authors can present asummary of the average follow-up with either the mean ormedian follow-up time or both. The mean allows a reader tocalculate the total number of person-years by multiplying itwith the number of study participants. Authors also maypresent minimum and maximum times or percentiles of thedistribution to show readers the spread of follow-up times.They may report total person-years of follow-up or someindication of the proportion of potential data that was cap-tured. 148All such information may be presented separately for participants in two or more exposure categories. Almost half of 132 articles in cancer journals (mostly cohort studies)did not give any summary of length of follow-up. 37 15 Outcome Data: Cohort Study: Report Numbers of Outcome Events or Summary Measures Over Time ExampleCase-control Study: Report Numbers in Each Exposure Category, or Summary Measures ofExposure Example Cross-sectional Study: Report Numbers of Outcome Events or Summary Measures Example Explanation Before addressing the possible association between exposures (risk factors) and outcomes, authors should report relevant descriptive data. It may be possible and meaningfulto present measures of association in the same table thatpresents the descriptive data (see item 14a). In a cohort studyTABLE 4.

Consider reporting the event rateper person-year of follow-up. If the risk of an event changesover follow-up time, present the numbers and rates of eventsin appropriate intervals of follow-up or as a Kaplan-Meier lifetable or plot. It might be preferable to show plots as cumu-lative incidence that go up from 0% rather than down from100%, especially if the event rate is lower than, say, 30%. 153 Consider presenting such information separately for partici-pants in different exposure categories of interest. If a cohortstudy is investigating other time-related outcomes (eg, quan-titative disease markers such as blood pressure), presentappropriate summary measures (eg, means and standard de-viations) over time, perhaps in a table or gure. For cross-sectional studies, we recommend presenting the same type of information on prevalent outcome events or sum-mary measures. For case-control studies, the focus will be onreporting exposures separately for cases and controls as frequen-cies or quantitative summaries. 154For all designs, it may be helpful also to tabulate continuous outcomes or exposures in categories, even if the data are not analyzed as such. 16 Main Results: 16 (a) Give Unadjusted Estimates and, if Applicable, Confounder-Adjusted Estimates andTheir Precision (eg, 95% Confidence Intervals).Make Clear Which Confounders were Adjustedfor and Why They were Included Example 1 \"We initially considered the following variables as potential confounders by Mantel-Haenszel stratied analysis:(. . .) The variables we nal logistic regressionmodels were those (. . .) that produced a in theodds ratio after the Mantel-Haenszel adjustment.\" 155Example 2 See Table 7. Explanation In many situations, authors may present the results of unadjusted or minimally adjusted analyses and those from fullyadjusted analyses. We advise giving the unadjusted analysestogether with the main data, for example the number of casesand controls that were exposed or not. This allows the reader tounderstand the data behind the measures of association (see alsoitem 15). For adjusted analyses, report the number of persons inthe analysis, as this number may differ because of missingvalues in covariates (see also item 12c). Estimates should begiven with condence intervals. Readers can compare unadjusted measures of asso- ciation with those adjusted for potential confounders andjudge by how much, and in what direction, they changed.Readers may think that 'adjusted' results equal the causalpart of the measure of association, but adjusted results arenot necessarily free of random sampling error, selectionbias, information bias, or residual confounding (see box 5).Thus, great care should be exercised when interpretingadjusted results, as the validity of results often dependscrucially on complete knowledge of important confound-ers, their precise measurement, and appropriate specica-tion in the statistical model (see also item 20). 157,158 Authors should explain all potential confounders consid- ered, and the criteria for excluding or including variables instatistical models. Decisions about excluding or including vari-ables should be guided by knowledge, or explicit assumptions,on causal relations. Inappropriate decisions may introduce bias,for example by including variables that are in the causal pathwaybetween exposure and disease (unless the aim is to asses howmuch of the effect is carried by the intermediary variable).

Table adapted from Tiihonen et al.156Vandenbroucke et al Epidemiology \u007f Volume 18, Number 6, November 2007 \u00a9 2007 the authors 824decision to include a variable in the model was based on the change in the estimate, it is important to report what change wasconsidered sufciently important to justify its inclusion. If a'backward deletion' or 'forward inclusion' strategy was used toselect confounders, explain that process and give the signi-cance level for rejecting the null hypothesis of no confounding.Of note, we and others do not advise selecting confoundersbased solely on statistical signicance testing. 147,159,160 Recent studies of the quality of reporting of epide- miological studies found that condence intervals werereported in most articles. 4However, few authors explained their choice of confounding variables.4,5 16 (b) Report Category Boundaries When Continuous Variables were Categorized Example Explanation Categorizing continuous data has several important im- plications for analysis (see box 4) and also affects the presenta-tion of results. In tables, outcomes should be given for eachexposure category, for example as counts of persons at risk,person-time at risk, if relevant separately for each group (eg,cases and controls). Details of the categories used may aidcomparison of studies and meta-analysis. If data were groupedusing conventional cut-points, such as body mass index thresh-olds, 162group boundaries (ie, range of values) can be derived easily, except for the highest and lowest categories. If quantile- derived categories are used, the category boundaries cannot beinferred from the data. As a minimum, authors should report thecategory boundaries; it is helpful also to report the range of thedata and the mean or median values within categories. 16(c) If Relevant, Consider Translating Estimates of Relative Risk into Absolute Riskfor a Meaningful Time Period Example \"10 years' use of HRT /H20851hormone replacement therapy /H20852 is estimated to result in ve (95% CI 3-7) additional breastcancers per 1000 users of oestrogen-only preparations and19 15-23additional cancers per 1000 users of oestrogen-pro - gestagen combinations.\"163 Explanation The results from studies examining the association be- tween an exposure and a disease are commonly reported inrelative terms, as ratios of risks, rates or odds (see box 8).Relative measures capture the strength of the association be-tween an exposure and disease. If the relative risk is a long wayfrom 1 it is less likely that the association is due to confound-ing. 164,165Relative effects or associations tend to be more consistent across studies and populations than absolute mea- sures, but what often tends to be the case may be irrelevant in aparticular instance. For example, similar relative risks wereobtained for the classic cardiovascular risk factors for men livingin Northern Ireland, France, the USA and Germany, despite thefact that the underlying risk of coronary heart disease variessubstantially between these countries. 166,167In contrast, in a study of hypertension as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease mortality, the data were more compatible with a constant ratedifference than with a constant rate ratio. 168 Widely used statistical models, including logistic169 and proportional hazards (Cox) regression170are based on ratio measures. In these models, only departures from con- stancy of ratio effect measures are easily discerned. Never-theless, measures which assess departures from additivity ofrisk differences, such as the Relative Excess Risk fromInteraction (RERI, see item 12b and box 8), can be estimatedin models based on ratio measures. In many circumstances, the absolute risk associated with an exposure is of greater interest than the relative risk. Forexample, if the focus is on adverse effects of a drug, one willwant to know the number of additional cases per unit time of use(eg, days, weeks, or years). The example gives the additionalnumber of breast cancer cases per 1000 women who usedhormone-replacement therapy for 10 years. 163Measures such as the attributable risk or population attributable fraction may be useful to gauge how much disease can be prevented if the exposure is eliminated. They should preferably be presentedtogether with a measure of statistical uncertainty (eg, condenceintervals, as in the example). Authors should be aware of thestrong assumptions made in this context, including a causalrelationship between a risk factor and disease (also see box 7). 171 Because of the semantic ambiguity and complexities involved,authors should report in detail what methods were used tocalculate attributable risks, ideally giving the formulae used. 172 A recent survey of abstracts of 222 articles published in leading medical journals found that in 62% of abstractsof randomized trials including a ratio measure absoluterisks were given, but only in 21% of abstracts of cohortstudies. 173A free text search of Medline 1966 to 1997 showed that 619 items mentioned attributable risks in the title or abstract, compared to 18,955 using relative risk orodds ratio, for a ratio of 1 to 31. 174TABLE 8.

Explanation In addition to the main analysis other analyses are often done in observational studies. They may address specicsubgroups, the potential interaction between risk factors, thecalculation of attributable risks, or use alternative denitionsof study variables in sensitivity analyses. There is debate about the dangers associated with subgroup analyses, and multiplicity of analyses in gener-al. 4,104In our opinion, there is too great a tendency to look for evidence of subgroup-specic associations, or effect-measure modication, when overall results appear to suggest little orno effect. On the other hand, there is value in exploringwhether an overall association appears consistent across sev-eral, preferably pre-specied subgroups especially when astudy is large enough to have sufcient data in each subgroup.

They might be important ndings, butmight also arise by chance. Some argue that it is neither possiblenor necessary to inform the reader about all subgroup analysesdone as future analyses of other data will tell to what extent theearly exciting ndings stand the test of time. 9We advise authorsto report which analyses were planned, and which were not (see also items 4, 12b and 20). This will allow readers to judge theimplications of multiplicity, taking into account the study'sposition on the continuum from discovery to verication orrefutation. A third area of debate is how joint effects and interac- tions between risk factors should be evaluated: on additive ormultiplicative scales, or should the scale be determined by thestatistical model that ts best (see also item 12b and box 8)?A sensible approach is to report the separate effect of eachexposure as well as the joint effect - if possible in a table, asin the rst example above, 183or in the study by Martinelli et al.185Such a table gives the reader sufcient information to evaluate additive as well as multiplicative interaction (how these calculations are done is shown in box 8). Condenceintervals for separate and joint effects may help the reader tojudge the strength of the data. In addition, condence inter-vals around measures of interaction, such as the RelativeExcess Risk from Interaction (RERI) relate to tests of inter-action or homogeneity tests. One recurrent problem is thatauthors use comparisons of P values across subgroups, whichlead to erroneous claims about an effect modier. For in-stance, a statistically signicant association in one category(eg, men), but not in the other (eg, women) does not in itselfprovide evidence of effect modication. Similarly, the con-dence intervals for each point estimate are sometimes inap-propriately used to infer that there is no interaction when TABLE 10.

A more valid inference is achieved by directly evaluating whether the magnitude of an associationdiffers across subgroups. Sensitivity analyses are helpful to investigate the influence of choices made in the statistical analysis, or to investigate therobustness of the ndings to missing data or possible biases (seealso item 12b). Judgement is needed regarding the level ofreporting of such analyses. If many sensitivity analyses wereperformed, it may be impractical to present detailed ndings forthem all. It may sometimes be sufcient to report that sensitivityanalyses were carried out and that they were consistent with themain results presented. Detailed presentation is more appropriateif the issue investigated is of major concern, or if effect estimatesvary considerably. 59,186 Pocock and colleagues found that 43 out of 73 articles reporting observational studies contained subgroup analyses. Themajority claimed differences across groups but only eight arti-cles reported a formal evaluation of interaction (see item 12b). 4 DISCUSSION The discussion section addresses the central issues of validity and meaning of the study.191Surveys have found that discussion sections are often dominated by incomplete or biased assessments of the study's results and their implica-tions, and rhetoric supporting the authors' ndings. 192,193 Structuring the discussion may help authors avoid unwar-ranted speculation and over-interpretation of results whileguiding readers through the text. 194,195For example, Annals of Internal Medicine196recommends that authors structure the discussion section by presenting the following: 1) a brief synopsis of the key ndings; 2) consideration of possiblemechanisms and explanations; 3) comparison with relevantndings from other published studies; 4) limitations of thestudy; and 5) a brief section that summarizes the implicationsof the work for practice and research. Others have madesimilar suggestions. 191,194The section on research recom - mendations and the section on limitations of the study shouldbe closely linked to each other. Investigators should suggestways in which subsequent research can improve on theirstudies rather than blandly stating 'more research is need-ed'. 197,198We recommend that authors structure their discus - sion sections, perhaps also using suitable subheadings. 18 Key Results: Summarise Key Results with Reference to Study Objectives Example \"We hypothesized that ethnic minority status would be associated with higher levels of cardiovascular disease (CVD)risk factors, but that the associations would be explained sub-stantially by socioeconomic status (SES). Our hypothesis wasnot conrmed. After adjustment for age and SES, highly signif-icant differences in body mass index, blood pressure, diabetes,and physical inactivity remained between white women andboth black and Mexican American women. In addition, wefound large differences in CVD risk factors by SES, a nding that illustrates the high-risk status of both ethnic minoritywomen as well as white women with low SES.\" 199 Explanation It is good practice to begin the discussion with a short summary of the main ndings of the study. The short sum-mary reminds readers of the main ndings and may help themassess whether the subsequent interpretation and implicationsoffered by the authors are supported by the ndings. 19 Limitations: Discuss Limitations of the Study, Taking into Account Sources ofPotential Bias or Imprecision. Discuss BothDirection and Magnitude of Any Potential Bias Example \"Since the prevalence of counseling increases with increasing levels of obesity, our estimates may overestimatethe true prevalence. Telephone surveys also may overesti-mate the true prevalence of counseling. Although personswithout telephones have similar levels of overweight aspersons with telephones, persons without telephones tend tobe less educated, a factor associated with lower levels ofcounseling in our study. Also, of concern is the potential biascaused by those who refused to participate as well as thosewho refused to respond to questions about weight. Further-more, because data were collected cross-sectionally, we can-not infer that counseling preceded a patient's attempt to loseweight.\" 200 Explanation The identication and discussion of the limitations of a study are an essential part of scientic reporting. It is impor-tant not only to identify the sources of bias and confoundingthat could have affected results, but also to discuss therelative importance of different biases, including the likelydirection and magnitude of any potential bias (see also box 3,item 9). Authors should also discuss any imprecision of the results. Imprecision may arise in connection with severalaspects of a study, including the study size (item 10) and themeasurement of exposures, confounders and outcomes (item8). The inability to precisely measure true values of anexposure tends to result in bias towards unity: the lessprecisely a risk factor is measured, the greater the bias. Thiseffect has been described as 'attenuation', 201,202or more recently as 'regression dilution bias'.203However, when correlated risk factors are measured with different degrees of imprecision, the adjusted relative risk associated with themcan be biased towards or away from unity. 204-206 When discussing limitations, authors may compare the study being presented with other studies in the literature interms of validity, generalizability and precision. In this ap-proach, each study can be viewed as contribution to theVandenbroucke et al Epidemiology \u007f Volume 18, Number 6, November 2007 \u00a9 2007 the authors 828literature, not as a stand-alone basis for inference and ac- tion.207Surprisingly, the discussion of important limitations of a study is sometimes omitted from published reports. A survey of authors who had published original research articlesinThe Lancet found that important weaknesses of the study were reported by the investigators in the survey question-naires, but not in the published article. 192 20 Interpretation: Give a Cautious Overall Interpretation Considering Objectives,Limitations, Multiplicity of Analyses, Resultsfrom Similar Studies, and Other RelevantEvidence Example \"Any explanation for an association between death from myocardial infarction and use of second generation oralcontraceptives must be conjectural. There is no publishedevidence to suggest a direct biologic mechanism, and thereare no other epidemiologic studies with relevant results. (. . .)The increase in absolute risk is very small and probablyapplies predominantly to smokers. Due to the lack of corrob-orative evidence, and because the analysis is based on rela-tively small numbers, more evidence on the subject is needed.We would not recommend any change in prescribing practiceon the strength of these results.\" 120 Explanation The heart of the discussion section is the interpreta- tion of a study's results. Over-interpretation is commonand human: even when we try hard to give an objectiveassessment, reviewers often rightly point out that we wenttoo far in some respects. When interpreting results, authorsshould consider the nature of the study on the discovery toverication continuum and potential sources of bias, in-cluding loss to follow-up and non-participation (see alsoitems 9, 12 and 19). Due consideration should be given toconfounding (item 16a), the results of relevant sensitivityanalyses, and to the issue of multiplicity and subgroupanalyses (item 17). Authors should also consider residual confounding due to unmeasured variables or imprecisemeasurement of confounders. For example, socioeconomicstatus (SES) is associated with many health outcomes andoften differs between groups being compared. Variablesused to measure SES (income, education, or occupation)are surrogates for other undened and unmeasured expo-sures, and the confounder will by denition be mea-sured with error. 208Authors should address the real range of uncertainty in estimates, which is larger than the statis- tical uncertainty reflected in condence intervals. Thelatter do not take into account other uncertainties that arisefrom a study's design, implementation, and methods ofmeasurement. 209To guide thinking and conclusions about causality, some may nd criteria proposed by Bradford Hill in 1965helpful. 164How strong is the association with the exposure? Did it precede the onset of disease? Is the association con- sistently observed in different studies and settings? Is theresupporting evidence from experimental studies, includinglaboratory and animal studies? How specic is the exposure'sputative effect, is there dose-response relationship? Isthe association biologically plausible? These criteria shouldnot, however, be applied mechanically. For example, somehave argued that relative risks below 2 or 3 should beignored. 210,211This is a reversal of the point by Corneld et al about the strength of large relative risks (see item 12b).127 Although a causal effect is more likely with a relative risk of 9, it does not follow that one below 3 is necessarily spurious.For instance, the small increase in the risk of childhoodleukemia after intrauterine irradiation is credible because itconcerns an adverse effect of a medical procedure for whichno alternative explanations are obvious. 212Moreover, the carcinogenic effects of radiation are well established. The doubling in the risk of ovarian cancer associated with eating2 to 4 eggs per week is not immediately credible, sincedietary habits are associated with a large number of lifestylefactors as well as SES. 213In contrast, the credibility of much debated epidemiologic ndings of a difference in thrombosis risk between different types of oral contraceptives wasgreatly enhanced by the differences in coagulation found in arandomized cross-over trial. 214A discussion of the existing external evidence, from different types of studies, should always be included, but may be particularly important forstudies reporting small increases in risk. Further, authorsshould put their results in context with similar studies andexplain how the new study affects the existing body ofevidence, ideally by referring to a systematic review. 21 Generalizability: Discuss the Generalizability (External Validity) of theStudy Results Example \"How applicable are our estimates to other HIV-1- infected patients? This is an important question because theaccuracy of prognostic models tends to be lower when ap-plied to data other than those used to develop them. Weaddressed this issue by penalising model complexity, and bychoosing models that generalized best to cohorts omittedfrom the estimation procedure. Our database included pa-tients from many countries from Europe and North America,who were treated in different settings. The range of patientswas broad: men and women, from teenagers to elderly peoplewere included, and the major exposure categories were wellrepresented. The severity of immunodeciency at baselineranged from not measureable to very severe, and viral loadfrom undetectable to extremely high.\" 215Epidemiology \u007f Volume 18, Number 6, November 2007 STROBE Initiative \u00a9 2007 the authors 829Explanation Generalizability, also called external validity or ap- plicability, is the extent to which the results of a study canbe applied to other circumstances. 216There is no external validity per se; the term is meaningful only with regard to clearly specied conditions.217Can results be applied to an individual, groups or populations that differ from those enrolled in the study with regard to age, sex, ethnicity,severity of disease, and co-morbid conditions? Are thenature and level of exposures comparable, and the deni-tions of outcomes relevant to another setting or popula-tion? Are data that were collected in longitudinal studiesmany years ago still relevant today? Are results fromhealth services research in one country applicable to healthsystems in other countries? The question of whether the results of a study have external validity is often a matter of judgment that depends onthe study setting, the characteristics of the participants, theexposures examined, and the outcomes assessed. Thus, it iscrucial that authors provide readers with adequate informa-tion about the setting and locations, eligibility criteria, theexposures and how they were measured, the denition ofoutcomes, and the period of recruitment and follow-up. Thedegree of nonparticipation and the proportion of unex-posed participants in whom the outcome develops are alsorelevant. Knowledge of the absolute risk and prevalence ofthe exposure, which will often vary across populations, arehelpful when applying results to other settings and popu-lations (see box 7). OTHER INFORMATION 22 Funding: Give the Source of Funding and the Role of the Funders for the Present Studyand, if Applicable, for the Original Study onWhich the Present Article is Based Explanation Some journals require authors to disclose the presence or absence of nancial and other conflicts of interest.100,218Several investigations show strong associations between the source of funding and the conclusions of research articles.219-222The conclusions in randomized trials recommended the experimental drug as the drug of choice much more often (odds ratio 5.3) ifthe trial was funded by for-prot organisations, even afteradjustment for the effect size. 223Other studies document the influence of the tobacco and telecommunication industries on the research they funded.224-227There are also examples of undue influence when the sponsor is governmental or a non- prot organization. Authors or funders may have conflicts of interest that influence any of the following: the design of the study228; choice of exposures,228,229outcomes,230statistical meth - ods,231and selective publication of outcomes230and stud - ies.232Consequently, the role of the funders should be de -scribed in detail: in what part of the study they took direct responsibility (eg, design, data collection, analysis, draftingof the manuscript, decision to publish). 100Other sources of undue influence include employers (eg, university adminis- trators for academic researchers and government supervisors,especially political appointees, for government researchers),advisory committees, litigants, and special interest groups. Concluding Remarks The STROBE Statement aims to provide helpful rec- ommendations for reporting observational studies in epide-miology. Good reporting reveals the strengths and weak-nesses of a study and facilitates sound interpretation andapplication of study results. The STROBE Statement mayalso aid in planning observational studies, and guide peerreviewers and editors in their evaluation of manuscripts. We wrote this explanatory article to discuss the impor- tance of transparent and complete reporting of observationalstudies, to explain the rationale behind the different itemsincluded in the checklist, and to give examples from pub-lished articles of what we consider good reporting. We hopethat the material presented here will assist authors and editorsin using STROBE. We stress that STROBE and other recommendations on the reporting of research 13,233,234should be seen as evolving documents that require continual assessment, renement, and, if necessary, change.235,236For example, the CONSORT Statement for the reporting of parallel-group randomized trials was rst developed in the mid 1990s.237Since then members of the group have met regularly to review the need to revise the recommendations; a revised version appeared in2001 233and a further version is in development. Similarly, the principles presented in this article and the STROBE checklist are open to change as new evidence and criticalcomments accumulate. The STROBE web site (http://www.strobe-statement.org) provides a forum for discussion andsuggestions for improvements of the checklist, this explana-tory document and information about the good reporting ofepidemiological studies. Several journals ask authors to follow the STROBE Statement in their instructions to authors (see web site forcurrent list). We invite other journals to adopt the STROBEStatement and contact us through our web site to let us know.The journals publishing the STROBE recommendations pro-vide open access. The STROBE Statement is thereforewidely accessible to the biomedical community.
