Just enough physical force or effort to maintain balance, to stay upright and stable, to be awake and attentive. Psychologically, to be alert, open and receptive, without striving towards a goal, or for a reward (including enlightenment), or to add commentary, judgment or other reactive behaviour to our experience. We simply sit, just to sit - without forcing, without unnecessary intention or purpose. This is non-violence (ahimsa) in action. Clarity, insight and understanding arise when force and reactivity are minimised. Dogen, in the Fukan-zazengi, advises us to sit in meditation, 'neither thinking, nor not-thinking.'

We just sit in peace, observing the procession of events without being disturbed by what comes along - as a heron stands, supremely alert, yet not interfering in any way in the stream of rippling water (until the moment comes to strike).
