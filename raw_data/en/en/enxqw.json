Most studies have specifically included patients with histories of severe anaphylaxis (n = 513) with egg ingestion and these patients also tolerate the vaccine So, even these patients are not at risk of serious reaction But what about patients with severe egg allergy?National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit -5/12/2016 4Manufacturers of injectable inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) report the maximum amount of ovalbumin < 1 \u00b5g per 0.5 mL dose The measured amounts in independent laboratories are usually much lower than the claimed amounts Thus, the vaccine does not contain enough ovalbumin to cause a reaction Why are there no serious reactions being reported?

All vaccination providers should be familiar with the office emergency plan and be currently certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Epinephrine and equipment for maintaining an airway should be available for immediate use.\" Do we need the algorithm?National Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit -5/12/2016 21Do we need the algorithm? It implies that egg allergy increases the risk for an anaphylactic reaction after influenza immunization, but an extensive body of data says this is not the case. It implies that children with severe reactions to egg ingestion are at increased risk for reactions, but hundreds of such children have been vaccinated uneventfully. It implies that RIV is safer than IIV or LAIV for egg -allergic recipients, but all vaccines rarely cause anaphylaxis Do we need the algorithm? For those with severe egg allergy requires a \"physician with experience in the recognition and management of severe allergic conditions\" = allergist, to whom a consult in some communities takes months It is inconsistent with US and international allergy guidelines It is inconsistent with Canadian vaccine guidelinesNational Adult and Influenza Immunization Summit -5/12/2016 22Do we need the algorithm? It is an unnecessary barrier to immunization Egg-allergic children (and some adults) are going unimmunized because practitioners don't want to take the \"risk\" Many hospitalizations and some deaths occur among the unimmunized Influenza vaccine and egg allergy My Recommendation (\"Pearl of Wisdom\") 1.No restriction on the use of the LAIV in egg-allergic recipients, i.e. treat LAIV like IIV. 2.No special precautions for the administration of any influenza vaccine (IIV or LAIV) to any egg -allergic recipient, i.e. no special medical setting or waiting period beyond those recommended for any vaccine "}
