It's not just about nutrition; it's about a crafting activity, and what these do to our minds and bodies. It's simply about unleashing [creativity for wellbeing](https://economiacreativa.wordpress.com/2021/04/21/creativity-for-people-and-organizations-wellbeing/). Why bread making? There are things that - gladly - will never be forgotten and go out of style. Moreover, they will always remain as they are. And this is, of course, bread; our everyday staple food, which most of the meals cannot be deprived of, and certainly breakfast without it, makes no sense whatsoever (that's what I think!). Bread has been present on our tables for centuries and will remain so. And although its form has altered slightly over time, the purpose and manner of use have not changed. I think most people, since the lockdown, restrictions and sudden changes related to [remote work](https://economiacreativa.wordpress.com/2020/05/20/how-to-be-productive-working-remotely/) unexpectedly found themselves in a very uncomfortable position. By been, abruptly forced to try to deal with the feeling of loneliness, isolation, lack of direct contact with colleagues and co-workers at work. Covid-19 made our lives completely turn upside down; and the chaos it introduced has made life no longer what it used to be. We can, however, note some [positive sides](https://economiacreativa.wordpress.com/2020/04/18/the-positive-side-of-coronavirus-lockdown/) of these strange times. Many people - including myself - due to isolation and more time at home, began to re-discover their own culinary talents, redesign their own interior decorations, or do gardening. Some dusty passions, hobbies and interests have come to the fore. Many people began to experiment, either - in the kitchen, garden, needlework, and many other endeavors, and unexpectedly found themselves creative and innovative. In a way, this was the case with me when it comes to baking bread. The smell of freshly baked bread always had a soothing effect on me and always brought back fond memories of my childhood; when my mother used to butter and jam on the still warm and fragrant slices of bread with a crispy crust, which quickly disappeared from the plate when I sipped hot cocoa milk before I could run to school. This smell of bread was a promise to me, a sign of something wonderful; maybe a sneak peak of something cool, or maybe just an entry for a nice day. This smell, especially in this particular period of the pandemic, has become an almost therapeutic experience for me. The benefits of bread making The Covid-19 pandemic has reminded the world of the importance of good health and a strong and resilient immune system. As a consequence, people's demand for healthy eating, Ayurvedic medicine*, mindfulness and overall wellbeing has increased tremendously. It has also significantly increased the fight against stress, anxiety or radical changes that weakens immune functions and resistance to health threats. Therefore, all forms of taking care of our health and wellbeing have started to be in the foreground. Consider eating; never before have we been so preoccupied with the nutritional composition of food, or healthy eating in general, as we are now. Especially in recent years; and this trend will continue. We've seen a surge in people's concern about eating processed foods, see the article: [\"Additives and addiction \u2014 why the food we eat is a minefield\"](https://www.ft.com/content/1e17a26c-5265-4bec-ae63-388e09af8000). Synthetic preservatives that have been used in foods for decades can lead to negative health consequences. Even in the most basic product, like bread (especially the one from the stores), we can find undesirable preservatives that we had no idea about. Perhaps that is why baking your own homemade bread becomes not only fashionable, comforting, but above all healthy. And besides, who doesn't like freshly baked bread? Bread-making to enhance creativity Bread making is one of my latest creative ritual discoveries as well as soothing and therapeutic needs. Thanks to bread making we obtain an endless list of even healing benefits for our body and spirit: starting from the relaxing properties, soothing nerves, releasing positive energy, mindfulness, to building self-confidence, discovering hidden abilities and possibilities, to a sense of complete [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) in the task. It's a tool of wellbeing to awaken energy fields. It's about feeling good and enjoying what you do. It also contributes to our physical health by creating nutritious and delicious food. It is too an experience that we can perform together with household members, children or even, virtually, with colleagues from work, share impressions and experiences, exchange recipes and photos, which is, for example, can be a part of wonderful team building activity. Especially now, when we are all under enormous pressure due to sudden changes and happenings; we all deal with many tasks, and a lot is expected and demanded from us. In this context, [what gives us energy and strength is our creativity](https://economiacreativa.wordpress.com/2020/05/02/behavioural-change-to-breakthrough-the-new-reality/), only thanks to it, we are able to regain hope, enthusiasm and vitality. Therefore, the need to take care of our physical, mental and spiritual health is very crucial and requires specific attention and maintenance. It is known that [creativity is crucial for people and organizations' wellbeing](https://economiacreativa.wordpress.com/2021/04/21/creativity-for-people-and-organizations-wellbeing/). A [Creative lifestyle](https://economiacreativa.wordpress.com/2021/01/24/12-steps-to-a-creative-lifestyle-2/) consists of little, everyday habits, positive changes and small but very significant rituals that will make our life more beautiful, meaningful and fulfilled. And we, the creators of this life, will be healthier, happier yet more efficient in any objective we set for ourselves. A breakfast, perfectly prepared, down to the smallest detail, forms my daily ritual in which, of course, the bread is a fundamental part. Thinly buttered and jammed slices, still warm when removed from the toaster, spread the wonderful fragrance throughout the kitchen and gently invite everyone to a wonderful feast. Together with freshly brewed coffee, they form a harmonious duo. Can you ask for more? Although, bread was always present in my house, it never occurred to me to bake it myself. Probably because it was always assumed that we buy bread in a store, or bakery, like everyone else. Because, why bother baking something so common. Since creativity is challenging assumptions, so why don't you try to bake your own bread? Believe me, until I tried it out, I didn't know how much fun it could be. But it was not only this feeling of joy and fun that accompanied me during my art of baking bread. There are many more, a satisfaction with the effect - a huge wow - that I managed to create something so wonderful and common at the same time. In addition, pride and faith in having creative abilities and skills (we are not always aware of them) and the quality of time spent. It relaxes, relieves stress and soothes nerves, like the best meditation ever. Moreover, we get rid of negative energy while releasing positive energy in return. Believe me, it's an energizing experience that enhance your senses! Besides, the quality of your own bread, of course, is incomparable to that from most stores/bakeries - since we add the best quality products, without unnecessary and unhealthy additives, including sugars and salts. Did you know baking bread is a great idea for online team building? The ritual of baking homemade bread is useful not only at home, where you can wonderfully satisfy family members with such delicacies, or relax yourself, and calm your nerves. But, such activity can also apply to workplaces. I guess you don't easily come up with this idea; yet it is true. How about, for example, new virtual, interactive cooking experiences that you can share with your colleagues? This may be the best way to bond a team\u2014and yes, it is possible in the time of [remote working](https://economiacreativa.wordpress.com/2020/11/08/creativity-to-empower-remote-teams/). These virtual cooking activities and other food-based experiences can unite a team across the countries, offering a fun, interactive, and memorable options for team building, weekend activities, holiday parties, and other private events, or just simply, a way to exchange or share culinary experiences, photos and recipes and healthy habits for inspiration. Mastering your very own bread recipe Do you have your favourite type of bread? I prefer multi-grain, although, I also like to experiment a bit, with different type of flours and additives (seeds, etc.). It often happens that my breads are full of various types of seeds, dried tomatoes, dried fruits, etc. Baking bread is easy; you just have to remember not to give up if you fail the first time or if the result is not entirely satisfactory. The really important thing is that you feel the joy and importance of what you are doing: creating something new. We all need to learn how to take care of our wellbeing at home, especially nowadays. My ritual of baking bread is one of my ways to combine creativity and healthy and sustainable diet, fulfilling [lifestyle](https://economiacreativa.wordpress.com/2021/01/24/12-steps-to-a-creative-lifestyle-2/). For some it will be energy release, and for others, a kind of mindfulness, or simply a way to relieve mental tension. Whatever works for you, each of these effects is a desired outcome.

Wholemeal bread Recipe crafted by Justyna Molendowska-Ruiz Timing Kneading the dough: 15 min. baking: approx. 40 min. Proving the dough: approx. 2 hours (total) Ingredients: 500g wholemeal flour 10g sea salt (Although, I do not add salt, is healthier) 15g fresh yeast 400ml warm water 20ml sunflower oil (to grease the molds) METHOD Weigh the flour and salt into a big bowl. Measure the water into a jug. With a fork, stir the yeast into the warm water. Empty the jug into the bowl and stir all the ingredients together. Knead the dough for 10-15 minutes. Once you have smooth and elastic dough nestle it back into the bowl and cover with a cloth. Leave it in a warm place to grow to twice its size or for 1 hour, whichever is first. By hand, shape your dough so it fits evenly into a well-oiled large loaf tin. Add your favourite seeds - optional. Dust the top of your loaf with a bit of flour and then cover the tin and leave it in a warm place to double in size or for 1 hour (whichever is first). Preheat the oven to 200\u00b0C. Throw a cupful of water onto the baking sheet for the perfect crust. Check it after 10 minutes and turn the oven down a notch (180\u00b0C) Take it out after 30 minutes when it's baked and beautifully golden all over. It should sound hollow when tapped underneath. Turn the loaf out and cool it for at least 10 minutes on a wire rack. *Ayurveda: is based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a delicate balance between the mind, body, and spirit.
