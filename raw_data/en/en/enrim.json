[[1]](#cite_note-1) [[2]](#cite_note-2) It only grows naturally in a part of [South Africa](/wiki/South_Africa), a country known for its unique plant life that is different from pretty much the rest of the world. Proven facts[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Rooibos_tea&action=edit\u00a7ion=1)] Like with most \" [super foods](/wiki/Superfoods)\", rooibos health claims start out on a level that's perfectly reasonable: [Organic](/wiki/Organic_food)\u2014 true, only one country and company supply it and they pledged to be organic. [[3]](#cite_note-3) [Caffeine](/wiki/Caffeine)-free \u2014 though most herbal teas are. - Full of [antioxidants](/wiki/Antioxidants)\u2014 true, many things are. The two studies looking at the antioxidant levels gave vastly different results. One stated rooibos had 50% more than [green tea](/wiki/Green_tea), and the other a good bit less than green tea. [[4]](#cite_note-4)Antioxidants can be beneficial, but more is not necessarily better (i.e., in the the case of very high doses). [[5]](#cite_note-5) - It can be consumed by people who have problems with regular tea (tannins/oxalic acid) \u2014 Just like many herbal teas. In areas with sketchy [water](/wiki/Water) infrastructure, drinking tea brings the added benefit of forcing you to boil the water, which kills many water-borne pathogens. Unfortunately, boiling water before drinking it can't protect you against [lead](/wiki/Lead) and other nonvolatile contaminants still found in the water of some [developing countries](/wiki/Third_World) (and notably, [Michigan](/wiki/Michigan)). Made-up facts[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Rooibos_tea&action=edit\u00a7ion=2)] Unsurprisingly, the health claims quickly start diverging into the [bizarre](/wiki/Food_woo): - There are claims (mostly [New age](/wiki/New_age)type) that it's an old [Japanese](/wiki/Japanese)secret to long life \u2014 Of course, no one had seen this product before the 18th century, when it started being used as a substitute for black tea by poor [Dutch](/wiki/Netherlands)settlers in [South Africa](/wiki/South_Africa). It doesn't grow anywhere else, and it doesn't ship well. It hadn't started being produced commercially (or even seen in Japan) until 2000 and after [Apartheid](/wiki/Apartheid)ended. [Toxin](/wiki/Toxin) [cleanser](/wiki/Cleanse) [[6]](#cite_note-6)\u2014 Researchers have found correlations for anti-fungal for skin infections on 11 dart [frogs](/w/index.php?title=Frog&action=edit&redlink=1). [[7]](#cite_note-7)It wasn't taken internally. - It contains healthy minerals \u2014 There are no listings of mineral contents of rooibos tea outside of a [nutritional supplement](/wiki/Nutritional_supplement)label or [crank](/wiki/Crank)websites. Each seems to have its own list of what is in the tea. - Protects the immune system \u2014 Nothing supports that, so: studies or it doesn't happen. - Supports and cures gastrointestinal issues \u2014 Nothing supports that, so: studies or it doesn't happen. - Protect against cardiovascular disease and diabetic vascular complications [[8]](#cite_note-8)\u2014 Nothing supports that, save the figments of people's imagination. - Protects against [cancer](/wiki/Cancer)\u2014 [Hell](/wiki/Hell), what super food doesn't (claim to)? There is insufficient evidence for this claim. [[9]](#cite_note-webmd-9) - It is used to prevent [HIV](/wiki/HIV)infection, but there is insufficient evidence for this. [[9]](#cite_note-webmd-9) - It is used to prevent age-related dementia, but there is insufficient evidence for this. [[9]](#cite_note-webmd-9) - It is safe for infants and [pregnant](/wiki/Pregnant)people \u2014 Okaaaay, and many other things aren't? Put on the kettle[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Rooibos_tea&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] Like with most non-toxic herbals; if you like it, enjoy it for that reason. Drinking Rooibos tea likely won't hurt (if consumed in moderation, assuming no prior health problems), and it might even be good for you. [[9]](#cite_note-webmd-9) Just keep in mind that supposing so [requires a leap of faith](/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance). One sore part of you guaranteed to take a hit from this tea is located in the wallet region \u2014 there's no such thing as a free lunch tea. And whatever you do, don't expect Rooibos (or any tea, for that matter) to perform any [miracles](/wiki/Miracles).
