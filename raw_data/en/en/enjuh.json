{"title": "Unforeseen Heat: An Accidental Superficial Partial-Thickness Hand Burn Utilizing a New Convection Oven", "author": "Mehmed F Canatan; Ahmed N Canatan; Mustafa O Canatan", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Thermal burns remain a significant public health concern, and it is crucial to understand the potential risks associated with everyday activities involving heated objects or surfaces. It has been found that males have a higher susceptibility to hand burns, but when it comes to burns caused by hot liquids, females tend to be more frequently affected. Cooking remains the predominant activity associated with a higher incidence of accidental hand burns. Prompt medical attention and appropriate management are essential in mitigating the severity of burn injuries. This case report presents a previously healthy 55-year-old female that sustained a superficial partial-thickness burn to the dorsal aspect of her right hand while preparing a meal in her kitchen with her brand-new convection oven. This was her first time using a convection oven, unaware of the fans and rapidly circulating hot air within the oven. We discuss the need for a comprehensive approach to wound care, including topical antimicrobial agents, dressings, pain management, and monitoring for potential complications to achieve favorable outcomes and minimize long-term sequelae. Prevention remains the cornerstone in reducing burn injuries. Awareness campaigns, safety guidelines, and educational initiatives aimed at promoting responsible handling of hot objects should be implemented. Simple preventive measures, such as using appropriate protective equipment such as oven mitts, being mindful of oven temperatures, and maintaining a safe distance from heated surfaces, can significantly reduce the risk of household thermal burns.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2023-07-29", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
