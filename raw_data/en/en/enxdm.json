This is equivalent to the amount needed to fund the Department of Health, the Ministry of Defence and theHome Office. 2 All taxes are subject to the risk of fraud and evasion by a variety of methods, ranging from false declarations to smuggling. Under their Service DeliveryAgreement for the period 2001-04, Customs are producing threat assessmentsfor all major business areas. Customs aim to use these assessments to measurethe impacts of fraud and to develop strategies for tackling them. 3 Customs current priorities on law enforcement are tackling drug and tobacco smuggling. The Government published its strategy for Tackling Drugs To Build a Better Britain in 1998 and for Tackling Tobacco Smuggling in March 2000. The results from the first year indicate that Customs are on track to achieve theiraim of putting tobacco smuggling into decline. In Tackling Indirect Tax Fraud , published in November 2001, Customs set out their estimates of revenue lossin the oils and alcohol sectors and from VAT missing trader fraud 1. It also sets out the Government's proposals for tackling fraud in these areas.In this section The risk to the revenue 1 Main findings 2 Main conclusions and 5 recommendations Figure 1 shows the total revenue collected by HM Customs & Excise in 2000-011 Other taxes \u00a32.2bn Value Added Tax \u00a358.6bn Hydrocarbon Oil Duty \u00a322.6bnTobacco Duty \u00a37.6bnAlcohol Duty \u00a36.6bnOther duties \u00a34.7bn NOTE All figures are net.

The fraudsters then sell on the goods at VAT inclusive prices anddisappear without paying over the VAT paid by their customers to Customs.2executive summaryHM CUSTOMS AND EXCISE: THE MISUSE AND SMUGGLING OF HYDROCARBON OIL 4 We have reported on developments in Customs' counter fraud activities in the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual Standard Report on Customscollection of duties. The latest report, published with Customs' accounts for2000-01, looks in particular at their work to combat Tobacco Fraud and areview of VAT registration. In July 2001, we published a separate report on theevasion of duties on alcohol through the diversion of duty-suspended productsto the open market (HC 178, Session 2001-2002). And we have alsocommenced work on a wide ranging review of the way Customs, theDepartment of Work and Pensions and Inland Revenue tackle the major threatof external fraud against the public purse. 5 In this report, we look at the risks Customs face on hydrocarbon oils duty and how well they are tackling the illegal use of rebated fuel (fuel on which the dutyis substantially lower than petrol and diesel because it will not be used in vehicleson the highway) and smuggling. Hydrocarbon oils, which accounted for \u00a322.6 billion from duties in 2000-01, include fuels such as petrol, diesel andkerosene. Our methodology is set out in Appendix A. How Customs are organisedto collect the duty and tackle fraud and smuggling is summarised in Appendix B. Main Findings 6 Customs collect 80 per cent of hydrocarbon oils duty from the nine large oil refineries operating in the United Kingdom. The balance comes mainly fromsmaller refineries and businesses that trade in imported oils. When the finalconsumer purchases the fuel, Value Added Tax is also due. Together,hydrocarbon oils duty and VAT made up 80 per cent of the retail price ofunleaded petrol (as of January 2002). 7 In November 2001, Customs estimated that in 2000 the revenue loss from frauds on petrol and diesel could be between \u00a3450 million and \u00a3980 millionin the UK (Figure 2) . 8 On the UK mainland, frauds on diesel in 2000 amounted to \u00a3450 million, up from \u00a3200 million in the previous year. Customs are concerned that fraudlosses in the diesel sector could continue to grow if concerted action is nottaken to tackle the problem. For Northern Ireland, the estimated revenue lossfrom fraud and legitimate cross border shopping on petrol and diesel was\u00a3380 million for 2000, up from \u00a3140 million in 1998. Customs estimate thetotal revenue from hydrocarbon oils duty in Northern Ireland is around\u00a3750 million.3executive summaryHM CUSTOMS AND EXCISE: THE MISUSE AND SMUGGLING OF HYDROCARBON OIL 9 Customs' developing strategy for tackling fraud on hydrocarbon oils duty is based on tackling misuse of rebated fuel and in addition in Northern Irelanddisrupting the supply of smuggled fuel. The main elements of the strategy aresummarised in Figure 3 . 10 Customs believe that the smuggling of fuel is a material problem only between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. This is because of the long landborder, the lower price of diesel and petrol in the Republic compared to theUK(for example on diesel there is a price difference of about 29 pence (38%)per litre, as of January 2002) and the presence of sophisticated criminal groupswith experience in smuggling. 11 The illegal use of rebated fuel is also a problem in Northern Ireland, where in 2000-01 Customs found more laundering plants than on the mainland. Rebatedfuels may only be used for off road purposes and attract significantly reducedrates of duty, for example red diesel (on which the duty is 3.13 pence per litre) isused principally in construction and agriculture, and marked kerosene (on whichno duty is paid) is used in domestic heating. Laundering plants illegally removethe chemical markers and any dye from rebated fuels. The situation in NorthernIreland is inevitably affected by the political and civic situation in the Province.Figure 2 shows the revenue lost from the use of UK non-duty paid fuel in 20002 Petrol \u00a3millionDiesel \u00a3millionTotal \u00a3million Fraud and legitimate cross border Legitimate cross border shopping 1,500 380 1,880150 150300230 1,580Mainland UK Northern IrelandTotal NOTE Customs estimate that \u00a3900 million is lost from legitimate cross border shopping for diesel which means that the maximum amount of fraud in the United Kingdom could be\u00a3980 million in 2000.

Where itdoes happen, however, there are also health and safety risks, for example toferry passengers, if oil is transported in extra tanks which have not beenproperly secured. Although the normal tanks of vehicles can be filled withcheaper fuel on the continent, it is an offence to then remove this fuel later onfor use in other vehicles in the UK. This is known as decanting. 13 Customs see the illegal use of rebated fuels in road vehicles as the main risk they face on hydrocarbon oils duty on the UK mainland. Customs haveundertaken a number of intelligence led operations on the mainland and inNorthern Ireland to track duty - rebated supplies from the point of productionthrough the distribution system to detect and disrupt illicit consumption. 14 Red diesel and kerosene are chemically marked so that Customs can detect illegal use by testing samples from fuel tanks. We found that contrary toCustoms guidance, staff have placed too much reliance on sight tests to detectthe obvious presence of the dye in red diesel. 15 Fraudsters can use laundering techniques to remove the markers from red diesel and kerosene, or mix red diesel with other agents to mask the dye, making theuse of sight tests alone an ineffective method for detecting the illegal use of fuel.The chemicals used to launder fuel often remain in the fuel which can causeserious damage to engines. Figure 3 shows how Customs have developed their strategy for tackling frauds on oils duty (as at November 2001)3 ! Use of intelligence to target suspicious users of rebated fuel !

The Legitimate Oil Pressure Group consider that itmight be easier for Customs to detect those retail sites in Northern Irelandwhich are selling smuggled fuel if all normal duty paid fuel in Northern Irelandis chemically marked, but this would need to be looked into further. 17 Since 1999-2000, when Customs started to develop their strategy for tackling frauds on hydrocarbon oils duty in Northern Ireland, the amount of fuel seized byCustoms there has doubled and the number of vehicles seized involved insmuggling has more than tripled. But filling stations in Northern Ireland sellingillicit fuel, of which there are estimated to be over 400 involved to some extent,are often back in business after Customs have seized fuel from them. The NorthernIreland region of the Petrol Retailers Association is concerned that if Customs arenot more effective their members will continue to go out of business. 18 I provided my initial findings, conclusions and recommendations to Customs in June 2001. In November 2001, Customs published Tackling Indirect Tax Fraud which includes their outline strategy for tackling frauds on hydrocarbon oilsduty and their estimates of revenue losses. Main Conclusions and Recommendations 19 As part of their overall change in approach to tackling fraud, Customs published their estimates of the revenue losses on hydrocarbon oils duty. Theseestimates will assist them in identifying areas where the duty is at risk and todevelop their response. They are working further on their estimates as inNorthern Ireland, in particular, these include legitimate cross border shopping.The Government has outlined in Tackling Indirect Tax Fraud what Customs arecurrently doing to tackle oils fraud and possible new initiatives currently beingconsidered. I believe that these should include an assessment of the risks and resources. Some of the key elements under consideration by Customs include: !An authorisation scheme for the distributors of tied oils and rebated fuels; !A simultaneous strengthening of the obligations on distributors to takereasonable steps to check that sales of such fuels are made only tocustomers who intend to put them to an approved use; !Improved chemical and colour markings of rebated fuel to deter misuse; !Increased numbers of intelligence-led checks and investigations; !Tougher penalties against those engaged in the supply of fuels for illicitpurposes, or for those found using such fuel in road vehicles; and !A targeted publicity campaign designed to highlight the danger of fuelmisuse and the penalties for people caught misusing. 20 As part of Customs' continuing work to develop their strategy they are also: !Looking at whether the distribution of their resources between drugs, tobacco and other frauds is the optimum; !Considering outcomes-based targets for hydrocarbon oils duty; !As part of the Organised Crime Task Force in Northern Ireland, workingwith other public sector agencies on ways to tackle the supply and sale ofillicit fuel in Northern Ireland; 6executive summaryHM CUSTOMS AND EXCISE: THE MISUSE AND SMUGGLING OF HYDROCARBON OIL !Developing their intelligence data to provide anti-smuggling teams with profiles of vehicles and individuals that are most likely to be smuggling oil;and !Ensuring that their road fuel testers comply with departmental guidelines,that require them to carry out full chemical tests on all fuel samples, takinginto account other relevant factors. 21 In addition, I believe Customs should: !Examine whether it would be cost effective to chemically mark all duty paid fuel in Northern Ireland. This could act as a deterrent to smugglers andlaunderers of fuel; !Give fresh guidance to road fuel testing units to ensure that currentpenalties and sanctions are used to best effect in order to act as a sufficientdeterrent to others; and !Assess the effectiveness of measures taken by other European UnionMember States in the oils fraud sector.
