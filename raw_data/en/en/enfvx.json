(This review was NOT intended to address issues of defining personality disorder per se.) A therapeu tic community is 'a consciously-designed social environment and programme within a residential or day unit in which the social and group process is harnessed with therapeutic in tent. In the therapeutic community the community is the primary therapeutic instrument.'(Roberts 1997, p.4) The original bid call cited Rapoport's (1960) four general principles for defining a democratic therapeutic community, and although this report addresses the various forms of the therapeutic community, the focus of this research review has been on existing literature relating to the democratic therapeutic community, in the tradition of Tom Main and Maxwell Jones, in both psychiatric and other secure settings, and in non- secure psychiatric settings, and on those dealing specifi cally with people with personality disorders, and mentally disordered offenders. The call for bids asked specifically for a review of the international literature on the effectiveness of therapeutic communities in such settings, and with such client groups. This review has therefore concentrated on the research literatu re on effectiveness, and the main part of the report concentrates on post-treatment outcome studies of secure, and non-secu re democratic therapeutic communities, for people with personality disorders, and mentally disordered offenders. Because of their presence in the research literature, we also included hierarchical, or concept-based therapeutic communities. These are us ually for substance abusers, in both secure and non-secure settings, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric, although there are considerably more in the USA, Canada, and other parts of the world than in the UK. In addition to the research literature, the researchers ag reed to look at additional ways of finding research literature, and descriptive information about therapeu tic communities internationally. This was done by targeting 'grey' literature, and by identifying as many therapeutic communities nationally and internationally as possible. These were subsequently written to, along with known writers, or workers in this field, asking for any published or unpublished r esearch they might have, and, if possible, for information about their therapeutic community, and its principles, organisation and practices. Such a wide trawl also helped to reduce any possible publication bias in favour of positive results. This work was conducted, in accordance with Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidelines, in an explicit and structured manner, with clearly stated research objectives, and protocols guiding the work and criteria for describing the relevance and quality of identif ied research. The results of this literature review are presented in both narrative form and a meta-analysi s. This is because the quality of data presented, and 2 the analyses in the studies retrieved, enabled system atic meta-analysis only in part, while much of the literature was not numerically comparable. The therapeutic communities Most secure therapeutic communities admit male o ffenders only. Some concept-based therapeutic communities in women's prisons in the US are reported in the literature, usually as part of a large study which includes both men and women. Secure therapeu tic communities are located mainly within prison and correctional services. Of these, only HMP Grendon, in Buckinghamshire, England, is an entirely therapeutic community prison. Other therapeutic communities comprise small units inside larger mainstream prisons, although some German Social Th erapeutic Institutions have been established in separate secure premises outside prisons. Most democratic prison therapeutic communities specia lise in personality disorders and recidivism, whilst concept-based therapeutic communities are directed specifically at substa nce abuse, which usually refers to drug rather than alcohol use. However, there ar e overlaps here, since recent studies of concept-based therapeutic communities in the comm unity have suggested that there is a high level of co-morbidity between drug abuse and personality disorder, and between drug abuse and mental illnesses. The client information for non-secure democratic TCs varies according to the service context, is diverse, and not easily summarised, so is given in detail in the review. The service contexts described in the research literatu re on democratic non-secure settings are very varied. Many are located within the NHS, and often at the te rtiary level of provision. Abroad, the hospital-based therapeutic communities are described typica lly as part of a psychiatric hospital. Non-secure therapeutic communities, such as Henders on Hospital, might typically include psychopaths, sociopaths, personality disorders, and character diso rders. For example, in the Henderson Hospital, the majority are young people, with a lower age limit of 18. 87 per cent of residents meet DSM-IV-R criteria for borderline personality disorder, and 95 per cent met criteria for at least one Cluster B Axis II diagnoses. Treatment is usually voluntary. In secure therapeutic communities inmates are generally selected by staff. In other therapeutic communities selection is by the community, or by staff-patient assessment group. Inmates can leave if they choose to do so, or be e xpelled from the community for their behaviour. All units offer a daily or community meeting, democr acy or patient participation in decision-making and running the therapeutic community, and a predominance of group activities. Concept therapeutic communities are organised ve ry differently from democratic therapeutic communities. There is a large body of literature on concept-based therapeutic communities and their outcomes. Although not the main thrust of this re port, the relevant in-treatment and post-treatment outcome studies on the effectiveness of secure con cept-based therapeutic communities are analysed, while 3the non-secure concept-based outcome literature is also summarised. This is provided both for information, and for contrast. The findings We began with 8,160 articles and ot her literature, reduced to 294 broadl y covering the relevant area. 181 individual TCs were named in the literature found, in 38 different countries, of which most were in the UK or the USA. For our core focus on personality disorders/mentally abnormal offenders, there were 52 items on outcome studies of secure democratic TCs, 41 on outcome studies of non-secure TCs, and 20 items on outcome studies of secure concept-based TCs. There were onl y 10 RCTs of any sort, and 10 cross-institutional or comparative studies, and a further 32 studies using some kind of control. If we take the latter as the minimum level of rigour that is acceptable, then ther e were in total 52 acceptable studies, all of which are discussed in some detail at some point in the report. Of these 52, 41 relate to democratic type therapeutic communities. A meta-analysis was set up for the 52 studies with controls. 23 studies were excluded where the outcome criteria were unclear, where the raw numbers were not reported, or where the original sample was not clearly specified before attrition. Where there w as a choice of outcome measures and control groups, emphasis was placed on conservative criteria, such as reconviction rates rather than psychological improvements, and on non-treated controls. This redu ced the number of studies for the meta-analysis to 29. The analysis had two stages. Initially the odds-ratio s for the individual studies, and 95% confidence intervals, were calculated (Woolf ,1955, discussed in Kahn and Sempos, 1989, pp. 56-57). Subsequently, the odds-ratios were combined to produce a summary odds -ratio for the 29 studies, and subsections of them, also with confidence intervals for the 95% levels (Yusuf, et al, 1985, discussed in Petitti, 1994, pp. 100-102). Several points are worth making about the results. There is strong evidence for the effectiveness of therapeutic community treatment apparent from these studies. The odds-ratio measure used indicates that studies below one have a positive effect, those above one a negative effect, and those on or about one are neutral. However it is vital to consider the confid ence intervals for each study, to ascertain that the odds- ratio was unlikely to have happened by chance. Th is is conventionally expressed through the calculation of the range over which the result would be unlikely to have happened more than 5 times out of a 100 (the 95% confidence interval). 19 of the 29 studies indi cated a positive effect, within the 95% level of confidence. The remaining 10 studies all had confiden ce intervals which straddled the neutral score, of which 8 produced odds ratios above one. When summary odds-ratios are calculated across all 29 studies, as is the convention with meta-analyses, the strength of this finding is underlined. With a summary odds-ratio of 0.57, and an upper 95% confidence interval of 0.61, this set of studies gives very strong support to the effectiveness of therapeutic community treatment. A check can be made on this by grouping the studies. Odds ratios calculated separately for the RCTs, and for the democratic, con cept, and secure types of communities all show strong results, with upper confidence intervals well below one . It is important to note that the RCTs were 4scattered across the different types of community. This suggests that there was no one subset of studies that was strongly affecting the overall summary result: study expected observed varian ce sample odds confidence code 'E' - expected size ratio interval (95%) A1 26 - 2.54 A19 110 -10 20.68 352 0.614 .397 - .949 A2* - .98 6.86 122 1.446 - - .584 B12 8.85 245 0.439 .216 - .89 B62 2.33 -1.83 1.07 30 0.095 .01 - 1.95 B7* 13 2 50 - 5.88 .107 0.567 0.524 0.614 8 studies) 0.464 0.392 - 0.548 Democratic (As and Bs - 21 studies) 0.695 0.631 - 0.769 Secure (As and Es - 22 studies) 0.544 0.498 - 0.596 Concept (Es only - 8 studies) 0.318 0.271 - 0.374 Full details about these studies, identified by thier code numbers, can be found in the Main Appendix, 10.2. Conventionally, this meta-analytic data is presented graphically, as fo llows. An odds-ratio between zero and one indicates some positive effect, around one indicates a neutral effect, and above one indicates a negative 5effect. The overall sum, 0.567, is marked with the dotted line: 6Odds Ratios 0.5 1.0 1.5 Concept ===== 7Publication bias - a funnel plot Considerable efforts have been made to track down unpublis hed or 'grey' material for this report. In contrast to our expectations, very little turned up. Of concern in meta-analysis is the possibility that publication bias might occur as a result of negative or neutral findings bei ng either not submitted, or not accepted by journals. A check on any publication bias is provided by plotti ng the meta-analysis odds-ratios against sample size in a 'funnel plot'. The lower the sample size, the higher shoul d be the range of odds ratios reported, giving rise to a typical funnel shaped scattergram. The expectation is that a scattergram would reveal blank spots caused by unpublished findings, or 'lost' studies. The funnel plot for this meta-analysis does not suggest that this is the case: Funnel Plot 05001000150020002500 00 . 511 . 52 Odds RatiosSample Size 8Methodological issues Evaluating the effectiveness of therapeutic communities, towards the establishment of which this review has been primarily aimed, depends crucially on a clear understanding of what the therapeutic community is, the setting, whether secure or non-secure, in which it is delivered, and at which patients it is aimed. These elements are all evidently contestable, both with in a largely sympathetic literature, and within a smaller, hostile literature. British Mental Health Law has been ambivalent a bout psychopaths. Both the 1959 and 1983 Acts separate psychopathy from other conditions, a nd define it behaviourally, while holding a pessimistic view of treatment interventions. Gunderson,1994, p.12, suggests that 'personality disorder is a diagnosis whose construct (ie its meaning) has grown rapidly and ch anged dramatically during the past 25 years'. Recent official reports on work in this area have re flected these difficulties. For example the Reed Report on Psychopathic Disorder, 1994, states that 'the diverse meanings a ttached to psychopathic disorder often undermined the effectiveness of evaluation of treatme nt' (p.34). Conceptual expansion makes judgements about research reports difficult, especially if they are more than about fifteen years old. The definition of therapeutic communities has also been difficult. There are two main types of therapeutic communities: democratic and concept-based/hierarc hical. For some writers these are variations on a basically common theme (Sugarman, 1984) - one dealing with deeper intrapsychic change and the other with initial behavioural control; for others they have nothing in common but the name (Glaser, 1983). They have emerged from quite separate origins. In general the intensity, or dosage, of treatment is commonly recognised in the literature by differentiating between therapeutic community approaches and the therapeutic community proper. The former refers to a therapeutic approach across whole hospitals, whereas the latter refers to specia lised therapeutic communities dealing with a defined population. In addition, democratic type therapeutic communities de veloped in prisons or secure settings are inevitably influenced by the requirements of prison re gulations concerning security and control. The methodological issues arising from the studies re viewed are numerous. In the 1994 Cochrane Lecture, McPherson, 1994, pointed out that RCTs are important where there is obvious uncertainty, but that they should not be used where there are ethical problems, a lack of objective outcome measures, resistance from the field, or a reluctance to compare treatments. On these grounds we do not feel that there is any intrinsic reason why RCTs should not be mounted furt her for therapeutic commun ities. Why have so few well-designed studies been done? The ideal of an RCT has generated difficulties where it has been attempted. Perhaps the most famous attempt was the Clarke & Cornish, 1972, study undertaken over 25 years ago, but which, in the end, proved impracti cal, and generated a methodological alternative, the cross-institutional design. Some of the difficulties reported in the literatu re include treatment complexity, treatment dosage and treatment integrity, population selection, dropouts, effects decay, and diagnostic shift. On the basis of the positive meta-analysis results, it is suggested that in addition to further RCTs, a more complex cross-institutional study is undertaken, togeth er with further cost-offset studies to complement those few already developed. 9Discussion and research recommendations This systematic international literature review has le d us to conclude that therapeutic communities have not produced the amount or quality of research literature that we might have expected, given the length of time they have been in existence, and the quality of staff we know exists and has existed in therapeutic communities. This may be partly due to a lack of emphasis placed on research in the early days of therapeutic community development, and more recently to a lack of resources, in terms of finance, staff and adequate research methodologies, designs and instrume nts. However, it is clear that since the meta- analysis indicates that existing research is in favour of therapeutic communities, there should be more, and more good quality, and comparative, research on therap eutic communities, in order to confirm the case that therapeutic communities are effectiv e, especially since they are expensive. In addition there is clinical evidence that therapeutic communities produce changes in people's mental health and functioning, but this needs to be further complemented by good qua lity qualitative and quantitative research studies. Recommendation one There is meta-analytical and c linical evidence that therapeutic communities produce changes in people's mental h ealth and functioning, but this needs to be further complemented by good quality qualitative and quantitative research studies. There is accumulating evidence, albeit it at a low leve l of research, of the effectiveness and particular suitability of the therapeutic community model to the treatment of personality disorder, and particularly severe personality disorder. In the absence of conclusi ve evidence of the effec tiveness of any alternative treatment we ought to protect and develop those therapies which can demonstrate some efficacy in treating personality disorder. Recommendation two Further research on the effectiv eness of therapeutic communities for personality disorders is warranted. There is also evidence of the effi cacy of therapeutic communities, modi fied for prison security needs, in managing difficult prisoners, and significantly reduc ing serious prison discipline incidents after admission, including fire setting, violence, self-har m and absconding. The placement of a therapeutic community within a secure environment however poses some problems. There ar e often conflicts between the need to maintain security and control (which is regarded as the primary task of prisons) and the provision of therapeutic community treatment, sin ce therapeutic communities ideally devolve major decisions regarding organisation, rules, treatment, sanctions, admission and discharge, to its clients. Recommendation three The development of modified therapeutic communities in prisons in the USA and Germany has grown rapidly. The efficacy of this approach should be considered for a research-based demonstration programme in the UK. There is evidence that the longer a resident stays in treatment, the better the outcome. Very short stay residents do particularly badly. 10Recommendation four While a few communities, such as Winterbourne Day Hospital in Reading, are tackling this issue, small research projects should be mounted to identify ways of reducing drop-out rates. Why have so few well-designed studies been done? The ideal of an RCT has generated difficulties where it has been attempted. Perhaps the most famous attempt was the Clarke & Cornish, 1972, study undertaken over 25 years ago, but which in the e nd proved impractical, and generated a methodological alternative, the cross-institutional design. Recommendation five A cross institutional design for a study of therapeutic communities 'in the field' should be undertaken. Concept-based therapeutic commun ity research literature is quite considerable, although of varying quality. However, there is sufficient literature around to warrant a literature review and meta-analysis in its own right. Recommendation six A review of concept-based therap eutic community literature should be commissioned to complement the current review, with a concomitant meta-analysis based on the studies found. Globally, the modified therapeutic comm unity seems to be surviving, and proliferating best (especially in the USA) in prisons, and for substance abusers; a nd concept-based therapeutic communities appear to predominate, both in terms of numbers of therap eutic communities, and in amount of literature, and research generated - although again much of it is of variable quality and generalisability. Concept-based therapeutic communities have also exercised themselves much more than democratic therapeutic communities about the reasons and prevention of early drop-outs, or 'splittees'. The health service in the main, and particularly in Britain, seems to have negl ected the therapeutic community form of treatment, although there appears to be a resurgence of interest recently.

This review was required to look at therapeutic communities in psychiatric and other secure settings, particularly for people with personality disorder, and al so mentally disordered offenders. The original bid call cited Rapoport's, 1960, four general principles fo r defining a therapeutic community (these will be outlined later in this report). These relate to th e 'democratic therapeutic community proper', and although this report will address the various forms of the therap eutic community, the focus of this research review has been on existing literature relating to the democr atic therapeutic community, in the tradition of Tom Main and Maxwell Jones, in both psychiatric and other secure settings, and in non-secure psychiatric settings, and on those dealing specifically with people w ith personality disorders, and mentally disordered offenders. The call for bids also asked specifically for a review of the international literature on the effectiveness of therapeutic communities in such settings, and with such client groups. This review has therefore concentrated on the research literatu re on effectiveness, and the main part of the report concentrates on post-treatment outcome studies of secure, and non-secu re democratic therapeutic communities, for people with personality disorders, and mentally disordered offenders (Section 5.2.). In addition, there is also some evaluative literatu re on in-treatment outcome and these studies for secure and non-secure democratic therapeutic communities are al so described in Sections 5.2. Finally, there is also extensiveness outcome literature on democratic therapeutic commun ities for client groups other than those with personality disorders, and mentally disorder ed offenders, and this is reviewed briefly in this report (Section 6.). We feel it is important to take account of the fact that hierarchical, or concept-based therapeutic communities, usually for substance abusers, exist in both secure and non-secure settings, both psychiatric and non-psychiatric, although considerably more in th e United States of America, Canada, and other parts of the world than in the United Kingdom. These ther apeutic communities are organised very differently from democratic therapeutic communities. There is a large body of literature on concept-based therapeutic communities and their outcomes. Although not the main thrust of this report, the relevant in- treatment and post-treatment outcome studies on the effectiveness of secure c oncept-based therapeutic communities are analysed in Sections 5.3., while the non-secure concept-based outcome literature is summarised in Section 6. This is provided both for info rmation, and for contrast. This research literature is quite considerable, although of varying quality. However, there is sufficient literature around to warrant a literature review in its own right, and the mate rial we have collected could be used to this end. 13The bid call highlighted the fact that therapeutic co mmunities differ in the sense of both overall structure, as well as specific programme content. Identifying these core principles and practices is addressed in three ways in this report. Firstly, section 3. looks at the overall bac kground and context of therapeutic communities . It looks at issues around defining what is a therapeutic commun ity; the types of therapeutic communities; how therapeutic communities philosophies, principles and pr actice have been modified to fit the needs of particular groups of clients, or the requirements of factors like security; and where therapeutic communities are, and have been, located internationally. Secondly, this report contains a descriptive secti on on the therapeutic community, based on a summary of the literature gathered for the research outcome review (Section 5.1.). The original bid call cited the following aims for this literature review:- i) identify the settings, their regimes and the way in which they defined themselves ii) the populations of the communities and the regimes should be described with details of the standards, standard monitoring and outcome indi cators including in the short, medium and long term iii) additionally, the catchment area, selection cr iteria and links with other services should be described as well as the degree to which it is provi ded as part of an integrated range of services iv) describe the types of care procedures present in the therapeutic process and identify research evidence about their effectiveness v) describe what procedures to support the regi me are used and identify evidence about their effectiveness vi) describe, as far as possible, the roles of diffe rent disciplines and descriptions of disciplines, as well as the support structures operated, with reference to multi-disciplinary working Thirdly, these same areas were surveyed in a sampl e of secure and non-secure democratic therapeutic communities, and the three Special Hospitals - Broadmoor, Rampton and Ashworth, either by visit, or by postal survey. These survey visits are outlined in Additional Appendix 11.2. In addition to the above, the researchers agreed to look at additional ways of finding research literature, and descriptive information about therapeutic commun ities internationally, in both secure and non-secure settings. This was done by targeting 'grey' lite rature, and by identifying as many therapeutic communities nationally and internationally as possibl e. These were subsequently mailshot, along with known writers, or workers in this field, asking for any published or unpublished research they might have, and, if possible, for information about their therap eutic community, and its principles, organisation and 14practices. These methods and findings are summarised in Section 4, and described in Additional Appendix 11.3. Any additional findings, or relevant material or informa tion is included either in Section 6., or in the Main Appendices. This work was conducted in an explicit and structured manner, with clearly stated research objectives, and protocols guiding the work and criteria for describi ng the relevance and quality of identified research. These are described firstly, in Section 4., in the report on searches, and the search appendices (Main Appendix 10.3); and, secondly, in Section 4., in the section on sorting and cataloguing of the research literature, and the reasons for the decisions. The results of this literature review are presented in narrative form, as well as through a meta-analysis of a sub-section of this literature, in Section 5. An overview of the research literature, together with observations about, and critiques of, the quality of the research literature, and particularly the methodologies used, and recommendations for future research are provided in Section 7. 152 OBJECTIVES AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS The literature on the nature and effectiveness of ther apeutic communities is fairly scattered, both within the UK and abroad . It was also felt likely that signifi cant material is held in the form of unpublished, or 'grey' literature known chiefly to the staff of indi vidual communities, or to networks of communities associated through organisations such as the Associa tion of Therapeutic Communities (and its sister organisation in Holland and elsewhere in Europe), the Planned Environment Therapy Trust, the World Federation of Therapeutic Communities, or the Society for Psychotherapy Research. The existing state of knowledge in therapeutic comm unities in psychiatric and other secure settings is patchy. A useful range of material has now accumulated in the International Journal of Therapeutic Communities , now Therapeutic Communities , since its foundation in 1980. There are also many references to therapeutic communities in related journa ls in psychiatry and psychology. In addition, for example, the Index Medicus has had a therapeutic community sec tion since 1969, as has the SSCI since 1976. Both have reported around 20 papers a y ear since then (see Manning, 1989 p. 50). Much of the literature on therapeutic communities h as been descriptive of regimes and populations, but the identification of which internal processes are most effective, and the demonstration of effectiveness with standard methodologies has been weak (see Manning, 1979b, for an explanation). Many such studies can be found for example in the International Journal of Th erapeutic Communities/Therapeutic Communities . The situation for therapeutic communities in secure settings is a little stronger, though by no means good (see Dolan and Coid, 1993, and B.50. Warren and Dolan, 1996, for recent summaries). 2.1 Research Objectives (i) To review the existing international literatu re on therapeutic communities in secure and some non- secure settings. (ii) To identify existing therapeutic communities in ternationally in secure settings and some non-secure settings, and to obtain information from a sample of these on their practice and research. (iii) To analyse the material (from published, 'grey' and unpublished sources) for information on treatments, populations, treatment outcomes, monitori ng procedures, care procedures, support structures and service integration. (iv) To evaluate the extent, nature, va lidity and reliability of the existing research. (v) To inform policy decisions and further research. 162.2 Questions addressed A.

We then designed a list of keywords, to form the bases of our searches, and designed the data extraction manuals, and a protocol for the research work. We conducted electronic database searches for relevant references to the lite rature; hand-searched relevant journals, and key books, and other reference volumes; we visited key library sites; we mailshot therapeutic communities, and writers and researchers on therapeutic communities, worl d-wide; we visited or surveyed key therapeutic communities in Britain; and we searched the Internet. We then retrieved all references that looked rele vant. These were then sorted according to our exclusion/inclusion criteria. The remaining references were then sorted into treatment outcome, and non- treatment outcome. All references were then catalogue d. We then set aside the core references on in- treatment and post-treatment outcome, and review articles of studies on post-treatment outcome, for democratic therapeutic communities in secure a nd non-secure settings, and for secure concept-based therapeutic communities. These ar ticles were then data extracted, both for descriptive material on therapeutic communities, based on the data extracti on sheets, and for evaluative research findings. The descriptive findings have then been described in narrative form. The outcome research findings are relayed in both narrative and tabular form. The findi ngs have then been summarised, and criticised, and some meta-analysed. Research recommendations have then been made on the basis of these findings. 183 BACKGROUND 3.1 Therapeutic communities 3.1.1. History of Therapeutic Communities Therapeutic communities inside the secure environments of prisons and special hospitals began in 1962 at Grendon Prison in England (A.9. Genders & Player, 1995) and, following visits by Maxwell Jones to the USA, in the early 1960's in America (E.19. Wexler & Love, 1994). Whilst the first wave of therapeutic communities in the USA was fairly short-lived, Gr endon is still operating as a therapeutic community prison. Subsequent therapeutic communities in US prisons have mainly been concept-based (see below). In the UK, the democratic model has become th e dominant one, with therapeutic communities being established in several prisons. Some of these have now closed (e.g. Barlinnie Special Unit and the therapeutic community in Glen Parva Young Offenders Institute), but there is still a small but thriving core of secure therapeutic communities, mainly aimed at personality disordered offenders. Some special hospitals in the UK (Ashworth) and Europe (Dr. He nri Van Der Hoeven - A36b. van Emmerik, 1987) also contain democratic therapeutic communities . The democratic therapeutic community literature re fers to Tom Main coining the term 'therapeutic community' in the 1940s, as a result of 'the second Nort hfield experiment' (Birmingham) (B.12. Dolan, Evans & Wilson, 1992), with soldiers suffering from wa r neuroses; then going on to develop and facilitate social and group processes within the hospital community, in order to help the men help each other; and finally developing the therapeutic community at Cassel Hospital, London (B.32. Schimmel, 1997, p.120). It also credits Main, along with Maxwell Jones a nd Stuart Whiteley at the Henderson Hospital, London, with promoting the concepts and practice of th erapeutic community treatment and rehabilitation programmes worldwide (B.32. Schimmel, 1997, p.120). Maxwell Jones is also credited with developing the therapeutic community as a widely followed model for the treatment of psychopaths (B.45. Whiteley, 1975, p.164). Piper, Rosie, Joyce & Azim, 1996, (B.29.) highlight th e distinction between the therapeutic community as an atmosphere created in a hospital by a particular a pproach to patients, and as a radical reorganization of structure within a circumscribed psychiatric treatment . These smaller psychiatric units (generally fewer than 100 patients) were run according to Rapoport's (B.30. Rapoport, 1960, pp.54-64) four principles of democratization, permissiveness, communalism and r eality confrontation, which combined to produce a culture of living-learning (see below). There was maximum opportunity for examination and understanding of patients' behaviour s in relationship to each other and toward authority figures and institutions. The environment also fostered patie nts' experimentation with behaviour change. These ideas were pursued through the operation of multiple gr oups: patient-patient groups , staff member-patient groups, staff member-staff member groups; and the daily community meeting, which all patients and staff members were required to attend. The patients and lay therapists with no tr aining assumed responsibility equal to the trained staff members and psychiatrists. Patients voted on issues such as admission and discharge of patients. The units were, in part, a re volt against the perceived abuse of power by existing 19institutions. They were also a radical attempt to shift the responsibility for recovery from the physician- superintendent to the patient. (B.29. Piper, Rosie, Joyce & Azim 1996 pp.14-16). Denford, Schachter, Temple et al, 1983, (B.10) suggest that the type of therapeutic community typified in Maxwell Jones's work focuses exclusively on group in teractions, and is based on the assumption that changing the social milieu may bri ng about individual change, whereas Main's therapeutic community, as typified by the Cassel Hospital, combines and integrat es this therapeutic community work with individual psychotherapy, and emphasises the importance of this in understanding and using the transference which the patient develops to the institution. In the past, th is model also used the termination of treatment as an important focus of therapy, a strategy which di scouraged routine follow-up (although this practice has been modified recently) (B.10. Denford, Schachter, Temple et al, 1983, p.225). Schimmel, 1997, (B.32.) describes the period of widesp read popularity and influence of the therapeutic community worldwide, and then its decline in impor tance and relevance and the closure of many units, with particular reference to Australia and New Z ealand (B.32. Schimmel, 1997, pp. 120-121). He also suggests that understandings about what constitutes optimal therapeutic community treatment have changed over time (B.32. Schimmel, 1997, p.123). Ba sed on experiences in Holland, Schimmel suggests that there is a trend towards 'shorter duration of stay and a decreasing influence of group-dynamic theorems in favour of psychodynamic and person-orient ed diagnostic therapeutic approaches' (B.32. Schimmel, 1997, p.123). Hafner & Holme, 1996, (B.15) also argue that, although early therapeutic communities were designed to treat a range of psychi atric disorders, their focus shifted progressively toward treating substance abuse disorder, which is now the main emphasis. They add that a few therapeutic communities still treat psychiatric illness in general, and several of these specialise in personality disorders (B.15. Hafner & Holme, 1996, p.461). Secure concept-based therapeutic communities are mainly to be found in the USA, where the concept- based approach has become dominant. Prison c oncept-based therapeutic communities began in the 1960's with Asklepieion at Marion Prison, Illinois (A .58. Paddock & Scott, 1973) and others followed. This first wave of prison concept-based therapeutic communities died down in the 1970's, partly because of organisational problems. An influential research review by Martinson in 1974 argued that 'nothing works' in treating criminals, and th is marked a down-turn in interest and funding for prison rehabilitation. In 1977, the Stay'n Out prison therapeutic community programme was established on Staten Island, New York, and since then concept-b ased therapeutic communities for dr ug-abusers have become widely established in American prisons (E.19. Wexler & Love, 1994). Elsewhere, concept-based therapeutic communities have been established as small units in existing prisons, but not on the same scale as in the USA. Concept-based therapeutic communities in prisons ar e modelled on similar therapeutic communities in the community, such as Synanon, in California, which wa s the original concept-based therapeutic community established by Chuck Dederich in the late 1950' s (Yablonsky, 1965). The model was extended and refined by Phoenix House in New York, and copied by many other establishments throughout the USA and Europe. They are usually organised into three st ages, or Phases, which are designed firstly to orient new entrants to the hierarchical culture of the th erapeutic community and its rules, which are geared 20towards drug users learning to behave and feel like non-drug users. Secondly, is a phase involving working in-house, and taking increasi ng responsibility within the community, and particularly for therapy and confrontation, and the final phase involves re -entry into the community, leading to successful graduation. These concept-based therapeutic commun ities focus almost exclusively on drug abusers. Most of the concept-based therapeu tic communities described in the studi es used in this review are based inside mainstream prisons, although the 're-entry' hou ses, which provide gradual re-integration into the community, are based outside. (For full findings on the history of therapeutic co mmunities taken from the analysed outcome literature, see Main Appendix 10.5. 3.1.2. Definitions A wide variety of institutions describe themselves as therapeutic communities, including day hospitals, in- patient settings, secure hospitals a nd prisons (B.50. Warren & Dolan, 1996, p.206). It is accepted in the field that self-definition is one, but not the sole, criterion for defining a therapeutic community. It is possible, but unlikely, that therapeutic communities ex ist without being aware of the overall field; it also possible, and perhaps probable, that therapeutic comm unities claim to exist within the field which others would not accept. What criteria would these othe rs use to identify a therapeutic community? A starting point is to consider the origins of the term therapeutic community. Manning, 1989 (D.68) (chapter 1) has traced these origins in detail. They came out of a general critique of existing mental hospital provision, and the perceived damaging effect s these could have on patients. Even as early as the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, Pinel in France and Tuke in the UK had argued that there should be a humane 'moral treatment' of the insane. In particular, those social effects that could damage patients in residential care might be turned round and harnessed for their improvement. Two particular streams of work developed in the 1940s in the UK to move this general idea into a specific treatment modality. Tom Main coined the term 'therapeutic community' in the 1940s, as a result of 'the second Northfield experiment' in Birmingham with soldie rs suffering from war neuroses. He subsequently developed and facilitated social and group processes with in the hospital community, in order to help the men help each other, and finally developed the th erapeutic community at Cassel Hospital, London. Maxwell Jones is also credited with developing th e therapeutic community in the 1940s, initially as a means of dealing with soldiers experiencing 'effort syndrome', then as a unit funded by the Ministry of Labour for the 'work shy', and ultimately as a widely followed model for the treatment of psychopaths, first at the Belmont Social Rehabilitation Unit, and subsequently the Henderson Hospital at Belmont. These two origins help to identify some of the variety that has developed in the field: first is the difference between the intensive, small, in-patient therap eutic community 'proper'and therapeutic community 'approaches' to humanising whole hospitals (Clark, 1964). In US terms, the attempt to humanise whole hospitals, and to utilise the general social environment has come to be decribed as 'milieu therapy' (B.32. Schimmel, 1997, p.121), although this can shade into more specific and intensive inpatient units. A second split can also be detected between those, such as Maxwell Jones, who stressed a social model of 21environmentally and situationally induced change, and those taking a deeper and more psychodynamic approach to inter-psychic reconstruction (Edelson, 1970). A further development has been the invention of a second general stream of 'concept-based or hierachical' therapeutic communities in the US since the 1950s. These are all of the intensive in-patient type, but have been explicitly targeted at the addi ctions, and have been or ganised on an explicitly non- psychodynamic model of closely monitored and highl y intrusive social conditioning, designed to get people off drugs and to provide a complete break with their past lifestyle. Nevertheless there are a number of general points we can make that encompass the general range of therapeutic communities. The ther apeutic community is essentially a p.168; B.46. Whiteley, 1990, p.892). This means that patients are totally immersed in the treatment environment, so that all of their daily be haviour, emotional and physical state can be observed, and challenged as appropriate through intensive group experiences. In addition they are encouraged to experiment with alternative 'corrective emotiona l experiences' (B.46. Whiteley, 1990, p.886). the therapeutic comm unity as 'a consciously-designed social environment and programme within a residential or day unit in which the social and group process is harnessed with therapeutic intent. In the therapeutic community the co mmunity is the primary therapeutic instrument.'(Roberts, 1997, p.4) A widely used cumulative definition of a therapeutic community is: 1. A group of people who live together or meet t ogether regularly and participate together in a range of purposeful tasks - therapeutic , domestic, organisational, educational ... who may have 2. intimate, informal, non-hierarchical relationships and 3. regular and frequent sharing of inform ation between all members of the group. ... it's not yet a therapeutic community, but will begin to be so if there is 4. a shared commitment to the goal of learning from the experience of living and/or working together ... it will be further developed by 5. a shared commitment to open examination and resolution of problems, tensions and conflicts with the group (a culture of enquiry) ... and theoretically informed by 226. bringing a psychodynamic awareness of individual and group process to bear on this examination ... all of which requires 7. A clear set of boundaries concerning time, place and roles within which the above can take place. (D.22. Kennard, 1994, p.109) There is also empirical evidence for a consistent difference between therapeutic communities and other programmes. For example, Price and Moos, 1975, undertook a large scale survey of 144 psychiatric treatment programmes, using their Ward Atmosphere Scale to identify differences in terms of social relationships, treatment, and system maintenance. Six types emerged (see Manning, 1989, p.33, Figure 2.1.). From these six types, a clear profile emerge d for therapeutic communities: '... this programme cluster strikingly resembles the type of milieu th erapy described by Maxwell Jones, 1952, as the 'therapeutic community' in that high patient invol vement and a strong therapeutic orientation are emphasised, but little explicit staff control is exercised' (Price and Moos, 1975, p. 184). 3.1.3. Types of therapeutic communities Underlying the various origins of therapeutic comm unities and the relative emphasis on socio- or psycho- therapy, the literature coalesces around two basic ty pes of therapeutic community in operation. Democratic therapeutic communities, based on the model developed by Maxwell Jones at the Henderson Hospital (Rapoport, 1960) often regard themselv es as 'real' therapeutic communities, and their practitioners may reject other organisational forms. However, concept-based therapeutic communities, mainly for substance abusers, which are based on th e model developed by Chuc k Dederich at Synanon in California (Yablonsky, 1965), thrive particularly in the United States. Indeed world-wide there are many more of the latter in operation. These, too, regard themselves as therapeutic communities, sometimes, but not always, qualifying this with the term ' concept-based ' or 'hierarchical'. Because of this adoption of the term by both types of therapeutic community, it is not always clear from the studies, which type is being described. Gene rally however, concept-based therapeutic communities are aimed exclusively at substance abusers, and have structured treatment programmes, whereby clients work their way through a succession of phases, ending with re-entry into the wider community, and 'graduation' from the programme. Democratic therapeutic communities are aimed at a range of mental illnesses, in which substance abuse, if it is present, is considered a symptom rather than the core issue. Though the democratic therapeutic community will gene rally have a closely structured daily timetable, arranged around a series of different meetings, groups and activities, progress through treatment is less clearly structured and demarcated. 23Rapoport's four core treatment values (permissive ness, communalism, democratisation and reality confrontation), developed in his study of the Hende rson Hospital (B.30. Rapoport, 1960), are widely used to encapsulate the therapeutic community proper, or democratic, non-hierarchical, as developed by Maxwell Jones (B.50 Warren & Dolan, 1996, p. 207). Rapoport gives the following definitions: permissiveness all members should tolerate from one anothe r a wide degree of behaviour that might be distressing or seem deviant by ordinary standards communalism there should be tight-knit, intimate sets of re lationships, with shared amenities, use of first names, and free communications democratisation every member of the community (residents and staff) should share equally in the exercise of power in decision making about community affairs reality confrontation residents should be continually presented with interpretations of their behaviour as it is seen by others, in order to counteract their tendency to distort, deny or withdraw from their difficulties in getting on with others. (B.30. Rapoport, 1960, pp.54-64) The model used in the hierarchi cal concept-based houses or concept- based therapeutic communities was developed in the United States. In these communities, the hierarchy is keener and more authoritarian, and the social organisation is a family surrogate system , with vertically stratified authority, and is more autocracy than democracy. These communities are par ticularly aimed at substance abusers, the staff members may themselves be ex-addicts and the commun ities aim to keep each member 'clean' by using very confrontative encounter groups (B.50. Warren & Dolan, 1996, p.207) There has been some debate about the extent to which the two types might be variations on a common theme, with the possibility of theoretical integration, or two really rather different endeavours, that happen to use a common name. There have been five proposals for considering some integration of the two types. Two are by Maxwell Jones (1979, 1984), doyen of the democratic tradition, published in US addiction journals, normally the province of the concept-based tradition. Three are from authors in the concept- based tradition, including the most prolific research wr iter in this area, De Leon (1983; also Rubel et al, 1982; Sugarman, 1984), and published in the International Journal of Therapeutic Communities , province of the democratic tradition. The arguments are that (a ) both types are basically democratic or peer driven, albeit with strong constraints, (b) that concept-b ased therapeutic communities are widening their client target and becoming very professionalised, and (c) that they are really addressing different stages of a single maturational cycle - concept-based therapeu tic communities designed for early containment and behavioural change, and democratic therapeutic communities designed for later intrapsychic reconstruction. The third general type of therapeutic community a nd ideology has an older tradition from the field of education , and a different client group of children and adolescents. This is a wide field (comprehensively 24documented by Bridgeland, 1971), including penal reformatories, learning disability institutions, progressive education, public schools, and, more recen tly, the general field of maladjusted children and special education. Within this rather loose collec tion of concerns, there is a line of development which leads from Homer Lane to David Wills and the Pl anned Environment Therapy Trust (PETT). Lane's principles were expressed through two central structur al elements in the Little Commonwealth, to advise on the foundation of which he came to England in 1913. These elements are that, firstly, each member pay their own way through wages earned in work w ithin the community (the Economic Scheme), and secondly, the democratic management of the community by all members in the Citizen's Court. Given Lane's influence over subsequent pioneers such as A. S. Neill, Lane can perhaps be acknowledged as the actual originator of modern therapeutic community practice, despite its apparent re-invention by both Maxwell Jones and Chuck Dederich. Nevertheless, the ideas remained within the education field, and came to be most vigorously expressed by David Wills, while the most systematic expression of his principles has been through PETT. PETT has come to acknowledge the intellectual vigour of writing stemming from the democratic tradition, in a manner re miniscent of the intellectual crossover between the concept-based and democratic streams (e.g. see Vol. 3. of Studies in Environmental Therapy, 1979, PETT) (Manning, 1989, pp.38-41). Clark made an early distinction between the therap eutic community 'proper', in which a specific small ward, unit or hospital is designed explicitly to make the social environment the main therapeutic tool, and the therapeutic community approach (Clark, 1965). In the latter case, Main's ideas were applied to a whole hospital, where patients were drawn from a catchment area, with mixed diagnoses, and were referred from G.P.s, and where there were a high number of referrals per year. A similar distinction was drawn by Crocket, 1966, between the general ther apeutic community in which individual (including physical) treatments were merely supplement by community and group methods, and the 'psycho-therapeutic community' in which such methods were the exclusive means of treatment. (Manning, 1989, pp.30-32) Secure therapeutic communities are inevitably modified to suit prison requirements of security and control, so that therapeutic timetables are arrange d around prison timetables of work, association, eating and lock-up. Some therapeutic community prisons, wh ich are independent of mainstream prisons, such as MHP Grendon, and some of the German Social Ther apeutic Institutions, are able to modify prison timetables and regulations slightly to accommodate therapeutic activities, whereas small therapeutic community units inside mainstream prisons cannot do this. Nevertheless, security and control are overriding features of prison environments, and the pl acement of a therapeutic co mmunity within a secure environment poses some problems for the therapeutic in tegrity of the therapeutic community regime, in terms of a conflict between control and democracy. At the same time, one of the main positive effects of running a prison therapeutic community is to break dow n the traditional roles which prisoners and officers create for themselves and each other - enshrined in the terms 'cons' and 'screws'. Prisoners are able to give up the need to impress their peers. (Kennard, 1983, p.58). 3.1.4. Locations world-wide 25Initially, we combed all the references we had collected, to gain a global overview of the number of therapeutic communities mentioned in the literature. Overall, we found 765 references (i.e. articles) covering 38 countries; of these 409 were for democra tic therapeutic communities, and 356 were concept- based. For the literature analysed fo r the main report, globally we found 294 references/articles. In these we found 181 references to named therapeutic communitie s, of which 106 were to democratic therapeutic communities, and 75 to concept- based therapeutic communities. Overall, for this review, most references (i.e. articl es) are for the UK and the USA, and most therapeutic communities are in the UK and USA. However, if we look at the types of therapeutic community, while the UK has produced more articles than the USA, and have roughly the same number of therapeutic communities referred to, when we look at concept- based therapeutic communities, and particularly concept-based therapeutic commun ities in secure settings, the USA dominates the field, in terms of number of articles and number of therapeutic communities referred to. However, the number of concept-based articles are dominated by both a few concept-b ased therapeutic communities, such as Stay'n Out, and CREST (prison therapeutic communities), and by a few authors, such as De Leon, Wexler, Inciardi, Condelli, etc. (More extensive details of the above are included in Main Appendix 10.5.). 3.2 Personality disorders 3.2.1. Definitions The definitions described here are based on the defin itions used mainly in the therapeutic community outcome research literature. This is therefore NOT a complete review of the definitions of psychopathy/personality disorder, nor wa s this the remit of this review. One of the issues for future therapeutic community research, therefore, is to a ddress more accurate and contemporary descriptions of the client groups treated. For a r ecent discussion of definitions of pe rsonality disorder, see Duggan, 1999. The traditional category used for patients of the type included in this review was psychopath . The Mental Health Act definition of psychopathy is 'a persistent disorder or disability of mind (whether or not including subnormality of intelligence) which results in abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct on the part of the patient and requires or is susceptible to medical treatment' (B.45. Whiteley, 1975, p.159). Whiteley also quotes McCord & McCord's , 1956, definition as 'an antisocial, aggressive, highly impulsive person who feels little or no guilt and who is unable to form lasting bonds of affection with other human beings', and Wootton's, 1959, de finition as 'extremely selfish persons and no-one knows what makes them so'. There is no universally accepted concept of psychopathic disorder , nor of what constitutes psychopathic behaviour, so it remains a diffuse and ill-defined diso rder of social behaviour, and that, therefore, treatment of so-called psychopaths is also understanda bly controversial. Whiteley, 1975, p. 159 (B.45.) notes Walker's 1968 view that the diagnosis of psychopa thy is no more than a social device to deflect 26towards psychiatric treatment an offender against society whom it seems inappropriate to deal with punitively. More recently, there has been rapid development of the categorisation of personality disorder , of which psychopathy is a sub-group (anti-social personality disord er, DSM-IV-R - Cluster B sub-type). Piper, Rosie, Joyce & Azim 1996 (B.29.) define personality disorder as an enduring, pervasive and inflexible pattern of inner experience and behaviour that results in functional impairments and subjective distress. Its stability of traits and long-term duration, and ther efore persistence of diagnosis, suggest that it is not changed easily. Personality disordered patients show poor compliance with treatment and poor treatment outcome. There is little evidence of spontaneous remission for people with personality disorders. Personality disordered patients manifest high co-morbi dity within the many Ax is II personality disorders (24-76% in the literature). For co-morbid patients, resistance to change not only characterises their personality disorder, but their other disorders as we ll, and they present a considerable challenge to workers in the mental health field. It is important to note that there may be cross-cultu ral differences in definitions of personality disorder and psychopathy, and in understandings of what patients are included in these diagnostic categories, even if the underlying incidence does not vary cross-cultu rally. For example, Kobal & Zagar, 1994, (B.19.) describes an open forensic unit in Slovenia, and divides severe personality disorders into three sub- groups - psychotic patients subject to security measur es; those coming from prison in order to have their dissocial behaviour modified, usually after severe suicide attempts; individuals with psychological disorders that are more evident on the social level. However, Vaglum, Friis, Irion et al, 1990, (B.33.) state that the validity of the DSM-III Axis II eleven categories of personality disorder is unclear (p. 161): and the use of the categories `no personality disorder' and are heterogeneous, with extensive overlap (p.170). The fact that many patients with personality disorders also have different Axis I disorders makes it more difficult to validate Axis II disorders, and the difference between Axis I and Axis II disorders, and there is also a lack of validity studies that control for Axis I disorders (B.33. Vaglum, Friis, Irion et al, 1990, p.161). In addition, it may be impossible to discr iminate between no personality disorder and other personality disorder patients at admission on the bases of symptom level only (B.33. Vaglum, Friis, Irion et al, 1990, p.171). 27Personality disorders occur in 10% of the general population, and their prevalence has been shown to increase with the security of treatment setting, such that they represent 20% of general practice surgery attendees, 30% of psychiatric outpatients and 40% of psychiatric in-patients (B.50 Warren & Dolan, 1996, p.206). In addition, personality disorder as a primary diagnosis represents 8.4% of first psychiatric in- patient admissions in the U.K. and 7.2% of all mental hospital admissions (B.50. Warren & Dolan, 1996, p.206). A high prevalence of personality disorder has been demonstrated in the prison population, with studies reporting the presence of any personality disorder in 12% of male and 28% of female remand prisoners; 76% of women in Holloway medical unit; and 86% of me n in special units for difficult prisoners (B.50. Warren & Dolan, 1996, p.206). The unmet need for treat ment in prison populations is indicated in Maden et al's 1994 large cross sectional survey of psychiatric disorder and the treatment needs of over 2000 sentenced prisoners, which estimated that 5% of men and 8% of women imprisoned in Britain were suitable for therapeutic community treatment. These percentages represent some 1920 men and 80 women in the entire sentenced prison population (based on samples of 1:20 and 1:4 respectively (B.50 Warren & Dolan, 1996, p.206). In addition, people with severe personality disorders have usually had notoriously high service usage; they tend to 'suck in' services in a reactive and unproduc tive way; they often have failed to engage in other forms of therapy; and the severity of their acting out behaviour means they are not contained in out-patient settings; many have a history of repeated c ontacts with psychiatric, social, forensic, penal and probation services, while evidence suggests that the spontaneous remission of personality disorders is uncommon (B.55. Menzies, Dolan & Norton, 1996). B.50. (Warren & Dolan, 1996) also states that people with personality disorder are often described as 'sucking in services in response to a crisis', and many could be described as 'abusers' of services rather than 'users ' (B.50 Warren & Dolan, 1996, p.206). B.45. (Whiteley, 1975) lists alternativ e explanations of the aetiology of psychopathy : - 1. the physical approach - due to an organic defect, probably innate, of the moral sense; 2. the hereditary approach - hereditary f actors, such as mesomorphic build, or chromosomal abnormalities; 3. organic disease of the brain, such as encephalitis, temporal lobe epilepsy, or brain damage in the womb or at birth; 4. the psychodynamic approach - ego strength is weak in relation to the overwhelming id; personality and emotional development is seen as immature; the ps ychopath is fixated at a proto-phallic level where sex is not yet differentiated, and there is no devel oped super-ego; the psychopath is egocentric, unable to empathise, sees people only as objects, is manipulative, and unable to delay gratification; 5. the sociological approach - includes the use of the term sociopath, and emphasises pathological social processes, and the behavioural aspects of psychopathy as a defence against breakdown into mental illness; deficiency of role-playing ability; actively seeking to avoid relationships. 28The therapeutic community outcome research literature refers little to mentally disordered offenders, per se. However, for the purpose of this review, we ha ve defined mentally disordered offenders as follows: people convicted of criminal offences, who are judged to have a mental illness. Where the offence is judged to have been caused by the disorder, the individual may be directed into psychiatric care. Otherwise the individual, if given a custodial sentence, will go to pris on. The literature often distinguishes between mentally disordered offenders and criminals with personality disord ers, and this distinction is also found in practice, often on the grounds that whereas mental disorder is thought to be treatable, personality disorder is thought to be fixed. This in itself is debated. 3.2.2. Dual diagnosis/co-morbidity Numbers of inmates in concept-b ased therapeutic communities, whose reason for referral is seen to be drug abuse, are also found to have personality disorders. In the USA, such clients have become known as mentally ill chemical abusers or MICAs. Resear ch suggests that MICAs cause special problems for therapeutic communities and that those with the most serious personality disorders are also those who leave early (Sacks et al.,1997). Wexler 1997 (E.32) reports that 52% of the inmat es of Amity in-prison concept-based therapeutic community were also found to have antisocial personality disorder. 294 METHODS 4.1 Report on searches 4.1.1. Introduction Searches of the Cochrane Library databases failed to locate any similar reviews already undertaken or in progress (see Appendix 10.3.1). From the outset, the Review team recognised the need for a flexible approach to the literature searches, marrying the basic principles of a 'classic' systematic review with the application of pre-existing specialist knowledge, in a manner sensitive to the topic. In par ticular, it was accepted that much important material in this field is not very recent, and so a fairly long historical perspective would have to be taken: no fixed start date was initially established, so we were immediately faced with wide variations in date coverage as between databases, journals and other sources of information. In order to cope with this, and in the light of the scattered and cross-disciplinary nature of the available literature, it was decided to create a framework by undertaking citation searches of a number of books on therapeutic communities, published between 1974 and 1997 (see Appendix 10.3.2 and Section 9. References and Bibliography). Furthermore, the significance of the International Journal of Therapeutic Communities/Therapeutic Communities as a focal point and information exchange for the international network of therapeutic communities led to a decision to institute a full hand-search of this journal, including citations. This preliminary work enabled system atic rankings to be established for the different disciplines in which material might be located (see Appendix 10.3.2. for fuller details). This list of major subject areas was then used to generate lists of: databases to be sear ched (see Section 4.1.2. below and Appendix 10.3.4; journals to be hand-searched (see Section 4.1.3.1. be low and Appendix 10.3.5), a nd key library sites to be visited (see Section 4.1.3.3. below and Appendix 10.3.6). In addition, preliminary lists were drawn up for calls for information to: professional organisations; research institutes and other relevant bodies; aut hors; therapeutic communities (see Appendix 11.3). Inevitably, electronic databases constitute the main s ource of information for any systematic review, and therefore searching these formed the bulk of Level On e work (see below, section 4.2 for a definition of levels of selection). However, it was also necessary to concentr ate a significant part of the project's resources on hand-searching the widest possible range of journals (both English- and foreign-language); on visiting a number of key sites in the UK (both libraries and active therapeutic communities); on UK and international calls for information via direct contacts with individuals and therapeutic communities; and on INTERNET searches. 30Each of these sources of information is outlined br iefly below (therapeutic community visits being covered in Appendix 11.2.; calls for information in A ppendix 11.3), with details of the criteria applied in gathering material, comments on any difficulties encount ered, and some conclusions as to the value of each of these sources to the present Review. At this Le vel, these conclusions are confined to volume and relevance of material found: quality of materi al is addressed in the Level Two analysis. A list of keywords (shown in Appe ndix 10.3.3) was used as the basis for searches in all the different contexts outlined, in the aim of collecting an initial list of candidate texts, as well as a broader range of information to act as a resource base for the Review team and for future researchers. 4.1.2 Electronic database searches A wide range of databases, covering journal citati ons, books and similar materials, grey literature, conference proceedings, pamphlets and similar materials, as well as research, both past and present, was considered for inclusion in the Review. However, it was not possible to allocate resources to every potentially useful database, and selection was made on the criterion of subject areas generated by the initial hand-search (see Appendix 10.3.2). 26 databases were selected for inclusion : ASSIA ISI - ISTP BIOSIS-PREVIEWS ISI - SCI Boston Spa Conferences ISI - SSCI British Humanities Index LILACS CAREDATA MEDLINE COPAC Mental Health Abstracts CORDIS National Criminal Justice Review Service Criminal Justice Periodical Index PASCAL Dissertation Abstracts PsychLIT** EDINA REGARD EMBASE** SIGLE Federal Research in Progress/CRSP Social Science Index IBSS SOCIOFILE (see Note below) The following databases were excluded from the Review because their subject areas did not achieve a ranking on our Subject Areas list was made to include relevant foreign-language da tabases in the Review, although it is not always easy to locate or gain access to these. Research ers in the field of bibliometric analysis note the preference of the majority of databases for English- language journals: 'The In stitute for Scientific Information's database for the social sciences contai ned only two German social science journals, whereas 31a German database contai ned 542' (Artus, 1996, cited in Seglen, 1997); and bias towards North American scholarship: 'American scientists, who seem particular ly prone to citing each other, dominate databases to such an extent (over half the citations) as to raise both the citation rate and the mean journal impact of American science 30% above the world average...' (Seglen, 1997). Similarly, the Review team's experience of the ther apeutic community field meant we were aware of the possible difficulties faced by researchers in publishing and disseminating important materials. As in many other small fields, they are at a disadvantage (compare d with their colleagues in larger fields) in gaining either access to 'high impact' journals or acceptance of specialist journals for indexing by major databases. Therefore, the Review placed a great deal of emph asis on databases that covered any 'grey literature'. The main list of keywords (Appendix 10.3.3) was used as a basis for devising search strategies and approaches. Appendix 10.3.4 gives all the search stra tegies used, along with information on the number of references returned, the date of the search, and dat es of coverage and search medium for each database. Database searches were undoubtedly the most fruitful in terms of both relevance and volume of material for the Review. 23 references to research in progress, 379 to past research (including dissertations), and 8,160 book, conference or journal article referen ces were collected for further consideration. In order to minimise loss of potentially valuable ma terial, collection of references at Level One was intentionally very extensive. Various practical st rategies were devised (such as the journal exclusion mentioned above) to avoid duplication of material wher e possible. However, the view was taken that not all duplication is unnecessary - for example, collec tion of the same reference with and without an abstract. The nature of the theme of this Review was such th at a lot of duplication during the fairly mechanical Level One searches was preferable to the loss of materi al for systematic examination by expert researchers at Level Two. 4.1.3. Other sources of information 4.1.3.1. Hand-searches of journals Resource limitations meant that labour-intensive hand-searches had to be restricted. Given that electronic database searching (without restriction on date coverage ) formed the backbone of the Review's approach to information-gathering, it was decided that a histor ical review of journal materials was beyond either our needs or our remit. The emphasis of journa l hand-searches would therefore be to locate recent materials of the following types: relevant articles, especially those that might ha ve been mis-titled or mis-described in databases; relevant background materials (for example, discussion of evaluating outcomes or cost-effectiveness in psychotherapy or other related treatments); individuals or institutions which could be su itable for direct contact (see Appendix 11.3); 32 names of major researchers and writers in the therapeutic community field; references to research in progress. In addition, some attempt was made to establish how far therapeutic communities are currently being discussed in journals representing a wide range of disci plines in over 20 countries. This is to some extent predictable (in Germany, 'social therapy' is applied largely in a penal context, so most discussion there takes place in criminology journals): but, in other in stances, less so. For example, in some countries such as Norway, leading medical journals occasionally cove r topics relating to therapeutic communities. In contrast, although the Netherlands generates proba bly the largest volume of non-English-language material most relevant to therapeutic community pr actice, this appears almost entirely in specialist journals. On this basis, 64 journals were hand-searched. As far as possible, all issues for 1996 and 1997 were reviewed, except for recently established journals or those considered of central importance to the Review, which were searched in complete series. Th ese and any other variations are noted in Appendix 10.3.5 where the journals are listed. The systematic process of drawing up the list of jour nals is outlined in Appendices 10.3.2. and 10.3.5., along with the criteria used for exclusion or inclusi on of a given journal. Appendix 10.3.5. contains a brief report on each journal searched: these are presented in alphabetical order, but could be sorted according to country or discipline in order to allow further analysis. The results of these journal searches allowed a tentative revision of the hierarchy of main subject areas in which discussion of therapeutic community issues is taking place (see Appendix 10.3.2.), to the following: General Psychiatry Addiction Hospital Psychiatry Forensic Psychiatry/Psychology General Medicine Criminology/Penology Medical Psychology Group Psychotherapy/Group Analysis General Psychotherapy, Counselling, etc. The existence was noted of many more journals which either were relevant to the therapeutic community field or should, ideally, be assessed for relevance: resources did not allow the exhaustive study of these. A list and a more detailed explanation are provided in Appendix 7.3.5., as these may be of use or interest to future researchers. However, resources were not th e only stumbling-block: both the number of incomplete series and the dearth of foreign-language journals held at institutions in the UK should be noted as barriers to a truly international, comprehensive lite rature review, as should delays and difficulties in obtaining rarer items through the Inter-Library Loan scheme. 33 34The value of journal hand-searches was negligible in relation to the Review's terms of reference: the volume of text found was small, and its relevance was low, often simply providing a shortcut to obtaining copies of articles that were also located by electroni c searching. The main value of searching journals lay in the information it provided about the main research ers - especially institutions - and writers in the field, about active therapeutic communities, and about the broader profile of therapeutic communities in journal coverage. 4.1.3.2. Searches of other relevant publications: reference and compilation volumes Results of searching the following are included at th e end of Appendix 10.3.5.: Addiction Abstracts; Current Research in Britain: Biologi cal Sciences; Current Research in Britain: Social Sciences; Yearbook of Psychiatry and Allied Mental Health. N.B. National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Research Monographs were treated as books, since this is how most library catalogues classify them (see Appendix 10.3.6.). A number of publications were considered for inclus ion in the Review: a complete list is given in Appendix 10.3.5. Selection of the above fro m this list was based on three criteria: where no database covering exactly the same or virt ually the same material was readily available; relevance of the publication to our designated Subject Areas; sensible deployment of resources. As far as the last criterion was concerned, we took a conscious decision to search small series rather than large ones. Reasons for not selecting each publication are given in Appendix 10.3.5. Although such paper publications are a valuable sour ce of important information, they are now being rapidly superseded by electronic media providing the same material much more quickly. It is recommended that future researchers replace these searches with databases covering the same publications. 4.1.3.3. Visits to key library sites On the basis of the list of relevant Subject Areas es tablished (see Appendix 10.3.2.), these 5 were selected as key library sites: BMA - to cover General Medici ne and Addiction; Tavist ock Centre - to cover Psychotherapy, Group Psychotherapy, Group Analysis, C ounselling, etc.; Institute of Psychiatry - to cover Medical Psychology, Psychiatry (including Hospita l and Forensic); Institute of Criminology - to cover Criminology; Prison Service Staff College- to cover Penology. At each of the key sites, searches were made of th e library catalogue using the search terms listed in Appendix 10.3.3., modified according to the term s used in each catalogue. Items identified on the catalogue (books and similar materials, grey literatu re, conference proceedings, annual reports, research 35papers, theses, dissertations, pamphlets and similar ma terials, audio and video tapes, as well as journal off-prints of previously unrecorded articl es) were hand-searched where available and included for Level Two examination if they met any of the following criteria: dealing with effectiveness of therapeutic communities (even where research was not obviously systematic or rigorous) giving statistics relating to therapeutic communities looking at outcomes of therapeutic communities (even where research was not obviously systematic or rigorous) giving admission criteria for therapeutic communities dealing with time spent in therapeutic communities or similar programmes dealing with types of treatments used in therape utic communities or similar programmes . The results of each visit are reported in Appendix 10.3.6. Some of the materials located through these searches provided valuable historical and conceptual background to the themes of the Review, and were not revealed by any other means (though subsequent difficulties in actually obtaining items through Inter Library Loans should be noted). Overall, however, the success of these searches in locating material of cen tral importance to the Review was limited. Their value lay more in demonstrating - for the benefit of future researchers as well as the present reviewers - that specialist libraries are not replete with undisco vered materials on therapeutic community research : rather, they document the complex historical deve lopment of therapeutic communities and give an overview of current therapeutic community practice. 4.1.3.4. Internet searches: World Wide Web Following NHS Centre for Research and Dissemination recommendations, a search of the World Wide Web was undertaken, starting with a meta-search engi ne and then going on to review relevant sites offered by each of the search engines suggested. The nature of therapeutic community activities necessitated the use of search terms originating in ot her languages (rather than literal translations from English). Spanish, German and French terms were selected from keywords on foreign-language databases and from the suggestions of professional colleagues abroad (see Appendix 10.3.3.). The results of WWW searches are reported in Appendix 10.3.7., along with the criteria used to select materials for collection. Although several hundred sites were visited initially, a final group of 118 relevant sites was selected by a Level One researcher and one of the expert Level Two researchers working together: even this relatively small proportion creat ed files totalling over 1.5 MBytes. The aim was to collect only materials covering extant therapeutic communities, research into therapeutic communities, therapeutic community practice and theory, as well as academic papers on related issues. The WWW materials collected for the Review give a pi cture of 'the therapeutic community archipelago' on a number of given days in 1997. They tell us wh at kind of therapeutic communities exist in which 36countries, how therapeutic communities are run and f unded, what kind of therapeutic support therapeutic communities aim to provide and to whom, and they discuss many issues of past, current and future therapeutic community practice. To some extent, they form a long-term resource - but not an up-to-date one, nor one that could be easily and systematically updated. 4.1.3.5. Mailshot and survey visits We also sent out 305 postal requests world-wide, for unpublished work in this area, and related information, to current researchers; authors of rele vant articles; interested individuals; a range of government and professional organisations; research ins titutes and other relevant institutions, and active TCs - all identified through our other search procedures. We received 69 replies, of which one produced unpublished material which we were able to include in the main study. (The results of this mailshot are described in Additional Appendix 11.3.1.) A small sample (18) of secure and non-secure therap eutic communities, both day and residential were visited, or surveyed by post, for similar relevant ma terial. (Details of the communities targeted are in Additional Appendix 11.2.) 4.2 Selection and cataloguing of articles We want now to turn to the material we found th rough our searches, and particularly to the 8,160 book, conference and journal articles references we gath ered from our electronic searches, and the other references gleaned from trawling bibliographies in sel ected journals and books, and other references to outcome literature that came from data ex tracting the references we already had. Very little of this turned up as grey literature , contradicting our expectations. As the term 'therapeutic community' was only coin ed in 1946, we conducted our systematic literature searches from 1946 until 1997. As described earlier in this review, we recognise that there were institutions operating along therapeutic community lines before this, in a number of settings, and that therapeutic community ideas have their roots in many related fields. However, for the purposes of this review, we did not search all this literature. For mo re extensive discussion of the historical roots of therapeutic community ideas, see Manning, 1989 and Kennard, 1998. 4.2.1. Selection criteria We undertook a sorting of the references retrieve d above on the following levels of sorting:- Level One - the searches produced lists of literature referen ces, many of which will also have abstracts. The lists of titles and abstracts were examined by two of the researchers working independently. 37Inclusion criteria were as follows: Outcome studies; Monitoring information; Care procedures; Client information; Information settings; on re gimes; Selection criteria; Service integration; Support structures; Learning disabilities. (Material on elders was excluded.) In addition, judgements were made about the nature of the work, as follows: any short research report or briefing paper was included: any other articles of l ess than two pages; short idiosyncratic descriptions; and short debates on practice or philosophy were excluded. Articles which satisfied these inclusion criteria at this stage were collected. We set an upper limit on the number of articles to be collected of 300, but we actually netted 294. Level Two: Scan of articles/books The 294 articles/books were scanned to ensure that they were of sufficient quality to include in the final report, and/or that they included information wh ich was required by the data extraction sheets. Articles/books which provided research information on the outcome of therapeutic community treatment in secure and non-secure democratic settings for ment ally disordered offenders and/or clients with personality disorders were put aside for deeper analysis, as were those for secure concept-based therapeutic communities. Level Three. The remaining articles/books These were resorted into in-treatment outcome studies; post-treatment outcome studies; and review articles of post-treatment studies, for both secure a nd non-secure democratic therapeutic communities, and secure only concept-based therapeutic communities. They were then cl assified according to the types of methodology and research design used, according to the levels of resolution listed below. These remaining papers were analysed separately fro m the others, using the data extraction sheets . Thus, we included papers on the following topics: Outcome st udy; Personality disorders; Clients + regime/treatment + outcome. Level Four: Reading and analysis of remaining qualifying studies This final level pulled out all studies which describ e the in-treatment and post-treatment outcome of democratic therapeutic community treatment in secure and non-secure settings with personality disordered clients and/or mentally disordered offenders, and th e in-treatment and post-treatment outcome of concept- based therapeutic community treatme nt in secure settings. These had al ready been analysed using the data extraction sheets. The inclusion criteria were as follows: Outcome offenders. An additional criteria was that all the ar ticles/books selected should be about therapeutic communities - we used a very loose description here; if the institutions called themselves, or were referred to as, therapeutic communities, or milieu therapy, or in-patient psych 38otherapy units, and included a weekly or daily comm unity meeting, group activities, and some form of democratic or client self-government; and offered predominantly group treatment, then the articles/books were retained. As well as information on the descriptive factors outlined above for our survey of therapeutic communities, we also specifically targeted collecting research inform ation on process studies; individual client case studies; outcome studies of individual clients, outcome studies of populations; review articles of outcome studies; cross-institutional studies; cost -offset studies; and evidence on the effectiveness of therapeutic communities for people with personality di sorders, and for mentally disordered offenders. 4.2.2. Principles for Synthesising Data There were three sorts of data synthesis: 1. How much of which types of research studies is in the material (displayed as tables). This is summarised information, based on the decisions made by the reviewers as to what each section should contain. 2. Narrative synthesis of outcome data. This is a qualitative report on the content of articles. The report also includes information on individual client outcome studies; population outcome studies, their comparability, and their advantages and disadvantages; descriptions of the types of research methodologies used, and their methodological advantages and disadvantages, and validity and reliability; on the effectiveness of therapeutic community treatment for personality disorders, and their e ffectiveness for mentally disordered offenders; together with a summary of findings. 3. Meta-analysis of studies which contain suitable data. 4.2.3. Sorting of References 4.2.3.1. Discarded or set aside, but retained Based on the above inclusion/exclusion criteria, 847 items were catalogued, using an alphabetical system (173 were discarded.). As, Bs & Es are the referen ces for the most pertinent research studies, Cs, Ds and Fs contain additional, but relevant, articles, which are also included in this review. All other sections (G- N) contain related references, which are not directly relevant to this review, but are contained in the Additional Appendices, for information. Ns relate to references to evalua tive work on Special Hospitals, about process, in-treatment outcome and post-treatment outcome- 6 were retained; M.A. relat es to a wide range of descriptive references about a range of concept-based units - non-secure/drugs/special interest/overseas - 52 were retained. M. relates 39again to a wide range of descriptive referen ces about democratic therapeutic communities - non- secure/non special hospitals, and/or i nnovative/ overseas - 115 were retained. L. relates to descriptive references on secure settings (prisons, secure units, special hospitals) - 80 were retained. K. relates to references for concept-based units - intake and process studies for secure and non- secure units - 119 were retained (2 were on secure un its, and 117 on non-secure). J. relates to references for non-secure democratic therapeutic communities - in take and process studies - 58 were retained. H. relates to secure democratic therapeutic communiti es- intake and process studies - 12 references were retained. G. relates to non-secure concept-based therapeutic communities - post-treatment outcome - 111 references were retained. 4.2.3.2. Retained for summarising This reduced our 8,160 items to 294. These were then grouped into categories as follows. All have been reviewed in some way for this review. Categories C, D & F (181) are summarised in Section 6., and are over-viewed in more detail in Add itional Appendices 10.6., 10.7. & 10.8. C = 51 items on non-secure/democratic/non-personality disorders or mentally disordered offenders - post-treatment outcome D = 69 items on definitional - therapeutic communities/ personality disorders/ methodologies/ reviews etc F = 61 items on concept-based - definitiona l/outcome reviews/methodologies/dual diagnosis 4.2.3.3. Retained for analysis All the remaining articles (113) were retained for furt her analysis - they constitute the evaluative research literature on secure and non-secure democratic ther apeutic communities, and secure concept-based therapeutic communities. These articles include all th e post-treatment outcome studies we retrieved, and the in-treatment outcome studies - these were all data extracted, and are described below, and included in the tables. The others are review articles (18), re lating to post-treatment outcome, and these were data extracted for descriptive material, a nd for references that had not alr eady been retrieved through our other searches. The number of outcome (in-treatment and post-treatment) articles (95) is greater than the final number of studies included, because some articles relate to the same study, but some contain other additional material, so are still retained. 404.2.3.4. Levels of resolution The in-treatment and post-treatment outcome studies were then categorised according to the level of resolution, or their position on a research methodology hierarchy. The sort of research undertaken is determined by the level of resolution at which any researcher wishes to examine the therapeutic community. 'Levels of resolution' is a concept borrowed from microscopy, and systems theory (Klir & Valach, 1967, pp.24-27; Kirk & Millard, 1979, 123-125), where, at a low level of resolution, the broad structure of an object can be observed and examined, but the fine detail cannot, whereas at high levels of resolution, detail can be ob served, but the general features are lost to view. At a low level of resolution, the therapeutic comm unity field as a whole, (or e.g., nationally) can be studied. At higher levels of resolution, groups of therapeutic communities can be examined, then individual (or single case) communities, then the finer de tails of parts of therapeutic communities, such as treatment orientation, staff groups, resident groups, interpersonal interactions, and individual members; and ending with a higher level of resolution, with part-functions of individual, such as intra-psychic processes (see below). Low level of resolution International therapeutic community field National therapeutic community field Groups of therapeutic communities (i ncluding comparisons with other regimes) (e.g. Norwegian network of therapeutic communities) Individual therapeutic communities Parts of therapeutic communities, such as treatment orientation, staff groups, resident groups, interpersonal interactions, and individual members Part-functions of individuals in therapeutic communities, such as intra-psychic processes High level of resolution For the purposes of this report, levels of resolu tion equate quite well with some of the NHS-CRD guidelines for a hierarchy as applied to research met hodologies, and the evidence for systematic literature reviews (see below). These levels of resolution will also affect the sort of methodologies, assessment and measuring tools used. For example, if researchers wa nts to look at the therapeutic community field as a whole, or groups of therapeutic communities, then th ey need comparative and cross-institutional research designs - using either a number of therapeutic communities, or comparing some therapeutic communities 41with other institutions, across a range of dimensi ons, including process and outcome measure, and with statistical techniques capable of dealing w ith the amount of information generated. Research methodologies Low level of resolution Well-designed randomised controlled trials (Level I) Other types of trial - well-designed controlled trial w ith pseudo-randomisation (Level II-Ia ) - controlled trials with no randomisation (Level II-Ib ) Cross-institutional, naturalistic studies Cohort studies - well-designed cohort (prospective study) with concurrent controls (Level II-2a ) - well-designed cohort (prospective study) with historical controls (Level II-2b ) - well-designed cohort (retrospective study ) with concurrent controls (Level II-2c ) Cohort studies with no controls Single case studies (of therapeutic communities) Studies of individuals within one therapeutic community Individual case studies, using clinical judgements High level of resolution We have adapted these levels of resolution here, for th e purpose of classifying further the research studies (as opposed to articles) we have data extracted, as follows:- 1. The gold standard of experimental research a nd the randomised controlled trial technique - post and in treatment = 10 2. Comparative, cross-institutional and cross-treatment design - post and in treatment = 10 3. Single community studies - with control/c omparison groups - post and in treatment = 32 4. Single community studies - with no contro l/comparison groups - post and in treatment = 29 5. Cost-offset studies - in- and post-treatment = 4 424.2.4. Articles/books retained for the systematic literature review The remaining articles/books (113) left after the impl ementation of all our inclusion/exclusion criteria were then grouped into categories, as follows:- A. Treatment outcome studies in secure democr atic therapeutic communities for people with personality disorders or mentally disordered offenders = 52 Post-treatment outcome studies = 38 In-treatment outcome studies = 4 Reviews of post-treatment outcome studies = 10 B. Treatment outcome studies in non-secure de mocratic therapeutic communities for personality disorders = 41 Post-treatment outcome studies = 26 In-treatment outcome studies = 7 Reviews of post-treatment outcome studies = 8 (These two categories form the main basis for our research report.) This next section is included in our data analysis , because concept-based ther apeutic communities are so prevalent in secure settings in America, and ha ve provided extensive research studies. These are described in Section 5.4., and illustrated on the tables. E. Post-treatment outcome studies in secure concept-based therapeutic communities (we don't know if these include people with personality disorders) = 20 4.3 The meta-analysis Sufficient studies were found for a meta-analysis to be undertaken. There were 52 studies that reported on the effectiveness of therapeutic communities, and whic h had used a control group. Relatively few of these were RCTs, the rest using a variety of control groups. Studies were excluded where the outcome criteria were unclear, where the raw numbers were not reporte d, and where the original sample was not clearly specified before any attrition of the sample over th e course of the study. Where there was a choice of outcome measures and control groups, emphasis was pl aced on conservative criteria, such as reconviction rates rather than psychological improvements, and on non-treated controls. This reduced the number of studies for the meta-analysis to 29. The analysis had two stages. Initially the odds-ra tios for the individual studies, and 95% and 99% confidence intervals, were calculated. This w as based on the standard method devised by Woolf (1955, discussed in Kahn and Sempos, 1989, pp. 56-57): 43Treatment Control Total Fail a b g Success c d h Total e f n OR = ad bc SE(ln OR) = /(1 a + 1 b + 1 c + 1 d ) 95% CL on ln OR = ln OR OR 95% CL on OR = (ln OR 1.96(SE)ln OR) 99% CL on ln OR 2.58(SE)ln OR 99% CL on OR = e (ln OR \" 2.58(SE)ln OR) Subsequently, the odds-ratios were combined to produce a summary odds-ratio for the 29 studies, and subsections of them, with confidence intervals also for the 95% and 99% levels. The subsections were the RCTs, democratic type therapeutic communities, concept type therapeutic communities, and secure therapeutic communities of either type . This was based on the standard method devised by Peto (Yusuf, et al, 1985, discussed in Petitti, 1994, pp. 100-102): Expected events, E = variances) (95%) This two stage analysis produced a standard set of meta -analysis data presented in S ection 5.4, and details of the calculations in the Main Appendices, Section 10.9. 4.4 Publication bias - a funnel plot Considerable efforts have been made to track down unpublis hed or 'grey' material for this report. In contrast to our expectations, very little turned up. Of concern in meta-analysis is the possibility that publication bias might occur as a result of negative or neutral findings bei ng either not submitted, or not accepted by journals. A check on any publication bias is povided by plotting the meta-analysis odds-ratios against sample size in a 'funnel plot'. The lower the sample size, the higher shoul d be the range of odds ratios reported, giving rise to a typical funnel shaped scattergram. The expectation is that a scattergram would reveal blank spots caused by 44unpublished findings, or 'lost' studies. The funnel plot for this meta-analysis does not suggest that this is the case: Funnel Plot 05001000150020002500 00 . 511 . 52 Odds RatiosSample Size 455 MAIN FINDINGS 5.1 Descriptive findings from the retained literature 5.1.1. Descriptive findings for secure an d non-secure democratic therapeutic communities The descriptive findings from the evaluative studies were extensive. They are summarised briefly here - the full findings are included in Main Appendix 10.5. 5.1.1.1. History The findings for the history of both secure and non-secure democratic ther apeutic commmunities are already summarised in Section 3. The full findings are in Main appendix 10.5., and therefore are not reproduced here. 5.1.1.2. Descriptions of therapeu tic community principles and practices Secure democratic Secure democratic therapeutic comm unities are inevitably modified to suit prison requirements of security and control. Thus therapeutic timetables are a rranged around prison timetables of work, association, eating and lock-up. A therapeutic prison, such as Grendon and some of the German Social Therapeutic Institutions, which are independent of mainstream prisons, are able to modify prison timetables and regulations slightly to accommodate therapeutic ac tivities, whereas small therapeutic community units inside mainstream prisons cannot do this. Neverthe less, security and control are overriding features of prison environments, and this is evidenced by the wear ing of uniforms by prison officer staff, the carrying of keys, cell and personal searches and other prison activities which are not part of therapeutic community life in non-secure settings. Non-secure democratic Whiteley, 1975 (B.45) states that there is no set fo rmula for a therapeutic community regime (p.168). Schimmel, 1997, (B.32.) describes the basis of the therapeutic community as creating an environment where complex interpersonal and community pro cesses become essential therapeutic factors and are subject to detailed analysis, and considered as a prim ary medium of treatment (p.121). The therapeutic community also involves patients' participation in these treatment processes (p.121). Schimmel also quotes Maxwell Jones's description of a therapeutic co mmunity as 'distinctive amongst other comparable treatment centres in the way the institution's total r esources, both staff and patients, are self-consciously pooled in furthering treatment', and a healthy therapeutic community as 'an open system', being highly facilitative of development and ch ange, and allowing for growth in positive directions (p.121). 46Whiteley, 1975, (B.45.) lists the defining characteristics of the social processes of the functioning community as Rapoport's,1960, (B.30) communalism in sharing of tasks, responsibilities and rewards; permissiveness to act in accord with one's feelings without accustomed social inhibitions; democratic decision-making; reality confrontation of the subject with what they are doing in the here and now; as well as social analysis, or Main's 'culture of enquiry' (p.165). Schimmel, 1997, (B.32.) also lists Gunderson's five specific functions that contribute to therapeutic milieu: containment, support, structure, involvement and validation (p.121). Whiteley, 1975, (B.45.) also says the process of treatment in a therapeutic community can be summarised simplistically as Interaction, Exploration, Experimentation (p.891). Piper, Rosie, Joyce & Azim, 1996, (B.29.) describ e the day therapeutic community, as a modified therapeutic community, milieu or environment ther apy and partial hospitalisation, and including a physical structure, a social structure, and culture, and psychodynamic group therapy, and large group psychotherapy/community meetings. They suggest that there are three basic prin ciples which are central to effective day treatment - the judicious use of aut hority; optimal patient-treatment matching; and careful attention to referral sources. They also identif y six principles of effective milieu therapy:- 1. it encourages patients to be responsible 2. it engenders mutual respect between staff members and patients 3. it facilitates patients' participation in the treatment of their peers 4. it fosters collaboration with higher order systems 5. it avoids abdication of authority, on the one hand, a nd abuse of power, on the other, of the designated staff members - in other words, it involves the judicious use of authority 6. its use of the operation of multiple groups at multip le levels throughout the system, which contribute significantly to 'a culture of enquiry'. (pp.18-19). 5.1.1.3. Service contexts Secure democratic Secure therapeutic communities are lo cated mainly within prison and correctional services. Of these, only HMP Grendon, in Buckinghamshire, England, is an entirely therapeutic community prison. Other therapeutic communities comprise small units inside larger mainstream prisons, although some German Social Therapeutic Institutions have been establishe d in separate secure premises outside prisons (L\u00f6sel, 1997). The Slovenian prison system is largely base d on a therapeutic community model (Kriznick, 1996). Some secure psychiatric hospitals also house therap eutic communities for forensic patients (A.17. Ogloff, 1992; A.36b. van Emmerik, 1987). The therapeutic community at Arnold Lodge Regional Secu re Unit in Leicester (A.12. McMurran, Egan & Ahmadi, 1998) was closed in 1997. A new therapeutic community prison is due to open in Marchington, Staffordshire, in 1999. This will be within the pr ivate sector and will reportedly consist of a 200-inmate therapeutic community unit attached to a conventional 600 inmate prison. 47Non-secure democratic The service contexts described in the research literatu re on democratic non-secure settings are very varied. Many are located within the NHS, and often at the tertiary level of provision, for example, the unit studied in B.3. (Chiesa, 1997) & B.4. (Chiesa, Iacoponi & Morris, 1996) is described as a tertiary service, and a referral resource within the NHS, with a nati onal catchment area; B.14. (Dolan, Warren & Norton, tertiary level NHS Hospital; B.43. (Ro sser, Birch, Bond et al, 1987) as a hospital funded entirely by the NHS; B.9. (Davies, Campling & Ryan, 1997) as a district service, funded by the local District Health Authority; and B.37. (Miles, 1969) as a large NHS psychiatric hospital for the subnormal. Abroad, the hospital based therapeu tic communities are described as: - part of a metropolitan psychiatric hospital in Australia (B.15. Hafner & Holme, 1996); a public psychiatric hospital in Australia (B.58. Spielman, 1975); a clinic in a private psychiatri c in Australia (B.57. Eisen, Blenkhorn, Wendiggensen et al, 1986); an in-patient ward in a University Hospital in America, with a metropolitan and suburban catchment area (B.20. Lehman & Ritzler, 1976); as a Day Hospital in the Psychiatric Department in Ullev Dl University Hospital, which is the main general hospital in Oslo (B.18. Karterud, Vaglum, Friis et al, 1992 & B.33. Vaglum, Friis, Irion et al, 1990); and a day treatment programme in a university hospital department of psychiatry (B.29. Piper, Rosie, Joyce & Azim, 1996); and finally, a Department of Forensic and Social Psychiatry in a University Hospital in Slovenia (B.19. Kobal & Zagar, 1994). 5.1.1.4. Client information (Most of the studies discussed in this section relate to adults. One or two relate to adolescents, but are retained both because they refer to the clients as ps ychopathic, or character or conduct disordered, and contain important research findings.) Secure democratic Most secure therapeutic communities admit male o ffenders only. Some concept-based therapeutic communities in women's prisons in the US are reported in the literature, usually as part of a large study which includes both men and women (E.2. Eisenberg & Fabelo, 1996; 1989; E.35. State of New York Department of Correctional Services, 1996). Arnold Lodge Regi onal Secure Unit admitted men and women. Not all the studies reported the gender of subjects. All inmates in secure therapeutic communities are o ffenders, except in one Special Hospital (A.47. van Emmerik, 1987) where some people are held in case th ey offend. Most democratic prison therapeutic communities specialise in personality disorders a nd recidivism, whilst concept-based therapeutic communities are directed specifically at substance abuse, which usually refers to drug rather than alcohol use. However, there are overlaps here, since recent studies of concept-based therapeutic communities in the community have suggested that there is a hi gh level of co-morbidity between drug abuse and personality disorder, and between drug abuse and me ntal illnesses. Indeed, the term MICA has been 48recently adopted which stands for Mentally Ill Ch emical Abuser (F.42. McLaughlin & Pepper, 1991). The overlap is also evident in admissions to demo cratic prison therapeutic communities which report a high-level of drug and alcohol abuse amongst inmates. There is little in the literature about specific mental illnesses in inmates except where outcome for th e mentally ill is compared with outcomes for the personality disordered (A.17. Ogloff, Wong & Greenwood, 1990; A.19. Rice, Harris & Cormier, 1992). Non-secure democratic The client information given varies according to the service context, is diverse, and not easily summarised, so examples are given in this section, but in full detail in Main Appendix 10.5. For example, for the Cassel Hospital, the clients are described in earlier studies as people with:- previous episodes of functional psychoses, both schizophrenic and manic depressive: chronic severe disturbances and neurotic illnesses, particularly depressive, a nxiety and phobic neuroses, often complicated by personality disorders or alcoholism: personality problem s or personality disorders, either unspecified or hysterical, with intense hostility, impulsive behavi our, disturbances of identity, transient psychotic experiences, and vacillation between withdrawal and ex igency in relationships, and who are borderline as opposed to neurotic: and other minority, organic conditi ons (B.10. Denford, Schachter, Temple et al, 1983); and as people who typically have proved resi stant to other physical and psychotherapeutic approaches (B.43. Rosser, Birch, Bond et al, 1987). In later studies, Cassel Hospital clie nts are described as: - adolescents, and families with severe emotional difficulties; adults with severe psychoneurotic conditi ons; with chronic and severe personality disorders, (Cluster A and B), and some Cluster C (non severe pe rsonality disorders): high co-morbidity with Axis I disorders, most commonly with anxiety disorders, phobic conditions, and substance use disorders: and as mostly female, single and unemployed at the time of admission; with severe and multiple symptomatology, chaotic interpersonal relationships, and severely impaired social functioning; with a history of self mutilation and self-destructive behaviour : suicidal feelings and attempts: and previous psychiatric hospitalization, or psychiatric out-patie nt treatment over the 12 months prior to the Cassel admission (B.3. Chiesa, 1997; B.4. Chiesa, Iacoponi & Morris, 1996). For the Henderson Hospital, clients are described in earlier studies as:- character disorders; psychopaths; sociopaths; anti-social personalities; young adults with personality disorders, who broadly fall into the diagnostic category of psychopathic disorder; with vari ous degrees of neuroticism: as anxious, emotional, socially isolated, apprehensive and somewhat imag inative; with some awareness of inner emotional disturbance, despite a predominance of acting-out symptoms; and as mostly young people over 18, with histories of drug and alcohol abuse: assault, or self-injury: criminal records: severe depression: 1984). 49Later studies of the Henderson Hospita l describe clients as:- young adults (17-45); psychopaths, often of a borderline nature; with marked disturbance of em otional and/or social functioning (i.e. personality disorders of a marked to severe degree - 87% of residents met DSM-III-R criteria for borderline personality disorder: 95% met criteria for at least one Cluster B Axis II diagnoses (although formal psychiatric diagnosis beyond personality disorder is ra rely referred to (B.46. Whiteley 1990); half with forensic history/criminal convictions: psychiatric treatment: substance abusers; with self-damaging and suicidal behaviour; with violen t and abusive behaviours; as placing high continuing demands on services; and Dolan & Norton, 1993; B.14. Dolan, Warren & Norton, 1997). 5.1.1.5. Referral procedures Secure democratic There is little specific information about referral procedures in the literature. Discussions with therapeutic community staff indicate that inmates are referred regularly from some prisons and not at all from others, and that this suggests a lack of willingn ess on the part of some prisons to make referrals. Once a referral is received, the inmate is considered for admission, and if successful, is generally placed on a waiting list. If the inmate is then transferred to the therapeutic community, they are sent on a '1080', which means that if they subsequently leave the th erapeutic community they can be sent back to the referring prison. Non-secure democratic Not a lot of information is provided in these studies in terms of referral procedures. Referrers and ways of referring vary from setting to setting, and are gi ven in more detail in Main Appendix 10.5. 5.1.1.6. Selection procedures Secure democratic As with non-secure therapeutic communities, treatment is usually voluntary. Inmates are generally selected by staff, who make their decisions on th e basis of documentation and assessment interviews. Inmates may be consulted at this stage, although they may have less say in the admission of a new member than residents in a non-secure therapeutic comm unity. Inmates can leave if they choose to do so, or be expelled from the community for their behaviour, and transferred back to prison. Whilst treatment is voluntary, it is nevertheless recognised that the alte rnative is prison, not freedom, and that therefore the choice is limited. 50Non-secure democratic There is more information given on selection procedur es, than on referral procedures, but they are quite often idiosyncratic to each unit. Henderson and Cassel are illustrative. Whiteley, 1970, (B.36.) says that all prospective patie nts are seen at a group interview; on the basis of this, prospective residents will be selected or not. The selection group consists of staff (psychiatrists, nurses, social workers etc) and elected members from the more senior patients (i.e. those who have been in the unit more than three months). The reasons fo r refusal are that not all psychopaths and psychiatric categories are suitable for Henderson/intensive therapeu tic community treatment and that correct selection is important; also no patient with a definite dia gnosis of psychosis, organic mental illness or mental subnormality will be selected. Whiteley adds that the selection group lasts for 2 hours, and assessment is around the following factors:- motivation for change; awareness of own social defects, and the need to do something about them; the capacity for gaining insight , and emotional growth; the particular ability to function in a group therapy setting; and can the therap eutic community at the moment cope with this person. Early leaving is usually decided by discharge votes. Rosser, Birch, Bond et al,1987, (B.43.) state that fo r the single adult unit of the Cassel Hospital, the grounds for selection are that patients are too disturbe d for outpatient psychotherapy; able to express some feeling and fantasy and to use interpretations for achie ving insight; have sufficient ego strength to tolerate intensive analytic treatment; are too old for the a dolescent unit; are single or unsuitable for admission to the family unit; that there is no evidence at initia l assessment of significant neuropsychiatric disorder; neurotic psychopathology; previous outpatient treatment; and depression. The grounds given for refusal are organic psychopathology. Admission is usually for 9 months to 2 years. (Initially, leaving the Cassel Hospital involved complete separation from the hospita l at the end of treatment, with no follow-up, but this has changed more recently, with the development of post-treatment outreach services.) 5.1.1.7. Regime descriptions Secure democratic Secure democratic therapeutic communities are based on the original Henderson model (A.9. Genders & Player, 1995; A.37.). Each has a regular, fixed, weekly timetable of meetings and activities. This includes the large group, which is attended by all inmat es and some or all staff, and held either daily or every other day. This large group (or community meeting or wing meeting) is a forum where house-keeping matters are discussed and decided, perfo rmance within the community is examined and information from other groups and meetings is repor ted. As with non-secure therapeutic communities, efforts are made to get the inmates to organise a nd run these meetings, whilst the staff offer help or information when needed. Inmates are assigned to small groups, which may meet daily or less frequently, where the emphasis is more clearly on therapy. These small groups focus particularly on inmates' offences and personal problems as well as behaviour in the th erapeutic community. As is usual with the therapeutic community milieu, efforts are directed to wards tying current behaviour to referral problems; 51throughout the inmate's stay attention is thus fo cussed on the 'offence-related behaviour' which they display in the community. A major issue for prison therapeutic communities is th e difference between therapeutic community culture and prison culture. Prison culture requires inmates to support each other against staff, not to report illegal behaviour and to be 'hard'. Therapeutic community culture requires inmates to work closely with the staff, to report and confront rule-breaking and to be open and show feelings. It is known to be difficult for inmates to make the switch, particularly since they may end up back in conventional prison or outside in the community, where their ther apeutic community activities and behaviours may be remembered. As with other therapeutic communities, the respons ibility for organising and running the community and its affairs is given over to the inmates, although this may be modified in order to comply with prison regulations about security and control. Non-secure democratic The regimes described vary, and each have their own particular features. Again, Henderson and Cassel are illustrative. In B.3. (Chiesa, 1997), the therapeutic community at Cassel Hospital is descr ibed as an in-patient as soci o-therapeutic, with psychosocial treatment, and individual psycho-analytically oriented psychotherapy . Length of stay is usually up to 12/18 months (now called the one-stage programme). There was no out-patient follow-up prior to 1992, and the current research project. The unit has now introduced an additional two-stage programme, since 1993, which involves 6 months in-patient treatment, and then one year of a twice weekly one and a half hour psychotherapy group, together with, in the first si x months, psychosocial outreach nursing, and outreach team work. The Cassel Hospital singl e adult unit has also been described in B.43 (Rosser, Birch, Bond et al, 1987) as an analytically oriented treatment programme. In B.4. (Chiesa, Iacoponi & Morris, 1996), the same unit is described as an inpatient-treatment unit, and a combination of formal group and individual psychothe rapy and experience of living in a therapeutic milieu. Group activities are aimed at fostering ego-strength and the acquisition of social skills. The hospital milieu provides a focus on an understanding of the intrapsychic and in terpersonal underpinnings of maladaptive patterns of behaviour, to facilitate th e process of resocialisation after discharge from the hospital. The containment given by the hospital milie u is felt to provide safeguards against the risk of suicide often present during treatment of these patients, and it ensures a degree of treatment compliance that is otherwise difficult to obtain in an outpatient setting. Menzies, Dolan & Norton, 1993, (B.55.), describ e Henderson Hospital as a therapeutic community specialising in the treatment of people with severe personality disorders. Dolan, Evans & Wilson, 1992, (B.12.), Dolan, Evans & Wilson, 1992, (B.13.), and Dolan, Warren & Norton, 1997, (B.14.) also describe Henderson Hospital therapeutic community as a specialis t psychotherapeutic in-patient treatment, and a national service for severe personality disorder Hende rson Hospital regime is an intensive long-term 52intervention. Maximum admission is one year. These last three studies also state th at the Henderson Hospital therapeutic community represents a change away from an authoritarian system towards more active participation of the patient in their own treatment - it is the democratic therapeutic community appro ach. It incorporates a collaborative style of staff behaviour, and avoids the traditional 'medical model' , which puts the patient in a passive position. The 'doctor' is the community itself; 'symptoms' are not the focus of therapy; the community concentrates upon the meaning of individuals' feeli ngs or actions, and on their relations hips with others. All social interactions are closely examined and commented upon by all. The more active participation of patients in their own treatment, and that of their peers, is central. Treatment involves the conversion of unconscious pathology and pathological behaviours into feelings whic h can be expressed verbally and handled by interpersonal discussion; a process of expression and containment by personal exchange. All treatment is in a group setting. Responsibility for the day to day running of the therapeutic community is shared among patients and staff, and is collaborative a nd democratically shared. The community itself is invested with an important decision-making function. In addition, at Henderson Hospital, there is no psyc hotropic medication. Treatment is voluntary, and no residents are admitted under Probation Orders with a condition of treatment, or under any section of the Mental Health Act. Piper, Rosie, Joyce & Azim, 1996, (B.29.) also descr ibe a partial hospitalization/day milieu therapy; a modified therapeutic community; time-limited psychodynamic group psychotherapy, for 18 weeks; time-limited group oriented day treatment; and an intensive, dynamic, insight-oriented milieu . The unit was set up in February 1973. The treatment milieu constitutes a physical structure, a social structure and a culture. Treatment is concerned with the optimal recovery of the individual from a mental disorder. Rehabilitation focuses on the individual's psyc hosocial adaptation to the illness, as well as to the community. It is a three-phase treatment, each phase of 6 weeks. The unit has a sister evening treatment programme. 5.1.1.8. Treatments offered Secure democratic Apart from the large and small groups, therapeutic communities mostly offer a range of additional treatments. There are standard prison behavioural programmes for some types of offences and problems. These include SOTP - the Sex Offender Treatment Programme - which certain inmates are required to undertake, and a range of programmes to do with anger management, social skills and addictive behaviour. Some prison therapeutic communities in corporate these programmes into their treatment portfolio; others prefer these to be carried out el sewhere, regarding the community as the treatment. Additionally, many therapeutic communities include crea tive therapies - especially art therapy and drama therapy. When considering the range and amount of additional treat ments, it is important to consider that there is 53inevitably a balance struck between structured and uns tructured time. Whilst it is considered useful to spend some time on structured therapeutic activiti es which promise specific outcomes, it is also considered important for inmates to have unstructure d time, so that they can absorb what they have learned, deal with the emotional aspects of therapy and relate to one another in more ordinary ways than is afforded by groups. Non-secure democratic All units offer a daily or community meeting, democr acy or patient participation in decision-making and running the therapeutic community, and a predominance of group activities - studies were not included in this review unless they met these criteria, so the information presented here describes the treatments offered over and above these treatment fact ors. Henderson and Cassel are illustrative. Denford, Schachter, Temple et al, 1983, (B.10.) describe daily community meetings at the Cassel Hospital; community living; assumption of responsib ilities in everyday work situations (cooking, cleaning, maintaining furnishing and decorations, pr actical hospital management); work groups; twice weekly individual psychothera py; and one weekly meeting with a nurse. The study points out that there is virtually no psychotropic medication used (this is st opped within one week of admission). Rosser, Birch, Bond et al, 1987, (B.43.) describe in addition at the Cassel Hospital a psychoanalytic small group twice weekly; individual psychotherapy with experien ced psychotherapists, supervised by a senior psychoanalyst; and individual discussions with their nurses. There is an emphasis on the practical aspects of living together. Anticipatory grieving in preparati on for discharge (no follow-up) was regarded as part of therapy. All elements of treatment are totally integrated. Multiple transferences are interpreted. Whiteley, 1990, (B.46.) describes the treatments offere d at Henderson Hospital as analytic groups; formal group therapy; experiential groups; hou sehold chores; playing games; and eating meals together. This study suggests that the process of treatment is not c onfined to the formal group therapy sessions alone; the day is best seen as one on-going group with the staff a nd patients never out of a therapeutic interaction. The theoretical bases to the treatments offered are obj ect relations; attachment; and living and learning. Whiteley, 1972, (B.35.) and. Whiteley, 1970, (B.36) also enumerate community meetings; small group psychotherapy; work groups - domestic , general maintenance, clerical (administration and research), furniture; visitors group; new members group; selection group; social committee; workshop committee; ward group; and democracy and community jobs, wh ich include 'Top 3' residents - Chair, Vice, Secretary, and sports rep, workshop foreman, librarian, treasurer, shop keeper, catering officer. Piper, Rosie, Joyce & Azim, 1996, (B.29.) call thei r day therapeutic community a 'package treatment', operating 5 days a week, 9 - 4, except Fridays when it is until 2.30. There are large daily community meetings, attended by 50 patients, plus large group psychotherapy for one hour a week. Large group psychotherapy is described as a specialised form of community meeting. There is democracy, but with the judicious use of authority - there is a weekly government group, and a daily living seminar. There are a variety of small groups. There are unstructured and insight-oriented small open groups, which meet twice weekly for one and a half hours, and are led by a psychiatrist or non-medical therapist; they are for 7-12 patients, and occur in the 12 weeks of Phase II. There are also structured and skill oriented small 54groups, run along the same lines. There is also psychodrama; a projective group; an action group; a personal relations group; a TV group; a life skills group; a re-entry group; a vocational group; a self awareness group; a weekly social outing; a weekly recreation group; and weekly patient evaluation groups; an exercise group; and relaxation training. The unit has a complete group orientation, whether structured or unstructured; skills-oriented or insight -oriented, or treatment or rehabilitation oriented. There is no individual therapy or one-to-one member-p atient contacts. There is formal feedback to individual patients in staff and patient groups twice duri ng a patient's stay. The unit also uses behavioural tactics such as contracting, communication and skills training, and other therapies such as family or couple therapy. 5.1.1.9. Monitoring procedures Secure democratic Little specific information is provided in the literatu re about monitoring procedures. Prison therapeutic communities comply with the general monitoring pr ocedures of prisons, and information is kept on admissions, discharges, assaults, serious incidents, positive drug tests etc. This information goes to inform local and national prison statistics, and also pr ovides a means for individual prison therapeutic communities to assess their immediate impact, e.g. reports of lower levels of assaults and serious incidents (A.3. Cooke, 1989). All inmates have prison files which chart their move s through prison and contain information on offences or achievements whilst in prison, along with statutor y reports. These are maintained whilst prisoners are in therapeutic communities, and in addition, notes are kept of behaviour in gr oups and meetings. Most therapeutic communities have some form of handove r report, in which notes are made as and when incidents occur, so that these can be reported to the ne xt shift of staff who are thus kept up-to-date with events. Non-secure democratic No information on monitoring procedures was retrieved from the research studies on non-secure democratic therapeutic communities for people with personality disorders. 5.1.1.10. Support structures Secure democratic Nothing was found in the literature specifically a bout support structures for therapeutic communities which are generally described as fairly isolated a nd vulnerable. This does not mean though that support structures do not exist. In the UK, several ther apeutic communities belong to the Association of Therapeutic Communities in Prisons, and members meet to discuss common issues. Concept-based 55therapeutic communities are often established as part of larger organisations (e.g. the drug abuse therapeutic community at HMP Holme House is part of Phoenix House England). Gartree Therapeutic Community has a board of outside advisers which m eets regularly and HMP Grendon brings in outside consultants and offers suppor t and training to other prison therapeutic communities. Non-secure democratic Very little information on support structures was found in the research studies on non-secure democratic therapeutic communities for people with personality diso rders. Typically they include a weekly staff meeting, after groups, and clinical supervision. 5.1.1.11. Service integration Secure democratic In the UK there is little mention of service integra tion, except for the difficulties of integrating the therapeutic community with the prison culture. Some of the staff in the therapeutic communities may represent other services, such as probation. Once a pris oner reaches the end of his stay in the therapeutic community, he is either released or returned to main stream prison. Either way, the therapeutic community has little more officially to do with him. In the USA, a recent innovation for American prison therapeutic communities has been the establishment of linked therapeutic communities in the community for ex-inmates who leave the prison therapeutic community (E.5. Lockwood & Inciardi, 1994). These act as half-way houses and provide a reference group and a means for inmates to integrate positively with the outside society. Non-secure democratic Again, there is no mention in the research studies retrieved of information about service integration. 5.1.1.12. Staff training and selection Secure democratic The therapeutic staff of prison therapeutic commun ities in the UK consists of specially selected and trained prison officers, prison hospital officers and ci vilians, such as psychologi sts, doctors and probation officers. Recently there has been a move to r ecruit NHS nurses, and some of these work in prison therapeutic communities. 56In the USA and in other concept-b ased therapeutic communities, there is usually a mixture of prison staff and ex-addicts, who have been through a therapeu tic community programme and now work as staff members. Non-secure democratic The information obtained on staffing, and staff training is again limited. Piper, Rosie, Joyce & Azim, 1996, (B.29.) state that the unit has 10 staff - 8 therapists, one full-time and one part-time teacher, a Psychiatrist-Director and secretary, plus staff with nursing, occupational therapy, clinical psychology, and social work backgrounds, and bachelors or masters de grees; on the job training is provided for therapists and teachers; and new staff are trained by day treatment staff members: new staff are selected by the psychiatrist-leader, after a two day interview by the staff members as a group, and by individual staff members: new staff have a probationary period of three months. Whiteley, 1970, (B.36.) says the Henderson Hospital h as 35-40 staff - psychiatrists, social workers, nurses, social therapists, domestic assistants, psychol ogists, secretaries, work group leaders (one an occupational therapist), and part-time - an a ttached DRO, Probation Officer, and Chaplain. 5.1.1.13. Financial information Secure democratic One study was found which described an attempt to work out the cost-effectiveness of a large drug treatment programme in the USA (A.2. Auerbach , 1977). This programme included therapeutic communities, but also included other treatment approach es. The study was in progress, as the programme had not been running long enough to collect sufficient data. Non-secure democratic Very few studies contained financial info rmation about therapeutic communities. Menzies, Dolan & Norton, 1993, (B.55.) estimated the average daily tariff at Henderson Hospital as \u00a3111.00. They also estimated the average daily cost for the general acute psychiatric inpatient beds of four district health authorities and trusts (T hames Region) as \u00a3153.20 (range \u00a373 - \u00a3242); the average daily cost of close supervision units as \u00a3173 (range \u00a3111 - \u00a3258); the average figure for an assessment and one out-patient appointment with a psychiatrist as \u00a3179 (range \u00a386 - \u00a3429); and the average figure for a treatment pack (one out-patient appointment, a nd 8 out-patient episodes) as \u00a3586 (range \u00a3357 - \u00a31,075); the average daily Day Hospital cost as \u00a371 (range \u00a336 - \u00a3123); the average cost of a week in a British adult prison as \u00a3386 (range \u00a3238 - \u00a3744). They also estim ated an average length of stay at Henderson Hospital as 7 months x \u00a3111, and th erefore equal to \u00a323,310 per patient. Dolan, Warren, Menzies & Norton, 1996, (B.56.) estim ated the average annual cost of psychiatric and 57prison services (for 24 patients) pre-treatment as \u00a313, 966 per patient; and post-treatment as \u00a31,308; with the total cost x 24 as pre-treatment at \u00a3335,196, and post-treatment at \u00a331,390. The average cost of this specialist admission was estimated at \u00a323,641 per patie nt, with a bed tariff for Henderson Hospital of \u00a3111.00 per day. They therefore estimated the cu mulative annual in-patient costs pre-treatment as \u00a3264,438; and post-treatment as \u00a319,462; the cumulative annual outpatient costs - pre-treatment as \u00a336,760, and post-treatment as \u00a311,928; and Prison costs - pre-treatment as \u00a339,968, with post-treatment costs as none. 5.1.1.14. Shortfalls in descriptive information obtained Secure democratic Published studies generally provide some information on history, regime description and clients. Unless the studies are specifically about referral and selection procedures, little information is available. In particular, there is little information about how the pa rticular client group in any therapeutic community came to be there. (A.9. Genders & Player, 1995 is a useful exception here). Where therapeutic communities are seen as national resources, it would be helpful to know where their referrals come from, and the grounds on which they are referred and selected . Although monitoring is carried out as part of prison procedure, there is little published informati on on this. No figures were obtained on costs of running secure therapeutic communities. Non-secure democratic While many of the studies give information on the history of therapeutic communities, on their principles and practice, and quite extensive descriptions about regimes, and the treatments offered in therapeutic communities, as well as information about the clients who are selected and admitted, there is much less information on the service contexts of therapeutic communities, on referral procedures, support structures, staff training, and financial information. Also, no information was found on monitoring procedures, or service integration. Obviously, these aspects were not the main focus of this review, but give an indication of what is considered important or rele vant to include in studies presenting research findings. 5.1.2. Descriptive findings for secu re concept-based d escriptive literature These are mainly to be found in the USA, where th e concept-based approach has become dominant. Concept-based therapeutic communiti es for drug-abusers have become widely-established in American prisons. Elsewhere, concept-based therapeutic co mmunities have been established as small units in existing prisons, but not on the same scale as in the USA. Concept-based th erapeutic communities in prisons are modelled on similar therapeutic comm unities in the community, such as Synanon, in California and have been copied by many other establishments throughout the USA and Europe. These therapeutic communities focus almost exclusively on drug abusers. Most of the therapeutic communities described in the studies are based inside mainstream prisons, although the 're-entry' houses, which provide 58gradual re-integration into the community, are based outside. The literature distinguishes two types of concept-based programmes. One is based on the m odel developed at Synanon and Phoenix House, and exemplified by the Stay'n Out programme and most others. A second type is found in Amity (E.25. Graham & Wexler, 1997), where there is a greater fo cus on psychodynamic therapy, social education and the development of close relationships. Concept-based therapeutic communiti es are organised as classic hierarchi es, with ranks of lowest level inmates who communicate upwards through a structure of increasingly more senior inmates, and then staff, and whose instructions come down through the sa me structure. These therapeutic communities offer a series of treatment stages, which are usually organised into three phases. Phase 1 is an orientation phase, during which the new entrant is introduced to the culture, concepts and beliefs of the therapeutic community, and to the rules. Some of the rules delimit ordinary behaviour. For example, it is usually forbidden to talk about drugs except in very particular circumstances, and anyone who does so is likely to be 'pulled up', ie., told in a house meeting that they have transgressed the rules and should not do it again. The therapeutic community belief is that inmates can learn new behaviours and attitudes, and particularly, that drug users can l earn to behave and feel like non-drug users, and that constant confrontation about their behaviour is the way to achieve this. The therapeutic communities often also have cardinal rules which result in expulsion, such as no drugs, sex or violence, although the absolute nature of these penalties will depend on the individual therapeutic comm unity. Inmates who are expelled are returned to mainstream prison. Therap eutic community residence is voluntary, and inmates who want to leave and return to mainstream prison can do so, although they may be asked to think about it first. All inmates work as part of work teams, which are organised as hierarchies, with workers, foremen and leaders. As far as is possible inside a prison, the work they carry out is real, eg: kitchen crew, maintenance crew, office crew. The hierarch y provides a place for everybody in the therapeutic community (including the staff) and provides opportuniti es for inmates to be promoted up to positions of considerable responsibility, and to be demoted if it is felt appropriate. Phase 2 is often the heart of the programme, where inmates who have learnt to use groups and the community, work on their development. It involves working in-house, usually in positions of increasing responsibility, and dealing in therapy groups with the issues which led to drug-taking and crime. Both Phase 1 and Phase 2 revolve around real work, such as cooking, cleaning, maintenance and office duties, and inmates are promoted up through the hierarchy to various work-related positions as they progress. How an individual performs at work, and how an individual feels about work and authority comprise an important part of the treatment. Generally, inmates are required to accept authority and to act as if they are positive and healthy people. The exception to th is is during group therapy sessions - encounter group - where they are encouraged to show and deal with th eir true feelings. (E.32. Wexler, 1997, notes that for some in-prison therapeutic community programmes, th ere are difficulties in finding real work for inmates to do, since basic housekeeping tasks are la rgely contracted to outside providers.) 59The therapy groups are often modelled on the origin al encounter groups run by Synanon, and can be heavily confrontative. Like the non-secure therap eutic communities the prison therapeutic communities are seen as self-help organisations, and peer confrontati on is seen as one of the most valuable tools of the treatment. Encounter groups generally have strict ru les, which try to prevent bullying or inappropriate rescuing, and which try to ensure everyone gets thei r share of attention. The strength of confrontation tends to vary between therapeutic communities, becau se it is recognised more and more that whilst drug users are heavily defended, and need powerful techni ques to get through to them, they may also have associated personality disorders or be extremely introverted. If confrontation is too direct and constant, it can lead to these inmates leaving early. The lite rature suggests that, whereas most of the prison therapeutic communities described be low are based on this confrontativ e model, Amity leans towards a slightly more spiritual and educative model. It is not easy though to assess the difference from the literature. Amity is still largely based on the Phoe nix House model, and it is still a hierarchical therapeutic community. Those inmates who complete Phase 2 (which means they will have successfully held the job of a department head within the therapeutic community, and will have been in treatment for usually 9-12 months), move on to Phase 3 or re-entry. This m eans re-entry into the community, and is a phased progression of moving from full-time residency into work or education in the community. This phase can cause some problems for prison therapeutic communities, si nce their inmates may be ready for re-entry at an early stage in their sentence, and before their o fficial parole date, and cannot be allowed into the community. Sometimes this means being transferred back to the main prison, which is considered detrimental to their recovery. Sometimes, inmates can be at late stages in their sentence, and once they reach their parole date, have to leave altogether, wh ichever stage they have reached. However, where the re-entry and parole date can be made to co-incid e, the inmate is released into the community, to employment or education. Where possible, inmat es are released to a non-secure therapeutic community, so that their re-entry to society can be supervised, a nd so that he or she can have support to find and keep a job or a place in college. Several studies descr ibe therapeutic community aftercare, and various projects have been established which provide early re lease for inmates, provided they live in a specially established community therapeutic community on leaving prison. During the re-entry phase, inmates take on responsib ility for education and often therapy for Phase 1 and 2 residents, acting as role models. By the time they finish this Phase 3, they are usually living and working out in the community, but keeping in t ouch through running or atte nding groups, attending house meetings, and networking with each other. A su ccessful end to Phase 3 re-entry is usually known as graduation. Usually, graduates are encouraged to keep in touch with the therapeutic community, and with the positive reference they have developed during th eir time in the therapeutic community. Programme graduates may well return to the therapeutic comm unity as junior staff members, and some end up as permanent staff, even becoming programme direct ors over time. It is common for concept-based therapeutic communities to recruit ex-addicts, now gra duates, as staff members. It is generally believed that ex-drug users are best positioned to help other drug users, because ex-addict s can empathise with the problems - they know the problems and ways of addicts, and can see through the manipulative ploys. Also, graduates can provide encouraging role-models , as their presence is a constant reinforcement to those still in treatment that it is possible to live a drug -free, crime-free, life. This, too, can be a problem 60in prisons, as not only are such staff ex-inmates, and t hus may be unable to return as staff, but also they often have no officially recognised qualifications (E.32. Wexler, 1997). Unlike democratic therapeutic communities, con cept-based therapeutic co mmunities focus almost exclusively on drug users. Thus, the outcome studies found tend to use relapse and reconviction as the main outcome criteria, although some also look at changes in behaviour and psychological tests scores. 5.2 Evaluative findings from the retaine d literature for secure a nd non-secure democratic therapeutic communities As part of our data extraction of the evaluative literature, we recorded information for individual qualitative case outcome studies, and individual quantitative outcome studies, and for process studies. These findings are all outlined in detail in Main Appe ndix 10.4. This section contains only the findings relating to in-treatment and post-treatment outcome for secure and non-secure democratic therapeutic communities. All the studies mentioned below can be found in su mmarised and tabular form in Section 8. (Tables) below. 5.2.1. In-treatment outcome studies 5.2.1.1. Experimental research/Randomised control trials Secure democratic None found Non-secure democratic We have only found one expe rimental, controlled trial for in-treatment outcome. 1. B.37. (Miles, 1969) Miles' study is of the therapeutic community wa rd and psychopathic unit at Harperbury Hospital, England, for 'subnormal' male psychopaths, mainly adolescent offenders. The therapeutic community was a new unit, and, after some initial allocations to th e new unit, patients were allocated alternately to the therapeutic community group (n=40), and to a non-matc hed control group (n=20) of similar patients in another ward of the same hospital, who were receiving traditional psychiatric disciplinary treatment. However, the therapeutic community was not separ ate from the hospital, and so the treatment group experienced not only the therapeutic community, but the total hospital environment, as did the control group. The outcome criterion was increased ability to form satisfactory personal relationships, between admission and one year later in treatment, measured using sociometric observations. 61These suggested that during the year, there was a steady if slow improvement in interpersonal relationships in the therapeutic community; that the therapeutic community increased the ability of psychopaths to accept each other more than did traditiona l hospital treatment; that the empathic ability of at least some of the patients in the therapeutic community increased during treatment, but not for the control group; that patients in the therapeutic co mmunity formed reciprocated friendships during treatment, while the control group did not; and the therapeutic community in creased the capacity to recognise others feelings towards themselves, whereas the control treatment did not. 5.2.1.2. Cross-institutional/comparative studies Secure democratic This section looks at changes which have been iden tified in inmates between the time of their admission and their departure. Three studies were found in th is section, all cross institutional studies which used psychological test scores to identify changes. Two of these (A.53. McCord, 1982 and A.64. (Gunn et al, 1978) were part of larger studies of post-treatment outcome. A.57. (Wenger, 1974) studied a group of 60 mentally ill offenders who were randomly assigned to tr eatment in a prison therapeutic community, or to conventional drug and observation treatment in a pr ison psychiatric hospital. He found significant improvements in the psychology and improvements in the behaviour of the therapeutic community group. A.53. (McCord, 1982) matched 35 boys at a secure reform therapeutic community with 35 boys at an authoritarian reform school, and found that whilst the therapeutic community improved some basic personality traits and attitudes, it did not decrease le vels of aggression. A.64. (Gunn et al, 1978) found a therapeutic community group at Grendon improved more than an outpatient group at Wormwood Scrubs, becoming less disturbed, acquiring higher self-esteem and becoming more realistic. Non-secure democratic Again, we have only found one cross-institutional, comparative in-treatment outcome study. 1. B.28. (Norris, 1983) This study compares patients at Henderson Hospital, E ngland, with trainees at a detention centre, and residents in voluntary trust communities, and includes matched samples (n=14), and looks at changes in Repertory Construct Grids between admission and disch arge. Numbers for the study are reasonable, and attrition rates are lower than for some studies. Findings are complex. The Henderson Hospital sample had graver behaviour problems and were more emo tional and anxious than the other two samples, and significantly more of the Henderson Hospital group cha nged in desired directions. The author claims 60% success rates overall for patients' increased self-esteem; and that 81% of men who stayed 30+ weeks were successful; as were 71% of the men who attended both community meetings and small psychotherapy groups. 625.2.1.3. Single case studies with control/comparison groups Secure democratic None found. Non-secure democratic We have found three single case studies with control or comparison groups - B.10 (Denford, Schachter, Temple et 1. B.10. (Denford, Schachter, Temple et al, 1983). This retrospective study is also related to the prospective study in B.43. (Rosser, Birch, Bond et al, 1987). This is a study of the Cassel Hospital therapeutic community single adult unit for people with severe personality disorders. Numbers are small, but attrition rates are also very small. The group is, however, subdivided into three groups - a drop-out group, and treatment successes and failures, so numbers are tiny. Outcome criterion is clinical improvement between admission and discharge. Factor s making for successful outcome are identified, as a potential aid to selection procedures, and a success rate stated of 41.37%. 2. B.18. (Karterud, Vaglum, Friis et al, 1992). This study is also related to B.33. (Vaglum, Friis, Irion et al, 1990 - same study data) & B.26. (Mehlum, Friis, Irion et al, 1991). This study is of the day hospital therapeutic community at Ullev Dl University Hospital, in Norway, for decompensated patients with severely disturbed persona lity disorders. Part of this study is of the therapeutic community social atmosphere and dynamics using the Ward Atmosphere Scale. The outcome study covers changes on a number of clinical dimensions, from admission to discharge. Numbers are reasonable but attrition rates are quite high at each testing stage, and the sample is subdivided by diagnosis, and by length of stay. At discharge, mean symptom scores had dropped for all groups, and symptom reduction was correlated positively with lengt h of stay. However, the group with no personality disorder improved most, followed by the borderline personality group and the 'o ther' personality group. The study claimed a 58% success rate for patients, in terms of not being on medication at discharge; 95.8% had made no suicide attempts; 96.9% had not b een transferred to an acute ward; and 74.33% had fulfilled their treatment. The study then went on to claim that the containing capacity of the day hospital therapeutic community was satisfactory. 3. B.58. (Spielman, 1975) This study is of the North Ryde Psychiatric Centre, Australia, for severe personality disorders. It is an intensive group psychotherapy treatment programme, r un along therapeutic community lines. This study looks at changes in self-esteem, alienation and purpose in life, from admission to discharge. It also relates them to a particular part of the treatment milieu - the closed small psychotherapy groups. Numbers are small, because of an attrition rate of 50%, who did not complete treatment, but early leavers are compared to treatment leavers. No success rates are given, but the study claims that, on discharge, patients show an increase in self-esteem; a decrease in alienati on; and an increase in purpose in life. 635.2.1.4. Single case studies with no control/comparison groups Secure concept-based Nine studies were found in this section. One of these, A.53. (McCord, 1982) was part of a larger comparative post-treatment outcome study. It is included here because part of the study looked at behaviour change in therapeutic community inma tes. Three of the studies are from Grendon (A.9. Genders and Player, 1995; A.14. Miller, 1982; A.16. Newton, 1996) and two from the Barlinnie Special Unit (A.3. Cooke, 1983 and A.60. Cooke, 1997). Popul ations of all the studies are described as personality disordered, psychopathic, violent or disruptive. Two studies from Grendon (A.14. Miller, 1982 and A. 16. Newton, 1996) used pe rsonality questionnaires, the Hostility and Direction of Hostility Questionnair e (HDHQ) and Rotters Locus of Control Scale to assess changes. A.14. (Miller, 1982) found that after treatment inmates had lower hostility, lower criminality and greater internal control whilst A.16. (Newton, 1996) found that all scores changed in the direction of normality, and that greater change was found in men who stayed more than 12 months. A.53. (McCord, 1982) used tests and observations to find that psychopathic and behaviourally disturbed boys at a reform school therapeutic community improve d, whilst boys diagnosed as neurotic or borderline psychotic did not. A.40. (Jones, 1989) at the Wormwood Scrubs Annexe, used Kelly's Construct Grid to establish changes in constructs duri ng treatment, and as part of the research, fed back his research findings to the inmates concerned. He found that the feedback itself led to positive changes. He also found that therapeutic community treatment initially lowered and then raised self-esteem, a nd used this evidence to argue that very early discharges from the therap eutic community, during a time when self-esteem is lowered, could be particularly harmful. He al so found that inmates who arrived at the same time as another did worse, which supports the findi ngs of A.45. (McPherson, 1973) at Grendon. A.17. (Ogloff et al, 1990) used Hare's Psychopathic Checklist to compare level of psychopathy with length of stay and degree of motivation. Overall, they found that psychopaths had higher attrition rates and spent less time in the programme, a point which is echoed by Jones (1997) in his comments on the Annexe at Wormwood Scrubs. A.17. (Ogloff et al, 1990) also argued that psychopaths showed less motivation and less improvement than non-psychopaths. Two studies in this section (A.3. Cooke, 1989 and A. 60. Cooke, 1997) describe the Barlinnie Special Unit, a small unit set up by the Scottish Prison Serv ice in Barlinnie Prison to contain violent and disruptive prisoners. The A.3. (Cooke, 1989) study provides detailed information on methodology and findings, whilst the A.60 (Cooke, 1997) study, written after the closure of the Barlinnie Special Unit, provides updated figures. Cooke, looked at the numbe r of assaults and serious incidents committed in prisons by the Barlinnie Special Unit population, and on the basis of these figures, calculated the number of assaults and serious incidents which might be expect ed to occur in the Barlinnie Special Unit. He found that in reality, there were significantly and substa ntially fewer of these events than would have been predicted, and argues from this that the organisati on and administration of a prison regime can greatly contribute to lowering the rate of prison violence. 64 A.9. (Genders and Player, 1995) carried out an qua litative study of Grendon prison, interviewing inmates and staff, and observing therapeutic and prison activ ities over an extended period. They used their findings to create a five stage career model of ther apeutic attainment, in wh ich each stage described a level of progressive therapeutic maturity. They th en used the model to assess the changes brought about by treatment at Grendon, and found that those who stayed the longest (over 18 months) were more likely to achieve therapeutic maturity than others. In an analysis of the characteristics of inmates, they found that those who stayed longest, and thus got furth est, had fewer convictions, higher intelligence and were more self-critical. This study is unusual in that it is qualitative, and the model of progress was derived from qualitative observations and analysis. The career model was later used to inform the Grendon reconviction studies (A.26. Cullen, 1993). The final study in this section is A.73. (Sandhu, 1970) who looked at a special prison in India which treated 18 psychopaths by mixing them in with 30 'we ll-behaved' prisoners, in an attempt to create a positive culture of change. Measurement of change was made on the basis of clinical observations. A.73. (Sandhu, 1970) found that 13 cases improved and 5 did not . Like Cooke, he reports a drop in prison violence, with no riots, serious assaults, suicides or escape attempts. The study of in-treatment behaviour is important for two main reasons. Firstly, it is a way of evidencing treatment effect and divorcing this from reconviction. Reconviction may occur despite treatment effect. Secondly, it examines in-prison behaviour, which in itself can become a serious prison management problem. Studies of behaviour in prison therapeutic co mmunities show that the behaviour of most violent or disruptive inmates improves during treatment. Non-secure democratic None found. 5.2.1.5. Cost-offset studies Secure democratic None found. Non-secure democratic We have only found one in-treatment cost-offset study - B.55. (Menzies, Dolan & Norton, 1993). It is not really a cost-offset study, but provides the groundwork fo r a later cost-offset study - B.56. Dolan, Warren, Menzies & Norton, 1996), by estimating pre- and in-treatment costs. 651. B.55. (Menzies, Dolan & Norton,1993) This is a study of the Henderson Hospital, England. It looks at retrospective pre-treatment costs for one year, for a small group of personality disordered patie nts, in terms of inpatient general psychiatry services; outpatient general psychiatric services; and pr ison costs. Using earlier post-treatment studies of the Henderson Hospital, which suggest that 41% of tr eated patients are not reconvicted or readmitted to psychiatric hospital after three years, these author s estimate a potential average saving of \u00a35,981.96 per patient per year, using ECR tariffs and Home Office costs, and a cost-offset of treatment after four years, with a saving thereafter. 5.2.2. Post-treatment outcome studies 5.2.2.1. Experimental research/randomised control trials Secure democratic Only two RCTs were found in this section, one from the 1960's (A.76. Cornish and Clarke, 1975) and one from the 1970s (A.2. Auerbach, 1977). A.76. (Cornish and Clarke, 1975) studied 13 - 15 year old boys randomly allocated to a therapeutic community hous e and to a conventional house in an approved school. A third group of boys, seen as ineligible for therap eutic community treatment and placed elsewhere, was also followed. No significant differences were found in the reconviction rates of the three groups. A.2. (Auerbach, 1977) studied a 'street prison' which was a secure therapeutic community located in an inner city area. Inmates worked though a systematic progr amme, similar to that provided by concept-based therapeutic communities, eventually being allowed out into the community for work and education. The reconviction study, which included inmates who had been released for between seven weeks and four years, found a significantly lower rate of recidivism for the experimental group. Additionally, it found that the experimental group had a significantly lower incidence of new crimes. Non-secure democratic There are four studies included in this section - B. 7. (Craft, Stephenson & Granger, 1964); B.20. (Lehman & (Chiesa, 1997). (See RCT tables 1-4). Not all of these studies meet all the criteria which strictly apply to experimental research and randomised control trials. Not all the programmes were set up as experimental treatments for the purposes of the controlled trials; not all allocations to the different treatments were strictly random; and not all of them have control groups which include e ither a different treatment or a 'no treatment' option. Some also appear to have run the risk of contamination across treatment variables, and mo st have quite high attrition rates. 661. B.7. (Craft, Stephenson & Granger, 1964) This study described a hospital in-patient ther apeutic community (based on the Henderson Hospital model) or group psychotherapy unit for male (adol escent) delinquents aged 13-25, with relatively low IQs, at Balderton Hospital, England. Although not a secure unit - the hospital was unlocked, and admission was technically voluntary, the patients who came to the unit were either on probation with a condition of residence, or transferred from Approve d Schools for treatment. This unit was not set up specifically for this study, but the study was undert aken not long after the therapeutic community had been implemented as an experimental psychiatric treatment programme. 50 referrals for psychiatric treatment were admitted on a 'strictly alternate basis' (B.7. Craft, Stephenson & Granger, 1964 p.543) to either the group psychothe rapy programme, or to another ward offering standard authoritarian training, through a disciplinary programme with individual treatment, and there was no untreated group. This sample was regarded as sev erely disordered and an extremely maladjusted group. However, 5 referrals who were consider ed too aggressive, and 10 offenders not requiring psychiatric treatment were not admitted. The expected length of stay for both groups was one year, but in fact varied from less than one month, to a year and a half, and 6 boys were excluded from the final analysis, because they stayed less th an three months, and comparisons were not made of the effects of different lengths of stay on outcome. In addition, da ta was only available for 30 boys on one of the tests. The group psychotherapy unit was smaller (30-bed) th an the authoritarian ward (50-bed), and also received, on average, twice as many nursing hours, and three times as many psychiatrist hours as the authoritarian ward. Also, senior nursing and medical st aff in charge of the hospital were common to both treatment wards, and the sample subjects shared common work and occupation therapy programmes, a sheltered workshop and leisure pur suits, and a token economy of 'merit money', which suggests the integrity of the treatment programmes may have been compromised. In addition, the units were only 100 yards apart, and could hear each other! The authors argue that patients' behaviour after discharge provides the 'obvious' criteria for measuring response to treatment (B.7. Craft, Stephenson & Gr anger, 1964 p.547), and so this study used outcome criteria of reconvictions; employment record, in terms of proportion of time employed since discharge; and clinical well-being, through two scales - one of clinical recovery, and one of residual neurotic symptoms, such as nail-biting, tics or enuresis; and changes in severity of disorder, as reflected through psychological tests. (Again, this study did not ev aluate the possible differential effects of the two treatments on different personality sub-groups.) The study hypothesis was that boys receiving the therapeutic community treatment would improve to a greater extent than those receiving the traditional authoritarian treatment. There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups on admi ssion. Between admission and discharge (i.e. in- treatment outcome), there were some differences, a lthough the authors acknowledge that overall, the test results are limited. The only statistical differen ce concerned absconsions, with more boys absconding more often from the authoritarian ward than the group ps ychotherapy unit. There were also differences in measured intelligence: the group therapy group's scores altered little, but 19 out of 24 boys on the authoritarian ward improved their scores. On the Po rteous Maze test, there were no significant changes in 67scores by the group therapy group, but a highly significant decrease in scores by those on the authoritarian ward (pp.548-550). There were differences between the two sample groups at follow-up (this study only includes follow-up results at one year post-discharge). There were significant differences between the two groups in the numbers of offences committed since di scharge, with nearly twice as many committed by members of the group psychotherapy group. However, the group ther apy boys appeared to have a slightly better employment record, although no statis tical difference was found. More than half the group therapy group still needed institutional care, as compared with a quarter of the authoritarian group, a significant difference (B.7. Craft, Stephenson & Granger 1964 p.551). The authors argue that these 'varying results' suggest that the authoritarian ward provided a more effective treatment of the psychopathic delinquents ad mitted to Balderton Hospital than the therapeutic community regime. They suggest the most important difference is the just significantly smaller number of offences at follow-up, and that this, taken with the ps ychological test results and the clinical evaluation, suggest a trend in favour of the authoritarian regime . However, the authors acknowledge that the results in this study do not conclusively show the authoritarian ward to be more effective, but argue that they also do not support the original hypothesis that the therapeu tic community regime is any more effective (B.7. Craft, Stephenson & Granger, 1964 p.552). We es timate succes rates of 41% for the therapeutic community unit, and 50% for the authoritarian regi me (although the latter was also cheaper to run). 2. B.20. (Lehman & Ritzler, 1976) This study compares two mixed inpatient psychiatri c hospital treatments, one a therapeutic community approach ward, which was designed to teach more e ffective social skills and provide a better emotional basis for work functioning; and the other a more traditional medically oriented ward, aimed primarily at the elimination or alteration of 'symptoms' - both in the same medical centre in America. This is a post-hoc comparison, in that the therapeutic community wa rd was not set up experimentally for this study, and some of the data used is retrospective. Also, the di stinctions between the two treatments were not as clear as they might have been, with the traditional ward using family therapy, group therapy and insight- oriented approaches, as well as behaviour modification as part of the treatment, and it had twice weekly staff-patient team meetings, where group issues and dynamics were discussed. Patients were, in theory, randomly admitted to both wards, but this depended on bed supply and demand, and the therapeutic community ward admitted 384 patients per year with an average stay of 21 days, while the more traditional ward admitted 454 patients per year , with an average stay length of 18 days - both very short. This study hypothesised that the therapeutic community ward would provide an atmosphere with greater involvement, increased patient autonomy, and more pr actical treatment orientation (as measured by the Community-oriented Program Environment Scale (COPES) - an adaptation of the Ward Atmosphere Scale); would be more satisfactory to its members (p atients and staff); and would be more effective, as measured by frequency of discharges against medical advice, and readmission rates. 68Approximately 10-20% of the possible sample were not asked to participate because of the severity of their illnesses, so the actual sample used consists of less disturbed patients. Also, there were typical attrition rates for the COPES of between 15 & 30% for st aff, and 25 & 55% for patients, but with larger patient response rates for the therapeutic community ward. The results of the COPES scores showed significant ma in effects for the wards, and significant interaction effects for wards x COPES categories. The differences were that the therapeutic community ward rated significantly higher on involvement, autonomy, practical orientation, and anger a nd aggression, but lower on order and organization. There were no differe nces between patients and staff members in their perceptions of the ward atmospheres. The satisfac tion scores (measured by the reciprocal of the mean difference between real and ideal COPES scores) agai n showed significant main effects for ward and categories, and significant interaction effects for ward s x categories, with greater member satisfaction on the therapeutic community ward, a nd no instance where the medical model ward was more satisfied than the therapeutic community ward. The therapeutic community ward had a significantly higher readmission rate overall, but had twice the readmission rate for neurotic patients, suggesting that this inpatient treatment approach was not very effective in preventing serious reoccurrence of symp toms following discharge, although the authors point out that this does not necessarily mean the treatment has failed, until other areas of functioning are also taken into account. There were no differences betw een the wards for overall frequency of discharges against medical advice, but character disorder patient s left against medical advice significantly more often on the therapeutic community ward, suggesting an in teractional effect between patients' diagnostic categories and treatment approach. The authors conclude that the more open, free-wh eeling atmosphere of the therapeutic community oriented ward may not be a good match for the im pulsive, acting-out individual with sociopathic tendencies, and that perhaps patients need a certain b ase level of social co-operation and concern, for the therapeutic community oriented treatment to be e ffective. We estimate success rates of 74% for all patients, including character disorders, for the ther apeutic community regime, in terms of readmission figures. The authors' study had originally posed the questi ons 'Does the therapeutic community inpatient ward really work?', to which they conclude that their st udy appears to provide a qualified 'yes' (B.20. Lehman & Ritzler, 1976 p.760). 3. B.29. (Piper, Rosie, Joyce & Azim, 1996) This study, described as a clinical trial evaluation of treatment efficacy, is of a day treatment programme, also called partial hospitalization, in Canada, r un as a modified therapeutic community, offering time- limited (18 weeks) group oriented and milieu therapy to 14-70 year old male and female patients with long-standing personality problems - affective and pe rsonality disorders. The study does not compare therapeutic community treatment with other types of treatment, but compares immediate 18 week day therapeutic community treatment, with a 'control' group receiving the same treatment, but with a delay condition (waiting list) of 18 weeks. The study also looked more closely at a subsample of 120 patients 69(60 matched pairs from each treatment condition). Patie nts who met the unit exclusion criteria were asked to participate in the study, and were then random ly allocated to one of the two treatments. Attrition rates were quite high. 5% refused to particip ate in the study, and another 8.8% were lost in the assessment process. Subsequently, a further 42% of th e immediate treatment group were lost to outcome, as were 31.5% of those assigned to the control/delayed treatment condition, so that, out of an original possible sample of 261, 79 completed immediate treat ment, and 61 completed the delay period, but only 39 of these completed delayed treatment as well (40.1%). (However, the authors point out that the follow-up patients did not differ significantly from the rest of the sample.) Outcome was multivariate, and measured in terms of 17 clinical variables, covering the areas of interpersonal functioning (8), psychiatric symptoma tology, self-esteem, life satisfaction, and defensive functioning, plus severity of disturbance based on written individual patient treatment objectives (B.29. Piper, Rosie, Joyce & Azim 1996 p.214). The authors concluded that their 'clinical trial' pr ovided considerable support for the efficacy of the day treatment therapeutic community programme (B.29. Piper, Rosie, Joyce & Azim 1996 p.223), and that there was a strong treatment effect that was maintain ed at follow-up (at an average of 8 months after therapy was completed). Treated patients improved si gnificantly more than their matched counterparts in the control condition in four of the general content areas studies - interpersonal functioning, symptomatology, life satisfaction and self-esteem, as well as in relation to their individualized goals for treatment: that is, these findings were supported by both between-condition and own-control analyses. For all variables, improvements associated with tr eatment were maintained at follow-up, or else demonstrated additional benefit. For all outcome va riables, the average treated patient exceeded 76% of the control patients, and 87% for those seven variables deemed to be significant, i.e. the effect sizes of treated patients relative to control patients were of considerable magnitude (.71) (B.29. Piper, Rosie, Joyce & Azim, 1996 p.223). In addition quality of object relations, and psychological mindedness were found to be related significantly and directly to patient success (remaining and benefitting) in the programme, and psychological mindedness was also found to be related directly to the degree to which patients worked in the programme. 4. B.3. (Chiesa, 1997) This is a study of the psychotherapeutic community at the Cassel Hospital, in England, offering a therapeutic milieu and psycho-social treatment. It is a study of the single adult inpatient psychotherapy unit for people with severe personality disorders, within that hospital. The methodology of the study and some preliminary results are describ ed, because they are of interest to this review, although the research project is still on-going, and final results will not be available until at least next year. 70The project is experimental, in that it is a 5-y ear prospective study, evaluating a newly established treatment programme. It is comparing two different types of therapeutic community treatment - one is a one-stage programme (the traditional Cassel ther apeutic community programme) of 12-18 months inpatient therapeutic community treatment; and the ne w, modified, two stage treatment programme, which involves shorter (6 month) inpatient therapeutic community treatment, followed by an extended out- patient follow-up treatment of one year of twice w eekly group analytic therapy and concurrent outreach psychosocial nursing and outreach team work for the first six months. These two treatments will also be compared to another comparison group of similar patients, who are being managed by a general psychiatrist in another region, with no access to ther apeutic community treatment. Allocation to the two therapeutic community treatment programmes is not random, but based on geographical considerations - patients referred from within the Greater London area are allocated to the two-stage programme, all others to the longer one-stage inpatient only programme. The expected final sample was originally 120+. Ho wever, the study has already encountered problems with attrition (four years after the implementation of the new programme). Five patients have swapped from the two-stage to the one-stage programme. A si gnificantly higher percentage of one-stage patients have dropped out in the first three months of treat ment (although these rates become considerably lower from four to twelve months) than in the two-stage programme. In addition, there has been a significant discrepancy between expected and actua l lengths of stay, with a significantly lower rate of attrition for the two-stage programme (mean average length for 12 month programme = 6 months; for 6 month programme = 5.3 months). The proposed outcome criteria are reduction in treatme nt costs (expected 40%); improved transition back into society; increase in numbers treated; and a reducti on in the waiting list. The study hopes to evaluate the relative effectiveness of the two treatment programmes, and to identify positive and negative prognostic factors. 5.2.2.2. Comparative/cross-ins titutional/cross-treatment studies Secure democratic In theory, all control group studies for secure therap eutic communities should count as cross-institutional studies. Therapeutic community populations are comp ared with prison populations and thus both groups were receiving some form of treatment. However, a difference was identified between studies which drew control groups from the general pr ison populations, and those which drew them from one mainstream prison. Those which drew control groups from one specified institution are reported here, whilst the others are reported in 5.2.2.3 as individual therapeutic community/single case studies with control/comparison groups. 71Using this criterion, five studies were found. Three studies found no significant differences between th e reconviction rates of therapeutic community inmates and comparison groups - A.15. (Newton, 1971); A.67. (Newton, 1973); A.21 (Sewell & Clark, 1982). A.18. (Rehn, 1979), comparing a German Social Therapeutic Institution with a prison, found that therapeutic community inmates were more likely to offend than the comparison group. When the figures are broken down into more sensitiv e gradations, further findings emerge. A.67. (Newton, 1973) notes the positive effect of a long stay in treatment, a finding which is echoed in many other studies. Evidence for a treatment effect is found in A.54. (McCord & Sanchez,1983), a study in which a therapeutic community school was compared to an authoritarian reform school. Ex-therapeutic community boys were at first less likely to re-offend th an ex-reform school boys, but after five years, the ex-therapeutic community boys reconviction rates ro se sharply, and overtook those of the other group. After extensive analysis, the authors concluded th at the initial low re-offending rate was a result of therapeutic community treatment, but that this wore off over time because the boys who came from the therapeutic community were particularly disadvant aged. A high proportion of them were poor and black, and when faced with prejudices and lack of opportuniti es in society, eventually returned to criminal activities. The reform school boys, who were less di sadvantaged as a group exhibited no treatment effect, but had fewer difficulties integrating into societ y, and so, eventually, began to re-offend less. A.21. (Sewell & Clark, 1982) found that drug addicts had the highest rate of re-offending, whilst sex offenders had the lowest. Whilst these cross-institutional studies provide a means of comparing outcomes of treatment, therapeutic communities tend to target difficult and personality disordered offenders, whereas prison wings contain a much broader spectrum of offenders, and prison hospitals contain those w ho are mentally ill. Thus, it is debatable whether cross-institutional studies in this instance provide a higher quality comparison than control group studies. The difficulties of finding a control group for this type of inmate is discussed below. Non-secure democratic We have only found one cross-institutional and/or cross-therapeutic communities study (B.53. Karterud, Pedersen, Friis et al, 1998), and this is still on-going, but again is reported he re, because the methodology is of interest 1. B.53. (Karterud, Pedersen, Friis et al, 1998) This study reports the forming of a Norwegian netw ork of several (currently 5 - one a therapeutic community in a psychiatric hospital department, w ith 3 preparing to join), psychotherapeutic day hospitals for the treatment of patients with personality disorders, to co-operate in an extensive quality assurance system. The network's quality assurance system is based on formal, signed, contract-based co- operation, and members have to pay an annual fee. The contracts oblige par ticipants to use the same quality assurance sy stem, for which they get a handbook, to receive training and software (free of charge), 72and to send their data in anonymous form at regul ar intervals to a common data base. Treatment is standardised across the network, is based on a variet y of group therapy formats, and is for a time-limited period of 18 weeks (like that in B.29. Piper, Rosie, Joyce & Azim, 1996), with a three and a half protracted outpatient phase. Follow-up is for five years. The authors argue that this system provides benef its to the individual patient, and the individual unit; provides a support system for all the units; and will assi st health care planning (B.53. Karterud, Pedersen, Friis et al, 1998 pp.24-25). The strengths of the network, from the research point of view, lie in the larger number of patients, and the similarities and differen ces between the units. The network units treat around 180 patients a year in the day hospitals, and around 150 additional patients in outpatient group analysis. The differences between the units can be looked upon as a natural experi ments (B.53. Karterud, Pedersen, Friis et al, 1998 pp.25-26). Finally, the network is us ing the Internet, both as a means of communication, and to provide the public with information. 5.2.2.3. Single case studies with control/comparison groups Secure democratic Nine studies were found. An important methodological point here is the difficulty for researchers of finding a matched comparison group for prison therapeutic community populations, si nce therapeutic community inmates tend to be more disturbed and more likely to be addicted to drugs and alcohol than general prison populations. A.13. (Marshall,1997) used two comparison groups, one drawn from the genera l prison population and one from the Grendon waiting list. He found that both the treatment group and the waiting list group were different from the general group and at a higher risk of re-offending. On release, the treated group were less likely to be reconvicted than the waiting list gr oup. The methodological arguments in the literature suggest that a waiting list group provides a better co mparison than other groups, but that waiting list inmates may well be given treatment of some sort, and so a fair comparison remains elusive. The therapeutic communities studied admitted a vari ety of inmates. Some therapeutic communities selected inmates on features of their criminal history such as recidivism (A.1. Angliker et al, 1973; A.63. Briggs, mental disorder (A.47. van Emmerick, 1987; A.19. Rice et al, 1992) and some simply took offenders (A.68. McMichael, 1974; A.58a. Paddock and Scott ,1973). Four studies looked at inmates in Grendon prison, and described these as personality disordered. Tests and questionnaires administered to inmates in secure ther apeutic communities generally show inmates to be more disturbed, more dangerous to themselves and ot hers, have longer psychiatric and criminal histories and to abuse drugs and alcohol more than the general prison population. Consequently, reconviction rates need to be read in this context, since it could be anticipated they would be higher if it were not for therapeutic community intervention (A.13. Marshall, 1997). 73Bearing this proviso in mind, several studies f ound no significant differences between the reconviction rates of therapeutic community inmates and comparison groups. (A.1. Angliker et al, 1973; A.68. McMichael, 1974; A.58a. Paddock and Scott, 1973). Other studies found that therapeutic community inmates were more likely to offend than comparis on groups (A.47. van Emmerick, 1987; A.64. Gunn et al, 1978; A.20. Robertson and Gunn, 1987). Other studies found therapeutic community inmates were less likely to reoffend (A.63. Briggs, 1972; A.26. Cullen, 1993; A.13. Marshall, 1997). When the figures are broken down into more sensitive gr adations, further findings emerge. A.26. (Cullen, 1993) compared short stay and long stay inmates at Grendon, and found that long-stay inmates were less likely to be convicted than short-stay inmates. Ot her writers on therapeutic communities have made this point, but opinion is divided as to why this should occur. Because therapeutic community treatment is voluntary, inmates can decide to leave if they are unable or unwilling to continue. Also, they can be ejected if they do not comply with the behaviour requirements of the community, or do not seem interested in making progress. Thus, there may be a mechanism at work in the therapeutic community which systematically excludes the most difficult of pa tients, and at the same time systematically retains the least difficult. Thus ,the higher rates of recidivism for short-stay inmates and lower rates for long-stay patients may be a reflection of the selection procedures , and have more to do with the types of inmate who leave or stay than with a treatment effect. However, this remains a matter of speculation: it is thought that the most severely personality disordered offenders do not stay long in therapeutic communities (Jones, 1997; A.17. Ogloff et al., 1990) and that this may account for the finding that short-stay inmates do worst. The problem of finding a truly matched comparison group makes this a difficult question to pursue. A.63. (Briggs, 1972) reports on a prison therapeutic community which had two distinct organisational phases. At first, the therapeutic community was in tegrated into Chino Prison. Later however, the therapeutic community was made autonomous, and was able to govern and manage itself. The reconviction rates for this second, autonomous, phase, were improved over those for the first phase, and suggested that prison therapeutic communities work better when kept separate from mainstream prisons. Some writers have analysed their results in term s of the crimes committed by inmates. A.47. (van Emmerick, 1987) who studied the secure forensic ther apeutic community, Dr. Henri Van der Hoeven in Utrecht, found that patients who came in with the most serious offences were the most likely to recidivate. Non-secure democratic We have found twelve research studies of individual therapeutic communities, which include some sort of comparison or control group as part of the study. Se ven of these relate to one therapeutic community, Henderson Hospital, and will be described together en bloc, and in chronological order Wilson, 1992; B.13. Dolan, Evans & Wilson, 1992; B.14. Dolan, Warren & Norton, 1997). The others will be described in the order they appear on tables (individual therapeutic communities with control/comparison groups studies 1- 4: (B.26. Mehlum, Friis, Irion 1989; B.62. Tucker, Bauer, Wagner et al, 1987). 74 1. B.30. (Rapoport, 1960) This study is actually based on the Belmont Ho spital Social Rebilitation Unit, which became the Henderson Hospital. At this stage, its target popul ation were described as working class psychopaths, or patients with long-standing personality disorders. The book reports on two different studies - one conducted by Rosow of all people referred fro m 1953-1957 (n=1226), and Ra poport's more detailed outcome study of 168 treated patients, split into two series, one cross-sectional, and one consecutive. Rapoport also compared those with stronger and w eaker ego strengths, across 5 behavioural defence types; those who improved during treatment and those who did not; and patient profiles at 6 months and one year post-discharge. Attrition rates were high - 58.3% of the outcome sample at the 6 month follow-up, and 61.9% at the one year follow-up, and so numbers at outcome are relatively small. Rapoport concluded that 41% had im proved at the one year follow-up, and this number was greater than at the 6 month follow-up. Improvement at follow-up was also significantly related to in-treatment improvement, and those patients with stronger egos made significan tly greater gains at follow-up. However, Rapoport also found that 16.6% of the outcome sample were worse at the 6 month follow-up than in their pre- treatment state. 2. B.36. (Whiteley, 1970) and B.6. (Copas & White ley, 1976) are related, sequential studies. (B.36. findings are also reported in B.35. Whiteley, Briggs & Turner, 1972.) B.36. (Whiteley, 1970) looked at a sample of 122 consecutive male only discharges from Henderson Hospital, one year and three years after discharge, in terms of reconviction and psychiatric hospital readmission. This sample was compared to a further consecutive group of 50, selected for admission, but who did not arrive. The sample itself was divided for comparison into those with better and poorer outcomes, and according to symptomatology, and whether they had convictions, and compared those with previous convictions only, with those with previous convictions and previous psychiatric hospital admissions. Attrition were again high - 47.6 % at one and three years. Whiteley enumerated a number of factors associated with better outcome, such as the predominance of affective syndrome in the presenting symptomatology of personality disordered patients, and stressed the importance of appropriate selection. He also claimed a success rate overall of 40.1%, but higher for those with previous psychiatric admissions. 3. B.6. (Copas & Whiteley, 1976) This study and its findings were further developmen ts of B.36. (Whiteley, 1970), to produce a predictive equation for the outcome of therapeutic community treatment at the Henderson Hospital with its particular personality disordered patients, which was to be valid ated on a further cohort of patients. It was hoped this equation would help improve selection. The predictive equation included six factors, and the outcome criteria were again reconviction and psychiatric hospital readmission - criteria that the authors admit are crude. However, there were no attrition ra tes once the study started because the authors were only using available government records. The st udy found that the equation did give a useful differentiation between 'poor' and ' good' outcome groups. The outcome period was longer - 5 - 6 years, and the authors claimed success rates of 47.1% at 2 - 3 year follow-up, and 40.2% at 5 - 6 year follow-up. One important observation they made was that an ear ly failure is not necessarily a precursor of repeated relapse (B.6. Copas & Roberts & Whiteley, 1984). This study included a larger mixed sample (245) of both patients admitted to Henderson Hospital, and tho se not admitted patients. Patients were classified into a typology of personality disorder, and into su ccesses and failures, and the study then investigated how the various types, and other background character istics, are related to outcome, again measured as reconviction or psychiatric hospital readmission. Attrition rates are lower than in some studies. The authors claim that therapeutic community treatment is effective with selected individuals, showing the antisocial behaviour associated with personality disorder , and of particular benefit to offenders with only one conviction, who are able to stay in treatment fo r 6+ months, in order for treatment to be maximally effective (B.5. Copas, O'Brien, R oberts & Whiteley, 1984 p.565). However, they also point out that those who were solely violent to themselves had a partic ularly poor outcome. Also, the poorest prognosis was for the extrapunitive neurotic personality disordered patient, with or without treatment, but the authors argue that even here, therapeutic community treatment can be effective. Again, the study claims success rates of 41%. 5. B.12. (Dolan, Evans & Wilson, 1992) (This is related to B.13. Dolan, Evans & Wilson, 1992)) This studied changes in neurotic symptomatology at follow-up (average 8 months) for a cohort of Henderson hospital personality disorder ed patients. They also compared the group who completed the follow-up questionnaire with those who did not, and comp ared patients staying different lengths of time in treatment (by trichotomisation). Attrition rate was 35%. The authors suggest that the sample has high scores for general symptomatology on admission, but their results show a highly significant reduction in symptomatic distress as measured by the SCL-90 questionnaire, following treatment at Henderson Hospital. Also, the long-stay group (9+ months) tended to show greater improvement than both the short (up to 3 months) and medium (3-9 months) stay groups. The authors state success rates of 55%, in terms of subjects improving reliably; and 32% whose change was also clinically significant. However, 6.5% of patients had deteriorated. The authors also point out that they did not take account of possible intervening life events between discharge and follow-up. 6. B.13. (Dolan, Evans & Wilson, 1992) This describes the same sample as B.12. (which contains the follow-up resu lts in detail.) This paper looks more closely at predictors of length of stay, a nd the relationship between improvement in neurotic symptomatology at follow-up, and length of stay in therapeutic community treatment. Attrition rates were 46% for the short and medium length stay groups, and 23% for the long-stay group. The numbers in each group are also relatively small. The findings were:- lengt h of stay is related to gender; is not related to initial neurotic symptomatology; tends to be related to change in symptomatology in the first 3 months of admission; but is not significantly associated with improvement in neurotic symptoms on follow-up - which seems to gainsay the tendency found in B.12. 767. B.14. (Dolan, Warren & Norton, 1997) This study looked at changes in core personality disorder symptoms, one year after therapeutic community treatment, (or one year after referral if not admitted), for a final sample of 137 patients with severe personality disorder. Attrition rates were 36.5% for completion of the baseline forms, and 58% for baseline sample, who did not complete follow-up forms. The baseline sample were grouped into admitted and not admitted (a sub-sample of this was those E CRs whose funding was refused). At follow-up, all groups showed some decrease in average symptom sco res over time. There was a significantly greater reduction in borderline symptom scores in the treat ed than in the non-admitted group. Changes in borderline symptom scores were significantly positively correlated with length of treatment. There was also a significant difference between the length of stay of admitted patients who showed clinically significant change, and those who did not. 61% of the treated group improved reliably, compar ed with 37% for the non-admitted group, while 43% of the treated sample showed clinically significant change, compared with 18% of the non-treated group. The authors also state that this change was reliable and clinically significant in 42.9% of the treated sample, compared with only 17.9% of the non- admitted group (18.2% of the unfunded ECR group). 8. B.26. (Mehlum, Friis, Irion et al, 1991) (This study is also related to B.18 Karterud, Vaglum, Friis et al, 1992, and B.33. Vaglum, Friis, Irion et al, 1990.) This is a study of the day unit for personality disorders at Ullev Dl Hospital, in Norway. The sample was grouped according to type of personality disorder, a nd these groups related to outcome, at 2 to 5 years after treatment. Attrition rate was relatively low at 24.7% at follow-up. Outcome criteria were multi- dimensional, and findings therefore more complex. The sample as a whole decreased in symptom scores from admission to discharge, and this was maintained at follow-up; there were no statistically significant differences between diagnostic groups; Cluster C personality disorders had both good global outcome, and marked symptom reduction; the borderline pe rsonality disorder group had moderate symptom reduction and fair global outcome; the schizotypal personality disorder group had a reduction in symptoms similar to the borderline group, but retain ed relatively poor global functioning, and were the least socially adjusted, employed and self supporting of all the diagnostic groups. The whole sample received outpatient treatment on average 50% of the follow-up period, and the schizotypal (77.7%) and borderline personality disorder groups had more in-pa tient treatment in the follow-up period than other groups. The success rates were 60% for the whole sample in terms of employment; and in terms of global outcome - 60% for the cluster C group and the no pers onality disorder group, and 20% for the borderline personality disorder group. 9. B.43. (Rosser, Birch, Bond et al, 1987) This is a study of the single adult unit for people w ith borderline personality, or personality problems, at the Cassel Hospital psychotherapeutic community in E ngland. For this reason, the sample size is small (28), so that although the attrition rate appears quite low at 17.85%, this reduces the sample to 23. Also, the sample appears to contain more neurotic patients than borderline. The sample was again divided into 77groups according to their global outcome ratings - at discharge, and at follow-up, and into drop-outs, and successes and failures, but numbers are then very small. Outcome criteria were multi-dimensional. The aut hors concluded that length of treatment positively correlated with outcome. At discharge, it was clai med that 60% of neurotic patients had improved, compared to 10% of other patients. The stated success rate overall at follow-up was 42.85%, but again was much better for neurotic than borderline personality disorder patients. The authors also claimed that some 70% of long-term successes could be identified at admission. In addition, the authors used an estimated lifetime profile of earnings to calculate a net gain for the sample as a whole of \u00a3500,000. 10. B.57. (Eisen, Blenkhorn, Wendiggensen et al, 1986) This study is of a modified therapeutic community at the Melbourne Clinic Psychotherapy Unit, in Australia, for people with long-standing personality disorders (93% of those admitted have severe personality disorders). The sample was 76, but attriti on rates were 51.2%, and in fact only 18.42% (18) had completed treatment at the end of the study. Th e sample was further subdivided into admitted and not admitted, and by length of stay, and by diagnosis. The study claimed that avoidant and dependent personality disordered patients showed less retention of symptoms following treatment, whereas borderline, narcissistic, histrionic and schizotypal personality disorders showed retention of higher symptom scores (but numbers are small). 46.16% (18) of patients were regarded as successfully independent, that is, were able to undertake full or part-time work, home duties or study at follow-up. Only 10.26% of those admitted were symptomless at follow-up. 11. B.59. (Gara, Hutchinson & Hafner, 1989) This study is of the Willows therapeutic community in Australia. It is of interest, because its target population are patients with personality disorders and substance abuse, but it is a democratic, not a concept-based, therapeutic commun ity. The sample was grouped and compared according to patients' attitudes to the treatment regime. Attrition rates are high - 51.5% of the sample were not traceable, and a further 36.1% were non-responders, so the final sample at follow-up was 32. The sample demonstrated increased coping with everyday life; increased level of satisfaction with employment and social-leisure activities, and improvement in their main problems at follow-up. Success rates claimed were 50.9% for increased number of close relationships, and 56.9% for better quality close relationships. 12. B.62. (Tucker, Bauer, Wagner et al, 1987) This study is of a specialised long-term in-patient psychiatric unit for patients with 'borderline conditions' in America. However, the sample of 40 inpatients are described as severe pers onality disorders. The sample was subdivided according to different durations of stay. Attrition rates were 19.5% at one year, and 35.5% at the two year follow-up, again leaving numbers quite small. The group as a whole had fewer rehospitalisations, one and two years af ter discharge, than for equivalent periods of time before admission, and patients were more likely to be in continuous outpatient psychotherapy bot h one and two years after discharge - which can be regarded as a success for this patient group. Patients also improved clinically and in global functioning, and repor ted improved relationships and inte rpersonal networks. Those who stayed longest had greater severity of illness at admission, and showed greater change in global functioning at follow-up. 78 5.2.2.4. Single case studies without control/comparison groups Secure democratic Nine studies were found. Whilst these were single case studi es, in that they studied patients or inmates in one institution, several studies provided a compara tive element between a study group and another group. Thus: (i) A.12. (McMurran et al, 1998) studying a therapeutic community in a Regional Secure Unit, compared outcomes for patients admitted for assessment only, a nd patients admitted for assessment and then kept on for treatment. They found no significant differences between the reconviction rates of the two groups, but a reduction in crime in both groups. (ii) A.47. (van Emmerick, 1987) studying the Dr.Henri van der Hoeven clinic in Utrecht, compared patients released into the community with patients tr ansferred somewhere else first, and found that those released directly from the hospital were less likely to be reconvicted and less likely to have drug and alcohol problems. This finding was echoed by A.37b. (Grendon Psychology Unit,1996) and by A.26. (Cullen, 1993) in his study of Grendon (see 3.4.3.3.). (iii) Several studies noted that the longer an inmate stayed in therapy the less likely they were to be reconvicted. A.40. (Jones, 1988) in a study of th e Annexe in Wormwood Scrubs found that those who stayed more than 26 months did best; A.43. (George, 1971) found a better outcome for men who stayed more than twelve months in treatment at Grendon, (iv) Whilst several writers argue that patients leave treatment early because of individual psychological reasons (eg: Jones 1997), A.12. (McMurran et al, 1998) found no significant differences between a group which stayed less than six months and a group which stayed longer. A.45. (McPherson, 1973) following A.43. (George, 1971) focussed on an organisational reason for length of stay - the number of new patients admitted together. He noted that therapists pr efer to take new inmates separately so that they do not form anti-therapeutic relationships with other newcomers, and are more influenced by the established therapeutic community culture. He found that men ad mitted to Grendon on their own, rather than at the same time as other new men, were likely to stay longer, and thus ultimately be less likely to recidivate. Research in this category also looked at a variety of personal and psychological traits, and related these to reconviction. A.43. (George, 1971) found that mo re positive outcomes could be expected for Grendon men who were older, married, and had few previ ous convictions, whilst (Jones 1988) at the Wormwood Scrubs Annexe found that extra-punitiveness was re lated to reconviction. A.67. (Newton, 1973), focussing on treatment effect, found that inmates w hose hostility scores became significantly lower during treatment were less likely to recidivate. 79Overall then, whilst the studies in this category di d not compare treated inmates to inmates treated elsewhere, they nevertheless generated comparisons within the groups studied. Findings suggest that inmates who stay longer do better, but information on why some people leave early and some stay is inconclusive. Length of stay may be related to individual characteristics or to local therapeutic community dynamics. Studies also showed that inma tes released into the outside community did better than those transferred back to main stream prison. However, there ar e unresolved questions attached to this finding, too. Most of these studies have looked at prison therapeutic communities where inmates are admitted towards the end of their sentence, and, if treatment goes according to plan, these inmates stay in treatment and are released into the community on thei r release date. Inmates who leave treatment early are transferred back to mainstream prison; therefore, as a group, they are all treatment drop-outs or rejects. It may be this feature which affects the likelihood of their being reconvicted, rather than the effect of experiencing mainstream prison after the therapeutic community. One prison therapeutic community in the UK which has a different policy is the Gartree Therapeutic Community, where inmates are admitted towards the beginning of their life sentence, which m eans that all of them will be transferred before release. Further research with this group may help to establish the effect of transfer after a successful therapeutic community career. Non-secure democratic We found four single case studies of post-treatment outcome, which did not include control or comparison groups - B.2. (Carson, (Davidson, 1976). 1. B.2. (Carson, 1973) This is a fairly simplistic outcome study of a therap eutic community for anti-soci al adolescents in Canada. The sample size was fairly small, and attrition rates were high - 48.9%. The length of follow-up was not stated. While 55.56% of the adolescents were empl oyed or at school at follow-up, and 62% reported improved relationships with their parents, 28.88% had been in court since discharge, and 82.88% said they had committed offences which could have brought them to court if they had been caught, and the success rate of 71.12% non-offenders at discharge h as to be considered in the light of this. 2. B.19. (Kobal & \u00f0agar, 1994) This study is retrospective, and is not a rigorous out come study, It contains mainly descriptive facts and figures, and has no data about the samples referred to , or the overall time span, etc. However, it is included here, because it is of interest to this review. It is about forensic pa tients - psychotic offenders, and some prisoners and people with socially accentuat ed psychiatric disorders - in Slovenia, and is non- secure, open ward, even though many of the patients are subject to security restrictions. The outcome criteria are therefore whether or not patients have been discharged, wh ich is unusual for this patient group - the authors say the discharge of offenders from compar able institutions is relatively rare - and whether or not they have committed socially dangerous offen ces post-discharge. Readmissions are not regarded as failure. The authors claim 100% success rates for patie nts being discharged - of the initial number of 127 offenders subject to security measures, none are s till in the institution; and for psychotic patients committing further socially dangerous offences since discharge. 80 3. B.15 (Hafner & Holme, 1996) (This study is of the same therapeutic community as B.59. Gara, Hutchinson & Hafner, 1989.) The sample size in this study is again quite small, and attrition rates cumulatively high. 82.9% of the sample were not readmitted to psychiatric hospital at follow-up, although 6.25% had been admitted for the first time. There was an overall and statistically significant reduction in psychological symptoms that occurred after an average of 64 days in the community; by 3 month follow-up, symptom levels had fallen by 45% since admission. Patients continued to improve after discharge. 4. B.8. (Davidson, 1976) Elliott House is a Home Office Probation Hostel therap eutic community for persistent male offenders. Again, this is not a rigorous outcome study, and little detail is given. Sample numbers are relatively small, and no attrition rates are given, nor are the parameters of the follow-up period, and the outcome criterion is crude. However, the author claims that 78% of residents competed twelve months in treatment without returning to prison; and 69% completed a fu rther twelve months after leaving Elliott House, without returning to prison. 5.2.2.5. Cost offset studies Secure democratic None found Non-secure democratic We have found three post-treatment cost-offset studies (Chiesa, 1997); and B.56. (Dolan, Warren, Menzies & Norton, 1996). Unfortunately, they do not all measure exactly the same service u sages, so findings are not directly comparable. 1. B.4. (Chiesa, Iacoponi & Morris, 1996) This study relates to the Cassel Hospital. It looked at two groups of patients, one pre-treatment and one post-treatment, in terms of their use of inpatie nt and outpatient psychiatric services; outpatient psychotherapy services; and inpatient medical and surgical services. Numbers are small - initially, 26 in each group, because attrition rates were high - 10% fro m the pre-treatment group, and 50% for the post- treatment group. The authors found a significant decr ease in the use of these services, particularly in terms of psychiatric readmissions, and also in the u se of psychotropic medicati on, and of cigarette and alcohol consumption, and an increased employment rate for the post-treatment group. The authors estimated an annual cost-offset or saving, over all three sets of services, of \u00a37,423 per patient. 812. B.9. (Davies, Campling & Ryan, 1997) This study of Francis Dixon Lodge, in England, l ooked at pre-treatment and post-treatment inpatient general psychiatric admissions only for Leicestersh ire patients admitted to the Lodge, and for ECR patients admitted. Numbers are again small, but attriti on rates are lower, largely due the the fact that the Lodge takes mainly local pa tients, who are more easily traced. The authors recorded us age for three years pre-treatment, but particularly look at costs for the year before, which represents 54% of the three year total, and the year after treatment, although further fo llow-up is planned. The cost-offset for Leicester patients was \u00a32,579; for ECR patients \u00a38,575; and the total \u00a33,074. 3. B.56. (Dolan, Warren, Menzies & Norton, 1996) This study looks at pre- and post-treatment usage of inpatient general psychiatric services; outpatient general psychiatric services, and prison costs. Numbers are very small - 24. Costs are calculated using Home Office and ECR data - which reflects th e Henderson Hospital's national catchment funding (although the authors do not confirm that all 24 patients are ECR funded), but, as can be seen from the above study (B.9. Davies, Campling & Ryan, 1997), is much higher than for those using local therapeutic communities, so is not generalisable beyond Hende rson Hospital, and ECRs. The authors found an overall average cost offset of \u00a312,658.59 per patient. 5.3 Evaluative findings from the retaine d secure concept-based outcome literature. This section covers the concept-based therapeutic co mmunities, which are almost always used for treating drug abusers. Although there are concept-based therap eutic communities in Europe and the UK, these are mostly based in the community, and have little publishe d literature. In contrast, the USA has developed a number of concept-based therapeutic communities hou sed in prisons, and has published a considerable amount of outcome research on these. 5.3.1. Post-treatment outcome studies 5.3.1.1. Experimental research/randomised control trials and tables Four studies were found in this section, all relati ng to CREST, a secure therapeutic community work release centre set up by the University of Delaware to provide therapeutic community prison aftercare and to provide the setting for the RCT. This research is all part of a large research demonstration project funded initially with two grants from NIDA (National Institute on Drug Abuse) and later with a follow on grant. Because the studies compared slightly differe nt groups, they will be described separately here. E.11b. (Nielsen et al, 1996) randomly assigned eligible inmates to CREST, or to a conventional work release programme. At 6 and 18 months after admi ssion, both groups were interviewed, to ascertain criminal involvement, and blood and urine samples were taken, to ascertain drug use. They found that therapeutic community work release w as effective in reducing recidivism and drug use, and that length of time in the programme improved outcome. 82E.10. (Martin et al, 1995) studied the KEY in-prison th erapeutic community (part of Delaware Prison) and the CREST work release centre (part of Delaware Univ ersity). CREST had been set up not just as an autonomous work release centre, but also to provide continuing therapeutic community treatment for drug abusers who left the KEY. E.10. (Martin et al, 1995) compared four groups: those who had been through the Key programme only, those who had been thr ough the CREST programme only, those who had been through both KEY and CREST and a comparison group w ho had been through none of these, but were eligible to do so. Whilst the CREST only group a nd the comparison group were randomly assigned, the others were not. Virtually all KEY inmates went on to CREST as a matter of course; the KEY only group was a historical one which comprised inmates who went through KEY before CREST existed. Thus the study can only partially be considered an RCT. At 6 month follow-up, using self-reports and urinalysis, the KEY-CREST group showed improved recidivism and relapse rates over the other three groups. Of the four groups, the comparison group had the worst outcome, followed by KEY only, CREST only and KEY-CREST, in ascending order. A similar, slightly more recent, study, E.26. (Lockw ood et al, compared groups which were allocated in the same way as the E.10. (Martin et al, 1995) study, and came to the same conclusions, i.e., that the comparison group had the worst outcome in terms of relapse and recidivism, followed by KEY only, CREST only and KEY-CREST. Again, urinalysis and self-report were employed to establish this. E.26. (Lockwood et al, 1997) provide the additional finding th at the treated groups were more likely to use drugs than to get arrested. They suggest th at this indicates some treatment-effect decay. The final study in this section is E.6. (Inciardi et al, 1997) who compared four groups. These were allocated in the same way as in the E.10. (Martin et al, 1995) and the E.26. (Lockwood et al, 1997) studies above, except that by the time E.6. (Inciardi et al, 1997) began their research, a new in-prison therapeutic community for women - WCI Village - had been estab lished at the local women's prison, and some of these women were now arriving at CREST work rel ease centre. Thus the groups comprised KEY only (WCI Village had not been opera ting long enough to include its members in the prison-therapeutic community only group), KEY/WCI Village + CREST, CREST only, and a comparison group. Once again, the CREST only and comparison groups were randomly allocated, the others were not. Interviews and urine tests at 6 and 18 month follow-up showed only no significant differences between the KEY group and the comparison group, but greatly improved recidivism and relapse rates for the KEY/WCI Village + CREST group. Overall, all four studies found much improved resu lts for the groups which went through both an in- prison therapeutic community and the work-release ther apeutic community. This supports a claim made fairly often in the literature that, without good aftercare - preferably therapeutic community aftercare, the effect of therapeutic community treatment in prison doe s not last, and that good aftercare is needed for ex- therapeutic community inmates to reintegrate properl y with the outside community. CREST operates as a therapeutic community, and so provides an aftercare or ganisation with which ex-inmates are familiar, and provides help with reintegration, by supporting inmat es in their search for employment and education. 83This study is also one of the very few therapeu tic community research projects set up as a randomised control trial. However, as noted above, only two gr oups in each study were truly random. Moreover, all four studies are unusual, in that they rely on self-report to establish recidivism, and do not triangulate these with official criminal records. 5.3.1.2. Cross-institutional/comparative studies One study was found. E.18. (Wexler et al, 1992) looked at rearrests, and time until rearrest, for inmates released from the Stay'n Out ther apeutic community, which operates programmes for male and female inmates in the New York State correctional system . Stay'n Out was established in 1977, and is the longest-running, concept-based prison therapeutic comm unity in the USA. E.18. (Wexler et al, 1992) compared outcomes for therapeutic community inma tes with three groups: milieu therapy, counselling and no treatment. (The authors define milieu therapy as less structured, less regimented and less hierarchical than the therapeutic community, which suggests that the milieu therapy they studied may have been modelled more on the democratic therap eutic community. However, there is not enought information in the paper to make this clear.) Using parole records and treatment records, they found that the hierarchical therapeutic community was the most effective means of reducing recidivism for both men and women, and that the longer an inmate spen t in the programme the greater the success rate. 5.3.1.3. Single case studies with control/comparison groups Five studies were found in this category. E.25. (Graham and Wexler, 1997), looked at Amity, a therapeutic community in Donovan Prison, San Diego. Three groups were studied: Amity 'completer s', who were released straight into the community; Amity completers who chose to move on to Vist a, a community-based therapeutic community; and a control group, which did not enter treatment. Arrest records at eleven month follow-up showed that, whereas the control group were rearrested about as often as parolees generally, there were significant improvements for Amity completers, and much greater improvements for the Amity + Vista completers (only 4.3% rearrests). Since these last were people who had chosen to go to Vista on leaving prison, and then had stayed there to complete the programme, th ey represent a self-selected group of highly motivated inmates, and as is usual with outcome research on th erapeutic communities, it is difficult to disentangle the treatment effect and the effect of individual co mmitment. The authors note that whilst their findings support findings from the Stay'n Out therapeutic community (E.18. Wexler et al, 1995) and from the KEY - CREST studies (E.6. Inciardi et al, 1997; E.26. Lockwood et al, 1997; E.10. Martin et al, 1995), their conclusions remain tentative, awaiting a more comprehensive analysis of the data. Two of the studies look at the IPTCs (In Prison Ther apeutic Communities) in Texas. The Texas drug treatment programme was set up extremely quickly in 1992, and many difficulties were experienced in staffing and running the IPTCs and the community th erapeutic communities to which inmates were sent on release from prison. Resources were promised, whic h were not delivered because of budget problems, and eventually the programme was slimmed down to smaller proportions. However, a number of IPTCs 84were established through this programme. E.2. (Ei senberg and Fabelo, 1996) compared the recidivism and employment rates of men and women who had been through the therapeutic community programmes at Kyle and Gatesville Prisons, with outcomes for in mates who were eligible for treatment but who had not been selected. They found that recidivism was lower and employment significantly higher for inmates who had been through the IPTC and then gone on to spend time in the non-secure therapeutic community and received counselling. The IPTC on its own had no impact on either recidivism or employment. E.8. (Knight et al, 1997) studied the Kyle IPTC programme, and compared completers (those who had been through the therapeutic community in prison a nd in the community) with non-completers (those who had been through the prison therapeutic community but dropped out of the subsequent community therapeutic community) and a comparison group of inmat es eligible but not selected for treatment. E.8. (Knight et al, 1997) found at six-month follow-up that drop-outs did slightly better than the comparison group, and that completers did significantly better in terms of arrests, self-reported crimes, drug use and employment. E.28. - a study from the US Bureau of Prisons (1998) examined DAP (the Drug Abuse Treatment Program), which provides modified in-prison ther apeutic community for drug abusers followed by transitional therapeutic community treatment for in mates released from prison and up to three years of monitoring. Using crime records and information from probation officers, the report found that inmates who completed DAP treatment used significantly less drugs and were significantly less likely to be arrested than a comparison group of inmates eligible fo r treatment but not given it. The report also gives information on the numbers of inmates who dropped out of the programme before completion, but these are not counted in the final outcome figures. The final study in this section is of CASAT, the Comprehensive Alcohol and Substance Abuse Treatment Program (E.35. New York State Correctional Se rvices, 1996). The study examined seven 200-bed facilities, which were organised into three phases of treatment: prison, community and aftercare. Treatment completers were compared to three ot her groups: Phase 1 failures, Phase 2 failures and 'all releases'. The authors used a techniqu e they call 'survival analysis', which is an attempt to control for the different lengths of time people have been released out into the community, so that treatment outcomes can be meaningfully compared. This is an analy tic technique which determines the cumulative rate of return to custody. It is based on the number of cases remaining in the community (and therefore 'at risk',) and relates these to the number of months since release. The authors provide return-to-custody figures for all four groups at 12, 18, 24 and 30 months after release, and show that whilst all the groups have cumulatively more members being rearrested, the treatment completer group has significantly fewer. Overall, the concept-based prison therapeutic communities provide outcome figures which suggest that the treatment is effective for people who complete the programme. In particular, those who go through a prison therapeutic community and then move onto a non-secure therapeutic community on release, and graduate from that therapeutic community, do well. This may be because the non-secure therapeutic communities focus heavily on gradually integrating thei r residents into the community, by helping them to find employment and education. Additionally, graduates of concept-based programmes are strongly encouraged to remain close to the therapeutic commun ity core, to attend groups and often to become staff 85members themselves in non-secure ther apeutic community programmes. Thus, they are provided with a new, positive reference group in the community, which condemns the use of drugs and offers support to those tempted to relapse. All the studies note that the longer the time spent in the programs (TIP effect) the better the outcome. It is sometimes assumed that this can be interpreted to m ean that greater exposure to the programme produces more positive change. However, a note of caution s hould be sounded here, as the difference in outcome could be a result of the gradual dropping out of tho se individuals less motivated to change. Concept- based therapeutic communities traditionally have high dr op-out rates, especially in the first few months. This is because (i) residents are admitted only on a voluntary basis, (ii) they have generous admission criteria and (iii) they tend to have strict behaviour rules, which makes it more likely that individuals will be expelled. Thus the TIP effect could be as mu ch a result of keeping on only the most promising individuals as a result of treatment. Although the outcomes are encouraging, they could be criticised on statistical grounds. Firstly, the comparison groups used are not necessarily similar to the treatment groups. Several of the studies use 'eligible' inmates as comparisons, with no informati on about how the inmates are deemed eligible, or whether they would be willing to enter a therap eutic community given the opportunity. Thus, the comparisons may differ from the treated groups in terms of initial motivation. Secondly, the figures given either compare drop-outs and graduates (two groups which differ in motivation and commitment) or compare the comparison group with drop-outs and gra duates. This second method can obscure the fact that the less promising inmates have dropped out of th e treatment cohort, whilst they are still included in the comparison group. A basic comparison between th e entire treatment cohort and the entire comparison cohort is rarely made. It should be added here that this compara tive procedure is not limited to the concept-based research, but occurs in the democratic therapeutic co mmunity research as well. It is mentioned here because the concept- based research has a characteristic methodology which is repeated, with slight variations, in all the different studies. 5.3.1.4. Single case studies with no control/comparison groups Four studies were found in this section. Although these studies did not have comparison groups, two of them (E.33. Field et al, 1989 and E.31. Swartz et al, 1996) compared outcomes for long-stay and short-stay clients. E.31. (Swartz et al, 1996) conducte d a retrospective study of IMPACT (Integrated Multiphase Program of Assessment and Comprehensive Treatment) in Cook County Jail, Chicago, examining the treatment records and criminal records of 1991-92 clients. They found that, at upwards of one year after release from prison, the shortest-stay gr oup were most likely to be rearrested, and that the rate of re-arrest decreased with increasing lengths of stay in IMPACT. The group least likely to be rearrested comprised inmates who had gone through the IMPACT programme and then gone on to drug treatment in the community. E.33. (Field et al, 1989) studied inmates from the Cornerstone Progam in Oregon State Hospital, Salem, who were discharge d between 1983 and 1985. Tracking them for three years after leaving prison, the authors found that those who completed the in-prison programme, and then went on to complete six months of aftercare/tran sitional services whilst on parole did best. In their conclusions they argue that the Cornerstone Progr am has a positive effect on decreasing criminality. 86They say that addicted offenders who receive little or no treatment show an increasing pattern of criminal activity and compare this with the finding that, wh ilst many successfully treated addicted recidivist offenders continue to be involved in criminal activities, their involvement is reduced. E.13. (Sweet et al, (1977) examined inmates from the Drug Offender Rehabilitation (DOR) programme in Memphis, Tennessee, a modified therapeutic commun ity with behaviour therapy. Their criteria for successful outcome was successful completion of the aftercare programme. This programme comprised drug testing, group counselling and requi red participants to remain in education or employment. They describe the total recovery rate of 57% (successful af tercare completers) as exceptional, and add that the four year success rate was over 50%. Finally, E.27. (Glider et al, 1997) st udied two cohorts of inmates treated by the Amity programme at Pima County Jail. The authors administered a number psychosocial tests on admission and discharge, and again six months after discharge. They found that positive changes occurred on scales for depression, anxiety and self-concept and that these were maintained after re lease. They found that recidivism rates at 6 and 30 months were considerably lower than rates for the general prison population, and conclude that the therapeutic community is an effective model for trea ting drug abuse within prisons. In particular they note that a very significant majority of the partic ipants continued in treatment after release from the programme. In summary, the findings of the four studies support th e effectiveness of in-prison therapeutic community programmes for drug abusing offenders, and the st udies which compare long and short-stay groups support the general finding that those who stay longer in treatment do better. Support is also offered for aftercare programmes. 5.3.1.5. Cost offset studies None found. 5.3.2. In-treatment outcome studies 5.3.2.1. Experimental research/randomised control trials None found. 5.3.2.2. Cross-institutional/comparative studies None found. 875.3.2.3. Single case studies with control/comparison groups None found. 5.3.2.4. Single case studies with no control/comparison groups Two studies were found which offered evidence for this section. Both were cited above and both used psychosocial tests to ascertain change. E.27. (Glider et al, 1997) in the study of Amity at Pima County Jail, found significant positive changes between admission and discharge on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Shortened Manifest Anxiety Scale (SMAS) and the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale. E.13. (Sweet et al, 1997) administered the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI) and found that length of time spent in the programme seemed to produce no signi ficant differences in the amount of change on EPI measures. What did produce a significant difference was appointment to a junior staff position, a standard feature of aftercare. Appointees showed heightened anxiety and neuroticism, possibly because of the increased responsibility, and lower scores on the lie scale. 5.3.2.5. Cost offset studies E.35, the CASAT study by the State of New York Depa rtment of Correctional Services (1996), includes a preliminary model for ascertaining cost savings that may be attributed to the operation of the CASAT programme. The basic assumption of the model was that no CASAT inmate would have been approved for temporary release programme participation without participation in the CASAT programme. Thus the major savings calculated are the difference between the cost of temporary release, and the greater cost of full-time incarceration. Whilst the in-prison therapeutic community treatment is more costly than general confinement, the earlier date of temporary release makes the CASAT programme cheaper to run overall. Overall the authors estimated that approximately $153 million in cost savings to the Correctional Department has resulted from the operation of the CASAT programme from its initiation in 1990 to the end of year 1996. The model is base solely on 'hotel' costs, and does not estimate other possible savings, such as lower costs of reincarceration or lower costs of crime and unemployment. 5.3.2.6. Summary In summary, in-treatment outcome is an under-resear ched area for secure con cept-based therapeutic communities. However, the two studies cited suggest that therapeutic community treatment facilitates some positive psychological changes. 5.3.3. Overall summary for in-treatmen t and post-treatment secure concept-based A total of twelve published studies we re found in this section. Of these, four examined KEY and CREST; two examined an Amity therapeutic community and two examined the Texas IPTCs. Thus, the published studies provided information on a total of seven therapeutic community programmes. It may be useful to note that an additional fifteen published studies were found which did centrally describe an outcome study, but which referred to these outcome studies in reviews and discussion articles. Thus, certain 88therapeutic communities (such as Amity, Stay'n Out and CREST) have a high publication profile. Two unpublished outcome studies were also found in this section, E.28. (Bureau of Prisons, 1998) and E.35. (New York Correctional State Services, 1996). Th ese differed from the published studies in that they covered larger numbers of drug treatment therapeu tic communities, and aggregated the figures provided by the prison monitoring procedures. The publis hed studies tend to focus in more depth on one therapeutic community, and to introduce their own research technologies, rather than use existing information. 5.4 Findings from meta-analysis There were only 10 RCTs of any sort, and 10 cross-institutional or comparative studies, and a further 32 studies using some kind of control. If we take the la tter as the minimum level of rigour that is acceptable, then there were in total 52 acceptable studies, all of which are discussed in some detail at some point in the report. Of these 52, 41 relate to democratic type therapeutic communities. A meta-analysis was set up for the 52 studies with controls. 23 studies were excluded where the outcome criteria were unclear, where the raw numbers were not reported, or where the original sample was not clearly specified before attrition. Where there w as a choice of outcome measures and control groups, emphasis was placed on conservative criteria, such as reconviction rates rather than psychological improvements, and on non-treated controls. This redu ced the number of studies for the meta-analysis to 29. The analysis had two stages. Initially the odds-ratio s for the individual studies, and 95% confidence intervals, were calculated. Subsequently, the odds-ratio s were combined to produce a summary odds-ratio for the 29 studies, and subsections of them, also with confid ence intervals for the 95% levels.

Some contained and comments on outcome studies, and therapeutic community effectiveness. Full details are contained in Main Appendix 10.6. 6.2 Non-secure democratic therapeutic communiti es for non-personality disorders - post- and in- treatment outcome studies - (Cs) The studies summarised here were all retrieved th rough our databases, but were not systematically targeted per se, and so are not a full review of the area. The studies are not about therapeutic communities for personality disorders, but for other forms of mental illness, mainly psychosis and schizophrenia. Overall, the findings are mixed, some positive, so me finding no advantage for therapeutic community treatment over other treatments, but often with ther apeutic community treatment being more expensive, and some negative findings. We retrieved three experimental or randomised cont rol trial studies - two relating to the same institution (C.43. Mosher, 1991; C.44. Mosher & Menn, 1977; C.71. Williams, 1992). We studies et al, 1989; and 11 studies related to one project, the Dutch Follow- up Project Psychotherapeutic Communities project reports perhaps the largest-scale comparative follow-up (up to 5 years) evaluation of inpatient psychotherapy/therapeutic communities.) We found 18 single case studies with comparison groups . 5 were from Finland, relating to the effectiveness of a modified therapeutic community for different samples of acute psychiatric patients with severe psychopathology al, 1993) . studies relate to Littlemore Hospital, England & Trick, 1970; C.79. Kennard, Clemmey & Mandelbrote, 1977). A further Dubska-Papiasvili, 1977). One study relates to a therapeutic community in a hospital department in Yugoslavia (C.25. Kecmanovi c, Ceric & Trograncic, 1975); one to an unit in Australia (C.47. Nurcombe, Owen & Beran, 1973); one to a partial hospitalization programme in America (C.58. Thompson, 1985); one to a residential programme in Belgium (C.78. Verhaest, Pierloot & Bostjin, 1982); l, England (C.82. Evison & Trauer, 1983). We also found 9 individual therapeutic community cas e studies without control/comparison groups. One relates to maladjusted adolescent boys (C.33. Lamp en & Neill, 1985). The other 8 studies relate to psychiatric patients. One is about Fraser House, in Australia (C.11. Clark, 1968); one a hospital therapeutic community in America (C.12. Cluxton, 1966); one a day hospital in Sweden Rosengren & Cronholm, 1981); one Starrin, & M achu, 1983); one to a modified hospital therapeutic community for black patients in South Africa (C.50 Pillay, Du Plessis, Vawda & Pollock, 1994); one of a day hospital workshop in London (C.57. Stevens, 1973) ; and another of a hospital in America (C.72. Wright & Kogut, 1972). We retrieved only one reference to a review artic le (C.18. Gunderson, 1980), which looked at various units offering intensive milieu therapy for non-chroni c schizophrenia patients, and attempted to identify the therapeutic ingredients of the treatment milieu. Further details of all these studies are contained in Main Appendix 10.7. 936.3 Non-secure concept-based pos t-treatment outcome literature - Fs A large body of literature was found relating to non-secure concept-base d therapeutic communities. Most of these come from the USA. Th ese therapeutic communities treat s ubstance abusers exclusively, although recent writings have stressed the comorbidity of drug abuse and various types of mental illness and psychopathology. There are some studies of ther apeutic communities which have been modified to accommodate mentally ill clients. About half of the papers cover issues which are not centrally related to the focus of this review, such as modifications to th erapeutic communities for different types of clients, histories, overviews and programme descriptions. Th e other half are of interest here however. These include papers on psychopathology and mental illness in treatment, outcome studies and cost benefit analyses. These are mentioned briefly below, and are summarised in Main Appendix 10.8. The following studies relate to psychopathology and me ntal illness, and substance abuse in concept-based therapeutic communities, or MICAs (mentally ill chemi cal abusers, whose primary problem is a mental disorder); CAMIs (whose primary problem is chem ical abuse, although they also have a severe psychological or psychopathic disorder) and CAs (chemical abusers, whose primary problem is chemical abuse, although they exhibit Axis II borderline or anti-social personality disorders and/or mild pathological signs). DeLeon notes that generally con cept-based therapeutic communities tend to exclude MICAs and choose to treat CAMIs & CAs; the best out come seems to be for CAs. (F.50. Jainchilli, De Leon & Pinkham 1986; F.6. De Leon, 1989). 2 other pape rs look at the treatment of MICAs in concept- based therapeutic communities. One paper uses clinical observations to classify drug addicts into 4 types (F.28 Cancrini et al, 1985). In addition, 2 outcome studies on concept-based ther apeutic community treatment of personality disorders and drug were found (F.41. Lennings, 1990; F.56. Clerici & Carta, 1996). Overall, there have been few studies which look specifically at outcomes for personality disordered clients in concept-based therapeutic communities. Baseline statistics demonstrat e that there are high levels of personality disorder among drug users treated in concept-based therapeutic communities, which suggests that outcome studies which do not look specifically at personality disorder s may nevertheless contain useful information on this topic. Two studies look at psychological status and retention (F.44. Sheffet et al, 1973; F.32. Lewis & Ross, 1994). Concept-based therapeutic communities, like democratic ones, have high drop-out rates, particularly in the first few months. One argument is that personality disordered clients are more likely than others to drop out of treatment at an early stage. This would tend to depress the outcome figures for personality disordered clients, since it would reduce the amount and intensity of treatment. However, other studies have found that initial psychological scor es are not predictors of retention or treatment outcome. There are several outcome studies which have been carried out for these c oncept-based therapeutic communities, to assess their effectiveness and to find pred ictors for success. In general, the predictors studies relate to individual characteristics of clients rather than features of the programme, although there have been attempts to construct methodologies fo r evaluating treatment processes the general findings are that the best predictors of outcome are the length of time spent in the programme and previous criminal history. The outcome studies reviewed here only form part of those retrieved, as those which relate explicitly to personality disorder and mental illness are reviewed el sewhere in this review. Relatively few outcome studies in this section were retrieved, since non-secu re concept-based therapeu tic communities were not specifically targeted by our research procedures. Th e review articles, summarised earlier, point to the existent of many other outcome studies in this area. Finally, 2 studies of cost-offset or cost-benefit were found (F.33 Griffin, 1983 & F.11. Gerstein, 1992). The latter found that overall therapeutic communities were cost-beneficial compared to prisons, less cost- beneficial than methadone maintenance, cost-e ffective insofar as they reduced crime costs and unemployment costs, and paid for themselves by simply keeping street crime off the street. In conclusion, there is a great deal of literature on non-secure concept-based therapeutic communities. In general they are viewed as an effective way of trea ting drug users, although there are criticisms that too much attention is paid to outcomes for graduates, and too little to outcomes for programme drop-outs. In recent years, programmes have been modified to accommodate different clients groups, in particular mentally ill chemical abusers. Studies of client characteristics suggest that admissions overwhelmingly display comorbidity with other symptoms, in partic ular personality disorder, and that the client group therefore should be regarded as dually diagnosed. Current writing is concerned not ju st with whether or not therapeutic communities work, but who they work for and which parts of the programmes and pr ocesses work most effectively. The most recent writings by DeLeon (F.58. DeLeon, 1994 and F.38. DeLeon, 1995) at the Centre for Therapeutic Community Research in America, present detailed models of programme characteristics, processes, treatments and clients, in an attempt to develop a m odel of change which can be used to refine outcome research and improve effectiveness of treatment. It should be pointed out that the studies retrieved cover a span of about thirty years, and that during that time, concept-based therapeutic co mmunities have changed, gradually developing from fairly marginal self-help organisations run by a few radical prof essional and ex-addicts, to mainstream state-funded organisations run by a much more professionalised mixed group of therapeutic community graduates and professional medical, social and mental health staff. This practice development has been mirrored and supported by research development, in particular De Leon's studies of Phoenix House in New York. It is clear from the literature that most of the con cept-based therapeutic commun ity research is American, and that large research programmes studying multiple drug treatment organisations have been funded and carried out in the USA, using major state funding. Th ere is little to match this research output outside the USA. Recently however, two major projects have been initiated, but are not yet due to report. NTORS (National Treatment Outcome Research Study) is a prospective longitudinal cohort study which is monitoring the progress of 1,110 clients who entered treatment in four different types of drug programme in the UK between March and July 1995. This is b ased at the Maudsley Hospital in London. The IPTRP 95(Improving Psychiatric Treatment in Residential Progr ammes) is a project funded through the BIOMED II programme of the European Commission and has partne rs in 9 universities and 33 residential treatment centres across Europe. The UK partner is the Scottis h Drugs Training Project at the University of Stirling. The study aims to standardise psychiatric protocols for relapse prevention, and to provide information on the extent of comorbidity or dual dia gnosis amongst substance abusers. The final phase of this project will be an outcome study. Neither NTORS or IPTRP will focus explicitly on therapeutic communities, but like some of the large American studies, therapeutic communities will be one of the major treatments included. 967 DISCUSSION: SUBSTANTIVE, METHODOLOGICAL AND DEFINITIONAL ISSUES 7.1 Introduction Research was an important part of the early ther apeutic community innovations (Manning 1976; 1979a). However, early therapeutic communities tended to prefer descriptive, qualitative and participant observation types of research, as more in keeping w ith the philosophy and practice of the therapeutic community. They were often suspicious of quan titative research, and reducing people to numbers, and particularly unhappy about the ethics of techniques, such as random allocation, and control groups, which also run counter to therapeutic community selec tion processes. This meant that there was little quantitative or evaluative research undertaken until th e 1970s, when there began to be more interest generally in the professionalisation of therapeutic co mmunities, which involved their alliance more with medicine and psychotherapy. There were also increas ing threats to therapeutic communities' survival and funding. The 1980s was a period of mixed fortunes for the therapeutic community, with many therapeutic communities closing - e.g. Paddington & Marlborough Day therapeutic communities. More recently, therapeutic communities seem to be experiencing a re vived interest in their treatment methods (Reed 1992; Dolan & Coid 1993; Cox 1997). At the same time, there has been an increase in both the quantity and quality of research work undertaken on therapeutic communities, together with a recognition of the need for research to prove both treatment and cost effectiveness, in response to external pressure. (Manning has charted and explained these fluctuati ons and tensions in th e relationship between therapeutic communities and research (Manning 1979b). In this section some methodological considerations will be addressed. The initial focus will be on issues of definition. In order to evaluate treatment effectiveness, some indication of the clarity of definition about the disorder to be treated and the treatment intervention employed is essential. In this case, there are considerable uncertainties on both c ounts, which have given rise to methodological disagreement. We will begin with definitions of the disorder, then consider the treatment, and the interaction or 'fit' between them, before coming on to methodological debates that have arisen in this area. 7.2 Diagnosis Patients diagnosed as psychopaths, or more recently personality disorder, are the main category of disorder in this field. D.2. (Barbour-McMullen et al 1988) summarises two types of psychopathy: the North American DSM-III tradition, represented also in the Hare Psychopathy checklist, characterised in terms of antisocial behaviour; and the European traditi on, characterised in terms of personality deviation in two dimensions of impulsiveness and social withdrawal. The US definition, which stresses poor early parenting, and consequent immaturity as the cause, has come to dominate work in this field. British Mental Health Law has been ambivalent a bout psychopaths. Both the 1959 and 1983 Acts separate psychopathy from other conditions, a nd define it behaviourally, while holding a pessimistic view of treatment interventions. For example, it appears to be unrelated to decisions di fferentiating those patients deemed treatable from those not treatable in a study of a special hospital by (D.8. Collins 1991). An early 97paper, D.5. (Blackburn 1983 p. 32), comments that 'The inadequacies of clinical classification, then, render most of the treatment research on 'psychopath s' worthless'. One consequence has been a rapid elaboration of the concept. D.32. (Whiteley 1995) and B.36. (Whiteley 1970), for example, following the classic work of Henderson (1939), has consistently diffe rentiated three types, separating the inadequate and aggressive types from the creative type, and sugges ting that the latter are most likely to respond to treatment. This has now been followed by a rapidly e xpanding classification, not of psychopathies, but of personality disorders, of which psychopathy is seen as a sub-type. For example, in the DSM III/IV manuals, where a speci al axis, axis II, is devoted to the personality disorders, there are eleven different types of persona lity disorder identified, one of which is the classic anti-social type most strongly associated with psychopathy (D.65. Stone, 1993). D.36. (Norton and Hinshelwood 1996) suggests, in reviewing treatment fo r severe personality disorders that this is 'an imprecise but useful clinical term' (D.36. No rton & Hinshelwood 1996 p. 723). However D.10. (DeJong et al 1993) question the utility of the detailed cate gorisation of personality disorders in hospitalised patients. One area of particular interest to evaluating ther apeutic communities, and much debated in the recent literature, is that of borderline personality disord ers (BPDs). D.15. (Higgitt and Fonagy 1992) discuss seven different types of borderline personality disorder , and suggest that this group are characterised by (i) symptom variability within the group, and over time for individual patients, and (ii) impairment of social relationships. The official DSM-IV definition is 'a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, affects and control over impulses' (D.35. G underson 1994 p.17). Gunderson describes how there have been three distinct ph ases of conceptualisation during which ' borderline personality disorder is a diagnosis whose construc t (ie its meaning) has grown rapidly and changed dramatically during the past 25 years.' (D.35. Gunderson 1994 p.12). Recent official reports on work in this area have reflected these difficulties. For example D.46. (Reed Report on Psychopathic Disorder 1994) states that 't he diverse meanings attached to psychopathic disorder often undermined the effectivenes of evaluati on of treatment' (D.46. Dept. of Health and Home Office 1994 p.34). Conceptual expansion of this rapidity makes judgements about research reports difficult, especially if they are more than about fifteen years old. The terms, and their meanings, used to classify, describe and diagnose patients have changed so extensively that any studies of the impact of treatments on these patients may be difficult to compare or compile. 7.3 Therapeutic communities The definition of therapeutic communities has also been difficult. There are two main types of therapeutic communities: democratic and concept-based/hierach ical. For some writers these are variations on a basically common theme ((D.29. Sugarman 1984) - one d ealing with deeper intrapsychic change and the other with initial behavioural control; for others they have nothing in common but the name (D.41. Glaser 1983). They have emerged from quite separate origins. Democratic therapeutic communities arose partly 98from the observation that, since the social environm ent of custodial mental hospitals could severely damage patients, then they might also be turned ar ound to benefit them too. Combined with psychological and social theories about the interaction between pe rsonality and environment, democratic therapeutic communities developed in the UK through the influen tial proselytising of a few key founding innovators. Concept-based therapeutic comm unities however are an American innovation designed to deal exclusively with problems of addiction. Again th e product of zealous innovato rs, they have expanded rapidly to encompass a truly world-wide self-help movement. We can summarise the definition of therapeutic commun ities in terms of three factors. All need to be present for us to identify a therapeutic community. Firs t is a set of values about treatment, or a specific therapeutic culture. These were famously summarised by the social anthropologist Rapoport (B.30. Rapoport 1960 terms of the four themes: democratisation, permissiveness, communalism, and reality confrontation. These are themes that are still widely used and measured in questionnaires (D.7. Clarke 1994; D.68. Manning, 1989). However, these th emes have been reworked , and added to and attachment (Haigh, Second is the therapeutic programme used, pa rticularly the use of therapeutic groups, including regular community groups which include all members. The amount of tim e in groups has also been used in systematic measures of therapeutic communities (Crockett, et al , 1978). Third is the self-d efinition of the community, or at least its staff, as a therapeutic community. Clearly there might be considerable variation within these parameters. A very widely used measure that combines measures of the relationships in a comm unity, its treatment, and the way in which the community system is sustained, is the work of M oos (1997), and in particular his development of the 'ward atmosphere scale' as a measure of the envir onmental factors constituting the therapeutic community treatment intervention. This gives a twelve dimension picture of any therapeutic community, rather than a single dimension of 'pure' therapeutic community intensity or 'dosage': relationships - involvement, support, spontaneity; treatment - autonomy, practicality, personal problem orientation, anger/aggression levels; system maintenance - order and organisation, programme clarity, staff control. In general the intensity, or dosage, of treatment is commonly recognised in the literature by differentiating between therapeutic community approaches and the ther apeutic community proper. The former refers to a therapeutic approach across whole hospitals, wher eas the latter refers to specialised therapeutic communities dealing with a defined population (see next section). Democratic type therapeutic communities develope d in prisons or secure settings are inevitably influenced by the purity of the treatment. Because of the requirements of prison regulations concerning security and control, Rapoport's four principles ha ve been modified. Cullen (1997) outlines how the modifications have been made at Grendon. Instead of full democracy, inmates have the power to make or influence certain decisions but not those that woul d compromise security. Instead of full permissiveness, deviant behaviour is not tolerated, but it is addressed by the community or small group, and fed into the therapeutic process (in prison it would be simply puni shed). According to Cullen, the principle of communalism, which covers individual and collec tive responsibility for managing the therapeutic community, survives relatively intact. Confrontation is often done in a much more directive way than that 99described by Rapoport, in order to prevent men fro m minimalising their offences and to help them appreciate the real perspective of their victims. The difficulties of establishing a fully democratic and self-governing organi sation inside a prison is partly documented by A.57. (Wenger 1974). He notes that in a prison hospital therapeutic community on Rikers Island, New York, the inmates were encouraged to establish self-governing systems and define rules of behaviour via inmates' committees. However this resulte d in rumours of sexual assault, theft and beatings by committee members, who ran their committee through strength and criminal reputation. The example shows how conventional inmate culture might be ab le to flourish in a therapeutic community setting unless some modifications are made to ensure that sta ff maintain control (a step which is in principle antithetical to the therapeutic community philosophy). The problems with Rikers Island were solved by closing the therapeutic community down, and starting again with a modified regime. The Barlinnie Special Unit in Scotland was closed because a working party found that the staff had relinquished control to the inmates, and that this had led to the deterior ation of the therapeutic regime (A.48. Scottish Prison Service 1994). Modified regimes however continue to operate inside prisons. Modifications vary. Therapeutic communities in prisons such as Grendon, Wormwood Scr ubs and Gartree, which base their regimes on the principles set out above, value large groups and collective responsibility, and see the community as a whole, rather than the staff, as the main therapeutic agent. Indeed, this use of the community, and the peer pressure it comprises, is often seen as the hallmark of the therapeutic community. Other prison therapeutic communities do not feature this communalism so clearly. For example, the Social Therapeutic Institutions of Germany are based on a more individualistic, ps ychotherapeutic model, and feature behavioural programmes, education and rehabilitation. Whilst they require that the inmate acknowledges and confronts their offence, there is emphasis on reparati on as well as on psychological change (A.62. L\u00f6sel & Egg 1997). Rawlings (1998) argues that therapeutic communities in prisons are required constantly to work to maintain their survival, since the principles on whic h they are based are virtually the opposite of prison principles. Whilst more modification might endear the therapeutic community to the prison, it would move the therapeutic community away from the therapeutic regime origin ally intended. On the the hand, too little regard to prison principles might result in isolation and ultimate closure. E.32. (Wexler 1997), who writes about the more hierachical and structur ed concept-based therap eutic communities for drug users, argues that these therapeutic communities can fit very well into prisons, provided therapeutic community personnel regard themselves as guests of the correctional system. Whether therapeutic communities are a continuing treat ment option has been intensively debated. For some writers the period of expansi on, fuelled through an idealistic desire to revolutionise the psychiatric hospital, was over in the 1970s, to be followed by a steady decline as community care developed (D.38. Ploeger 1980, for Germany; D.37. Vaglum et al 1982, for Norway; D.40. Miller 1992, for the UK - 'the therapeutic community has passed its sell-by date', p. 127). Others however have noted that the decline is illusory. It may actually be the consequence of the disappearance of controversy as therapeutic communities in fact grow in number and acceptab ility, as D.56. (Clark and Walker 1984) show for 100Australia, and which they interpret as the result of its wide tacit acceptance. In fact, therapeutic community practitioners have more recently focussed th eir therapeutic claims on specific targets, with more carefully designed programmes: therapeutic communities proper for personality disorders, therapeutic communities in prisons, and therapeutic co mmunities for the addictions. This development, to which we now turn, has been characterised by D.68. (Manning 1989), as a shift from social movement to scientific innovation. 7.4 Therapeutic communities and specific treatments In recent years therapeutic communities, or modified versions of it, have come to be concentrated on specific populations, for economic and theoretical reasons, as well as a result of lengthy clinical experience and some modest research data. There are three such areas: personality disorder, the addictions and prison settings. Personality disorder, as we have noted, has developed rapidly in nosological terms in recent years. The dominant US approach, epitomised in DSM III and IV , defines personality disorder as a behavioural condition whereby impulsive antisocial actions, and poor social relationships, are seen as arising from immaturity through poor early parenting, and which can be substantially ameliorated through intense residential therapeutic experiences in a therapeutic community - a 'c rash course in living' which will provide the opportunity for rapid and permanent matura tion. Doyal, in the Reed Report (D.46. Dept. of Health & Home Office 1994), argues cogently on theore tical grounds that the key features of personality disorder, the failure to sustain moral reciprocity and the resultant atrophy of long-term social relationships, are (a) necessarily treatable (since th e ability to manipulate depends on understanding that reciprocal obligation is an essential feature of social life) and (b) particularly suited to therapeutic community treatment, as the site for reinserting such r eciprocity as a basic feature of a patient's mode of life. D.33. (Whiteley 1994), D.36. (Norton and Hi nshelwood 1996), and D.15. (H iggitt and Fonagy 1992) - in a widely cited review of the use of psychothera py for personality disorders, make similar arguments. D.68. (Manning 1989 chapter 3) develops a sustained argument from social theorists such as Giddens, Harre, Seve, Lacan, and Gramsci to argue that the diffi culties that such patients exhibit are ideally suited to therapeutic community treatment. Comparative empirical studies, for example, D.48. (Karterud 1988), also indicate that therapeutic communities are not good for short term emergency or catchment area cases, nor long-term psychotic patients, but have produced the best results for persona lity disorders. There is al so widespread clinical support for the use of therapeutic communities for personality disorders: 'there is a great deal of clinical evidence to support the value of therapeutic co mmunities' (D.15. Higgitt and Fonagy 1992 p.36). For those where this has manifested itself in addi ction, concept-based therapeutic communities have proved effective at breaking the addiction, and devel oping alternative ways of life. As addiction has spread to be a world wide problem, so have th ese therapeutic communities, which number now many thousands in dozens of countries. 101In addition, the therapeutic comm unity has coincidentally the capacity to contain in a humane and efficient manner those who are prone to violent a nd disruptive behaviour. The ability of therapeutic communities to contain difficult patients has been comm only observed, and, in some respects, the use of large community groups by articulate staff is a mechan ism of social control, in which the principle of physical observation by staff on the basis of Bentham's pantopicon is replaced by mutual community observation - with overtones of totalitarianism. Whatever the morality of this, D.49. (Natarajan and Falkin 1997) argue that therapeutic communities in prison ar e an effective means of surveillance, and reduce costs by reducing violence and difficult behaviour. 7.5 Methodological comments Although painstaking, and occasionally tedious, systematic literature reviews like this provide very useful information on treatment interventions where there is clinical uncertainty, such as is the case for therapeutic communities, and they are respected as a research tool, particularly within the NHS. The methodological issues arising from the studies re viewed are numerous. In the 1994 Cochrane Lecture, McPherson, (1994) pointed out that RCTs are important where there is obvious uncertainty, but that they should not be used where there are ethical problems, a lack of objective outcome measures, resistance from the field, or a reluctance to compare treatments. On these grounds we do not feel that there is any intrinsic reason why RCTs should not be mounted fu rther for therapeutic communities. However RCTs are very difficult to run for therapeutic communities: There are great difficulties in randomly allocating residents to treatment programmes, and keeping the experiment uncontaminated. Most of the RCTs found were only partially successful in this. The practical difficulties involved in random controlled studies mean that such approaches may be unlikely in this area. Outcome measures were often very crude, such as reconviction or readmission, or very idiosyncratic to particular institutions. This makes the generalisability of findings difficult. Almost all studies have high attrition rates, ty pically of around one third or more. Although we have been careful to check and exclude doubtfu l studies from our meta-analysis, where studies with comparisons or controls do not include the whole sample, this might considerably affect the results reported. The literature suggests a great range of structures and practices that are covered by the umbrella term therapeutic community, and this makes it very difficult to ensure treatment integrity when comparing therapeutic communities. 102 It is difficult to allow for, or take account of , factors which intervene between discharge and follow-up. These difficulties have been taken up more recently by Seligman, in relation to psychotherapy research. He distinguishes between the efficacy study, as epitomised by the randomised control trial, and the effectivenesss study - 'how patients fare under the actual cond itions of treatment in the field'. Seligman expresses his disillusion with the 'gold standard' of the efficacy study (expensive in time and money) as 'the only, or even the best way of finding out what treatment actually works in the field' , and concludes that 'deciding whether one treatment, under highly controlled conditions, works better than another treatment or a control group is a di fferent question from deciding what works in the field' (Seligman, 1995 pp.1-2). Seligman suggests that some treatments are 'too cumbersome for the efficacy study paradigm' (Seligman, 1995 p.3), particularly long-term therapies, especially if there is no fixed, or variable, duration; where the therapy is self-correcting; where patients have multiple problems or psychiatric diagnoses; and where improvement is concerned with the general functioning of patients, as well as improvements in disorders, or specific presenting symptoms. He also suggests that random assignment 'may turn out to be worse than useless for the investigation of the actual treat ment of mental illness in the field'. (Seligman, 1995 p.13) What Seligman suggests instead is naturalistic surveys of large numbers of people who have gone through any particular treatment, with multivariate measures of effectiveness, using sophisticated correlational methods. (Seligman, 1995 pp.4-5). In addition, Evans et al (1996) have offered a more sophisticated critique, particularly of the statistical shortfalls, of experimental and obser vational methods - here in relation to forensic psychotherapy. They argue that selecting from the complexity of ther apy for research purposes must diminish it; that experimental research in the field is never as 'clean' as it is in laboratory conditions; that even very strong associations between variables still allow for many diffe rent explanations for that association; and that many other variables which were not controlled or manipulated could explain the association found between the variables studied (Evans et al, 1996 p.517). However, Evans et al's most important arguments relate to sample size and statistical significance, and the need for very large, 'sometimes logistically impo ssible' sample sizes of people, to have even 'a good chance' of detecting a realistic significant effect for treatment (here psychotherapy) (Evans et al, 1996 pp.523-524). Seligman also asked what degree of statistical significance is clinical significance, and how large an effect size is meaningful (Seligman, 1995 p.8). The therapeutic field is notable for strong clini cal support, but poor research based evidence (D.17. Holman, 1996: 'studies of therapeutic communities are fe w' p.65.) Writers in this field are quite familiar with the ideal - what should be done (for example, D.26. Paul, 1967 is widely cited), and would like nothing more than to be able to prove to the sa tisfaction of sceptics and health purchasers that this treatment works. It is another thing to achieve this ideal. Definitional ambiguities, and programme complexity have generated consid erable methodological debate about the way to undertake evaluation in this field. The key problems are that the treatment itself is multi-dimensional, the dosage strength is 103difficult to determine, the programme controls its own intake, there are steady dropouts from the programme, observed effects decay over time, and the target patient population has been steadily refined and re-classified. However, poor research does not necessarily mean poor treatment results, as has frequently been concluded by critics of the therapeutic community. Why have so few well-designed studies been done? The ideal of an RCT has generated difficulties where it has been attempted. Perhaps the most famous a ttempt was the Clarke & Cornish, 1972 (D.55.) study undertaken over 25 years ago, but which, in the end, proved impractical, and generated a methodological alternative, the cross-institutional design, discussed in the next section. Some of the difficulties reported in the literature are summarised here: Treatment complexity First is the issue of treatment complexity, and the problem of identifying exactly what the therapeutic community treatment is that is being evaluated. As outlined in Section 3., therapeutic communities come in at least two types. Within th ese types, there are variations in the treatment values involved, the programme structure, time spent in groups, and th e self-identity of the community as a therapeutic community. Evans 1994 (D.12) points out that any expe rimental research design needs a clearly specified programme, but in reality, as Berg, 1979 (D.3.) argu es, therapeutic communities are very difficult to replicate for evaluative purposes. Paul, 1967 (D.26.) provides the classic statement of the need for no- treatment controls and randomisation if at all possibl e, but makes the point that patient and treatment characteristics vary, as do follow-up times. Other wr iters covering these points in much the same way include Pilgrim, 1997 (D.57.), Einstein, 1981 (D. 11.), and Hine et al, 1982 (D.66.). The Report undertaken for the Council of Europe by Clarke a nd Sinclair, 1974 (D.50.) argues this case in detail. Dosage and integrity A further point is that, even if there is some confid ence that the treatment has been identified clearly, it is difficult to know how to measure the dosage (other th an time-in-treatment - see below), since not only do programme timetables vary, but also the quality of sta ff and the administrative context of the therapeutic community. A particular division is frequently made in the literature between the therapeutic community proper and the therapeutic community approach, alt hough there is little specific attempt made to identify these differences consistently (but see D.30. Warren, 1994, who suggests that some contradictory findings may have been caused by confusion between these typ es). Moreover, since one of the criteria identified above for the definition of a therapeutic community is that of self-identity, there is a difficulty over treatment integrity - how do we know th at the self-identity of a particul ar programme is not erroneous? Or what happens when therapeutic communities, as th ey have been known to do, go through periods of disruption, or sluggishness? At what point is the treat ment itself compromised? This is a point raised in connection with the Clarke & Cornish, 1972 (D.55.) st udy of Kingswood - it was not clear how 'pure' the therapeutic community house was, and thus how re presentative of a therapeutic community treatment modality. 104Population selection The randomisation of patients to treatment require d in experimental models may involve ethical difficulties, and these are often raised tangentially in th e literature. It does not seem to us that these are in principle insurmountable, and they will not be addressed in this review. However there other much more significant practical difficulties discussed at greater length. Patients accepted for therapeutic community treatment are normally both self-selected (in terms of application to join) and community-selected (in terms of the whole community, not just staff or cons ultants). This means there is no independent decision that can guarantee referral and acceptance, and con sequently randomisation is difficult to set up and sustain. Candy et al, 1972 (D.67.), for example, set up a feasibility study of using an RCT to study psychotherapy, but found that it was impractical, in that referrers and staff compromised randomisation through non-random selection effects. Higgitt and Fonagy, 1992 (D.15.) suggest that personality disorders are particularly unlikely to allow themselves to be randomised, or at least those that do will be selective. Staff may also be reluctant to support randomisation, or be tempted to undermine it in practice. The consequence is that a carefully designed RCT can become undermined to the point of failure. The Clarke & Cornish, 1972 (D.55.) study of Kingswood is one of the best known failures in th is respect, because referrers stopped referring within the system. Staff influenced each other across the pr ogrammes included as experi mental and controls, and undermined the randomisation process. It proved difficu lt to control the Hawthorne effect. The authors concluded that 'the controlled trial would seem to have a more limited function in penal research than has sometimes been ascribed to it in the past and certainly much more limited than it has in medicine. In the view of the writers it is particularly unlikely that its widespread use at present would significantly advance knowledge about institutional treatment in ways that could not be otherwise achieved' (D.55. Clarke & Cornish, 1972 p.21). The recommendation is for studies of larger number of institutions and their natural variation (see below). Dropouts Treatment in therapeutic communities takes time - typi cally around six to nine months. This heightens the possibility that patients will leave prematurely. In fact, dropouts from therapeutic community treatments are commonplace. Dropouts from research studies are also a difficulty. The US literature on addiction therapeutic communities contains numerous articles (discussed elsewhere in this report) on such 'splittees'. In treatment terms, there is a clear association with in-treatment improvement and length of stay (D.54. Nieminen, 1996), and hence a concern, al most an obsession, with retaining patients in the programme. In research, as we have mentioned, sustai ning comparable dosage is an essential pre-requisite for evaluation, which is seriously compromised by dropouts. Effects decay Even if the patients are randomised, and treatment is successfully delivered and measured, there remains the problem of the point at which improvement should be measured. On the one hand in penal research, it has been possible to follow up failures over quite long pe riods of time through the use of criminal records, 105for example, for five years or more. On the other ha nd, many studies have been content to look at change while still in treatment, at the end of treatment, or at a year post-treatment. Clearly, given the likely effects of post-treatment experiences and effects, sustained effects over long periods even if smaller, may be more convincing than larger effects early on which are not sustained. Early home office research, where longer post-treatment effects could be monitored, was particularly concerned about the extent to which post-treatment environmental effects could swamp treat ment gains (D.44. Dunlop, 1974; D.50. Clarke and Cornish, 1978). The solu tion to this problem was fairly obviously felt to be the measurement of intermediate change duri ng and soon after treatment, and the use of cross- institutional designs (see below) to capture changes during treatment. Prison-based research has in a sense suffered from th e opportunities that prison records offer for long- term follow-up, since the effect of any interventi on is likely to decay over long periods of time. Any consistently positive effect over l ong periods would be remarkable. Fo r prison research, this led in the 1970s to an assumption of therapeutic pessimism, famous ly expressed in the dictum that 'nothing works' (Martinson, 1974). However, the accumulation of dozens of studies si nce then has, through meta-analysis (see below), shown that even over long periods a consistent effect of a ten per cent reduction in recidivism compared to controls has been ach ieved in German social-therapeutic prisons and American correctional facilities for juveniles (D.64. L\u00f6sel, 1995). Diagnostic shift The discussion above of the rapid development of th e diagnostic classification of personality disorders, combined with the widespread agreement that therapeutic co mmunities are inappropriate for schizophrenics and other psychotic pa tients, and their rapid spread throughout the US and other countries to deal with the addictions, and to a lesser ex tent in prisons, means that the population on which therapeutic communities have been ta rgeted has changed very substantially since the early post-war years. This is a further source of difficulty for evaluativ e designs, and particularly for the accumulation of sufficient studies to enable meta-analysis to be undertaken (D.34. Beach, 1989). 7.6 Methodological alternatives There are two strategies recommended in the literatu re for dealing with these accumulated difficulties, apart from the admonition to 'try harder!'. Meta-analysis In the prison and addiction fields, there are a c onsiderable number of smaller follow up studies. One alternative is to collect these studies together and conduct a meta-analysis. The best known attempt to do this is reported a series of publications by L\u00f6sel and his associates, (D.63. L\u00f6sel (unpublished)). L\u00f6sel 1995 (D.64.) is a representative analysis. In all these studies, he reiterates the points already reported in many other references in this section that issues of treatment integrity, diagnosis, drop out, and so on make RCTs of doubtful use. In reaction to the pervasive view 20 years ago, that 'not hing works' in terms of prison therapy interventions 106(Martinson, 1974), L\u00f6sel presents a meta-analysis of 19 German studies of effects of social-therapeutic prisons, plus 12 meta-analyses of many US prison pr ogrammes for juvenile delinquents. All effects are found to be positive, but small (generally about a 10 pe r cent reduction in recidivism). Within this range of studies, the 'cognitive-social learning approach' is the most successful type. L\u00f6sel concludes that 'For the critics of the treatment approach, it should be easier to achieve consensus on the fact that certain forms of intervention under certain circumstances lead to substantial increases in effect sizes beyond the 10 percentage points' (D.64. L\u00f6sel, 1995 p. 33). On this basis he suggests a list of 20 factors associated with 'what works', including a clear conceptualisation of the programme, clear identification of the offender's needs, and supportive post-treatment social and family networks. In the light of this set of papers by L\u00f6sel, the fi rst systematic meta-analysis of the effectiveness of therapeutic communties to have been undertaken is presented in this report. A meta-analysis was set up for the 52 studies with controls. 23 studies were excluded where the outcome criteria were unclear, where the raw numbers were not reported, or where the origin al sample was not clearly specified before attrition. Where there was a choice of outcome measures and control groups, emphasis was placed on conservative criteria, such as reconviction rates rather than ps ychological improvements, and on non-treated controls. This reduced the number of studies for the meta-analysis to 29. The analysis had two stages. Initially the odds-ratio s for the individual studies, and 95% confidence intervals, were calculated (Woolf ,1955, discussed in Kahn and Sempos, 1989, pp. 56-57). Subsequently, the odds-ratios were combined to produce a summary odds -ratio for the 29 studies, and subsections of them, also with confidence intervals for the 95% levels (Yusuf, et al, 1985, discussed in Petitti, 1994, pp. 100-102). Several points are worth making about the results. There is strong evidence for the effectiveness of therapeutic community treatment apparent from these studies. The odds-ratio measure used indicates that studies below one have a positive effect, those above one a negative effect, and those on or about one are neutral. However it is vital to consider the confid ence intervals for each study, to ascertain that the odds- ratio was unlikely to have happened by chance. Th is is conventionally expressed through the calculation of the range over which the result would be unlikely to have happened more than 5 times out of a 100 (the 95% confidence interval). 19 of the 29 studies indi cated a positive effect, within the 95% level of confidence. The remaining 10 studies all had confiden ce intervals which straddled the neutral score, of which 8 produced odds ratios above one. When summary odds-ratios are calculated across all 29 studies, as is the convention with meta-analyses, the strength of this finding is underlined. With a summary odds-ratio of 0.57, and an upper 95% confidence interval of 0.61, this set of studies gives very strong support to the effectiveness of therapeutic community treatment. A check can be made on this by grouping the studies. Odds ratios calculated separately for the RCTs, and for the democratic, con cept, and secure types of communities all show strong results, with upper confidence intervals well below one . It is important to note that the RCTs were scattered across the different types of community. This suggests that there was no one subset of studies that was strongly affecting the overall summary result. 107Turning to the variation between these different groups of studies, it is clear that the studies of concept- based therapeutic communities indicat e the most effective treatments, with democratic types showing slightly less. This pattern might be due to several causes. First might be the date of the study (all the concept studies have appeared since 1993). Second might be the nature of the patients (concept therapeutic communities deal exclusiv ely with the addictions). Third might be the type of therapeutic regime itself. Clearly some useful outcome is indicated by the meta-analysis, and further research would be useful for identifying the factors which are e ffective. RCTs by themselves cannot do this for the reasons discussed earlier, but one means of doing th is is to adopt a cross-institutional design. Cross institutional design This was the solution recommended by the Home Offi ce research team that tackled the Kingswood trial. If the treatment, patient disorder, and post-treatment e ffects, are all sources of experimental uncertainty, the alternative is to study a range of therapeutic community treatment interventions in their existing natural state, including normal variation between them. In this way, different aspects of the 'black box' can be unravelled, and can be related to patient ch ange during and after treatment. For example, Bergland et al, 1991 (D.4.) analysed 21 addiction programmes, grouped into 5 types, in the SWEDATE project. Variations in programme type were related to outcome, in terms of the per cent who remained drug free at follow-up. Clarke and Cornish, 1978 (D.62.), af ter the collapse of the Kingswood RCT, reported good effect on behaviour in-treatment, despite no positiv e effect on long-term recidivism, and concluded therefore that a cross-institutional design looking at in-treatment would be useful. The same argument is elaborated in Cornish, 1987 (D.9.), Dunl op, 1974 (D.44.), and Dunlop, 1975 (D.53.). Manning and Lees, 1985 (D.42.) and Manning, 1989 (D. 68.) designed a study in the light of these recommendations and report a cross-institutional design looking at six therapeutic communities in Australia. Using structural equations to model the vari ations in treatment components, they were able to account for 58.24% of the outcome variance from in-treatment variables (D.68. Manning, 1989 p.180). There are, as yet, no other published attempts to use th is design to evaluate therapeutic communities. This is partly due to the research costs involved. The cross-institutional design can be both interpretativ e and exploratory, and can also include survey investigation in the design, both to facilitate explor ation, and provide a basis for interpretation. Interpretative research is perhaps best symbolised by the school of ethnography. It emphasises relying for explanation on the interpretations people themselves put on the reasons lying behind their actions. It also emphasises naturalistic observation of phenomena in the field, and seeks insights into social behaviour from data collected in a way which is as unadultera ted as possible by the procedures and preconceptions of the researchers. An excellent example of this type of research is Bloor et al's sociological collection of 'ethnographies of therapeutic work in eight different therapeutic communities' (Bloor et al, 1988 p.1.) They argued that all comparative studies are relevant to the issue of evaluation, and pointed out that only a few existing studies of therapeutic communities dealt with more than one community. On the basis of their qualitative data, Bloor et al divided their th erapeutic communities into two types - those using mainly reality confrontation, and those using instru mental intervention; and identified six principles of 108therapeutic work -reflexive, inte rpretative, interventionist, dominating, selective, and subject to habituation. (Bloor et al, 1988 p.11) Other past examples of cross-ins titutional studies, which compare ther apeutic communities to other types of treatment regimes are Street, Vinter & Perrow's (1966) comparison of therapeutic community regimes with other forms of treatment regime for delinquent adolescents; Whiteley, Briggs & Turner (1972), who described the principles and practice, and some small- scale research studies undertaken in two therapeutic communities - Henderson Hospital, and Chino Prison in California, and a rehabilitative community-based hostel for ex-offenders, which was not a therapeu tic community; Almond's (1974) study of healing communities, which included therapeutic communiti es; and Shenker's (1986) study of 'intentional communities' - therapeutic communities, kibbutzim, and Hutterite colonies. More recently these cross-institutional, comparative d esigns have been adapted to be evaluative as well, sometimes by including methods used in randomised controlled trials, to make the results both interpretative and quantitative. This is done thr ough the use of both qualitative and quantitative measures, and through the use of techniques such as prediction, partial correlation and other statistical techniques, i.e. the relative risks distributed in the populations of each setting are standardised, so that differences between predicted and observed outcomes will indicate th e relative effectiveness of different institutions. In addition, measures of various aspects of the treatme nt process, or analyses of the treatment regime, are correlated with measures of effectiveness. Dunlop has suggested that the advantage of such a design is that it is capable of identifying small differences in re gime effectiveness, and that, rather than using an artificial experimental situation, it can 'use, explore a nd, thus, help to explain the natural situation of the regime.' (Dunlop, 1975 p.23) Dunlop also suggest s that, because the method depends on correlating scores which have been assigned to each setting, eight is probably the minimum number of therapeutic communities, for which the method is feasible (Dunlop, 1975 p.23, while Manning suggests it is necessary to look at perhaps 20 or more (Manning, 1979b p.306). This method of research is also not without its pr oblems. In the past, it has still been assumed that treatments can be broken down into separately identifiable classes or units, but this involves regarding individual units or treatment regimes as molar, single va riables, rather than molecular, multiple variables, and loses the subtleties of complexity. Secondly, there is the problem that correlations between measures of treatment process and measures of effects do not prove causation. Clarke & Sinclair pointed out that correlations are easier to interpret when there is a clearly causal dependent and independent variation and the direction of causality is only one way, but this c ondition is not fulfilled, for example, in a therapeutic community, where staff influence residents, and vice versa. (Clarke & Sinclair, 1973 p.50). In addition, cross-institutional methods of research, like experi mental methods, have sought to demonstrate and compare the gross effects of particular treatments, without making systematic attempts to describe the treatments, or to understand or explain how any resu lts of treatment might be brought about and how any beneficial gross treatment effects could be replicated (Clarke & Sinclair, 1973 p.30). A more recent, and particularly useful example of this methodology, is that proposed by Moos, which attempts to address some of these issues. Moos has been working for some years on ways of characterising treatment environments in more sophisti cated ways, in order to be able to relate these to 109treatment outcomes (Finney & Moos, 1984; Moos & Burnett, 1996). Initially, Moos did this through the Ward Atmosphere Scale (Moos, 1997), and later through the Multiphasic Environmental Assessment Procedure (Moos, 1980; Moos & Lemke, 1996). The WAS and its variants (e.g. COPES) have been used in therapeutic communities - occasionally in Britain (e.g. Verhaest, Pierloot & Janssens, Hansson, 1996; Smith, Gross & Roberts, 1996). MEAP has been used in a number of treatment settings in the USA, mainly for substance abuse programmes, but also psychiatric settings (Moos, 1997), and was used by Lees & Manning in their study of Richmond Fellowship houses in Australia (Lees & Manning, 1985; Manning, 1989). It has been little used in Britain, despite its potential usefulness for comparativ e, evaluative research. MEAP evaluates the physical and social environmen ts of treatment settings, and enables description, monitoring and comparison of such settings. It descr ibes objective characteristics of the setting, such as the aggregate personal and social characteristics of r esidents and staff, the physical design of the setting, the programme's policies and services, and the quality of the programme's social climate. Through path-analytic structural equation causal modelling, the data can be used to plot the direct and indirect effects of these key aspects of the treatment process and setting, in relation to resident outcome, both in-treatment and post-treatment (Cronkite & Moos, 1978; Moos & Lemke, 1996; Moos, 1997). This provides a means of evaluating the effectiveness of treatment re gimes (Moos and Lemke 1996; Moos, 1997; Manning, 1989). Moos has now moved on to look at more sophisticated ways of measuring in-treatment outcomes, such as satisfaction and participa tion (Moos & King, 1997; see also Rogers, Wood & McCarthy, 1993 for an evaluation of community meeting participation as an indicator of treatment progress.) Cost offset There were only four studies found. This is a new area of development for therapeutic community research, stimulated by the relatively high cost of th is treatment. These studies show clearly that the cost of treatment is offset quickly by subsequent savings on future servi ce use. Given the strong evidence from the meta-analysis for the efficacy of therapeutic co mmunities, further cost-offset studies are warranted. 1108 TABLES 8.1 Democratic A: In treatment outcome - RCT Democratic non-secure TCs Table 1: Description of institut ions covered by outcome studies Study Pub. date Institution Approx. op. dates of inst.
