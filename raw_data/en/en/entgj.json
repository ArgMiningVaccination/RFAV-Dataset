A Word About Cleansing...Many of you have worked with Naturally Radiant in some sort of body cleanse or detox. Cleansing is very effective when done on a seasonal basis, usually in the spring and fall. Cleansing in the spring was designed to cope with a possible toxic overload linked to a winter diet heavy in meat and grains. A spring cleanse relieves the digestive tract of cold weather stagnation. A fall cleanse was used to rid the body of parasites which had accumulated over the summer and to tone the digestive tract for a long winter. But life is not so simple anymore. We are exposed to many more toxins today. As a result, many natural health practitioners are now recommending more frequent cleanses. Herbs and nutrients found in organic food sources can provide detoxifying effects on the body to boost its immune system and to aid the body in healing itself. Cleanses can assist in strengthening the body's immune system reducing instances of inflammation, depression and anxiety, rashes and other diseases. There are super products available to help you cleanse, contact one of our Holistic Therapists at Naturally Radiant to chose the cleanse that best meets your individual needs!
