Pregnancy brings about a whole series of changes that prepare you to bring a new life\u2014your baby\u2014into the world. For mothers and fathers, it is a gratifying and uniquely human experience full of excitement and promise. It also comes with questions, doubts, and worries.This section on pregnancy is rooted in the belief that having a baby is a highly personal experience for future parents. It is designed to answer your questions about pregnancy and serve as a companion through the weeks and months as you prepare to welcome your new baby. It's also meant to bolster your confidence and help ensure the experience lives up to your hopes and expectations.22Pregnancy The stages of pregnancyMenstrual cycle Illustration: Les Publications du Qu\u00e9becBefore pregnancy Women Menstrual cycle Your body prepares for pregnancy during every menstrual cycle. Menstruation is a stage of the menstrual cycle. Menstrual cycles begin at puberty around the age of 12 and continue until menopause, which typically occurs around age 51. To determine the length of your menstrual cycle, count the number of days from the beginning of your period to the day before your next period starts. Menstrual cycles can last anywhere from 21 to 35 days, but are usually between 28 and 30 days long.Pregnancy 23 The stages of pregnancyOvulation occurs when an ovary releases an egg. Once an egg is released, it is drawn into the fallopian tube. It may then come into contact with sperm , at which point fertilization may occur (see Fertilization , page 28) . To estimate when you will ovulate, count backwards 14 days from the end of your menstrual cycle. Women with regular 28-day cycles usually ovulate around the 14 th day of their cycle. For women with irregular cycles, however, it is more difficult to predict the day or period of ovulation.During a menstrual cycle, your body goes through a number of changes. Many interactions take place between your brain and your pituitary gland, a hormone-secreting organ. These interactions trigger the release of hormones that stimulate ovulation, which in turn prepares your body for fertilization . Ovulation Women are born with all the eggs they will ever have. They have about 400,000 eggs at puberty, and by menopause, all of them are gone.24Pregnancy The stages of pregnancyFemale reproductive system tube Ovary Endometrium Cervix VaginaEgg UterusOvulation period (or fertile period) Since ovulation does not always occur on the expected day, we use the term ovulation period or fertile period. This is when a woman is most likely to ovulate. If a man and a woman have intercourse during the fertile period, there is a one in four chance (at age 20) and a one in twenty chance (at age 40) that fertilization will occur. An egg must be fertilized within 12 hours. If it doesn't come in contact with a sperm during this period, it disappears through vaginal discharge. At this point, the glands in the brain will stop producing hormones. This triggers menstruation, and the cycle starts all over again.Pregnancy 25 The stages of pregnancyMen Throughout their lives, men produce sperm . Sperm production begins at puberty and continues until death. Sperm are produced in the testicles (see Male anatomy , page 27) , where they go through a number of stages. It takes about two and a half months before they are ready for fertilization . Once they are ready, they are stored in the seminal vesicles.When a man ejaculates, sperm from the seminal vesicles are mixed with fluids from the prostate and other glands of the male reproductive organs. This is known as semen. The semen from a single ejaculation usually contains between 20 million and 200 million sperm cells. Sperm can live 72 to 120 hours in a woman's genital tract, but only a few seconds outside it.26Pregnancy The stages of pregnancy 1 Pelvis Bone that supports the organs in the mother's abdomen. 2 Ovary The two ovaries produce eggs and female hormones. 3 Uterus Muscular organ the size of a small pear that grows as the pregnancy progresses. This is where the embryo develops. 4 Fallopian tube The Fallopian tubes connect the uterus and the ovaries. They transport eggs and are necessary for fertilization. 5 Cervix Bottom part of the uterus connected to the vagina. During menstruation, blood flows from the cervix, which is almost closed. During labour, the cervix dilates to let the baby through. 6 Vagina A roughly 8 cm long passageway between the uterus and the vulva. The vagina is flexible and elastic so it can stretch during intercourse and delivery. 7 Bladder Organ that holds the urine produced by the kidneys. 8 Perineum Viewed from the exterior, the region between the anus and the vulva. The muscles of the perineum form a sort of internal \"hammock\" that supports the genital organs and bladder.Female anatomy 1 2 2 4 3 10 10 11 12 6 9 6 5 3 5 7 6 9 8 4 8Pregnancy 27 The stages of pregnancy 5 Prostate Gland that secretes seminal fluid, one of the substances composing semen. 6 Scrotum Sac of skin that protects the testicles. 7 Testicle The testicles (or testes) are the organs that produce sperm. 8 Seminal vesicle Located above the prostate, the seminal vesicles are reservoirs that store sperm that are ready for fertilization. 9 Anus Opening through which feces are expelled. 9 Anus Opening through which feces are expelled. 10 Urethra Tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. It is part of the perineum. 11 Clitoris Sensitive, erogenous organ that plays an important role in female sexual pleasure. 12 Vulva All external genitalia, including the labia and clitoris. Male anatomy 1 Bladder Organ that holds the urine produced by the kidneys. 2 Vas deferens Tube that carries sperm from the testicles to the prostate. 3 Urethra Tube that carries urine from the bladder and out the penis. It also carries semen from the prostate and out the penis. 4 Penis Male genital organ. Its sponge-like tissue swells with blood during erections. Illustrations: The Pregnancy Book Adapted by Bertrand Lachance with the permission of the Department of Health, UK 1 2 4 6 7 3 8 5 928Pregnancy The stages of pregnancyFertilization Fertilization occurs when a sperm and an egg meet. For this to happen, the sperm must cross the outer layer of the egg. The egg and the sperm then fuse to form a single cell. The fertilized egg starts to develop and slowly descends toward the uterus to form an embryo . It will implant itself in the lining of the uterus, which is called the endometrium. Implantation takes place about seven days after ovulation.Most women take a pregnancy test when they realize their period is late. If the test is positive, it means that fertilization has occurred. In about one out of every six pregnancies, the embryo will not develop or the baby's heart will stop beating relatively early on. The uterus will then stop growing and expel its contents, ending the pregnancy in miscarriage (see Miscarriage , page 160) .Pregnancy 29 The stages of pregnancylength of pregnancy The length of a pregnancy is calculated from the first day of a woman's last menstrual period because it's virtually impossible to know the exact moment of fertilization . Health professionals will most likely refer to your pregnancy in terms of weeks. When they say you are \"20 weeks pregnant,\" for example, it means 20 full weeks have gone by since the first day of your last menstrual period. The reason is simple: it is more accurate to talk about weeks than calendar months. Your baby will be considered at term as of 37 weeks and could be born anytime between 37 and 42 weeks after your last menstrual period. Most babies are born between 39 and 41 weeks. The 42 weeks of pregnancy (maximum length) are further divided into three trimesters of 14 weeks each. Each trimester corresponds to specific stages in the development of the fetus (see Development of the fetus , page 31) . Due date One of the first things you'll want to know on learning you are pregnant is when the baby is due. When will the big day be? To estimate your due date, count 280 days, or 40 complete weeks, from the first day of your last period. The expected due date is therefore only an approximate date. An ultrasound (see Ultrasound , page 128) performed before 20 weeks of pregnancy will give you a good idea of the due date, plus or minus 7 to 10 days.PrEGnAncy 30The fetus Development of the fetus 31 Fetus's environment 37 Lennart Nilsson / TTPregnancy 31 The fetusFirst trimester: from conception to 14 weeks At 5 weeks, the embryo 's heart begins to beat, although it cannot yet be heard during a medical exam. At 6 weeks, the embryo measures 5 mm.Development of the fetus Your baby is constantly growing and must go through several stages before he's ready to live outside the uterus. These stages, or key moments, are outlined below. The number of weeks associated with each stage (based on last menstrual period) is only an approximation and may differ from one woman to the next. cells embryoMenstruation Fertilization Heart starts to beat 1st trimester 2nd trimester 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21weeks32Pregnancy The fetusAt 7 weeks, the embryo 's head is much bigger than the rest of its body. Its arms begin to form as the elbows and hands appear. The fingers are still fused together. The eyes are now quite visible. At 10 weeks, the embryo already has a human appearance: its eyes, nose, and mouth are recognizable. Its eyelids are closed. The fingers have now separated and the toes are beginning to form. Your baby begins to move his limbs, but you won't feel any movement yet. He has now progressed from embryo to fetus : all the body parts are in place, but are not yet fully formed.

Around 20 weeks, your uterus is level with your belly button. Your baby's movements are now strong enough that you can feel them. Some women feel these movements a little earlier or a little later in their pregnancy. Your baby is coated in a whitish cream known as vernix caseosa , which protects his skin. At 22 weeks, your baby measures around 19 cm. His hair begins to grow, and his body is covered in a fine downy fuzz known as lanugo.

Among other things, it Keeps your baby at the right temperature Protects him against shocks from outside the womb Provides space for him to move and develop his muscles and lungs The fluid is contained in a kind of pouch that surrounds the baby (amniotic sac or \"membrane\"). The membrane actually consists of two layers, which is why you will often hear it referred to as \"the membranes.\" Just before or during labour , the sac will break, causing the amniotic fluid to leak out. This is what's known as \"breaking the water.\"38Pregnancy The fetusPlacenta and umbilical cord The placenta starts to grow as soon as the fertilized egg embeds itself in the uterus. It is connected to the baby by the umbilical cord. At four weeks of pregnancy, blood begins to flow between you and the embryo . The umbilical cord and placenta carry the oxygen and nutrients your baby needs to grow. They also help get rid of your baby's waste by returning it to your body, which then eliminates it.The placenta secretes into the mother's blood the hormones required to maintain the pregnancy and help the fetus grow. It also acts as a barrier between the mother's blood and the blood of the fetus. But the placenta does not filter everything. Certain substances that are harmful to the fetus can get through, including alcohol, certain drugs, and certain medications.Liane ComeauPrEGnAncy 40Everyday life during pregnancy Physical changes 41 Emotional changes 50 Sexuality 56 Personal care 58 Physical activities 60 Tobacco, alcohol, and drugs 64 Household products 70 Cats 71 Gardening 71 Health and safety at work 72 Travel and trips 72 Janie Grondin photographePregnancy 41 Everyday life during pregnancyPhysical changes Pregnancy is a period of rapid changes in your body. Most of these changes are temporary and will gradually disappear after your baby is born. Some of them are pleasant, while others can cause a certain amount of discomfort. Heart, blood vessels and lungs During pregnancy, your heart rate can increase by up to 10 beats per minute. Your heart shifts slightly within your rib cage as the baby grows and your uterus expands. The volume of your blood increases to meet the needs of the fetus .Pregnancy also brings about changes that can affect your breathing. Many women feel a little short of breath when they're pregnant. Shortness of breath comes on gradually and remains mild. It can start as early as the first months of pregnancy. Hair Head and body hair growth can change during pregnancy. Some women may experience increased hair growth on their bodies and have a thicker, fuller head of hair. A few months after the birth, it is not uncommon to experience more hair loss than usual.42Pregnancy Everyday life during pregnancySkin Changes in hormone levels during pregnancy stimulate the skin and scalp, causing a noticeable effect in some women. Changes to your skin and scalp shouldn't be cause for concern, as most will diminish or disappear altogether in the months following the birth. Hyperpigmentation Most pregnant women will find that their skin darkens. This condition is known as hyperpigmentation. Hyperpigmentation tends to be localized, usually appearing as a thin dark line between the belly button and the pubis. It can also occur as a darkening of the perineum , anus, neck, armpits, the areola on your breasts, or the skin around the belly button. The pregnancy mask some women get is a result of hyperpigmentation. It is characterized by the appearance of brown patches on the face.Hyperpigmentation and pregnancy mask can be aggravated by sun exposure. To protect yourself, you can use sunscreen (see Sunscreen , page 58) . Hyperpigmentation and pregnancy mask clear up after the birth of the baby and generally disappear altogether within a year. Stretch marks Stretch marks can also develop during the second half of pregnancy. They are mainly visible on the tummy, breasts, and thighs, but also in the armpits or on the lower back, buttocks, and arms. Stretch marks form when a deeper layer of skin stretches as the body changes. They are initially a pinkish or purple colour, and gradually become less apparent over time. There is no proven method for effectively preventing or treating stretch marks. The massaging motion used to apply moisturizing cream may help reduce them somewhat, although the ingredients of the cream themselves appear to have little effect.Pregnancy 43 Everyday life during pregnancyOther changes Some women develop acne, which usually disappears after the pregnancy. Hormonal stimulation of the skin can result in the appearance of acrochordons (skin tags)\u2014tiny benign skin growths that are most common in skin folds such as around the neck and armpits. Some women may develop angiomas between the second and fifth months of pregnancy. Angiomas are little red patches on the skin formed by blood vessels. Most angiomas will disappear on their own within three months of giving birth.Bladder and kidneys Bladder function changes during pregnancy. The kidneys increase in volume and filter more liquid. This can trigger a more frequent or urgent need to urinate. Later in pregnancy, the uterus expands as the baby grows, putting pressure on the bladder. This increases the urge even more. You will probably feel the need to urinate more often at night, too. During the day, your body tends to accumulate water in your tissues. When you go to bed these water reserves are sent to your kidneys and you feel the urge to go\u2014again!44Pregnancy Everyday life during pregnancyStomach and intestines Digestion often slows down during pregnancy due to hormonal changes. This can cause heartburn (see Heartburn and acid reflux , page 143) and constipation (see Constipation , page 144) . Breasts Your breasts may become more sensitive and increase in size. The blue veins that crisscross their surface may become more visible. Your nipples and areolas prepare for breastfeeding by growing slightly. They may also become darker. Little bumps form on the areolas. These bumps are glands. They produce oil that will help keep your skin moisturized and protected during breastfeeding.Beginning at 16 weeks, the breasts start producing colostrum. Colostrum is the first milk produced for a newborn baby. Some women may leak colostrum during pregnancy. This is completely normal. Uterus Before pregnancy, your uterus is the size of a small pear. As your pregnancy advances, it expands to meet the needs of the fetus and changes shape and position in your abdomen. The increasing weight of the uterus moves your centre of gravity further forward. This can cause your posture to change. That's why some women walk differently than they did before becoming pregnant. Vaginal discharge Women often have more vaginal discharge during pregnancy due to hormonal changes. The discharge is usually whitish in colour, slick, and odorless.Pregnancy 45 Everyday life during pregnancyGrowth of the baby in the uterus Uterus Intestine Intestine Belly button PlacentaRectum Uterus Bladder Vagina Before pregnancy Around 20 weeks Around 32 weeks Illustrations: Maurice Gervais46Pregnancy Everyday life during pregnancyLigaments and joints Pregnancy hormones tend to make the ligaments supporting your joints loosen up gradually, especially in the pelvic area. For some women, this can cause pain during physical activity, or even while resting. Fat reserves Women accumulate fat reserves throughout pregnancy, especially in the tummy, back and thighs. These reserves store energy and are necessary to ensure that the pregnancy and breastfeeding go well. Weight gain Women gain weight during pregnancy because their baby is growing and their bodies are changing. The weight gain corresponds to the weight of the growing baby, but also the weight of the uterus, the placenta, and the amniotic fluid. The breasts, maternal fat reserves, blood, and extravascular fluids also contribute to weight gain (see Distribution of weight gain during pregnancy , page 47) . Adequate weight gain helps you lead a healthy pregnancy, but it's not the only factor. A healthy diet (see Eating well , page 77) , and regular physical activity (see Physical activities , page 60) will also have a positive effect on you and your baby's health.Weight gain during pregnancy is normal and allows you to lead a healthy pregnancy.Pregnancy 47 Everyday life during pregnancyDistribution of weight gain during pregnancy Illustration: Maurice Gervais Maternal fat reserves Uterus Breasts Placenta Blood Amniotic fluid Baby Extravascular fluids 48Pregnancy Everyday life during pregnancyChanges in weight during pregnancy At the beginning of pregnancy, your appetite may vary depending on whether you have morning sickness (see Nausea and vomiting, page 141) or pregnancy cravings (see Appetite, cravings, and aversions , page 80) . Some women gain more weight; others lose weight. Your weight will adjust as the months pass.You will put on weight gradually.By the end of the first trimester, you can expect to have gained between 500 g and 2 kg (1 to 4.5 lb). Most weight gain occurs during the second and third trimesters, as your baby starts to grow faster. During these two trimesters, you can expect to gain between 225 and 500g (1/2 to 1 lb) per week, depending on your pre-pregnancy weight. Weight gain can vary greatly from one woman\u2014and one pregnancy\u2014to another. There's no need to weigh yourself at home. Your prenatal care provider will monitor your weight on a regular basis. If you're worried about your weight gain, don't hesitate to let your care provider know.Pregnancy 49 Everyday life during pregnancyWomen carrying more than one baby (e.g., twins, triplets) will gain more weight. If this is the case for you, your prenatal care provider will take this into account. Living with the changes Every woman experiences pregnancy differently, but the transformations affecting your body can have an impact on the way you see yourself. Some women are comfortable with the physical changes. Like their growing belly, they may see them as signs of the baby developing inside of them and the future addition to the family.Other women find it harder to accept their changing bodies and new image. The day-to-day symptoms and discomforts of pregnancy can make this even more difficult. If you're experiencing discomfort or dissatisfaction, don't hesitate to express your feelings or talk it over with someone you trust. Pregnancy transforms women's bodies. Give yourself time to adapt to the changes. They're proof of your body's amazing ability to give life!50Pregnancy Everyday life during pregnancyEmotional changes For the pregnant woman Along with the physical changes, pregnancy can also trigger emotional, psychological, and social changes. Preparing for motherhood and the arrival of a baby can give rise to numerous questions and cause stress for some women. Take the time you need to adapt to these new realities (see Being a mother , page 738) . For many women, the changes associated with pregnancy can give rise to what may seem like conflicting emotions. For example, you may find yourself swinging between joy, worry, denial, excitement, even sadness. The important thing is to acknowledge your emotions rather than fight them. Let your emotions come and let yourself feel them. Talking about your emotions with those close to you can do you good and help you get the support you need.You can also talk to other pregnant women or those who have recently given birth. This can help you realize that you are not alone in experiencing some of the changes and emotions you are going through. Most regions have places where pregnant moms-to-be can meet (see Prenatal activities , page 123) . You may also notice that you don't share the same emotions or concerns as others. Remember, every woman\u2014and every pregnancy\u2014is unique.Pregnancy 51 Everyday life during pregnancyTo adapt to these changes, some women prefer doing activities by themselves, such as meditating or walking. Try to find what is most helpful or does you the most good. Pregnancy can be a very emotional time. Don't hesitate to share what you're feeling with people you trust. If you need more support, talk to your prenatal care provider. During pregnancy, women may attract more attention. Family, friends, and even strangers will often make comments, sharing remarks on your weight or appearance or offering all sorts of advice. Some women are comfortable with and appreciate the extra attention. Others may feel pressure and prefer to avoid the comments. If you feel this way, don't hesitate to say so and set your limits. You can always choose not to respond to questions and comments about your pregnancy.52Pregnancy Everyday life during pregnancySome women experience the changes and emotions of pregnancy more intensely and may be affected by depression during this period. About one in ten women will experience depression during pregnancy. If you find yourself feeling sad or irritable most days or lose interest and enthusiasm for your daily activities over more than two weeks, or if you or your loved ones are worried, talk to your prenatal care provider.For the future father or partner Future fathers and partners also face their share of changes during a pregnancy. Some wonder if they will be able to live up to expectations. Others have questions about their new family situation or worry they won't agree with their partner about the level of involvement each will have with the child.Pregnancy 53 Everyday life during pregnancyThe simple fact of knowing that your partner is carrying a child may not be enough to make the pregnancy tangible for you. Attending prenatal checkups and ultrasound appointments, listening to the baby's heartbeat, and feeling his first movements are events that can help you start building a relationship with your baby. Your relationship will become more real if you talk to and touch your baby through his mother's belly. Even so, some partners only become truly conscious of their new reality when the baby is born.If you know other new or expectant fathers or parents, don't hesitate to ask them about their experiences. These conversations can provide answers and help you embrace your new role. Participating in prenatal sessions can also help make you more confident in your abilities. For more information, see the section Being a father , page 730 .54Pregnancy Everyday life during pregnancyFor the couple Going from a two-person to a three-person relationship or expanding your family brings its share of changes and adjustments. You and your partner both have concerns but they won't necessarily be the same and may not come at the same time. You may wonder how your partner will react if you talk about your fears or share your doubts. Regardless of what you're feeling, it's important to communicate. Communicating allows you both to express your emotions and points of view so you can stay united on the path to parenthood. Your relationship as a couple is important as it forms the basis of your family-to-be.Your relationship as a couple is important because it's the foundation of your family to be.For the family If you already have children, you may have the impression you are neglecting the older ones. Fatigue and the discomforts of pregnancy may change the way you look after them. You may feel guilty or wonder how you'll be able to love all your children and give each one the attention he or she deserves. For your partner, family and friends, your pregnancy can be a special opportunity to build stronger ties with your older children.Pregnancy 55 Everyday life during pregnancyYour other children, regardless of their age, may feel jealous or even angry at the idea of welcoming a new member into the family. They may be worried about where they will fit in during the pregnancy and after the birth of their brother or sister. Reassure them and help them accept the baby on the way by talking to them about the upcoming birth. You can get them actively involved in preparations for baby's arrival\u2014by helping decorate the baby's room or drawing baby a picture, for example. It's a good idea to tell them that you still love them and demonstrate it by showing your affection. Samantha L\u00e9pine Have your children touch your belly when the baby is moving.56Pregnancy Everyday life during pregnancySexuality Pregnancy can have an impact on an individual or couple's sex life. Sexual desire and the frequency of sexual relations may increase, decrease, or vary during pregnancy. The changes in the woman's body or the new perception you have of yourself and your partner as parents rather than lovers can create feelings that affect sexual desire. Various factors, including medical contraindications, discomfort, personal limits, a greater desire for simple tenderness, or a growing belly, may lead you to set aside certain sexual practices or try new ones. Kathy Pouliot, studio Lollipop photo Sexual relations can continue throughout pregnancy without any problem, as long as you respect each other's needs, limits, and comfort zone.Pregnancy 57 Everyday life during pregnancyPleasure, whether physical or psychological, may be experienced differently by each partner during pregnancy. For example, you and your partner may not have the same ability to reach orgasm, the same degree of sensitivity, or the same feeling of closeness. You may have some concerns about sexual activity while pregnant, but you can have sex without worry: neither vaginal penetration nor orgasm cause miscarriage and they will not lead to premature labour or hurt your baby. The baby is well protected inside the amniotic sac in the uterus.In some situations, however, you may be advised not to have sexual intercourse; for example, if you have bleeding, abdominal pain, or problems with the placenta, or if there is concern about premature labour or a rupture of the amniotic membranes. Your prenatal care provider will tell you if this is the case and advise you about what precautions you should take. During pregnancy, it is important to protect yourself against sexually transmitted infections (STIs) . Use a condom if you have sexual relations where there is a risk of contracting an STI. This will prevent the infection from being transmitted and avoid the complications it can cause you and your baby.58Pregnancy Everyday life during pregnancyPersonal care Cosmetics and creams Most cosmetics (creams, makeup) can be used during pregnancy. Face cream and hand and body creams that do not contain any medicinal ingredients can be used safely. If you use a medicated cream, your doctor or pharmacist can check to see if you can continue using it while pregnant. Hair products and treatments Hair products and treatments including dyes, colouring shampoos, highlights, and perms are not dangerous to pregnant women or their fetus . However, if you use hair products as part of your work, discuss the matter with your health professional (see Health and safety at work , page 72) .Sunscreen You are advised to use sunscreen when you go out in the sun. This is especially important during pregnancy because the sun can increase hyperpigmentation and pregnancy mask (see Hyperpigmentation , page 42) . Use a cream or lotion with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 that protects against both UVA and UVB rays. Be especially careful to protect your face. Insect repellent If you are unable to avoid situations where you will be exposed to insects and you are obliged to use insect repellent, it is best to use one that contains DEET, icaridin, or soybean oil. DEET- and icaridin-based products protect against both mosquitos and ticks, but soybean oil-based products do not protect against ticks.Pregnancy 59 Everyday life during pregnancyIf you are pregnant, do not use products containing more than 30% DEET, 20% icaridin, or 2% soybean oil. Be sure to read the label to know how long the protection will last. Reapply only as needed. A few precautions There is no scientific proof that the use of these insect repellents by pregnant women presents a risk to the health of the baby they are carrying. But it is important to apply the product to exposed skin only and to wash off any excess. To limit your exposure to these products, you can apply them to your clothes rather than directly onto your skin. Wearing long pants and light colours is another way to help protect against insect bites.The use of citronella oil or lavender oil-based products during pregnancy is not recommended. Their effect is short-term so you have to reapply often, thereby exposing yourself to the product in large amounts. Laser hair removal and electrolysis There have been no scientific studies done on the risk of electrolysis and laser hair removal for pregnant women and their unborn babies. As a precaution, it is recommended that you avoid these hair removal methods until after you give birth. Tanning salons Even though ultraviolet rays cannot reach the fetus , tanning salons are not recommended for pregnant women. The extreme heat you are exposed to during tanning sessions can significantly increase body temperature and harm your baby. Many tanning salons require pregnant customers to provide written authorization from a health professional. 60Pregnancy Everyday life during pregnancyPhysical activities Being physically active during pregnancy is good for your physical and mental well-being. Women who are active during pregnancy cope better with the physical changes of pregnancy, have more energy, and are less short of breath. Practicing regular and varied physical activities throughout pregnancy is beneficial and safe. It prevents and relieves constipation, eases back pain (see Discomforts of pregnancy , page 139) , and prevents certain pregnancy complications, such as gestational diabetes (see Gestational diabetes , page 164) . Better physical fitness may also help you recover more easily after giving birth. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Ollendorff Being active has many benefits for your pregnancy. Getting around on foot, taking walks, and playing with your kids are some of the activities you can work into your daily routine.Pregnancy 61 Everyday life during pregnancyBeing active day to day Physical activity, even in small quantities, is good for your pregnancy! If you're not used to being active in your everyday life, start slowly and gradually add more. Getting around on foot, going for walks, and playing with your kids are some of the activities you can work into your daily routine. Pregnant women can aim for a total of 150 minutes of moderately intense physical activities per week, spread over several days. Moderate intensity means you can talk while exercising, but you can't sing.Choice of activities Choose your activities based on your fitness level and what you feel like doing. You can continue many of the activities you enjoyed before becoming pregnant. However, you may have to adapt some of them depending on your stage of pregnancy. For example, you can reduce the intensity, or change certain movements. Sports like power walking, swimming, aquafitness, stationary biking, and snowshoeing are examples of activities you can do. You can also add strength and mobility exercises (see Examples of mobility exercises , page 62) , yoga, and gentle stretching to your daily routine. 62Pregnancy Everyday life during pregnancyExamples of mobility exercises Round back stretch Pelvic tilts Illustrations : Luz De sign + CommunicationsFatigue and some discomforts of pregnancy may prevent you from being as active as you like, especially at the beginning and end of your pregnancy. Listen to your body, exercise less intensely, or get some rest, then resume physical activity when its comfortable for you. A few precautions Don't worry\u2014exercise doesn't increase the risk of miscarriage or of problems for your baby. Your prenatal care provider will tell you if your health situation prevents you from doing physical activities.Pregnancy 63 Everyday life during pregnancyHowever, scuba diving, sports and activities that can expose you to falls, physical contact, impacts, or injury are not recommended during pregnancy. It is also best to avoid sit-ups and other similar movements, as well as activities in hot, humid environments or at high altitudes (> 2,500 m). If you feel discomfort during physical activity such as shortness of breath, urinary leakage from effort, or a sensation of heaviness in the vagina, don't hesitate to change activities or ease off on intensity. You can also ask your prenatal care provider for advice in these situations, or if you don't feel capable of participating in physical activity. Good to know ... Exercise raises your body temperature and makes you lose water by sweating. It's important to hydrate properly before and during physical activity (see Drinks , page 97) . Women athletes who wish to continue training intensively during pregnancy should do so under the supervision of a physician. Listen to your body and respect your limits. 64Pregnancy Everyday life during pregnancyTobacco, alcohol, and drugs During your pregnancy, your prenatal care provider will ask you whether you smoke, drink alcohol, or use cannabis or other drugs. You may feel guilty or uncomfortable, or worry about being judged if you say yes. Rest assured, the purpose of these questions is to give you an opportunity to Get the information you need Talk about concerns you may have about the impacts of these habits on your health and that of your unborn baby Receive prenatal care that takes your situation into account Seek help if you want to quit Be referred to specialists if you need additional help Tobacco Pregnancy is a good time to quit smoking. The dangers of tobacco for the fetus , baby, and mother are real. The more cigarettes smoked, the greater the risks for the baby but there's no safe level of cigarette use during pregnancy. It's not always easy to quit smoking, drinking, or using cannabis or other drugs. Ask for advice or help from a health professional (see Got questions or concerns? Need help? , page 69) .Pregnancy 65 Everyday life during pregnancy Smoking harms the development of the fetus and can impact the pregnancy in the following ways: It increases the risk of placental abruption (detachment of the placenta), premature rupture of the amniotic sac, and premature birth. It can slow fetal growth and result in lower birth weight. It increases the risk of having a stillborn baby or a baby who dies in the days following birth. It also increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome .If you have friends and family who smoke, ask them to smoke outdoors so that you and your baby won't be exposed to tobacco smoke. For most smokers, smoking is an addiction that can be hard to kick. A telephone helpline, website, and numerous quit-smoking centres offer their services free of charge to the public. To access the helpline service and find the centre nearest you: iQuitnow 1-866-527-7383 tobaccofreequebec.ca/iquitnowIt's never too late to quit smoking. Your baby will benefit, regardless of when during your pregnancy you actually quit.Pregnant women are advised not to smoke cigarettes or expose themselves to second-hand smoke (from other smokers).66Pregnancy Everyday life during pregnancyAlcohol Pregnant women are advised not to drink alcohol. The more alcohol consumed, the greater the potential harm to the baby. Binge drinking and regular consumption of alcohol are especially harmful. As for occasional consumption of small amounts of alcohol, the exact effects are not known. As a precaution, it is therefore recommended to avoid alcohol completely. The effect of alcohol on the baby is the same, regardless of the type of drink\u2014beer, wine, or spirits.Pregnant women are advised not to drink alcohol throughout their pregnancy.Alcohol can have numerous harmful effects during pregnancy: it can result in miscarriage , premature birth, or a stillborn baby. Alcohol can also negatively affect the development of the fetus 's organs and cause birth defects. The brain is the organ most sensitive to alcohol. Alcohol can cause brain damage, which can lead to learning, memory, and attention deficit disorders, problem-solving issues, and behavioural disorders. These disorders persist throughout the child's life. Since the brain develops throughout pregnancy, it is recommended to not drink alcohol, regardless of the trimester. Like many women, you may have consumed alcohol in the early days of your pregnancy before you knew you were pregnant. If you have concerns, you can talk to your prenatal care provider. The placenta does not filter alcohol: it lets alcohol through to the baby.Pregnancy 67 Everyday life during pregnancyA few tips Explain to your partner, family and friends that it's important for you to not drink alcohol. This will help them support you better. Take advantage or your pregnancy to discover non -alcoholic drinks or cocktails that can be just as tasty: Sparkling water flavoured with - Pieces of fresh or frozen fruit (use them like ice cubes!) - Slices of cucumber - Fresh herbs - Syrups (grenadine, ginger, grapefruit, or others) Fruit juice mixed with sparkling water Homemade iced tea, cold fruit tea Virgin (alcohol-free) versions of your favourite cocktails, available in virtually all bars and restaurants Vegetable and fruit juices, milks, and smoothies iStockphoto Take advantage of your pregnancy to try different non-alcoholic drinks and cocktails.68Pregnancy Everyday life during pregnancyCannabis The effects of cannabis consumption (marijuana and other cannabis by-products) during pregnancy are a matter of concern. Effects can depend how much is used and when. Cannabis can interfere with the growth of the fetus , which can result in lower birth weight. It may also affect brain development in the baby, leading to problems later during childhood and adolescence. Pregnant women are advised not to use cannabis or expose themselves to second-hand smoke. Cannabis affects the baby regardless of how it is used: smoked, vaped, eaten, or consumed in some other form. What's more, when smoked, it can have the same effects as tobacco on the fetus. Even though cannabis may relieve nausea in some patients, it is not a solution for pregnant women. You will find advice on relieving pregnancy nausea in the table Nausea and vomiting , page 141 .Pregnancy 69 Everyday life during pregnancyOther drugs The effects of drugs on the unborn baby depend on several factors: the type of drugs used, the amount consumed, and the moment and way the drugs are taken. Cocaine, for example, can cause bleeding or placental detachment in pregnant women, which can, in turn, lead to the death of the fetus or premature birth. Babies whose mothers took drugs during pregnancy may experience drug withdrawal symptoms at birth among other problems. What's more, there is no way to know or check exactly what substances drugs bought on the street actually contain.

Corrosive products such as bleach and oven cleaners can irritate (and even burn) the respiratory tract, but do not harm your baby if inhaled in low concentrations. Heavy-duty cleaning products and air fresheners that contain solvents release toxic substances. As a precaution, you should only use such products when absolutely necessary. It is important to always read and follow product instructions.Paint and paint remover Most interior paints are latex based, which means they are thinned with water. Latex paints are considered safe during pregnancy if you are only exposed to them on an occasional basis. Avoid using oil-based paints as they contain solvents that are harmful to the fetus . It is unlikely, however, that you will harm your baby by spending a short period of time (up to a few hours) in a room that has been freshly painted, especially if the room has been well ventilated. Avoid stripping paint using a sander or paint remover. You could expose yourself to lead contained in old paint or to the toxic chemical products contained in paint remover.Pregnancy 71 Everyday life during pregnancycats Got a cat at home? That's not a problem, except that your four-legged friend could be carrying the toxoplasma parasite. Cats can contract this parasite by eating contaminated meat like mice or uncooked meat. The parasite then ends up in the cat's feces. To reduce the risk of being infected, have someone else clean the cat's litter box. If no one else is available to clean it, wear plastic gloves and wash them after use before removing them. Wash your hands thoroughly after taking off the gloves. You can also reduce the risk of transmission if the litter box is cleaned at least once a day, since parasites present in cat feces take 1 to 5 days before becoming infectious. Keep pets away when preparing food. Don't let your cat climb up on kitchen counters or the dining table. Other precautions are listed in Preventing food-borne infections , page 104 . If you don't have a cat and would like to get one, consider waiting until after you give birth. Gardening Cats and other animals may have buried their feces in your garden. To avoid contact with the toxoplasma parasite (see Cats , page 71) , wear gloves when gardening and when handling soil and sand. Wash your hands well after gardening and thoroughly wash all vegetables and fruit that may have been in contact with soil. Other precautions are listed in Preventing food-borne infections , page 104 .72Pregnancy Everyday life during pregnancyHealth and safety at work If you are pregnant or breastfeeding and your working conditions are potentially dangerous to your health or that of your baby, or if you simply have concerns about this matter, discuss it with a physician. If you are not already on leave for a pregnancy-related health condition, the doctor will ask an occupational health doctor to assess whether your work presents risks with regard to pregnancy or breastfeeding. If this is the case and you are an employee who does not work for a federally regulated business, you are covered under Qu\u00e9bec's For a Safe Maternity Experience program (see page 777) . If you work for a federally regulated business, you are covered under the Canadian Labour Code . For information, visit canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/ programs/employment-equity/regulated-industries.html .Travel and trips Car safety The Highway Safety Code stipulates that all occupants of a vehicle must wear a seat belt. A properly-worn seat belt can prevent injury in the event of an accident. It protects the mom-to-be and is the best protection for the fetus . Air travel Pregnant women can travel by air. There are no international regulations preventing them from being on board a plane. However, each airline has its own rules, so it's a good idea to check with the airline you wish to fly with before buying your ticket.Pregnancy 73 Everyday life during pregnancyBring a signed note from your health professional with you to the airport indicating your due date and a brief overview of your health and pregnancy status, as the airline may require you to present it. Overseas travel Before planning a trip abroad, you should talk to your prenatal care provider about your destination, how long you plan to stay, and any vaccines that may be required. Your prenatal care can be adjusted as needed. Your health professional may also refer you to a travel health specialist.

The lap belt should be worn snug around your hips, below your belly.74Pregnancy Everyday life during pregnancyZika Before traveling abroad, get information on the risk of infection by the Zika virus. It is recommended for pregnant women to postpone travel to Zika-affected areas. The Zika virus is transmitted through bites from infected mosquitoes. It can also be transmitted between sexual partners via the sperm or vaginal fluid of an infected individual. Most people who are infected don't realize it because they don't have any symptoms.Zika infection during pregnancy poses a serious threat to the baby. It can cause birth defects like microcephaly (abnormally small head), resulting in serious mental retardation. Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant and their sexual partners must take precautions if they are staying in a Zika-affected area. That means using a condom, for instance, or abstaining from sexual contact until the risk of transmission has passed. Before planning a trip abroad, you should talk to your prenatal care provider.Pregnancy 75 Everyday life during pregnancyFor information on the duration of the transmission period and recommendations on the Zika virus, consult your health professional and the following websites: quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/zikavirus/ and canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/zika-virus.html . Check back often because these sites are updated regularly to keep up with the latest scientific research.Insurances Check that your insurance policy covers your medical costs in the event you have to be hospitalized or give birth in another country. Also check before you leave that your baby is insured too. This coverage is even more essential in the event of a premature birth, as a stay in intensive care can be very expensive. R\u00e9gie de l'assurance maladie du Qu\u00e9bec reimburses an amount equivalent to the cost of the care you would have received in Qu\u00e9bec. Since such care can be more expensive outside of Canada, you (if you and your baby are not insured) or your insurer could end up with a big bill to pay.PrEGnAncy 76 iStockphotonutrition during pregnancy Eating well 77 Nutritional needs of pregnant women 78 Eating regularly 79 Appetite, cravings, and aversions 80 On the menu: variety, colours, and flavours 81 Essential nutrients 92 Drinks 97 Special needs 100 Diets 103 Preventing allergies 103 Preventing food-borne infections 104 Resources 116Pregnancy 77 Nutrition during pregnancyEating well Eating well means opting for meals and snacks made up of vegetables and fruits, whole grain foods, and protein-rich foods, especially plant-based ones. General advice on eating well applies at every stage of life and to all members of the family. But during pregnancy, women have special nutritional requirements.Trying new flavours, varying your dishes and cooking methods, and sharing meals with others are all ways to make eating well a pleasure. Eating well during pregnancy To eat well and meet your and your baby's needs during pregnancy, it is recommended that you Eat a variety of foods and add lots of colour to your plate Plan meals to include vegetables and fruits, whole grain foods, and protein foods Take a daily multivitamin with folic acid and iron Eat regularly (i.e., at least three times a day) according to your appetite Add one or two snacks between meals according to your appetite Drink mostly water when you're thirsty, supplemented by nutritious drinks such as milk or fortified soy milk Avoid restrictive diets Take the necessary precautions to avoid food-borne infections78Pregnancy Nutrition during pregnancyThe following pages will help you better understand your nutritional needs during pregnancy and adjust your diet to meet them. The general advice presented here may not apply to you if you have a health problem, food intolerances, allergies, or other special needs. Talk to your health professional. He or she can evaluate your situation and adapt the advice, or refer you to a nutritionist. Advice for women with gestational diabetes or multiple pregnancies can be found in the section Special needs , page 100 .nutritional needs of pregnant women The foods you eat during pregnancy contribute to your baby's health by providing the nutrients she needs to develop and get a good start in life. Your baby relies on you for nourishment. The food you eat provides the nutrients she needs to develop and get a healthy start in life. Pregnancy 79 Nutrition during pregnancyEating well also ensures that you meet your own needs during pregnancy. The physical changes you undergo (see Physical changes , page 41) increase your body's need for liquids and many nutrients . What's more, a proper diet helps you build the energy reserves you need for pregnancy and breastfeeding. Starting in the second trimester of pregnancy, your baby will develop faster and you will need to eat a little more. An extra snack or light meal during the day will usually be enough to meet your and your baby's growing requirements.Eating regularly To eat regularly, you can have three meals a day plus a few snacks, or five or six smaller meals. Try different options to find what works best for your day-to-day routine and your appetite. Eating regularly during pregnancy helps keep you energized throughout the day and prevents or reduces some of the discomforts of pregnancy, including nausea (see Nausea and vomiting, page 141) and heartburn (see Heartburn and acid reflux , page 143) .80Pregnancy Nutrition during pregnancyAppetite, cravings, and aversions Appetite may vary from one woman or pregnancy to another, and even from day to day. The physical changes you undergo can affect your appetite. Early in the pregnancy, hormonal changes can increase your appetite, even if your needs haven't changed. As the pregnancy progresses, your uterus will compress your stomach, slowing digestion and reducing appetite. Some of the discomforts of pregnancy (see Discomforts of pregnancy , page 139) may also increase or reduce your appetite, especially during the first few months.Cravings During pregnancy, most women have cravings\u2014a strong desire for a particular food. You may find yourself longing for chocolate, salty snacks, ice cream, or candy. Sometimes, cravings are for more nutritious foods, such as fruit or dairy products. Eating regularly can help reduce cravings, but regardless of what kind of foods you hunger for, the important thing is to eat well overall.Pregnancy 81 Nutrition during pregnancyAversions During pregnancy, you may also find yourself avoiding foods you enjoyed before you became pregnant. Even if you stop eating a particular food, you can still get the nutrients you need from other sources. For example, if you don't feel like meat or poultry, you can opt for other protein foods like legumes, eggs, or fish. Aversions are most common in the first trimester of pregnancy. If you stop eating certain foods, you can always try them again later in your pregnancy. If your cravings and/or aversions happen very frequently, bother you, or make eating complicated, don't hesitate to raise the issue with your prenatal care provider or a nutritionist.on the menu: variety, colours, and flavours Vegetables, fruits, whole grain foods, and protein foods are all important parts of a healthy diet during pregnancy. Each of these food groups provides different nutritional benefits, providing you with energy, helping your baby develop, or keeping you healthy throughout your pregnancy. The Food Guide Snapshot can serve as an example when you're preparing your meals. The food groups in the guide are presented in the following pages. For more information, go to food-guide.canada.ca/en/food-guide-snapshot/ .Enjoy filling your plate with a variety of colourful and flavourful foods.82Pregnancy Nutrition during pregnancyFood Guide Snapshot Vegetables and fruits Colourful vegetables and fruits make a crunchy and flavourful addition to your meals. It's recommended that you incorporate them into all your meals and snacks. You can get your veggies and fruits in different forms: fresh, frozen, canned, dried, or in sauces and compotes. They're easy to steam, stir-fry, or cook in the oven, and they go great in soups, cooked dishes, smoothies, and desserts. Veggies and fruits are also rich in nutrients , including fibre (see Fibre , page 96) (see Folic acid , page 93) , and vitamin C. Their colour indicates what kind of nutrients they contain. That's why it is recommended to eat a variety of different coloured veggies and fruits. To make the most of their benefits, try to eat one dark green and one orange vegetable every day: e.g., broccoli, spinach, romaine lettuce, carrots, sweet potatoes, and winter squash. Have plenty of vegetables and fruits Eat protein foods Choose whole grain foods Sant\u00e9 CanadaMake water your drink of choicePregnancy 83 Nutrition during pregnancyA few tips If you're not used to eating veggies and fruits at every meal, start by adding them in small quantities. Choose the ones you like the most first, then try new ones and find different ways to cook them. Some veggies and fruits may be more affordable to purchase frozen or canned, especially in winter. Choose the ones that have less salt and sugar. Vegetable and fruit juices often contain a lot of salt and sugar, and no fibre. It's better to get your veggies and fruit in other forms. Good to know ... Most of the fibre, vitamins, and minerals in potatoes are found in the skin. Brush them clean with a vegetable brush, cook them, and eat them with the skin on! iStockphoto Choose vegetables and fruits in a variety of colours, as they are rich in different nutrients.84Pregnancy Nutrition during pregnancyWhole grain foods Whole grain foods are one of the main sources of food energy. That's why they're recommended with every meal. Whole grain foods include whole grain bread, pasta and breakfast cereal; oatmeal; brown rice; and any food made from whole grain flour. There are all kinds of whole grains you can try that can add variety to your meals, such as hulled barley, buckwheat, rye, millet, quinoa, wild rice, spelt, and kamut. Whole grain foods are rich in nutrients , including carbohydrates, fibre (see Fibre , page 96) and many vitamins and minerals.A few tips If you're not used to eating whole grain foods, add them gradually to your diet. To start, you can aim to make half of the grain products you eat whole grain. iStockphoto Whole grain foods supply the energy you need to stay on your toes throughout the day.Pregnancy 85 Nutrition during pregnancy Protein foods During pregnancy, proteins help the baby's organs and muscles develop. Protein foods also help you keep you energized between meals and throughout the day. That's why it's important to include them in every meal and snack. Many foods contain proteins. These foods are described in the following pages. Choose plant-based protein foods on a regular basis, including legumes, nuts, seeds, and soy products like tofu.Dairy products In addition to proteins, dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt contain calcium and phosphorus, which are vital to building your baby's bones and teeth. Milk also contains vitamin D, which helps your body absorb and use calcium. Milk and dairy products are easy to add to meals and snacks. For example, you can Supplement meals and snacks with milk, yogurt, or cheese, based on what you like best Enjoy milk or yogurt in your cold cereal at breakfast or at snack time Replace water with milk when preparing hot cereals such as oatmeal or cream of wheat Use milk and dairy products in cream soups, gratins, salads, blancmange, b\u00e9chamel sauce, omelettes, puddings, tapioca, and smoothies Opt for dairy products with less fat, sugar, and salt.When you choose whole grain foods, check the ingredients. The first item on the list must include the words \"whole\" or \"whole grain.\"86Pregnancy Nutrition during pregnancyAre you lactose intolerant? Lactose-free milk, yogurt, and cheese are available in most grocery stores. You can also find tablets and drops that help digest dairy products. Ask your pharmacist for advice. You can also opt for fortified soy beverage, which doesn't contain lactose. Fortified soy beverages, tofu, and other soy products Fortified soy beverages contain calcium and vitamin D, and just as much protein as milk. Opt for plain or unsweetened fortified soy beverages. Most other plant-based beverages (e.g., almond, hemp, or rice beverage) contain little or no protein. iStockphoto Dairy products and fortified soy beverages help make bones strong.Pregnancy 87 Nutrition during pregnancySoy products like soybeans (edamame) and tofu are a good way to add variety to your diet. For example, you can use tofu like meat or poultry in most recipes. Legumes, nuts, and seeds Legumes, nuts and seeds are nutritious foods that are appealing for their flavour and variety. These plant-based protein foods are also rich in fibre. Legumes such as lentils, chickpeas, and beans are also inexpensive and can be regularly included in your diet. They make an easy addition to soups, salads, and stewed dishes, for example. iStockphoto Legumes like lentils, chickpeas, and beans are affordable and nutritious foods.88Pregnancy Nutrition during pregnancyEggs Eggs are nutritious, practical, and inexpensive. In addition to protein, they also contain choline, which helps develop your baby's brain and tissues, and vitamin D. Meat, game, and poultry In addition to protein, meat, game and poultry are a good source of iron, which contributes to blood formation and the growth of the baby and placenta. A few precautions While liver is an excellent source of iron, it is not recommended for pregnant women because it is too high in vitamin A. If you eat wild game, it's preferable to eat meat from game killed with lead-free ammunition. Lead can negatively affect children's development.Fish and seafood Eating fish and seafood during pregnancy provides important nutrients , including protein, vitamin D, magnesium, and iron. Oily fish such as fresh, frozen, or canned salmon, mackerel, herring, sardines and lake whitefish are also high in omega-3 fatty acids, which contribute to the development of your baby's brain and eyes. Good to know ... Two meals of oily fish per week provide you with all the omega-3s you need to meet you and your baby's needs. A few precautions Some species of fish contain contaminants such as mercury. Women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, women who are breastfeeding, and young children can still enjoy fish if it is chosen carefully.Pregnancy 89 Nutrition during pregnancyTo limit exposure to contaminants Opt for fish and seafood that are low in mercury and other contaminants: shad, smelt, trout (except lake trout), Arctic char, Atlantic tomcod, salmon, lake white fish, redfish, canned light tuna, tilapia, oysters, mussels, clams, scallops, crab, shrimp, and lobster Limit your consumption of - Certain marine fish (fresh or frozen tuna, shark, swordfish, marlin, and orange roughy) to 150 grams of cooked fish per month (75 grams per month for children 1 to 4 years old) - Canned white tuna to 300 grams per week (about two normal-sized cans). Canned light tuna is a better choice. For children, see Fish , page 546 . Avoid regular consumption of fish most vulnerable to contamination: bass, pike, walleye, muskellunge, and lake trout. iStockphoto Protein foods are nutritious and help keep you energized throughout the day.

Food is by far the best source of nutrients, even during pregnancy. But since it's hard to meet all of your requirements for iron and folic acid through diet alone, it is recommended that you take a prenatal multivitamin supplement.It is recommended that you start taking a multivitamin containing folic acid two or three months before getting pregnant, and that you continue throughout pregnancy and after giving birth. The prenatal multivitamin should contain at least 0.4 mg of folic acid AND 16 to 20 mg of iron Some women's needs may differ. Your health professional will suggest an appropriate multivitamin for you. A few tips Talk to your pharmacist or health professional before taking any vitamin or mineral supplements other than those that have been recommended to you. Some women may find it easier to take chewable prenatal multivitamins. Make sure they contain the recommended quantities of folic acid and iron.Pregnancy 93 Nutrition during pregnancyFolic acid Folic acid is an important vitamin for all pregnant women, especially at the beginning of pregnancy. It helps your baby's brain develop and reduces the risk of a neural tube defect such as spina bifida and other birth defects . Foods containing folic acid include Legumes: lentils, Roman and white beans, soybeans (edamame), chickpeas Dark green vegetables: asparagus, spinach, okra, avocados Orange fruits: papaya, oranges Sunflower seeds Enriched pasta Enriched flour and bread made from enriched wheat flourIron Iron is necessary for increasing blood volume and for the growth of the baby and placenta. Iron intake during pregnancy also allows your baby to build up important reserves for the first months of life. That's why you need more iron during pregnancy than at any other stage of life. Iron deficiency can cause health problems for the baby and lead to anemia in the mother. Even if you regularly eat foods that contain folic acid, it is recommended that you take a supplement containing at least 0.4 mg of folic acid throughout your pregnancy (see Vitamin and mineral supplements , page 92) .94Pregnancy Nutrition during pregnancyHere are some foods that contain iron: Animal-based foods Meat: beef, lamb, pork, veal, game Poultry: chicken, turkey, ptarmigan Fish: sardines, salmon, trout (except lake trout), halibut, haddock Seafood: shrimp, oysters, mussels, clams Seal and other marine mammals, wild duck, moose, caribou Blood sausage While liver is an excellent source of iron, it is not recommended for pregnant women because it is too high in vitamin A. Even if you regularly eat foods that contain iron, it is recommended that you take a supplement containing at least 16 to 20 mg of iron throughout your pregnancy (see Vitamin and mineral supplements , page 92) .Plant-based foods Legumes: dried beans, lentils, chickpeas Medium or firm tofu Iron-fortified breakfast cereals Certain vegetables: pumpkin, green peas, potatoes, spinach, and other leafy greens Cashews, almonds, pistachios, and their butters Sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and their butters Iron-fortified pasta and bread Iron from animal sources is absorbed better than iron from plant sources. To more effectively absorb the iron contained in plant -based foods, add foods rich in vitamin C to the same meal: e.g. kiwi, citrus fruits, peppers, cloudberry, broccoli, strawberry, pineapple, Brussel sprouts, snow peas, mango, or cantaloupe. Also, avoid drinking coffee or tea with meals and in the hour that precedes or follows a meal.Pregnancy 95 Nutrition during pregnancyCalcium and vitamin D Calcium plays an essential role in building baby's bones and teeth and keeping them healthy. To effectively absorb calcium from food, you also need vitamin D. Here are some good dietary sources of calcium, vitamin D, or both: Calcium and vitamin D Milk Fortified soy beverages Yogurts fortified with vitamin D Calcium Yogurt and cheese Tofu with calcium sulphate Canned fish with bones: sardines, salmon Calcium-fortified foods Most legumes and dark green vegetables also contain small amounts of calcium, as do almonds and certain nuts and seeds. Vitamin D Oily fish like fresh, frozen, or canned salmon, mackerel, herring, sardines, and lake whitefish Eggs Margarine If you don't consume a lot of dairy products or fortified soy beverages, make sure your multivitamin also contains calcium and vitamin D. 96Pregnancy Nutrition during pregnancyOmega-3s Omega-3 fatty acids contribute to the development of your baby's brain, nervous system and visual system. That's why it's important to make them a regular part of your diet during pregnancy. Fish are the best source of omega-3s. Opt for oily fish like fresh, frozen, or canned salmon, mackerel, herring, sardines, and lake whitefish (see also Fish and seafood, page 88 ). You will also find small quantities of omega-3s in other foods such as Canola, flaxseed, and nut oils, and vinaigrettes and soft margarine (non hydrogenated) made with these oils Ground flaxseed, chia seeds, walnuts Foods fortified with omega-3s (e.g., some milks and eggs)By regularly eating foods containing omega-3s, you can usually meet your requirements through your diet. However, if you decide to take an omega-3 supplement, consult a pharmacist or other health professional (see Natural health products , page 139) . Fibre Fibre is necessary to ensure your intestines work properly. It helps regulate digestion and prevent constipation (see Constipation , page 144) . Fibre is found in various categories of foods: Whole grain foods Vegetables and fruits Legumes, nuts, and seeds Try to make these foods a regular part of your diet. It is also important to stay well hydrated when you increase your intake of high-fibre foods.Pregnancy 97 Nutrition during pregnancyDrinks During pregnancy, your fluid needs increase by about 50%. Drink often, especially water, to stay well hydrated. Proper hydration helps your intestines do their job and reduces the risk of constipation, fatigue, and headaches. Water and nutritious drinks Water is the ideal drink when you're thirsty. It's easier to make it your drink of choice when you have it close at hand, e.g., in a water bottle you always carry with you. For an original touch, feel free to add some fruit, herbs or cucumber slices to give it some flavour.You can also opt for nutritious beverages such as milk or fortified soy beverages. Not only do they help you stay hydrated, they also provide nutrients like protein, calcium, and vitamin D. Nutritious drinks like these are practical when you're not feeling very hungry. You can also use them to make smoothies. Just add yogurt and some fruit.98Pregnancy Nutrition during pregnancy iStockphoto Drink often, especially water, to stay well hydrated. For an original touch, feel free to add some flavouring.Coffee and caffeinated beverages During pregnancy, you are advised not to exceed 300 mg of caffeine per day. That means no more than two cups of coffee (one cup equals 237 ml or 8 oz.) or three espressos of approximatively 30 ml/1 oz. each, provided you don't get any caffeine from other sources. Caffeine is also found in tea, iced coffee and tea, chocolate, and some soft drinks and medications. Energy drinks are not recommended during pregnancy. They can contain as much caffeine as coffee, and sometimes a lot more. They also contain products such as ginseng and taurine, which have not been proven safe for pregnant women.Pregnancy 99 Nutrition during pregnancyDecaffeinated products are safe for consumption during pregnancy. For more information, go to canada.ca/en/public-health/ services/pregnancy/caffeine.html . Herbal teas Certain plant-based products can have a negative effect on pregnant women, by triggering contractions, for example. For others, there isn't enough scientific evidence to determine whether they are safe for pregnant women.According to Health Canada, the following herbal teas are generally safe when consumed in moderation (no more than two or three cups a day): orange or other citrus peel, ginger, lemon balm (or bee balm), rosehip, and linden flower (not recommended for persons with pre-existing cardiac conditions). Vary your herbal teas rather than drinking the same kind every day. Another tasty option is to add lemon juice or ginger slices to hot water. Some mixed teas and herbal teas contain ingredients that are not recommended during pregnancy. Pay special attention to the ingredients when you buy such products.100Pregnancy Nutrition during pregnancySpecial needs During pregnancy, you may find yourself in a situation where you have special dietary needs (e.g., a health problem related or unrelated to the pregnancy). If you have any questions, don't hesitate to raise them with a nutritionist or your prenatal care provider. Gestational diabetes Women with gestational diabetes should eat vegetables and fruits, whole grain foods, and protein foods, just like other pregnant women. Eliminating any of these food groups is not recommended, because you and your baby might not get all the nutrients you need. Artificial sweeteners To reduce their sugar intake, some people prefer to use artificial sweeteners or opt for \"diet\" foods and drinks containing artificial sweeteners, such as certain yogurts, beverages, jams, and chewing gum. Sweeteners (e.g. aspartame, sucralose, sorbitol) found in processed foods or used for cooking are considered safe by Health Canada, even during pregnancy. Cyclamate (e.g. Sugar Twin brand), a sweetener sold only in individual packets, should not be used unless recommended by a doctor.Pregnancy 101 Nutrition during pregnancyHowever, it is advisable to avoid sugar-rich products (e.g., juice, soft drinks, cakes, ice cream, sugar added to your food like in coffee or milk) or to consume them only in small quantities. To help stabilize your blood sugar level (blood glucose), it's important to eat regularly (see Eating regularly , page 79) . The Food Guide Snapshot presented on page 82 can help guide you with meal preparation. Eating foods high in fibre (see Fibre , page 96) and protein (see Protein foods , page 85) will also help you control your blood sugar. For more information on gestational diabetes, Gestational diabetes , page 164 . Twin or multiple pregnancies Women carrying more than one baby need to eat a little more than women carrying a single child. If you have a multiple pregnancy, adding a few extra snacks or light meals to your usual diet may help you meet your needs (see Nutritious snack ideas , page 90) . Your health professional may also recommend special vitamin and mineral supplements. Discomforts of pregnancy such as morning sickness pressure on the stomach from the uterus, slower digestion, and physical discomfort are often greater for women with multiple pregnancies. These problems can really affect your appetite. You can adapt what you eat by opting for more nutrient- rich foods or drinking nutritious beverages like smoothies, fortified soy beverages, and milk more often. For more information on twin or multiple pregnancies, see Multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.) , page 166 .102Pregnancy Nutrition during pregnancy Pregnancy 103 Nutrition during pregnancyDiets Vegetarianism and veganism If you're vegetarian, it's entirely possible for you to lead a healthy pregnancy. Be aware, however, that some nutrients , such as iron and omega-3s, are harder to get from a vegetarian diet. Pay special attention to these nutrients and let your prenatal care provider know about your dietary preferences. If you're a vegan, it's also possible for you to lead a healthy pregnancy, but you're at greater risk of developing deficiencies in several nutrients. Iron, calcium, vitamin D, zinc, vitamin B 12, iodine, choline and omega-3 are more difficult to obtain with a vegan diet. Talk to your prenatal care provider about your dietary preferences.Dieting Going on a diet during pregnancy is not advisable, unless recommended by your health professional. Starting a new diet could put you and your baby at risk, because you may not get all the nutrients necessary for your baby's development and your health. Talk to your prenatal care provider if you want to go on a diet or are already on one. Preventing allergies Excluding foods from your diet doesn't reduce the risk of food allergies in your newborn. By eliminating certain foods, you run the risk of depriving yourself of some of the nutrients you and your baby need. If you are worried about allergies, discuss the matter with your health professional.104Pregnancy Nutrition during pregnancyPreventing food-borne infections There's no such thing as a world without germs. They are in the air, water, and soil, in animals, and in fertilizers and gardens. Therefore, they can also be found in the food and water we consume. Germs can cause food -borne infections. However, most of the germs found in food aren't dangerous, and your digestive system and immune system are there to defend you. What's more, basic hygiene habits can help protect you against food-borne infections.Prevention tips for the whole family On the following pages, you'll find advice on how to choose, store, handle, and cook food to prevent food -borne infections. These measures are applicable at all times by everyone involved in food preparation. Some foods pose a greater risk to pregnant women. You'll find specific advice related to pregnancy in the section Prevention tips for pregnant women , page 110 .Pregnancy 105 Nutrition during pregnancyCleanliness Wash your hands thoroughly with soap before and after handling food (see How to do a good hand washing, page 638) .

As a result, pregnant women are more vulnerable to certain infections, such as listeriosis. Infections like listeriosis and toxoplasmosis can also be more severe in pregnant women and cause serious problems for the fetus or newborn. Toxoplasmosis Toxoplasmosis is an infection transmitted by a parasite. It can be found in raw or undercooked meat, but also in cat feces. You will find more information on this infection in the sections Cats , page 71 and Gardening , page 71 .Listeriosis Listeriosis is caused by a bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes . It is a rare disease, and often relatively harmless for healthy adults. During pregnancy, however, the risk of contracting the disease is higher, and it can have serious consequences. In pregnant women, the symptoms of listeriosis are often similar to those caused by the flu: fever, shivering, fatigue, headache, and muscle or joint pain. More rarely, listeriosis causes digestive problems (eg., vomiting, nausea, cramps, diarrhea, headaches, and constipation).However, the bacteria that causes listeriosis can pass through the placenta and trigger a miscarriage in the first trimester. If contracted later on in pregnancy, it can cause premature delivery, stillborn birth, or serious infections in the baby (e.g., blood poisoning, meningitis).Pregnancy 111 Nutrition during pregnancyListeriosis and foods The bacteria that causes listeriosis is present in the environment and can also be found in facilities where food is processed. It survives and can develop in cold temperatures, for example in household refrigerators or the refrigerated section at the grocery store. It can contaminate certain raw foods, but it can also contaminate cooked or pasteurized foods through cross contamination due to contact with raw food. It is important to note that foods contaminated by the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria look, smell, and taste normal. To destroy the bacteria that causes listeriosis, food must be cooked or reheated to a safe temperature (see Safe internal cooking temperature , page 108) .Foods most likely to transmit listeriosis are low-acid foods containing a lot of water and not very much salt that Are produced without being cooked or industrially processed to destroy the bacteria or Are already cooked or pasteurized, but - are at high risk of being contaminated during handling or storage after cooking or pasteurization - are ready-to-eat foods kept for a long time in the refrigerator - are eaten without being cooked again These foods are presented on the following table Safer choices for pregnant women, page 112 .112Pregnancy Nutrition during pregnancySafer choices for pregnant women Safer choices Choices to avoid during pregnancy Meat, game, poultry Meat, game, and poultry cooked or reheated to a safe internal temperature (see page 108) Raw or undercooked cooked meat, game or poultry (e.g., tartare, carpaccio, rare ground meat) P\u00e2t\u00e9s and meat spreads that do not need to be refrigerated until they are opened (e.g., canned products) Homemade p\u00e2t\u00e9s and meat spreads that are properly cooked and stored (see page 104) Refrigerated p\u00e2t\u00e9s and meat spreads (e.g., country-style p\u00e2t\u00e9, cretons) Dried and salted deli meats that don't need to be refrigerated, like some salamis and pepperonis Refrigerated deli meats (e.g., ham, turkey, sliced roast beef, bologna) reheated until steaming hot or used in a dish cooked to a safe internal temperature Refrigerated deli meats (e.g., ham, turkey, sliced roast beef, bologna) Smoked sausages (hot dogs) reheated until steaming hot (see page 108) Raw smoked sausages (hot dogs), i.e., not reheatedPregnancy 113 Nutrition during pregnancySafer choices Choices to avoid during pregnancy Fish and seafood Fish and seafood cooked or reheated to a safe internal temperature (see page 108) Fish and seafood that do not need to be refrigerated until they are opened (e.g., canned products) Raw or undercooked fish and seafood (e.g., tartare, sushi, ceviche, raw oysters) Smoked fish and seafood that do not need to be refrigerated until they are opened (e.g., canned products) Refrigerated or frozen smoked fish and seafood (e.g., smoked salmon or trout) cooked or reheated to a safe internal temperature (see page 108) Smoked fish and seafood that is sold refrigerated or frozen (e.g., smoked salmon or trout)114Pregnancy Nutrition during pregnancySafer choices Choices to avoid during pregnancy Eggs and egg-based products Eggs that are well-cooked, with firm yolks and whites (e.g., omelet, boiled, scrambled) Raw or runny eggs (e.g., sunny side up, soft -boil ed, poached) Pasteurized vinaigrettes, mayonnaise, and salad dressing Pasteurized eggs and egg whites for raw egg-based recipes Egg-based dishes cooked to a safe internal temperature, like quiche (see page 108) Homemade eggnog heated to 71\u00b0C (160\u00b0F) Recipes made with raw or undercooked eggs (e.g., unpasteurized mayonnaise, Caesar salad dressing, or eggnog; mousse; sauce; cookie or cake dough eaten raw)Pregnancy 115 Nutrition during pregnancySafer choices Choices to avoid during pregnancy Milk and dairy products Pasteurized milk and yogurt made from pasteurized milk Raw milk and dairy products made from unpasteurized milk Any cheese used in cooked dishes (e.g., sauces, casseroles, or au gratin) All pasteurized and unpasteurized hard cheeses (e.g., Parmesan and Romano) The following cheeses, made from pasteurized milk: - Firm cheese (e.g., cheddar, Gouda, Swiss) - Cheese curds - Cottage cheese or ricotta - Cream cheese - Processed spreadable cheese (in jars, wedges, or blocks) - Processed cheese slices All pasteurized and unpasteurized soft cheeses (e.g., Brie, bocconcini, All pasteurized and unpasteurized blue cheeses Raw milk firm cheeses Vegetables and fruits Pasteurized vegetable and fruit juice Unpasteurized vegetable or fruit juice that is brought to a boil, then cooled Unpasteurized vegetable or fruit juice Fresh fruits and vegetables that have been thoroughly washed Unwashed fruits and vegetables Cooked or canned sprouts Raw sprouts (e.g., alfalfa, clover, radish, mung bean, and bean sprouts)116Pregnancy Nutrition during pregnancyFor more information For more information on how to prevent food-borne infections, see canada.ca/content/dam/canada/health-canada/migration/healthy-canadians/alt/pdf/eating-nutrition/healthy-eating-saine-alimentation/safety-salubrite/vulnerable-populations/pregnant-enceintes-eng.pdf .

This first visit is generally longer than subsequent appointments. Your health professional will take the time to ask questions about your health history and will also offer to perform a physical exam. Type of questions to expect At your first prenatal visit, your health professional will probably ask about the following: The date of your last menstrual period and the length of your cycle in order to determine how many weeks pregnant you are and estimate your due date Your health before and since the start of your pregnancy. For example, you may be asked about health problems, medication, allergies, operations, problems related to anaesthesia, and depression If you have ever been pregnant before, including any miscarriages or abortions you may have had Your family history and the family history of the baby's father, i.e., any diseases that run in your family and the father's family If you have ever had gynecological problems, such as cervical surgery, or if you or your partner have herpes Your living conditions (sources of income, family situation, support network) Your lifestyle (diet, physical activity, tobacco, alcohol, drugs) Your religious beliefs and practices If there are any sources of stress in your life, and if so, what kind What type of work you do in order to determine if it poses any risks during pregnancy126Pregnancy Prenatal careDo you have questions? Are you hesitant to have some tests done? Do you think other tests might be helpful? Now is the time to talk these things over with your health professional so you can make informed decisions. Some exams, such as genetic screening, for example, should ideally be performed between 11 and 13 weeks of pregnancy (see Screening tests , page 129) . If you want to have these exams, your first prenatal visit is a good time to talk about it. Physical exam Your health professional will offer to perform a full physical exam, which may include a gynecological exam. He or she will check your weight and blood pressure and may listen to your baby's heartbeat. A PAP test to screen for cervical cancer will be suggested. This exam can also be performed later during the pregnancy, or after the birth.You may notice light bleeding within 24 hours of the gynecological examination. Don't worry, the bleeding is from the cervix, which is more sensitive during pregnancy. Subsequent visits Subsequent visits are usually shorter. At each appointment, your health professional will ask how your pregnancy is going and check: Your weight Your blood pressure The height of your uterus (starting around 20 weeks) The baby's heartbeat Your baby's heart starts to beat five weeks after the start of your last menstrual period. Usually, it cannot be heard until 10 to 12 weeks into the pregnancy.Pregnancy 127 Prenatal careBlood tests and urine analyses During your visits, your health professional may prescribe blood tests and urine analyses to determine If you are anaemic If your blood sugar level (blood glucose) is normal - Between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy, your health professional will suggest a screening test for gestational diabetes (see Gestational diabetes , page 164) . This test measures your blood sugar after you drink a sugary liquid. If you have an infectious disease that you could transmit to your baby (such as syphilis, HIV/AIDS, or hepatitis B) Your blood type and rhesus factor (Rh factor) : - If you are Rh negative, some precautions must be taken. You may be given anti-Rh immunoglobulin (also called WinRho\u00ae) at 28 weeks of pregnancy, and sometimes after the delivery. You may also be given WinRho\u00ae if you have a miscarriage , undergo amniocentesis , or you have bleeding. If you have anti-rubella antibodies If you have bacteria in your urine, even if you don't have any symptoms If you have protein in your urine Depending on your condition, additional tests may be suggested at different times during your pregnancy.128Pregnancy Prenatal careVaginal swabs It is also recommended that pregnant women be tested for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like chlamydia and gonorrhoea. Many of these diseases can go undetected and affect your health and that of your baby. STI screening is completely confidential. If you think you may have had contact putting you at risk for an STI after your initial screening, don't hesitate to talk to your health professional about repeating the tests. Your health professional will suggest a vaginal and anal swab to check for Group B Streptococcus at around 36 weeks. This type of bacteria poses no problems for the mother, but can in rare cases harm the baby if it is not treated. If it is present, you will be treated with antibiotics during labour . Ultrasound Ultrasound is a type of exam that will be offered by your health professional. Ultrasound enables your health professional to: Determine how far along you are and when your due date is Check that your baby is the right size for his/her age See most of your baby's organs (heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, bladder, brain, etc.) and limbs Confirm how many babies there are Determine the location of the placenta During the ultrasound, it is often possible (but not always) to determine whether your baby is a boy or a girl, although there is a slight risk of error. If you want to keep the baby's sex a surprise, tell the technician and your doctor to avoid any misunderstanding.Pregnancy 129 Prenatal careScreening tests Screening tests for chromosomal anomalies may be offered to you as part of your prenatal care. Trisomy 21 Prenatal Screening Program of Qu\u00e9bec At your first prenatal visit, your health professional will ask if you want to take part in the Trisomy 21 Prenatal Screening Program of Qu\u00e9bec. Prenatal screening is not mandatory. It is up to you to choose whether or not to do the screening tests and whether or not to use their results. The decision is yours at each of the steps described in the next pages. Before you have these tests, think about the decision you will have to make if you find out the baby has a trisomy.In Qu\u00e9bec, most of the tests under the screening program are free for women who choose to participate. These are the steps involved in the Trisomy 21 Prenatal Screening Program: 1. Biochemical test, with or without ultrasound 2. A genomic test or amniocentesis if the biochemical test shows a high probability. The genomic test may also be offered right away if you meet one of the following criteria: You will be over 40 years old at the time of the birth You have already had a pregnancy with trisomy 21, 18, or 13 You have just had a prenatal genetics consultation. These tests are described on the following pages. 130Pregnancy Prenatal careBiochemical test The biochemical test consists of two blood test performed during pregnancy: One between weeks 10 and 13 A second between weeks 14 and 16 The test takes into account your age and the blood test results to determine whether your probability of having a baby with trisomy 21 is low or high. Depending on the results, the test may also indicate a high probability of your baby having trisomy 18. Good to know ... If the results of the biochemical test, with or without ultrasound, show a high probability, this does not necessarily meant that your baby will have trisomy 21 or trisomy 18.UltrasoundAlong with the biochemical test, you may be offered an ultrasound between weeks 11 and 13 of your pregnancy. There may be a fee charged for this test. This ultrasound is used to measure nuchal translucency, i.e. the space between the skin of the neck and the spine of the fetus . A higher than normal measure of nuchal translucency may indicate a high risk of trisomy 21, other chromosomal abnormalities , or fetal malformations. If there is a high probability that the baby has trisomy 21 or 18, you will be offered the genomic test. In certain specific situations, you may be offered an amniocentesis right away. Genomic test The genomic test is designed to detect trisomies 18 and 13 and make screening for trisomy 21 more certain. It more accurately identifies pregnancies where the risk remains high after the results of the biochemical test.Pregnancy 131 Prenatal careThis test is offered because it is reliable and safe. It is done by a blood test on the pregnant woman. Amniocentesis If the genomic test shows that the risk is high, a diagnostic test called amniocentesis will be proposed to you. This test involves inserting a thin needle into the abdomen to take a sample of amniotic fluid from the uterus. This method is a reliable way to determine whether the baby has a chromosomal anomaly , but it does carry some risk of complication, including miscarriage . If you are faced with the difficult choice of continuing or terminating your pregnancy after completing these tests, you may need help. Don't hesitate to discuss this choice with your family or a health professional. You may also want to contact trisomy 21 parent groups. They can help you better understand their reality and make the decision that is best for you. To find groups in your area, contact your CLSC. For information about the program, visit quebec.ca/en/ health/advice-and-prevention/screening-and-carrier-testing-offer/trisomy-21-prenatal-screening-program- of-quebec/ . Other screening tests After the birth, you will be given the option of testing your baby's blood and urine for diseases that are rare, but require early monitoring or treatment (see Blood screening , page 244) .It is normal for you and your partner to feel anxious if you choose to have these tests done. Be sure to ask for all the information you need and take your time to decide.132Pregnancy Prenatal careother types of care Dental care You can see a dentist during pregnancy, but be sure to let him or her know you're expecting. Generally speaking, there is no problem with receiving dental care during pregnancy. However, your dentist may suggest that non-emergency treatments be postponed until after delivery. Eye care Hormonal changes during pregnancy can make your eyes dry and cause discomfort. Your optometrist can recommend the appropriate treatment. Your vision can also fluctuate while you are pregnant, which means your glasses or contact lenses may no longer be suitable for your vision. If this is inconvenient, you can consult an optometrist to obtain a temporary prescription. Your vision will stabilize in the months after the birth. It is advisable to wait six to nine months after delivery or until you stop breastfeeding before obtaining a new prescription. However, if you experience sudden vision loss, or if your vision suddenly becomes double or blurry, you should see a doctor promptly (see Severe headaches, upper abdominal pain, or sudden changes in vision, page 154) . X-rays You may occasionally require x-rays during pregnancy. If you need to have an x-ray, be sure to tell your doctor or dentist that you are pregnant. He or she will be able to determine whether the benefits of the x-ray outweigh the risks for you and your fetus . If you do have an x-ray, tell the medical technician that you are pregnant so that he or she takes all possible safety precautions, like having you wear a lead apron, for example. At your first prenatal visit, let your health professional know if you had any x-rays before learning you were pregnant. Pregnancy 133 Prenatal careVaccines Flu (influenza) vaccine Pregnant women in the second and third trimester are more likely to suffer flu complications or be hospitalized. They may also transmit the flu to their baby. That is why it is recommended that you get the flu vaccine if you are 13 weeks pregnant or more. If you have a chronic health condition, you should get the flu vaccine as soon as possible, regardless of your stage of pregnancy. Pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine Pertussis (whooping cough) is a contagious disease of the respiratory tract that can be serious for young babies. It is recommended that pregnant women be vaccinated against pertussis. The vaccine is usually given between 26 and 32 weeks of pregnancy. It protects you and your baby during the first few months of baby's life. The vaccine must be repeated for each pregnancy.Depending on your condition, other vaccines may be recommended to you during your pregnancy or after delivery. Contact with people with a contagious disease Some pregnant women may come into contact with people, especially children, who have contagious diseases. If you don't feel sick but you think you have been in contact with someone who has a contagious disease, here is some advice for how to deal with certain diseases.If you feel sick or have any physical signs that suggest you've caught one of these diseases, see a doctor promptly. As a precautionary measure, inform the healthcare facility before you arrive.134Pregnancy Prenatal carePertussis (whooping cough) If you've been in contact with someone who has pertussis (whooping cough) in the 4 weeks before your due date, see a doctor. Fifth disease (also known as erythema infectiosum or parvovirus B19 infection) Thanks to their antibodies , over half of pregnant women in North America are protected against fifth disease, and so are their fetus . If an unprotected pregnant woman contracts fifth disease, there is a chance the fetus may become infected. In rare cases, the fetus could become severely anaemic and the mother could miscarry . The risk of complications is greatest before 20 weeks of pregnancy. The risk is much lower after.If you come into contact with someone with fifth disease, talk to your health professional. He or she will be able to assess your situation. Rubella (German measles) Rubella, or German measles, can cause complications for the pregnancy and the fetus. However, it's unlikely that you'll come into contact with someone who has this disease. Thanks to vaccination, rubella is very rare in Qu\u00e9bec and the rest of Canada. If you think you have been in contact with the disease, see a doctor. Measles Measles is a highly contagious disease. Pregnant women with measles can have a more serious form of the disease. They also are at greater risk of miscarrying or not carrying their baby to term. There have been no reported cases of congenital defect due to measles, however.Pregnancy 135 Prenatal careIf you think you have measles or have been in contact with a person with measles, promptly contact your doctor, CLSC, or Info-Sant\u00e9 to have someone assess your situation. Chickenpox When chickenpox is contracted by a pregnant woman it can cause complications for the mother and baby. The childhood vaccination for chickenpox reduces the risk of exposure for pregnant women. Here is what you should do if you come into contact with a person with chickenpox: If you have already had chickenpox, you can rest assured that your baby is at no risk. If you've never had chickenpox or aren't sure if you've had it, see a doctor within 48 hours. If you were born in North America, there is a more than 90% chance that you are protected. If you aren't protected against chickenpox, you will be given antibodies to help keep you from getting the disease or reduce its intensity if you do get it.Other contagious diseases If you come into contact with a person with one of the following contagious diseases, there is no particular danger for your pregnancy or your baby: roseola, hand -foot-mouth disease and scarlet fever. However, if you are sick and you have any symptoms that may be caused by a contagious disease, see a doctor. If you are worried you had sexual relations that put you at risk of sexually transmitted infection (STI) during your pregnancy, don't hesitate to tell your health professional. He or she may suggest screening (see Vaginal swabs , page 128) . STI screening is confidential. At all times, info-Sant\u00e9 can advise you on what to do.

Some of these products, or their ingredients, may be dangerous during pregnancy. What's more, their effects during pregnancy are not always well known, and their exact contents are not always clearly indicated on the packaging. Plants used for cooking, like parsley, basil, and garlic, are generally harmless. But when sold as natural health products in the form of capsules, tablets, tinctures, extracts, or essential oils, they can be more concentrated than when they are used in food. This may present risks for the pregnancy. Some teas and herbal teas may also represent a risk during pregnancy. For suggestions on herbal teas you can use while pregnant, see Herbal teas , page 99 .

Some of these illnesses may be more frequent or troublesome while you are pregnant. Don't hesitate to talk to a health professional if you're worried about changes in your health or if your symptoms interfere with your activities. See a doctor right away if your overall condition deteriorates or you notice any of the warning signs described (see Warning signs , page 151) . An Info-Sant\u00e9 nurse ( 8-1-1 ) can advise you on what steps to take at any time. Even if you are pregnant, most common health problems can be treated. Talk to a pharmacist or other health professional first, however, before taking any medication. Pregnancy 151 Health during pregnancyWarning signs Some problems during pregnancy require immediate attention from a health professional for evaluation. You can also contact your birthing centre or your hospital's obstetrics department directly.See a health professional right away if your overall condition deteriorates or if you have any of the following problems: Vaginal bleeding Loss of consciousness (fainting) Severe headaches, upper abdominal pain, or sudden change in vision Fever Lack of baby movement after 26 weeks of pregnancy Contractions before 37 weeks of pregnancy Loss of amniotic fluid Heavy blow to the belly Severe abdominal (belly) pain Chest pain and sudden shortness of breath A number of these warning signs are explained on the following pages.152Pregnancy Health during pregnancyVaginal bleeding Before 14 weeks of pregnancy Pregnant women often experience bleeding at the beginning of their pregnancy. Bleeding may be related to the changes in the body at the start of pregnancy, i.e., implantation of the embryo in the uterus. In such cases, bleeding is light and is no cause for concern. Often, the cause of the bleeding is unknown, it does not last, and the pregnancy proceeds normally. However, half of all women who bleed early in their pregnancy have a miscarriage (see Miscarriage , page 160) .When to consult a health professionalYou may have light bleeding after a gynecological exam because the cervix is more fragile during pregnancy. In this case, you don't need to be evaluated. In all other cases, if you experience bleeding during the first trimester, have a health professional evaluate the situation. Women whose blood is Rh negative, for example, may need to receive immunoglobulin (WinRho\u00ae) if they have bleeding. Go directly to the emergency room if you have heavy bleeding (vaginal bleeding that soaks two regular sanitary pads or one maxi-pad per hour for two or three hours straight) or if bleeding is accompanied by weakness, dizziness, or severe abdominal pain. An Info-Sant\u00e9 nurse ( 8-1-1 ) can advise you on what steps to take at any time. Pregnancy 153 Health during pregnancyAfter 14 weeks of pregnancy It is not normal to have vaginal bleeding after the first trimester of pregnancy (i.e., the first 14 weeks). If you do, see a health professional right away for an evaluation. The bleeding may come from the placenta, for example, or be a sign of a miscarriage or the start of labour . Bleeding does not always mean the pregnancy is at risk, but you should be evaluated to make sure everything is all right. Note that you may experience light bleeding after a gynecological exam, because the cervix is more fragile during pregnancy. In this case, you don't need to be evaluated. Loss of consciousness (fainting) Loss of consciousness (fainting) can be normal during pregnancy. But if you experience dizziness or fainting, it's best to see a health professional. Go directly to emergency if you lose consciousness and have other symptoms at the same time, such as bleeding, severe abdominal pain on one side, chest pain, shoulder pain, or palpitations. Also see a health professional if you have suffered a blow to the head or belly.154Pregnancy Health during pregnancySevere headaches, upper abdominal pain, or sudden changes in vision Contact your health professional right away if you are experiencing any of the following symptoms: Severe headaches Upper abdominal pain A sudden change in vision A general feeling of being unwell Also consult your health professional if you notice that your blood pressure is high (more than 140/90). Fever Fever is an increase in body temperature above the normal level. It is the body's way of defending itself against infection. An adult has a fever if their body temperature (taken orally) is 38\u00b0C or higher. If you have a fever while you are pregnant, it could be dangerous for your pregnancy or indicate that you have an infection that needs to be treated. When to consult a health professional If you have a fever of 38 to 38.4\u00b0C and your overall condition is good, you can wait a while to see how the situation evolves. You can take acetaminophen to lower your temperature and relieve pain. However, you should see a doctor or your prenatal care provider if Your fever of 38 to 38.4\u00b0C lasts more than 24 hours You have a fever of 38.5\u00b0C or higher You feel unwell or have any other concerns You can contact an Info-Sant\u00e9 nurse for advice at any time by calling 8-1-1 .Pregnancy 155 Health during pregnancyIf you are worried or unsure, you can also contact your hospital's obstetrics department or your birthing centre.Lack of baby movement after 26 weeks At around 20 weeks, your baby's movements increase and are strong enough to be noticed. Some women feel movement a little sooner, others a little later. At the end of your pregnancy the baby's movements may feel different, but they are still present. Your baby is more active at certain times of day. You might not notice his movements if you are more active or distracted than usual. You also may not be able to feel all his movements, even if he is active. Remember the movements you saw on the ultrasound that you couldn't feel. After 26 weeks of pregnancy, if you can't feel your baby move or he is moving less than usual, rest and see what happens. If you count fewer than six distinct movements over two hours, contact your birthing facility or health professional right away or go to the hospital to make sure your baby is all right.If you need to take acetaminophen (Tylenol\u00ae), choose a product that contains only acetaminophen. Your pharmacist can advise you. Don't confuse acetaminophen (Tylenol\u00ae) with ibuprofen (Motrin\u00ae, Advil\u00ae) or with aspirin. And don't take ibuprofen or aspirin during pregnancy unless recommended by your health professional. Only take acetaminophen for a short period. If you need to take acetaminophen for a longer period or for other reasons, talk it over with your health professional.156Pregnancy Health during pregnancyContractions before 37 weeks of pregnancy Throughout your pregnancy, it is normal to feel contractions that are unrelated to labour . Known as Braxton Hicks contractions, they are irregular and may or may not be painful. They can be caused by sudden changes in your position, standing for long periods, or sexual activity. You may also feel small \"electric shocks\" in your cervix or menstrual-like cramps that last a few seconds. If this happens, these are not contractions; they are usually reactions to the baby's movements. However, if you feel your uterus harden regularly and are experiencing pain, you may be having real contractions. Sometimes the pain of the first contractions is similar to menstrual cramping. Good to know ... Real contractions last at least 20 seconds. If they come and go at regular intervals, this could indicate the start of labour. To help tell the difference between contractions and other abdominal pain, see the table Telling the difference between contractions and other abdominal pain , page 157 . If you are experiencing regular or frequent contractions (more than seven in one day) before 37 weeks, you may be going into premature labour, especially if you also have more abundant vaginal discharge. Contact your health professional or hospital so they can determine what is happening. Premature labour can sometimes be stopped if it is caught early enough. After 37 weeks, the same symptoms may indicate that labour is starting. In this case everything is perfectly normal because your baby is no longer considered premature (see The start of labour , page 204) .Pregnancy 157 Health during pregnancyTelling the difference between contractions and other abdominal pain Problems Symptoms Heartburn Pain in the upper abdomen Burning sensation caused by excess acid Intestinal cramps Pain throughout the abdomen that may be due to diarrheal or constipation Urinary tract infection Pain in the lower abdomen and sometimes the back Frequent need to urinate small amounts False urge to urinate and sense of urgency Leaking urine Burning sensation when urinating Persistent urge even after urinating Blood in the urine (sometimes) Ligament pain Stretching sensation or pain in the lower abdomen, especially when you move, exert yourself physically, walk for a long time, or turn over at night (ligament pain is more common during second pregnancies and poses no danger to you or your baby) Uterine contractions Painful hardening of the uterus The first contractions are sometimes like menstrual cramps Pain lasts at least 20 seconds When labour begins, the pain will come and go at regular intervals158Pregnancy Health during pregnancyLoss of amniotic fluid (breaking of the waters) Most pregnant women have vaginal discharge during their pregnancy (see Physical changes , page 41) . Sometimes, however, other fluids such as urine or amniotic fluid may be discharged. The table Telling the difference between the types of discharge , page 159 can help you determine what type of discharge you are having. Loss of amniotic fluid can indicate the start of labour . If your waters break before 37 weeks, it can pose a risk for the baby. If you think you are losing amniotic fluid, or if you are unsure, call your midwife or your birthing facility or go to the hospital. If you your waters break at or after 37 weeks, you need to go to the hospital or birthing centre.Pregnancy 159 Health during pregnancyTelling the difference between the types of discharge Type of discharge Description Amount Vaginal discharge Heavier and runnier in the final months of pregnancy Can dampen underwear, but doesn't overflow Can soak a panty liner Urine More common after physical exertion, movement, coughing, and sneezing The flow stops when the bladder has been emptied Amniotic fluid (waters) Continuous loss of a clear, odourless fluid, which happens when the baby moves or the mother changes positionThe amount of discharge is another factor that can help you determine if you are leaking amniotic fluid. To estimate the amount Wear a sanitary pad (not a panty liner) Check the pad after 30 minutes If your waters really are breaking, the pad will be soaked and heavy160Pregnancy Health during pregnancyMiscarriage and mourning Miscarriage Pregnant women often experience bleeding at the beginning of their pregnancy. Bleeding may be related to changes associated with the start of pregnancy, i.e., the implantation of the embryo in the uterus. However, half of all women who bleed in early pregnancy have a miscarriage . In some cases, miscarriage can occur without any symptoms or bleeding. Good to know ... Women whose blood is Rh negative may need to receive immunoglobulin (WinRho\u00ae) if they have bleeding or a miscarriage. Your health professional will tell you if this is the case for you. About one in six pregnancies ends in miscarriage. Most miscarriages occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy and are caused by major genetic abnormalities . The embryo doesn't develop, or the baby's heart stops beating. At this point, the uterus generally stops growing and will expel its contents.Pregnancy 161 Health during pregnancyHowever, the risk of miscarriage does increase with age. For women age 35 and over, one in four pregnancies end in a miscarriage. For women age 40 and over, it is one in two. If you want to get pregnant again after a miscarriage, it's best to wait until you have had at least one normal menstrual cycle. It may be helpful to consult with a health professional if you have had several miscarriages. Keep taking your folic acid supplement.The abnormalities that cause miscarriage occur at random. They do not mean that a woman is infertile or has a health problem. Even after a miscarriage, it is possible to have a healthy pregnancy in the future.In rare cases, the embryo implants itself outside the uterus. This is called an ectopic or extra-uterine pregnancy . An ectopic pregnancy cannot continue to term. A medication or surgical abortion is usually necessary. In very rare cases, a baby may die later during pregnancy, for reasons that cannot always be explained. 162Pregnancy Health during pregnancyGrieving: when your pregnancy ends unexpectedly After a miscarriage , you and your partner may feel sad and distressed, and even go through a period of mourning. You may also experience feelings of anger, denial, and confusion. Some women feel guilty about things they did or did not do early in the pregnancy because they think they caused the miscarriage. If you have had an ectopic pregnancy , it is also normal to grieve for a time and to perhaps need help. If you are concerned about your chances of getting pregnant again, feel free to bring it up with your health professional,Miscarriage is not related to stress, fatigue, physical or sexual activity, diet, or lifting heavy loads.The grieving process The loss of an unborn child is a deeply personal experience. The grief a person may feel is influenced by circumstances. Some people start establishing an emotional bond with their child from the moment they start planning the pregnancy. For others, the loss of the baby represents the loss of their identity as a parent or an end to their plans for a family. Generally speaking, men and women don't grieve the same way. In addition, individuals may go through the different stages of grieving at different times. Whatever your situation, give yourself time to grieve and work through your emotions at your own pace.Pregnancy 163 Health during pregnancyIf you and your partner don't know how to break the news to your children or family and friends, you can talk to someone who has been through the same situation or ask a health professional for help. Resources also exist to help your family and friends understand what you're going through and provide support through this difficult time. The death of an unborn baby can trigger grieving the same way as any human death. It should not be minimized. If your baby dies after 19 weeks of pregnancy or after being born, you may also be entitled to maternity benefits under the Qu\u00e9bec Parental Insurance Plan. Qu\u00e9bec Parental Insurance Plan 1-888-610-7727 rqap.gouv.qc.ca/en/wage-earner/specific-events/ death-of-a-child Here are a few resources to help you during your grieving process: SOS Grossesse Telephone helpline for questions about pregnancy and termination of pregnancy 1-877-662-9666 sosgrossesse.ca (in French only) bras vides (CHU Sainte-Justine) A series of free videos on perinatal grief (in French only). chusj.org/fr/soins-services/C/complications-de-grossesse/ Deuil-perinatal-mort-perinatale (in French only)164Pregnancy Health during pregnancyHigh-risk pregnancies Some pregnancies are considered to be at higher risk than others. Examples include cases involving high blood pressure (hypertension), gestational diabetes, or multiple pregnancies. If your pregnancy is considered high-risk, you will be followed more closely and undergo additional exams. You may also be referred to a clinic that specializes in high-risk pregnancies (GARE) for prenatal care. High blood pressure (hypertension) during pregnancy Hypertension is when your blood pressure is higher than normal. Some women develop hypertension during pregnancy. In this case, health professionals generally recommend blood work and a urine sample, as well as treatment to lower blood pressure. They may occasionally recommend hospitalization. Depending on the stage of pregnancy and the condition of the mother and baby, it may be necessary to induce labour . In such cases, the medical team will determine the best time for the birth. Gestational diabetes Gestational diabetes is an increase in the blood sugar (blood glucose) level caused by certain hormones produced by the placenta. Regular blood sugar monitoring is recommended for women with gestational diabetes. The most common consequence of gestational diabetes is having a bigger baby. This can result in a caesarean birth or make for a more difficult delivery for both mother and baby. The baby may also have low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) and breathing problems at birth.Pregnancy 165 Health during pregnancyTo prevent complications from gestational diabetes, it is recommended to eat a balanced diet and stick to a regular meal schedule (see Special needs , page 100) . Regular exercise such as a daily walk is also recommended (see Physical activities , page 60) . These recommendations on diet and physical activity apply to all pregnant women, but are especially important for those with gestational diabetes. An individual or group meeting with a nutritionist is a good way to learn more about the kind of diet that promotes a healthy pregnancy and baby's development. It may not always be possible to control blood sugar levels, even with a proper diet and good exercise habits. If this is the case, the prenatal care team will prescribe appropriate treatment. Additional tests may be necessary to ensure the baby is doing well during the final weeks of pregnancy. Special monitoring may also be carried out during delivery. For more information, you can call the Diabetes Qu\u00e9bec InfoDiabetes helpline. pregnancyMultiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.) For many women and their partners and families, a multiple pregnancy can come as a shock. They say having a baby changes your life forever, so imagine when you're expecting more than one! You'll need to make adjustments to plan for prenatal care, the birth, and the way you organize family life once your newborns arrive. Types of twins There are two types of twins: identical twins and fraternal (non-identical) twins. Identical twins come from the same egg and the same sperm . They have the same genetic makeup, are of the same sex, and usually share the same placenta. Fraternal twins come from separate eggs fertilized by different sperm. They develop side by side in the uterus, but have a different genetic makeup and their own placenta, and may not be of the same sex.Two types of twins Identical twins Fraternal twinsIllustration: Maurice GervaisPregnancy 167 Health during pregnancyFor women with multiple pregnancies, the physical changes associated with pregnancy (see Physical changes , page 41) happen faster and are more intense. These rapid changes can result in increased fatigue and more discomfort (see Discomforts of pregnancy , page 139) . If the discomfort bothers you, don't hesitate to talk to your prenatal care provider. Women carrying more than one baby also have greater nutritional requirements (see Special needs , page 100) . Multiple pregnancies come with a higher risk of complications during pregnancy and delivery. Women with multiple pregnancies will have more frequent checkups, especially at the end of the pregnancy. This is to ensure that each of the babies is developing well. Preterm labour is the most common risk for a multiple pregnancy and can lead to premature birth. Premature babies require more care than full-term babies (see Care of premature babies , page 246) .Even if you are carrying twins, a vaginal birth is often possible. During the pregnancy, it can be helpful to talk with other parents who have had similar experiences. There are also associations of parents of twins in some areas of Qu\u00e9bec.

But in some relationships, one partner tries to control the other and uses violence to resolve conflicts. Some women experience domestic violence during pregnancy. In fact, one in ten women report being victims of violence at least once during the period surrounding their pregnancy. In most of these cases, domestic violence continues after the baby is born.Examples of domestic violence Your partner Constantly criticizes your tastes and abilities Puts down your family and friends, or forbids you from seeing them Monitors your movements or your activities and communications (calls, text messages, emails) Forces you to have sex, even if you don't want to Pushes or shoves you Threatens to hurt you or your children Gives you no say in financial decisions or controls your spendingPregnancy 169 Health during pregnancyAll forms of violence\u2014psychological, verbal, physical, sexual, or economic\u2014can have serious repercussions on your health and that of your child. Shame or fear of being judged can keep some victims of violence isolated. Since violence rarely stops on its own, it is important for your safety and the safety of your child to break your silence and talk to someone you trust who can provide support.You can contact your CLSC or Info-Social ( 8-1-1 , option 2) to get help from a health professional.

To help make a decision, many families want more information about breastfeeding, how to initiate it, and the potential challenges involved. The following pages provide useful information to help you prepare for breastfeeding. Making the decision to breastfeed Health professionals around the world over recommend that babies be fed breast milk exclusively for the first six months of life. The Canadian Paediatric Society, Dieticians of Canada, and Health Canada all echo this recommendation. Once babies have started eating solid foods, it is recommended that they continue breastfeeding until the age of two years or more. Women breastfeed for a variety of reasons. Some breastfeed because they like always having milk ready for their baby, while others see it as a way of strengthening the bond they developed with their baby during pregnancy. Still others decide to breastfeed because of the health benefits for the mother and baby. Listing the reasons why you want to breastfeed will help you make your decision. Ask yourself what's important for you and your family in light of your values and your situation. And take time to think about your intentions and how you can prepare yourself for the challenges you may face on the way. Regardless of your situation, remember to tell your family and healthcare professional about your decision. That way they'll know what to expect and be able to support you better. Trust yourself\u2014you know best what your baby needs. Knowing the reasons why you want to breastfeed before your baby is born can help you cope with periods of hesitation and discouragement. 172Pregnancy Preparing to breastfeedBreastfeeding and health Breast milk contains antibodies and other substances that help baby's immune system fight off certain diseases. The more breast milk a baby gets, the more protection she has\u2014protection that may even continue after she stops breastfeeding. Breastfed babies are at lower risk of diseases such as diarrhea, ear infections, colds, and bronchiolitis. And when breastfed babies do get these illnesses, they are less severe. Breastfed babies are also at lower risk of sudden infant death syndrome and are better protected against certain chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes.Breastfeeding delays the return of menstrual periods. In the short term, women who breastfeed are therefore less likely to develop anemia . Over the long term, women who have breastfed have a lower risk of becoming diabetic or developing breast and ovarian cancer. Most medications are compatible with breastfeeding. If you are taking medication, discuss it with your healthcare provider before your baby is born.Pregnancy 173 Preparing to breastfeedA learned skill The start of breastfeeding also marks the start of your life with your new baby. Preparing for breastfeeding and the first few days with your baby can help you deal with the surprises and moments of discouragement you may face along the way. Learning to breastfeed takes practice, both for you and your baby. Before baby arrives, you learn the theory. Then you put the theory into practice, and you realize it isn't always as easy as you thought. Little by little, with each passing day and each feeding, you will both get more skilled. Then it all starts to come naturally, and everything feels easy! That's when it becomes enjoyable. It can take four to six weeks for some women to feel comfortable breastfeeding. For others, it will take less time. During this learning period, you and your partner will develop your own ways of working as a team. It's normal to need information, support and encouragement if you have questions or problems. Don't hesitate to seek help from people you can rely on in your circle of family and friends or from breastfeeding resources (see The importance of a support network , page 180) . It can be useful and comforting to have made initial contact with breastfeeding resources in advance in case you experience problems.174Pregnancy Preparing to breastfeedStarting milk production: the first few days Breasts naturally prepare for breastfeeding throughout pregnancy (see Breasts , page 44) . This preparation culminates at childbirth, when hormones send the signal to start milk production. Whether you have small or large breasts, long or short nipples, they are designed to produce milk and feed your baby. There is nothing you need to do to prepare your breasts for breastfeeding. Whether your baby arrives early, on time or late, you will have milk for her.Breastfeeding itself doesn't change the appearance of your breasts; the changes are primarily due to carrying a baby and having your milk come in.Colostrum: your first milk The first few days after your baby's birth are very important for initiating breastfeeding and starting milk production. Your first milk (colostrum) is thick and yellowish in colour, and contains just what your newborn needs. You may feel like you're not producing much milk, but when your baby nurses, she gets small quantities that are ideally suited to her little stomach. During this learning period, it's normal for your baby to nurse very often. She was nourished constantly when she was in your womb. As the days go by, she will get used to this new method of feeding. Pregnancy 175 Preparing to breastfeedBreast stimulation Stimulating the breasts by nursing at least 8 times every 24 hours helps get milk production off to a good start. It also helps prevent your breasts from getting engorged (see Engorgement , page 492) . If your baby isn't ready to nurse, you can stimulate your breasts by expressing milk manually or with a breast pump (see Producing a good supply of milk , page 420) . When your breast milk \"comes in\" Between the second and fifth day after giving birth, milk production increases rapidly and the milk becomes clearer. This is known as having your milk \"come in.\" It is caused by hormonal changes and happens in all women, whether they breastfeed or not. For more information on this increase in milk production, see When your milk comes in, page 419 .The composition of breast milk Breast milk composition changes throughout the breastfeeding period to adapt to baby's needs and age. Breast milk is made up of proteins, sugars, and all the fats a baby needs, including omega 3 fatty acids that support brain and eye development. It provides each baby with the exact amount of vitamins and minerals they need to develop, with the exception of vitamin D (see Vitamin D: Not your ordinary vitamin! , page 380) . What's more, it contains enzymes that facilitate digestion. Breast milk has antibodies that help baby fight infections and develop her immune system. It is also rich in good bacteria that are thought to provide her with lifelong protection. To date, over 200 components have been identified in human milk. Certain factors influence the composition and taste of breast milk (see What influences the composition of milk , page 388) .176Pregnancy Preparing to breastfeedWays to make breastfeeding easier Making skin-to-skin contact in the first hours after the baby is bornPlacing the newborn right on her mother's chest, skin to skin, has a number of benefits for breastfeeding. The baby retains her heat better and is calmer. This contact also triggers her reflex to take the breast during the first hour of life, as well as later on (see Right after birth: Mother and child get acquainted , page 438) . It's good to take advantage of baby's first few hours of life to start breastfeeding. After these first few hours have passed, the baby will enter a rest and recovery period during which her reflexes will \"hibernate\" for a few hours.If your baby isn't ready to start nursing, it's a good idea to stimulate your breasts as soon as possible after giving birth to help start milk production (see How to express milk by hand , page 455) . You can express milk in a spoon and offer it to your baby, placing a few drops on her lips at a time. Staying close to baby and being attentive to hunger signsIt's good to keep your baby near you day and night. Your newborn needs to be close and be reassured by your presence. Being physically close to your baby allows you to get to know your baby and learn to detect the early signs of hunger (see Hunger signs , page 367) . It's an ideal time to give your baby the breast because he will probably be calmer. The first feeding will be etched in baby's memory and will help her recall what to do next time. Pregnancy 177 Preparing to breastfeedBeing close to your baby also allows you to quickly provide for her needs, which helps build a bond of trust. Positioning at the breast Proper positioning at the breast helps prevent breastfeeding pain and most nipple injuries. In the first few days of life, mom and baby learn together how to establish a pain-free latch and good suction (see Bringing baby to your breast , page 426) . When your baby is sucking effectively, you can see her pause and swallow (see How to tell if your baby is sucking effectively , page 429) . The swallowing motion is harder to notice before your milk comes in, because your baby is only swallowing small amounts of colostrum. Some women may be surprised by the sucking sensation at first. Some degree of sensitivity may be normal, but if nursing is painful, ask for help without delay.Breastfeeding on demand or often enough to meet baby's needs The frequency and length of feedings varies from one baby to another. In the first few days of life, it's normal for a newborn to nurse very often and to have feedings clustered together (see How often to nurse\u2014 and how long? , page 432) . Frequent feedings stimulate milk production and reassure the baby during this important adaptation period. You can expect to nurse 8 times or more every 24 hours during this period, and afterwards as well. Some babies frequently show hunger signs. Other babies don't always give cues that they want to feed. If your baby isn't showing signs of hunger or signs of wakefulness, you may need to wake her up to ensure she gets enough milk. Information and precautions regarding bottles and pacifiers If it's necessary to feed your baby using a method other than breastfeeding, she can be bottle fed with expressed milk.178Pregnancy Preparing to breastfeedHowever, sucking at the breast isn't the same as drinking from a bottle. Milk usually flows faster from a bottle than from the breast, and the baby's mouth movements are different. As a result, using a bottle, especially for a prolonged period of time, can lead to problems with breastfeeding. A trained breastfeeding support person can show you an alternative to bottle-feeding, if you wish. If your baby uses a pacifier, it can be difficult to recognize her hunger signs. Your baby may end up skipping a feeding, which can affect milk production. To maintain milk production at a level that meets your baby's needs, check first to see if she's hungry or needs to be changed or cuddled before giving her the pacifier.Breastfeeding accessories There is an ever-expanding array of breastfeeding accessories on the market\u2014everything from breast pumps and nursing bras and pillows to nursing pads and more. None of them are essential, although reusable or disposable nursing pads can be useful if your breasts leak milk. A nursing bra isn't necessary either, but it can be very practical. If you do decide to wear one, it is best to get it toward the end of your pregnancy so that it fits your breast size. Community groups are good sources of information when the time comes to choose a breast pump or other breastfeeding accessories.Pregnancy 179 Preparing to breastfeedcommon concerns and possible problems Despite the known benefits of breastfeeding, some women are still hesitant to nurse their baby. Common fears include being incapable of breastfeeding, not having enough milk, having sore nipples, not being able to eat everything they want, not giving the father the opportunity to help with the feeding, and having their breasts deformed from breastfeeding. Most of these concerns are based on popular misconceptions or myths. Talk them over with a trained breastfeeding support person. The first few weeks of breastfeeding can be challenging nonetheless. Possible issues include engorgement, nipple pain or injury, frequent feedings (see Cluster feeding , page 434) , difficulty positioning the baby at the breast, worries about milk production, and a crying baby. Most of these issues are temporary, and solutions exist (see Breastfeeding problems and solutions , page 468) . If you want to prepare yourself for breastfeeding or you have concerns, feel free to talk to a trained breastfeeding support person. You can contact a breastfeeding mentor or a professional at your local CLSC. That way, you'll be better prepared to overcome any challenges you may face. Some women think that breastfeeding is meant to come naturally and easily and may feel flustered if they have problems. Don't worry, most breastfeeding issues are temporary, and solutions are available. 180Pregnancy Preparing to breastfeedThe importance of a support network Your pregnancy is a good time to talk about your impressions and expectations with your partner, family, and friends. It's also a good time to find out about the breastfeeding resources and community groups in your area. The role of the partner As a future father and partner, you can play an active part in the discussions and decision on breastfeeding your child. Your role is important. You can make a real difference by working hand-in-hand with your partner while a breastfeeding routine is being established.At the beginning, the mother often needs help getting the baby latched on to the breast. You can help by lending an extra hand to hold the baby, shifting a pillow, or sharing a word of encouragement. Little things like bringing your partner something to drink or making a snack are always appreciated. You can also reassure your partner when she's feeling unsure of herself, shield her from negative pressure from friends and family, or seek out support if she needs it. Helping care for your baby will also make breastfeeding easier for your partner and allow you to ease into your role as parent. You can work as a team, taking your turn holding your baby skin to skin between feedings, especially after your partner's milk has come in. You can change diapers, burp your baby, and rock her in your arms to soothe her or put her to sleep.Pregnancy 181 Preparing to breastfeedSupport from family and friends If you or your partner were breastfed, your families may be familiar with the practice. But you might also be the first in your family or your partner's family to breastfeed. In this case, you may want to let them know what your intentions are. Knowing your plans can help them support you in your decision. Also, don't hesitate to ask them for a helping hand with things like meals, babysitting, errands, and housekeeping.As soon as your baby is born, you can find ways to support your partner with breastfeeding. Your presence means a lot, especially during the adaptation period. Breastfeeding resources There are several types of resources that offer breastfeeding help and support. For more detailed information, see Getting help , page 416 . Breastfeeding resources Breastfeeding support groups and organizations Early childhood services at your CLSC Info-Sant\u00e9: 24/7 telephone consultations at 8-1-1 Certified lactation consultations (IBCLC) (private in-home services) Breastfeeding clinics with medical specialists (available in some regions) Your midwife or doctor182Pregnancy Preparing to breastfeedHere are some specific resources: Qu\u00e9bec , La allaitement.caMouvement Regional du Qu\u00e9bec Group of organizations in 19 cities and towns across Qu\u00e9bec reseaudescrp.org (in French only)Pregnancy 183 Preparing to breastfeedRemember that everyone's breastfeeding experience is a little different and that every baby is unique. If you or your friends have had difficult breastfeeding experiences in the past, that doesn't mean you will have trouble this time. It's normal to need time to get used to breastfeeding. As you're learning, you may have moments when you question your decision. It's a good idea to know who to turn to for help and to have people around who can support you.Breastfeeding a baby isn't always easy, but once breastfeeding is established, it can be very rewarding and nourishing for you and your baby. Trust yourselves and enjoy the pleasures of parenthood\u2014one day at a time.PrEGnAncy 184 St\u00e9phanie CaronPreparing for the birth Visiting the hospital or birthing centre 185 What to bring to the hospital or birthing centre 186 Vaginal birth after caesarean 188 Breech presentation 190 Birth plan 193 Preparing for the baby's arrival 198Pregnancy 185 Preparing for the birthIs your due date coming up soon? Check with your prenatal care provider about when you should go the hospital or birthing centre. Some facilities allow you to contact the birthing unit directly with questions about your pregnancy starting at 20 weeks. In the weeks prior to your due date, think about what you want to bring to the hospital or birthing centre and start preparing your bag. Knowing who will care for your other children when it's time to leave for the birthing facility will also take a load off your mind when your labour starts. Think about telling the person about your their routine and preferences.Visiting the hospital or birthing centre During your pregnancy you can find out about the different options available for giving birth (hospital, birthing centre), their services and their specific features (routine, rules, length of stay, and types of interventions). Some hospitals and birthing centres allow you to visit their birthing rooms. But more and more of them offer virtual tours online. These video tours provide a detailed overview of what will happen during your stay and allow you to familiarize yourself with the surroundings. They also provide information on the type of equipment available during the birth (e.g., bathtub, shower, physio balls, birthing bar, cushions, benches). Ask your health professional or prenatal class instructor about visiting opportunities.186Pregnancy Preparing for the birthWhat to bring to the hospital or birthing centre Suggestions for the mother \u0007Your health insurance card and other proof of insurance (if you have any) \u0007Your hospital card \u0007Your pregnancy notebook and pregnancy follow-up forms (sheets 1, 2, 3, and 4) if you received any during your pregnancy checkups \u0007Your birth plan \u0007Your vaccination record \u0007A note pad and pen \u0007Comfortable clothes for the labour and delivery (if you don't want to wear a hospital gown) \u0007Comfortable clothes for day and night \u0007Slippers and warm socks \u0007Tissues (not always provided by the hospital) \u0007A change of clothes and underwear \u0007One or two nursing bras \u0007Going home outfit \u0007Super maxi pads (heavy flow) \u0007Your toiletry bag \u0007Your glasses and contact lens case, if you wear them \u0007Snacks (like muffins, cereal bars, dried fruit) and drinks \u0007Items you may want during labour, like massage oil, extra pillows, a hot water bottle, and music \u0007Reading material \u0007A watch \u0007Any medication you are taking \u0007Your From Tiny Tot to Toddler guide!Pregnancy 187 Preparing for the birthSuggestions for the partner \u0007Comfortable clothes and shoes \u0007Food and drinks \u0007A camera \u0007Reading material \u0007Your toiletry bag \u0007A bathing suit (if you want to get in the whirlpool with your partner during labour ) \u0007Your pillow \u0007Pyjamas \u0007A change of clothesSuggestions for the baby \u0007Diapers (if not provided by the hospital or birthing centre) \u0007Pyjamas \u0007Undershirts and bodysuits \u0007A blanket \u0007A hat \u0007Going home outfit (appropriate for the season) \u0007An infant car seat (required to go home by car, see page 673 ) 188Pregnancy Preparing for the birthVaginal birth after caesarean Women who have had a caesarean (also known as a caesarean section or C-section) are often able to give birth to subsequent children vaginally. Approximately three in four women who prepare for a vaginal birth after a caesarean (VBAC) do give birth vaginally. Advantages and risks of VBAC There are many advantages to giving birth vaginally. There are no risks of complications from surgery, you get to hold your baby for as long as you want right after she is born, you are more mobile, and your recovery time is shorter.However, vaginal birth after caesarean does carry a very low risk of uterine rupture. If this happens, an emergency C-section will be necessary. Uterine rupture is rare, but can have very serious consequences for both mother and baby. A planned caesarean also carries the risk of complication (see Caesarean , page 235) . Decision to have a VBAC If your last baby was delivered by C-section, you may be wondering how you will bring your baby into the world this time: vaginally or by C-section?Pregnancy 189 Preparing for the birthTo help you make this decision, your doctor or midwife will assess your situation and tell you what factors could increase or decrease your chances of giving birth vaginally. When discussing this question, make sure to express your preferences and needs with respect to the options available. In some cases, vaginal birth is contraindicated and will not be recommended. Your plans may also change. For example, your decision to give birth vaginally may be re-evaluated during your pregnancy, and your healthcare provider may in the end recommend a caesarean. Conversely, if you are planning a C-section, your labour may begin before the date set for your caesarean and you and your doctor may decide that you can deliver vaginally.Preparing for a VBAC Preparing for a VBAC is no different from preparing for any other vaginal birth. For example, you can take prenatal classes or learn more about pain relief (see Techniques for coping with childbirth pain , page 211) . Having a friend or family member or doula at your side throughout labour and the birth can be helpful. Research shows that this kind of support makes delivery go more smoothly and reduces the risk of having a C-section. Also remember that you can have an epidural during labour.190Pregnancy Preparing for the birthBreech presentation If your baby is positioned with his feet or buttocks facing downward (breech), your doctor or midwife may want to attempt to turn him at around 36 or 37 weeks. This technique, known as version, is used to move the baby into a head-down position and increases your odds of having a vaginal birth. The version procedure is performed at the hospital.Your doctor or midwife will place her hands on your abdomen to try to move your baby into a head down position. Version is usually attempted after the baby's position has been verified through ultrasound . In some cases the procedure is not possible or is contraindicated, for example if there are low levels of amniotic fluid.Pregnancy 191 Preparing for the birthAfter the version procedure, a fetal non stress test (monitoring) will be done to make sure your baby tolerated the procedure without a problem. There are fewer risks associated with version than with a C-section. If your baby cannot be turned, you can discuss the possibility of attempting a vaginal birth with your doctor or midwife. Vaginal delivery of a breech baby requires a special evaluation and certain conditions must be met. Not every hospital may offer it. A caesarean will be considered in most cases of breech presentation. Talk to your healthcare provider about your options.Breech presentation Illustration: Maurice Gervais192Pregnancy Preparing for the birth Dominic MorandPregnancy 193 Preparing for the birthBirth plan When your baby is born, you will have decisions to make as parents about the treatment and care mom and baby will receive. Keep in mind that no one knows ahead of time how the birth will go, and that you may change your minds during delivery. Nonetheless, you will feel better prepared if you have taken the time during pregnancy to: Identify your wishes and concerns Share your thoughts with your partner and your family and friends Inform all the health professionals who will be assisting you, as well as anyone who will be with you at the birth, of your values, preferences, and wishes Find out about the services and features available at the hospital or birthing centre where you will have your baby There are many sample birth plans available for your use. Ask for one from your health professional or at prenatal class, or see if your hospital or birthing centre has a version they use. You can also look for sample birth plans in books or online.A birth plan is a tool that can help guide your thinking. It also lets you communicate your wishes, verbally or in writing, to health professionals and anyone else involved in the birth so they know what is important for you and your partner.194Pregnancy Preparing for the birthYour birth plan describes your ideal birth. Most births go well, but sometimes things can happen differently, for example, in the event of an emergency situation for you or your baby's health. Keep an open mind about how things may go. Deliveries are unpredictable. Be confident and remember that if you have any doubts or questions about decisions to be made, you can ask your health professionals for information. They have experience and can help you during the delivery.No matter what type of plan you choose, a good birth plan should be: Clear and short (no more than one page) Discussed with your health professional before the birth Flexible The following table can help you plan, as much as is possible, the birth of your child.Pregnancy 195 Preparing for the birthThings to think about when preparing your birth plan Topic Things to think about Support during the birth (see Having someone with you during childbirth , page 210) Who do you want to be with you during labour and at the birth? Do you want a doula to assist you? (see page 120) . If so, it is preferable to let your health professional know, Do you want to know in advance which medical staff will be present at your delivery (e.g., doctors, nurses, midwives and professionals in training)? Methods for coping with pain (see Understanding and coping with pain , page 209) What methods would you like to use during labour to cope with or relieve pain or make it more bearable? (see page 209) What kind of environment do you want during the birth? (see page 210) Do you want to use any particular techniques to help relieve pain? (see page 209) Do you want to use medication? (see page 232) Which positions would you like to try during labour (see page 215) and pushing (see page 221) ? What kind of equipment and accessories are available to you at the hospital or birthing centre?196Pregnancy Preparing for the birthTopic Things to think about Interventions during childbirth (see Possible interventions during labour , page 226) What interventions are possible during childbirth at your hospital or birthing centre (e.g., induction and stimulation of labour , fetal monitoring, epidural, episiotomy)? If you wish, ask about: - The reasons for these procedures - Their effects on you and your baby Which of these procedures do you want to have during delivery and which ones do you want to refuse? How you plan to deal with unexpected developments? Are you prepared for the possibility of a caesarean birth? (see page 235) Who would accompany you during the caesarean? First moments with your baby (see First moments with your baby , page 224) Do you want skin-to-skin contact with your baby right after giving birth? (see page 241) How do you envisage rooming-in with your baby at the hospital or birthing centre? Will it be possible to stay with your baby at all times? Is this encouraged at the hospital or birthing centre? Do you want the person who is with you to be able to stay at all times? If you are in a shared room, what measures are taken to help you room-in and enjoy private time with your baby? What are the routines and procedures at the hospital or birthing centre during your stay? Are there times where you can ask not to be disturbed so you can rest or have privacy?Pregnancy 197 Preparing for the birthTopic Things to think about Exams and interventions after the birth (see Caring for your newborn , page 243) What exams, interventions, and medications will be suggested for you and your child after the birth? If you wish, ask about - The reasons - The possible consequences - The timing of these procedures How do you want to deal with unexpected developments after your baby is born, for example, if your baby is premature and/or has to stay in hospital? (see page 245) Do you want to have access to measures that make it easier to stay with your child at all times during hospitalization? If you want to breastfeed your baby, what measures are available at the hospital or birthing centre to help you do so? Would you like to use breast milk banks? Feeding your baby (see Feeding your baby , page 366) How to you want to feed your baby Have you thought about telling your family and the professional at your hospital or birthing centre about your decision to breastfeed? Does your hospital or birthing centre have people familiar with breastfeeding who can help you if needed? If you have a premature baby or things don't go as planned, how do you feel about using commercial infant formula or supplements for your baby?198Pregnancy Preparing for the birthPreparing for the baby's arrival The arrival of a new baby brings major life changes for parents and the rest of the family. When you have a newborn, just taking a shower can become quite an adventure. For a while, you may not be able to manage your home household as you usually would.It's a good idea to get ready ahead of time, for example, by organizing child care for your other kids, making meals you can freeze, and getting used to having a less tidy house. Ask yourself who you can turn to for help: family, friends, neighbours, a community group? Are your friends and family asking what kind of gift you'd like when your baby arrives? Why not ask for ready-made frozen meals? Or request \"help coupons\" you can redeem for babysitting, meals, housework, and so on?Pregnancy 199 Preparing for the birthThink also about setting your limits. Long visits and unsolicited advice after the baby is born can be more tiring than helpful. Some parents will prefer to have peace and quiet to create a welcoming family space for the baby. Don't hesitate to accept offers of help\u2014if it's welcome, of course! There are also community groups that provide services and support to families, for example, a few hours of housework or childcare per week. Contact your CLSC to find out what is available in your area. iStockphoto Some parents will prefer to have peace and quiet to create a welcoming family space for the baby.200Pregnancy Preparing for the birthA few tips to help get ready for baby's arrival at home When you cook, prepare extra quantities you can freeze in meal-ready portions. Friends and family can also help out by offering homemade frozen meals as a gift. Get the house ready for baby's arrival. You can borrow furniture, strollers, and clothes from friends and family, for example, or buy them new or used. Community organizations providing services to families are useful resources. If people offer to lend a hand, be clear about your needs. Make a list of things that would make your life easier (e.g., helping with errands, cleaning the house, making meals, picking up your other children at daycare). If people don't offer their help, don't hesitate to ask in advance for a helping hand in the weeks after your return home. A little extra assistance can help you catch your breath and make the most of your first days and weeks with your baby. Being flexible is the best approach for dealing with the new situations you will face.Pregnancy 201 Preparing for the birth Sandra EstrelaMireille BarakatDElIVEryThe start of labour 204 The stages of childbirth 216 Possible interventions during labour 226 The first few days 240DElIVEry 204 iStockphotoThe start of labour Recognizing the start of labour 205 When should I go to the hospital or birthing centre? 208 Understanding and coping with pain 209Delivery 205 The start of labourYou will soon be bringing your baby into the world. Labour generally begins spontaneously between 37 and 42 weeks of pregnancy. Your expected delivery date is not a deadline. Even if you have not given birth after 40 weeks, there is still a good chance labour will begin on its own. However, it may be preferable to give birth before 42 weeks rather than wait until 42 weeks have passed. If there is still no sign that labour has started after 41 weeks, your doctor or midwife will discuss the available options with you. They may suggest you undergo some tests, such as monitoring, or ultrasound . The test will help determine whether you can continue to wait for labour to begin on its own or whether it is preferable to induce labour (see Inducing labour , page 227) .recognizing the start of labour No one can predict when and how your labour will begin. Most women will recognize labour because of certain telltale signs, such as contractions or their waters breaking. It's normal at that point to feel excited or anxious. Passing the mucus plug The mucus plug, which blocks the cervix during pregnancy, is made of thick, jelly-like substance sometimes tinged with blood. You may lose your mucus plug several days before you give birth or during labour. You can even lose it in several stages. If you lose your mucus plug, don't be too quick to jump to conclusions. This doesn't necessarily mean labour has started. You will need to wait for other signs. You may also lose your mucus plug without realizing it.206Delivery The start of labourContractions For most women, labour begins with uterine contractions. During contractions, your belly grows tight and hard, and you have pain that lasts at least 20 seconds (see Telling the difference between contractions and other abdominal pain , page 157) . Many women feel pain in the lower abdomen. For others, the pain is centred in the lower back and spreads to the front. Some women find the pain of contractions similar to menstrual cramps, only stronger. Every woman will experience contractions in her own way. The sensations may be different for the same woman from one pregnancy to another. Contractions during labour are regular and grow steadily stronger.Breaking of the waters (rupture of the amniotic membrane) For some women (about one in ten), the breaking of the waters (rupture of the amniotic membrane, or amniotic sac) signals the beginning of labour. The amniotic membrane is made up of two layers, which are often referred to as \"membranes.\" The membrane envelops your baby and holds the amniotic fluid that surrounds him. When it ruptures, the amniotic fluid leaks out. This is commonly known as having your \"water break\" because the liquid that leaks out is clear like water, although sometimes tinged with a bit of blood. You may only leak a few drops or it may leak enough to wet your bed or your clothes. In some cases, there may be so much liquid that it drips onto the floor.Delivery 207 The start of labourAt the end of pregnancy it can be difficult to distinguish between normal vaginal discharge and amniotic fluid (see Telling the difference between the types of discharge , page 159) . Generally with amniotic fluid, there will be enough to soak a sanitary pad. What to do When your water breaks, you should go to the hospital or birthing centre, even if you have no contractions. The staff will make sure your baby is doing well. They will also check whether your membrane did actually rupture, or if you simply have vaginal discharge, which tends to be heavier at the end of pregnancy. Labour will likely start in the hours after your water breaks. If the contractions still haven't begun or if you are a carrier of group B streptococcus (also called GBS), labour may need to be induced (see Inducing labour , page 227) . Alexandre Mallette When your water breaks, you should go to the hospital or birthing centre, even if you have no contractions.208Delivery The start of labourWhen should I go to the hospital or birthing centre? Towards the end of your pregnancy, your doctor or midwife will explain to you the right time to head to the hospital or birthing centre. This will depend on the distance you have to travel, your previous deliveries, your health, and the state of your cervix. Towards the end of your pregnancy, check with your doctor or midwife at what point you should go to the hospital or birthing centre.However you should go to your hospital or birthing centre immediately if any of the following situations occurs: For a first delivery, you are having regular contractions every five minutes or less for one hour This is not your first delivery and you are having regular contractions every five minutes or less. If you live more than 30 minutes away, you should head to the hospital or birthing centre when your contractions occur every ten minutes Your water has broken (your membrane has ruptured) You are losing blood You no longer feel your baby move (see Lack of baby movement after 26 weeks , page 155)Delivery 209 The start of labourWomen often go the hospital or birthing centre because they think they are in active labour , when in fact they are still in early labour (see Early phase or \"latent phase\" of labour , page 218) . If this happens, you will be advised to return home and come back later. This allows you to get used to the contractions at home, in a familiar environment. When labour begins or when in doubt, call your midwife or a nurse at the obstetrics department of your hospital. They will check with you to see if labour has started and answer your questions, give you advice, and tell you when to come to the birthing centre or hospital.Understanding and coping with pain The pain of labour is unique and serves a purpose. It signals the start of the opening process that will lead to the birth of your baby. This process happens gradually. A rhythm develops and the intensity of the pain steadily increases. The pain is stronger during contractions, while the period between contractions gives you time to recover. For some women the start of labour is hardest; for others the most difficult moment is when it is time to push. There are various things that can help cope with childbirth pain without using medication. Knowing what they are can help women and couples better understand the pain and prepare in advance.210Delivery The start of labourHaving someone with you during childbirth During childbirth, a woman needs to feel the presence and support of someone she knows and trusts. This can be the baby's father, the woman's partner, a member of her family, a friend, or a doula (see Doulas , page 120) . This presence will help her feel better, and reassure and encourage her during labour . As a father or partner you may feel helpless and powerless during the birth, especially since this is an extremely important time for you. What do you do when the one you love is in pain and tells you she can't take it anymore? How do you deal with all these emotions? There's no game plan that's guaranteed to work, but you should know that your presence makes a big difference. Try to adopt a positive and caring attitude and encourage your partner as much as you can.Creating a supportive environment Women who give birth need an environment where they feel calm, safe and confident. This helps them to secrete the hormones needed for labour. To create a supportive environment, you can do things like dimming the lights and reducing ambient noise as much as possible (e.g. turning down the monitors, asking people to whisper).You don't need to be an expert to be useful during delivery. Don't be afraid to try different things. Your partner will tell you what feels good. Keep supporting her and continue what you're doing if your words and actions seem to be helping.Delivery 211 The start of labourTechniques for coping with childbirth pain You can try various techniques to see what you find helpful for coping with the pain. Different things may work at different times during your labour . Movement Movement helps labour progress. During childbirth, you are encouraged to move, walk around, and squat. Find a comfortable position and don't hesitate to switch from one position to another (see Possible during labour , page 215) . Large physio balls are usually available to sit and move around on. Don't hesitate to ask for a ball if nobody offers one to you. Using water Most hospitals and birthing centres offer you the option of taking a bath or shower. Many women find that being in the water helps them cope with pain. M\u00e9lissa Bernard photographe Many women find that being in the water helps them cope with pain.212Delivery The start of labourMassage Gentle massage can help reduce anxiety and make the pain easier to bear. During contractions, some women prefer vigorous massage of painful areas or acupressure. Compresses Hot or cold compresses applied to painful areas can help reduce pain. Relaxation methods Some women learn relaxation methods such as breathing techniques, visualization, and self-hypnosis, or do yoga. You can practice these methods during your pregnancy to help yourself prepare. During labour , listening to music and creating your own bubble of calm can also be soothing.Other techniques Some birthing facilities also offer injections of sterile water beneath the skin or the use of TENS machines, which electrically stimulate painful areas. If either of these methods interests you, don't hesitate to ask your healthcare provider for more information. If you get to a point where the methods for coping with the pain are no longer working or you feel like you can't bear it any more, keep in mind that pain can often be relieved with drugs (see Pain medication , page 232) .Delivery 213 The start of labourTips for coping with childbirth pain Have someone with you\u2014the baby's father, your partner, a family member, friend, or doula. Create a warm, calm, and intimate atmosphere. Stay warm. Trust yourself and your instincts. Stay in the moment. Visualize what is happening inside of you. Move and change positions as needed (don't stay lying down)\u2014walk around between contractions. Relax. Breathe slowly. Take a shower or bath. Eat and drink as needed. Make noise. Don't hesitate to ask for whatever would make you feel better. Have someone encourage and comfort you through their words and actions. Have someone touch you, massage you, or simply hold your hand. Have someone sponge you with a wet compress.214Delivery The start of labourPositions during labour Throughout labour , you can try different positions to help dilate the cervix and help you relax between contractions. Lying flat on your back is often the least comfortable position. If you feel the need to lie down, lying on your side is often more tolerable. Whether you're standing, squatting, sitting on a physio ball, or even kneeling on all fours, keeping your upper body straight can help speed up labour. The following page shows examples of the various positions you can try during labour. Olivier Drouin Keeping your upper body straight can help speed up labour.Delivery 215 The start of labourPossible during labour Illustrations: Maurice Gervais Standing Sitting Squatting KneelingDElIVEry 216 Caroline NicolasThe stages of childbirth First stage: Thinning and opening of the cervix 217 Second stage: Descent and birth of your baby 219 Third stage: Delivery of the placenta 223 First moments with your baby 224Delivery 217 The stages of childbirth Uterus CervixMucus plug Illustrations: Maurice Gervais During pregnancy the cervix is closed and thick.At the beginning of labour the cervix has thinned (also called \"effaced\").During labour the cervix opens (dilates).At the end of the first stage of labour the cervix is fully dilated (10 cm).Throughout labour your body undergoes changes to allow your baby to make his way to the world outside. Childbirth is divided into these three main stages: First stage: Thinning and opening of the cervix (also called dilation) Second stage: Descent and birth of your baby Third stage: Delivery of the placenta It isn't possible to predict the length of each stage because it varies from one delivery to the next.First stage: Thinning and opening of the cervix The first stage of labour is the period when your contractions start to be regular. These contractions allow the cervix to thin (efface) and open completely (dilate), until it is 10 centimetres wide. Opening of the cervix218Delivery The stages of childbirthProgression of labour Early phase or \"latent phase\" of labour During the latent phase, you may have contractions without being certain what they mean. Is it the start of labour or a false alarm? At the beginning, the contractions are not very strong. You'll be able to talk during a contraction. They are often irregular and don't last very long. Try to stay calm and don't forget to sleep and eat. Feel free to take a bath or shower if you like. Take this opportunity to get accustomed to what's happening inside your body. This phase may be long or short; you'll need to be patient. It's not yet time to go to the hospital or birthing centre unless your water breaks or you no longer feel the baby moving.If your contractions become weaker or stop altogether, this is called false labour. Something is happening inside you, but it's preparatory labour that is helping to \"ripen\" the cervix. Active labour At some point, you'll feel that labour is progressing. The contractions are painful and are closer together, longer and more intense. This is the active phase of labour: the cervix has thinned (effaced) and is open (or dilated) to about 3 to 5 centimetres. The strength of the contractions gradually increases and the cervix gradually opens to 10 cm (complete dilation). The contractions are often very painful at 8 or 9 cm. They are most intense just before complete dilation at 10 cm.Delivery 219 The stages of childbirthThis phase is often compared to a storm. You may experience strong emotions or feel the need to make noise or scream. You may feel like you're losing control and that it will never end. This is normal. Try to give in to the labour , breathe, visualize your baby starting to move down inside of you and stay in contact with her (see Understanding and coping with pain , page 209) . Labour can be intense and bring strong feelings and emotions. Trust yourself and don't be afraid to ask the person with you or your healthcare team for what you need.Second stage: Descent and birth of your baby The second stage of labour begins when your baby has dropped well down into your pelvis and the cervix is fully open (dilated). The baby can now descend into your vagina to be born. Pushing When your cervix is open (dilated) to 10 cm, the sensations become different; you will probably feel the need to push. The contractions become a force within you, and all your energy is concentrated on pushing to help bring your baby into the world. You may feel the urge to push before your cervix is fully dilated. Your care team will guide you when it's time to start pushing to ensure that your pushes are more effective.220Delivery The stages of childbirthThe time between contractions can allow you to recover between pushes. You may have a bowel movement during the pushing stage. This is completely normal. It is also possible that your perineum won't have time to stretch enough as the baby comes out and it may tear. These tears usually heal well on their own after the birth. If you have an epidural, your awareness of the urge to push is lessened and may even be entirely absent at the beginning of the second stage. Awareness of the urge will come later, as your baby descends with the contractions. Normally, you can wait to push until you feel the urge to do so. Your efforts will then be more effective\u2014you'll do a better job of pushing and won't have to push as long.Pushing positions The following page shows examples of the various positions you can try during the second stage of labour . With help from the person accompanying you or the healthcare team attending the birth, find a position that works for you. Feel free to change positions when you feel the need to do so.Delivery 221 The stages of childbirthPossible pushing positions Illustrations: Maurice Gervais 222Delivery The stages of childbirthBirth of your baby The time when you push is an intense experience for you and those accompanying you. As your baby prepares to enter the outside world, the top of his head will appear, and the father or partner will be able to see the baby's hair. You can also watch your baby's progress in a mirror (mirrors are available in most birthing rooms). After the top of the head, the baby's face will appear. Another push and the baby's shoulders and rest of his body will come out.Birth of the baby Illustrations: Maurice GervaisDelivery 223 The stages of childbirthThird stage: Delivery of the placenta Your baby is born, but the delivery isn't over yet. Contractions will continue for a little while longer to deliver the placenta. After the placenta is delivered, your uterus will continue to contract to prevent hemorrhages and to regain its original shape. If you breastfeed, your baby's first few feedings will stimulate the production of oxytocin , a hormone that increases contractions of the uterus. If the contractions aren't strong enough, there is a risk of hemorrhaging. In this situation, treatment consists of massaging the abdomen at the uterus to stimulate it to contract, or giving oxytocin as a medication. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Boh\u00e9mier Usually, the father or partner will be invited to cut the umbilical cord.224Delivery The stages of childbirthIf all is well with both of you, your baby will stay on your chest, skin to skin. Ideally he will remain there for at least two hours without interruption. With both of you under a warm blanket, you can cuddle your baby as you get acquainted for the first time. At last you can marvel at his tiny face, his fists, and feet, and meet his gaze. All of this helps your baby to gently transition to life outside the uterus; skin-to-skin contact allows him to maintain his body heat and regularize his breathing and heartbeat. In addition, it makes your newborn feel safe and makes breastfeeding easier. At some point, your baby's instinct will be to nurse for both food and comfort. The care team assisting with your delivery can help you get started with breastfeeding.First moments with your baby Within moments of being born, your baby will announce his arrival with his very first sounds. He will be placed on you. The care team will dry your baby off and make sure he's doing well. If needed, they will clear the secretions out of his nose and mouth.Delivery 225 The stages of childbirthIf your condition does not allow it, skin-to-skin contact can be with the father or another significant person. If skin-to-skin contact can't be made right away, don't worry, you will have the opportunity later on and your baby will be just fine. Your baby will enjoy the warmth of your body or the comfort of being held by his father or another significant person. He will recognize the voices of his parents. Your baby will stick out his tongue, blink his eyes, breathe more quickly, move his lips, turn his head\u2014it's time to get to know one another! This is a wonderful and emotional time of discovery for all, one that marks a special period of bonding as a family. M\u00e9lissa Bernard photographe Your baby is enveloped by the warmth of your body and instinctively seeks to nurse for food and comfort.DElIVEry 226 iStockphotoPossible interventions during labour Stripping the membranes 227 Inducing labour 227 Stimulating labour 229 Monitoring the baby's health 229 Pain medication 232 Episiotomy 235 Caesarean 235Delivery 227 Possible interventions during labourStripping the membranes Toward the end of your pregnancy, your healthcare provider may suggest stripping your membranes (also called a membrane sweep). The procedure can trigger uterine contractions within a few days so you don't have to be artificially induced after 41 weeks (see Inducing labour , page 227) . A membrane sweep can be done during a vaginal exam to check the dilation and consistency of your cervix. It can be an uncomfortable, sometimes painful, procedure and may cause some spotting for the first 24 hours.Inducing labour When is labour induced? Labour will be induced if there is a medical reason to do so, e.g., a woman's water has broken (rupture of the amniotic membrane) but she is not having contractions, or the pregnancy has gone beyond 41 weeks. In other rare situations the health of the mother or baby may justify inducing labour. Talk to your health professional about the reasons for induction and its potential consequences.228Delivery Possible interventions during labourMethods used to induce labour There are several different ways to induce labour , and the method chosen will depend on many factors, like how ripe the cervix is and whether or not it is a first delivery. First the ripeness of the cervix is evaluated. If the cervix is still closed (or thick), the woman may be given hormones vaginally (via tampon, tablet, or gel) or orally (via a pill). This will soften the cervix and it will begin to thin (efface). The cervix will then open (dilate) a few centimetres. Sometimes a catheter with a small balloon attached is inserted into the cervix. The balloon can then be inflated inside the cervix to open it. These methods may sometimes cause discomfort or pain but they help prepare the cervix for the next stage of the induction process.Contractions may be induced using medication administered intravenously, orally, or through the vagina. Once the medication starts to take effect, it must usually be administered until the baby is born. It is also possible to break water (rupture the amniotic membrane) artifically. This procedure is generally no more painful than a cervical examination and does not harm the baby.Delivery 229 Possible interventions during labourStimulating labour Once labour has begun naturally, your care provider may suggest stimulating labour if your cervix is not opening (dilating) and your contractions are too far apart or not strong enough. The frequency and strength of contractions are increased using oxytocin , which is intravenously administered on a continuous basis. Once the oxytocin starts to take effect, it must usually be administered until the baby is born.Monitoring the baby's health Throughout the active phase of labour, the care team will regularly check on the baby's well being by listening to his heart with an ultrasound machine. During this phase, an ultrasound is performed every 15 to 30 minutes. Monitoring with a fetal monitor If your baby needs to be watched more closely, he will be monitored with a fetal monitor. The period of monitoring can vary in lenght depending on the situation. Monitoring may be intermittent or continuous.230Delivery Possible interventions during labourDuring monitoring, two sensors are strapped to your abdomen and connected to a machine that produces a monitoring strip. One sensor tracks your baby's heartbeat and the other records your contractions and the baby's movements. If the monitor bothers you or you would like to move around more, ask if you can take monitoring breaks to allow for more freedom of movement. The staff can explain what the pattern on the monitoring strip means. There's no need to worry if you stop hearing your baby's heartbeat. Most of the time it's because you or your baby have moved and the sensor is no longer in the right place. Tell the staff so they can readjust it. iStockphoto During monitoring, two sensors are strapped to your abdomen and connected to a machine that produces a monitoring strip.Delivery 231 Possible interventions during labourWhen and why is monitoring used? When? Why? During the last trimester To make sure your baby is doing well if You have health problems (diabetes, high blood pressure) There are concerns about your baby (reduced movement, underweight, insufficient amniotic fluid) When inducing or stimulating labour with drugsTo make sure your baby is doing well and to assess the frequency of contractions. Monitoring continues until the baby is born. During labour To make sure your baby is doing well, to monitor the frequency of contractions, and to see how your baby is handling them, if There is any doubt about your baby's well-being, or if the situation requires more in-depth evaluation or follow-up You request an epidural during labour, in which case you will probably be connected to a fetal monitor until the baby is born You are planning for a vaginal birth after a caesarean (VBAC) You have a high-risk pregnancy If you had a pregnancy without complications and you're having a normal labour, your baby's heart will be checked regularly with an ultrasound machine to make sure he's doing well. 232Delivery Possible interventions during labourPain medication In hospitals, certain drugs can be administered to ease birthing pains. The following options may be offered to you: an epidural, narcotics, nitrous oxide gas, or a pudendal nerve block. These methods are described below. Ask in advance which of these options are available at your hospital. Everyone reacts differently to medication. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask your prenatal care provider or delivery room care team.Epidural Epidural anaesthesia, often referred to as an epidural, is the most effective method for relieving childbirth pain. It involves injecting a local anaesthetic through a flexible tube (catheter) inserted between two vertebrae in the lower back. The drug numbs the nerves in the abdominal area and partially numbs the leg nerves. The epidural reduces or eliminates the pain of labour while allowing contractions to continue. However, it can diminish contractions and prevent you from moving around as freely as before. This can slow the baby's descent. If you want to have an epidural, an evaluation will first be done to ensure, among other things, that this type of anaesthesia is not contraindicated for you.Delivery 233 Possible interventions during labourGood to know ... It is best not to receive an epidural too soon, to ensure that your labour is well underway. On the other hand, you may not be able to have it in time to relieve your pain before the push. Before receiving an epidural, you will be connected to an intravenous solution (IV) that will remain in place until after the medication stops working. You will also probably be hooked up to a continuous fetal monitor, especially if you are given drugs to stimulate your contractions (see Stimulating labour , page 229).In some hospitals, you can still walk around and go to the bathroom while under an epidural. Ask your care provider. However, if you have problems urinating, you may need a urinary catheter . The effects of the epidural may make it more difficult to know how to push. This is why there may be a greater need to use vacuum extractors or forceps to deliver a baby when the mother has an epidural. Epidurals do not increase the risk of having a caesarean.234Delivery Possible interventions during labourNarcotics Narcotics are analgesics administered as injections into a muscle or vein. They decrease the sensation of pain without eliminating it completely. They are mainly used during the early phases of labour when the pain level is still low. The more the pain increases, the higher the dose needed to relieve it. The possible side effects of narcotics also increase with the dose. These drugs can make you sleepy and nauseous and affect your heart rate. The baby may also experience some of these effects. That's why narcotics are not normally used at the end of labour. Sometimes the baby requires medical monitoring for a few hours after birth until the drugs are eliminated from his system. However, these drugs have no long-term effects on the mother or baby.Nitrous oxide Nitrous oxide, also known as \"laughing gas,\" is administered through a breathing mask. It partially relieves pain during labour. Nitrous oxide can cause nausea and dizziness, but is generally well tolerated. Pudendal nerve block A pudendal nerve block is a pain medication administered just before the push. Its purpose is to reduce perineum and vaginal pain during childbirth. Using a long needle, an anaesthetic is injected into the two pudendal nerves through the vagina. You can discuss pain management options in advance with your prenatal care provider or ask your delivery room care team if you have any questions.Delivery 235 Possible interventions during labourEpisiotomy An episiotomy is a cut (incision) in the perineum that is made just as the baby is about to be delivered. It may occasionally be used in situations where the baby needs help to exit more quickly. The cut is then sutured under local anaesthesia. Episiotomies are no longer done routinely because they have been shown to increase the risk of deep tears to the perineum.caesarean The caesarean (also called caesarean section or C-section) is a type of delivery performed when the baby cannot be born through the vagina. This surgical procedure involves cutting open the mother's abdomen and uterus to remove the baby. In Qu\u00e9bec, about one in four women give birth by C-section. Reasons to have a caesarean A caesarean can be planned or unplanned, and there are several reasons why it may be performed. Here are some examples of situations where a caesarean may be necessary.236Delivery Possible interventions during labourSituations requiring planned caesareans: Certain medical problems in the mother When the placenta fully or partially covers the cervix (placenta pr\u00e6via ) Certain cases of breech presentation (see Breech presentation , page 190) A previous caesarean combined with conditions not favourable for vaginal delivery (see Vaginal birth after caesarean, page 188) Situations requiring unplanned caesareans: The baby is in a position that does not allow for a safe delivery There are concerns about the baby's health Labour has not progressed adequately, despite proper stimulation The mother has major medical problemsWhat happens during a caesarean Before the caesarean, the mother will be given an intravenous solution (IV) and fitted with a urinary catheter . Caesareans are generally done under an epidural (see Epidural, page 232) or spinal block. The spinal block is similar to the epidural, but the drug is injected into a different region of the spine. It allows for a faster anaesthesia. In both cases only the lower body is anaesthetised and the mother remains conscious. In rare cases, a general anaesthetic that puts the patient \"to sleep\" is used. Once the preparations for the caesarean are complete, the person accompanying the mother can enter the operating room and sit near her. A sheet hides the view of the belly during the operation.Delivery 237 Possible interventions during labourThe incision is usually horizontal, above the pubic hair line. Once the baby is delivered and the umbilical cord is cut, the baby is placed against the mother's skin if both baby and mother are doing well. The placenta is then removed, and the uterus and abdomen are closed with stitches or staples. Even after a caesarean, the mother will be able to start skin-to-skin contact with her baby and initiate breastfeeding. Depending on the circumstances and where the delivery took place, this could be in the operating room, the recovery room, or the hospital room (see Is breastfeeding still possible? , page 444) . If the mother is unable to start skin-to-skin contact, the father or another significant person can do so instead. Nicolas L\u00e9ger The person accompanying the mother during a caesarean delivery can enter the operating room and sit near her.238Delivery Possible interventions during labourPossible consequences of a caesarean Caesareans may have short and long-term consequences. Short-term effects of a caesarean delivery include the following: Abdominal and pelvic pains that require the use of drugs Difficulty urinating Possible difficulties with breastfeeding immediately after the caesarean due to the pain and discomfort caused by movement (see Is breastfeeding still possible? , page 444) Hospital stay sometimes longer than for a vaginal birth Longer recovery than for vaginal deliveryMost caesareans go well. However, since it is a surgical procedure, complications are possible for the mother, including infection, bleeding, thrombophlebitis , and injury to internal organs. These complications may require additional interventions and care. In the long term, the caesarean may affect future pregnancies by increasing the risk of a placental disorder such as placenta pr\u00e6via . There is also the possibility of uterine rupture during a future vaginal birth, although the risk is very low (see Vaginal birth after caesarean , page 188) . In the hours immediately after the birth, a baby born by caesarean may have a lower body temperature. Skin -to-skin contact with the mother or other parent can help improve the situation. Babies born by caesarean are also more likely to experience mild respiratory distress.Delivery 239 Possible interventions during labourRecovering from a caesarean At the hospital, you will be encouraged to gradually start walking, drinking, and eating as the effects of the anaesthesia wear off and you feel better. Moving around after a caesarean helps speed recovery and prevent complications. The pain of the incision and numbness of the skin in the surrounding area may be uncomfortable. The presence and duration of the pain and numbness vary from one woman to another. Your doctor will prescribe drugs for pain relief. The incision will heal in the weeks following childbirth. Before you leave the hospital, a health professional will tell you how to care for your wound and will give you advice for your specific situation. Don't hesitate to ask all the questions you may have. You can also read the section The body after birth, page 254 , for more information. You will also be given advice on how to care for your newborn. Usually a baby born by caesarean does not require any special care.It will take a few weeks before you can resume all your activities, such as driving, lifting heavy objects, engaging in certain physical activities and sports (see Physical activity , page 258) , or having sexual relations (see Sexuality after birth , page 263) . When to consult a health professional? After your return home, consult a health professional if you see any signs of a possible wound infection (e.g., redness, discharge). You may also find that having a caesarean triggers a range of sometimes contradictory emotions. Each experience is unique, and the way you feel after a caesarean can change over time. Don't hesitate to talk your feelings over with a professional.If you experience any of the problems listed in the red box on page 254 , see your doctor or midwife right away or go to the emergency room.DElIVEry 240 Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier DelormeThe first few days Skin-to-skin contact 241 Your stay at the hospital or birthing centre 242 When the unexpected happens 245 The body after birth 254 Baby blues 260 Depression 262 Sexuality after birth 263 Birth control 264Delivery 241 The first few daysYour baby has finally arrived. Who does she look like? Her daddy? Her mom? Maybe a distant relative? Whatever the resemblance, your baby is unique, and now it's time to get to learn all about her. Skin-to-skin contact Skin-to-skin contact with your newborn in the first hours, days, and weeks of life soothes and comforts her. Skin -to-skin contact is an excellent way to get acquainted with your baby and develop an emotional bond. Enjoy skin-to-skin contact as often as you like. Simply place your baby directly on your chest with just a diaper on and cover her in a blanket. Skin-to-skin contact with the mother's chest can make breastfeeding easier. Jos\u00e9e Brassard You can start skin-to-skin contact right after birth and continue as long as you like. Your baby will feel warm and safe snuggled up against you.242Delivery The first few daysyour stay at the hospital or birthing centre Hospital stays generally last 24 to 36 hours after vaginal delivery and 36 to 48 hours after a caesarean section. At birthing centres, the stay is usually about 24 hours. The length of your stay may vary depending on you and your baby's health. Most hospitals encourage parents to room-in with their newborn. This gives them more time to get to know their baby and get accustomed to taking care of her, with a nurse nearby if they need help or advice.Your stay at the hospital or birthing centre is a unique opportunity to get used to your baby and learn to take care of her. Make the most of it! Dominique Belley If you plan on driving home, a car seat is mandatory for your baby from the moment you leave the hospital or birthing centre (see Travelling safely: Car seats , page 673) .Delivery 243 The first few daysRooming in also lets you feed your baby on demand. If you breastfeed, those first moments together are precious for getting your milk production going (see Ways to make breastfeeding easier , page 176) . If you have visitors, make sure that they're not sick when they come to see you and that they don't have any infections, such as a cold or a cold sore (oral herpes). Many hospitals and birthing centres provide the opportunity to meet with a vaccination counsellor during your stay there. The counsellor's role is to support you with your reflection process about vaccination for your child. If you aren't given this opportunity, don't hesitate to discuss any vaccination-related questions you may have with your health professional (see Vaccination , page 616) . During your stay you must also complete the paperwork required when there is a birth.Caring for your newborn During your stay at the hospital or birthing centre, the nurses, doctors, or midwives will provide care to your baby to ensure her well-being and to prevent or screen for health problems. If you have concerns or questions about the care provided to your newborn, feel free to talk to these health professionals. Preventive care In the hours following delivery, the care team will suggest giving your newborn a vitamin K shot to prevent bleeding. Newborn bleeding is rare but can be severe and even fatal. They will also suggest that an antibiotic ointment be applied to your baby's eyes to prevent certain serious infections. Physical examination During your stay at the hospital or birthing centre, a health professional will also give your newborn a thorough physical examination to make sure she is healthy and identify any potential issues.244Delivery The first few daysBlood screening Within a few days after birth, the staff will suggest that a blood screening be done. To do so, they will take a few drops of blood from your baby's heel. The purpose of screening is to detect rare diseases that are generally not apparent at birth, but can pose serious risks to a baby's health. If a child has one of these diseases, treatment must begin as soon as possible, before symptoms appear. Early detection can help prevent or attenuate severe, permanent complications. For most children, the screening results will be normal and the parents will not be contacted. No news is good news!If the screening results are abnormal, you will be contacted and referred to a specialized centre for additional tests. If these analyses confirm a diagnosis, you will be offered appropriate monitoring and treatment for your child. For more information on screening, visit the following websites: quebec.ca/en/health/advice-and-prevention/ screening-and-carrier-testing-offer/depistage-sanguin-et- urinaire-chez-les-nouveau-nes . The first few daysWhen the unexpected happens All parents want a healthy baby. But sometimes the happy event of childbirth can take an unpredictable turn. Even under the best conditions, things may not go as planned. Having a family brings great joys, as well as its share of challenges and uncertainties.If your baby suffers from an infection, birth defect, or other health problem she may require hospitalization after birth or in the days that follow. This comes as a shock to parents who must learn to live with this new reality and adjust to a role different from the one they imagined. The birth may also occur before the date scheduled. Babies are considered premature when birth takes place before 37 weeks of pregnancy. A premature baby may require some of the special care presented in the table on page 246 .246Delivery The first few daysCare of premature babies Time of birth Care Before 34 weeks Transfer to a neonatal intensive care ward in a hospital that has one. Your baby may Receive phototherapy (exposure to light in an incubator) if she has jaundice Be placed in an incubator to keep her warm Receive intravenous solution (IV) Receive help breathing Receive help feeding 34 to 37 weeks Extra care, but less of it.Your baby may Receive help feeding Receive phototherapy (exposure to light or a cradle) if she has jaundice Receive help breathing (only in rare cases)Delivery 247 The first few daysSome suggestions for getting through these difficult moments You may feel guilty or helpless if your baby is hospitalized for a complication such as premature birth, infection, birth defect (whether discovered before or after birth) or another health problem. Here are a few suggestions to help you through these difficult times. Ask questions Don't be afraid to ask questions about your baby's health and the care and treatment she's receiving. If you have concerns about certain aspects or her care or treatment, ask if other options are available. She's your baby and you are entitled to have a say in decisions affecting her. It is the responsibility of members of the care team to keep you informed. However, time constraints sometimes make it hard to have these conversations. Ask them when is the best time to talk and find out when the doctor usually visits.Ask for help and support If possible, ask your family and loved ones to help you by taking care of the house, minding your other children, or taking turns being with your baby. You may not always be able to be at the hospital, especially if you have other children. In the case of a prolonged hospital stay, it's essential that you get enough rest to stay healthy and to be able to care for your baby when she arrives or returns home. Remember that your child will need you not only during the hospitalization but afterwards as well. Don't hesitate to ask for psychological help if you feel you need it. Specialized care teams often include social workers and psychologists that can support you.Don't hesitate to ask your child's care team any questions you may have.248Delivery The first few daysFind out about the resources available The specialized care team at the hospital can advise about help you can receive at home. You can also request a follow-up with your CLSC when your child is discharged from the hospital. It's important not to neglect the post -hospitalization period, which may also be difficult for some parents. If your baby has a particular health problem, check if there are resources for parents of children with the same problem. The help of other parents who face similar challenges can be useful. The following website lists many resources available across Qu\u00e9bec: laccompagnateur.org . There is also an association to support parents of premature infants: Pr\u00e9ma-Qu\u00e9bec 1-888-651-4909 / 450-651-4909 premaquebec.ca/enA few suggestions for making a hospital stay easier Many parents want to be with their baby when she is hospitalized. Sometimes, the father and mother take turns staying with their baby during the day when they are able, or may want to spend the night. Check with your hospital about the options available. For example, you can ask if the hospital has a room where you can room-in with your baby if you want to. Keep in mind, however, that some hospitals may have space constraints that make staying with your baby difficult.Delivery 249 The first few daysHave physical contact with your baby in an incubator Don't hesitate to ask for help with touching your baby in the incubator or with holding her in your arms or skin -to-ski n under a blanket. Your baby will feel your presence and this will help her. If you can't take her out of the incubator, ask if you can put a scarf or piece of clothing that smells of you in beside her. Breastfeed your hospitalized baby Even if she is hospitalized, your baby may be able to nurse and take in part or all of the milk she needs. If you want to breastfeed, but your baby is not yet able to suck, it is important to stimulate your breasts in the hours after birth to get your milk production going (see Ways to make breastfeeding easier , page 176) . iStockphoto Don't hesitate to ask for help with touching your baby in the incubator or holding her in your arms or skin -to-skin under a blanket.250Delivery The first few daysExpress your milk until your baby can breastfeed on her own. Your milk can be refrigerated or frozen until she is ready for it. When you give her the milk, extra minerals or calories may be added to it if your baby needs them. You can ask for help expressing your milk. Breast pumps are often available in intensive care wards. Don't be discouraged if you get only a few drops the first few times. Your breasts need regular stimulation to produce what your baby needs. Don't forget that your baby has a tiny stomach and only needs a few drops of milk when first starting to breastfeed. Having a photo of your baby, being close to her, or making skin-to-skin contact for a few minutes beforehand can help you express more milk. If you hadn't planned to breastfeed, it's not too late to think about it.Ask about hospital visits Some hospitals may allow visits by your other children or your loved ones. Make sure your visitors aren't sick when they come to see your baby and that they don't have any infections, such as a cold or a cold sore (oral herpes). Even an ordinary cold can be serious for your newborn. It can be a good idea to talk with your other children about what's going on. The baby's siblings also have feelings and concerns about the baby's health. For example, you may wish to reassure them that what's happening with the baby is not their fault. Slightly older siblings often believe that their feelings of jealousy toward the new baby have caused the complications. You can get them involved in caring for the newborn whenever possible.Delivery 251 The first few daysDeath of a newborn child The loss of a baby is always an ordeal for the parents and family. It is very rare for a baby to die before birth or in the first few days of life. The cause is usually extreme premature birth or birth defects . When a baby dies during pregnancy, it is often recommended that the mother have a natural or induced vaginal delivery. After the delivery, it can be particularly difficult for her if she starts producing milk or has bloody discharge. These signs often act as reminders of the loss of the baby.Grieving the loss of a baby At the hospital some parents may ask to hold their baby in their arms, to dress her, or take photos. Doing so can help with the grieving process. An autopsy may be performed to determine the cause of death. Various funeral options (e.g., cremation, burial) are usually suggested. Back home it's normal to experience feelings of shock, outrage, confusion, and sadness. The intensity and duration of these emotions will vary from person to person, as will and the amount of time needed to recover. The different phases of grief may overlap, and don't always come in the same order. Also, the two parents often do not mourn in the same way or at the same pace.252Delivery The first few daysSupport resources Parents who have experienced the death of a newborn say that the presence and support of their loved ones helped them through the ordeal. There are also support groups for parents who have lost a child. These groups can provide valuable assistance to parents as they go through the mourning period and allow them to share their experience with other bereaved parents. Parents can also see a health professional (e.g., psychologist, social worker) for counselling, either individually or as a couple.Consult your CLSC to find out about services offered there or other services in your area.

Be patient\u2014it's normal. It will take several weeks to get to a good level of energy. Back home, if you see signs that worry you, don't hesitate to contact the CLSC nurse or Info-Sant\u00e9 ( 8-1-1 ). You can also consult your doctor or midwife. The following pages provide information about the body after childbirth and about post-delivery care for both vaginal and caesarean deliveries.After you return home, see a doctor or your midwife right away or go to the emergency room if You show signs of hemorrhaging - You soak one regular sanitary pad an hour for two consecutive hours or - You lose large blood clots (e.g., more than one egg-sized clot) You have a fever\u2014temperature of 38.0\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) or higher You have severe abdominal pain not relieved by analgesics You have difficulty breathing You have a new pain in your leg with swelling You have severe headaches, upper abdominal pain, or a sudden change in vision Call 9-1-1 if you show signs of shock: agitation, weakness, paleness, cold and damp skin, sweating, confusion, palpitations.Delivery 255 The first few daysContractions You may feel uterine contractions, especially while you are breastfeeding. If this isn't your first pregnancy, you may experience more contractions than during previous pregnancies. If you need relief from the pain, contact your health professional. Blood loss After giving birth vaginally or by caesarean section, it is normal to experience blood loss, known as lochia. For the first day or two, your blood loss will be heavier than during menstruation and will then diminish. If your bleeding increases instead of diminishing, consult your healthcare provider. Occasionally you may pass a blood clot. This happens generally in the morning after urinating or breastfeeding. So long as the bleeding lessens after passage of the clot there is no need to worry. Be aware that unusual physical effort may cause redder and more abundant lochia. See the box on page 254 to know when to see a health professional.As the days go by, the colour and texture of the lost blood will change. It may be mixed with mucus (a whitish substance). The colour will gradually change from pink to brown, becoming paler, and it could turn yellow. Lochia discharge usually last three to six weeks. During this time, use sanitary pads. Do not use tampons or a menstrual cup. Hygiene Hygiene is very important after giving birth. Here are a few helpful tips: Change your sanitary pad at least every 4 hours. Always wipe from front to back. Wash your hands after using the toilet. Wash yourself once a day or more, but do not use a vaginal douche. If you had a vaginal birth, you can shower or take a bath in a clean tub at any time, but don't use oil or bubble bath.256Delivery The first few daysIf you had a caesarean delivery, you can shower at any time. You can have a bath starting around five days after the procedure, as long as the incision is healing well. Stitches Don't worry if you have stitches in your perineum : they will not tear when you have a bowel movement. After showering or bathing, gently dry the stitches before you get dressed. If you had a caesarean delivery, it is important to dry the stitches on your belly thoroughly with a clean towel after taking a shower or bath. After seven days, you can remove any adhesive strips that have not come off by themselves. If you see any signs of possible infection (e.g., redness, discharge), see your healthcare provider. Bowel movements It is normal not to have a bowel movement in the first two to three days after vaginal delivery and three to five days after a caesarean.However, if you still haven't had a bowel movement after this period, you may be constipated. Constipation is common after both vaginal and caesarean deliveries. These tips can help: Gradually increase your intake of high fibre foods: - Whole grain foods - Vegetables and fruits (fresh, dried, frozen, or canned) - Legumes and nuts Increase your daily water intake. Go to the bathroom as soon as you feel the need. Gradually resume low-intensity physical activity when you feel able to do so (see Physical activity , page 258) . If these measures aren't enough, ask a health professional whether a laxative might help.Delivery 257 The first few daysUrine After the delivery, you may feel a burning sensation when urinating. If you do, try spraying your vulva with warm water while you urinate. It's also normal in the first few days after delivery to have trouble retaining urine. Urine leakage may continue for a few weeks after you give birth. If this annoyance persists, mention it to your doctor during a follow-up visit. The perineum and pelvic floor Seen from the exterior, the perineum is the part of the body located between the vulva and the anus (see Female anatomy , page 26) . Inside, the muscles of the perineum form a \"hammock\"\u2014the pelvic floor. The muscles of the pelvic floor support your internal organs, including the uterus, bladder, and rectum. Among other things, the perineum helps prevent leakage of urine and feces.During pregnancy and childbirth, the perineum adapts to facilitate the birth. After the baby is born, the pelvic floor muscles are stretched. It is also normal that the vulva looks different, e.g., the labia are more open. After a vaginal birth, the perineum may remain sensitive for a while. In some cases, it may also be sensitive after a caesarean. It can take several weeks or months before the pelvic floor muscles regain their muscle tone. Exercises such as Kegel exercises can help. It's advisable to talk to your healthcare provider to find out when to start doing these exercises and how to do them properly. If you have urine leakage, pain during sexual relations, or any other concerns, don't hesitate to talk to your healthcare provider. If necessary, he or she can give you advice about specialized perineal rehabilitation resources (e.g., physiotherapists).258Delivery The first few daysFatigue It's normal to be tired after a vaginal or caesarean delivery. It takes a few weeks to get to a good level of energy. Be patient\u2014your body needs time to recover. Recovery speed and energy levels vary from day to day and from one woman to another depending on things like the baby's demands, the mother's quality of sleep, and the help she has available. Despite your newborn's needs, try to take care of yourself. If possible, try to sleep when your baby does. Don't hesitate to ask for help when you need it. All new mothers need rest and a helping hand to recover from the demands of childbirth.Physical activity Pregnancy and childbirth bring about major physical changes that can last for months after your baby is born. Resuming physical activity little by little can help improve your energy level and physical fitness. It can also contribute to your psychological well-being. When your pain is gone and you feel up to it, you can gradually resume low intensity activities such as walking. For example, you could start with one daily walk and gradually work up to a few short walks per day. You can increase their frequency and length bit by bit, depending on your energy and tolerance level. Around four to six weeks after giving birth, you can gradually start increasing the intensity of your activities (e.g., take brisk walks). Choose activities you enjoy while paying attention to how your body has recovered since giving birth.Delivery 259 The first few daysIt's usually recommended that you wait until your perineum has regained its muscle tone (see The perineum and pelvic floor , page 257) before you move on to high intensity or high impact exercise like running. This can take from a few weeks to several months after childbirth. As for swimming, you can usually start again once your lochia discharge (see Blood loss , page 255) becomes less abundant. It is advisable to talk to your healthcare provider before you resume swimming. If you had any complications during your delivery, it may also be wise to check with your healthcare provider before you start exercising again.Listen to your body and its limits. They may not be the same as they were before your pregnancy.Weight Some of the weight gained during pregnancy is lost with the delivery of the baby and placenta and the release of amniotic fluid. In the six weeks that follow, the uterus returns to its normal size. Blood volume and swelling also decrease, leading to further loss of weight. After that, your body will gradually use up the fat reserves it accumulated during pregnancy. The pace of weight loss can differ from one woman and one pregnancy to the next. Be patient! It takes time to shed the weight you gained over nine months. With a balanced diet (see Eating well , page 77) and an active lifestyle (see Physical activity , page 258) , losing 1 to 2 kg (2 to 4 lb.) a month is reasonable.260Delivery The first few daysGoing on a weight-loss diet is not recommended, especially if you breastfeed. A low-calorie diet can diminish your milk production and energy level. Pregnancy transforms a woman's body. Even if the weight gained can be lost within a few months, you may not get your pre-pregnancy silhouette back. Give yourself time to accept these changes and don't hesitate to talk about them with people you trust.Baby blues After the birth of your baby it's normal to have mood swings and to cry more than usual. Many new moms experience the baby blues for a short period of time. The baby blues follow the birth of the baby and can last from a few days to approximatively two weeks. Hormonal changes and fatigue are largely responsible for this temporary depression.Delivery 261 The first few daysHere are few tips to help you feel better during this time: Get your family and friends to help out a little more. Allow yourself to take a break or nap. Talk about how you feel. Take care of yourself. Talk to other parents. Enjoy skin-to-skin contact with your baby. Let the tears flow without trying to resist or worry too much about the cause\u2014it's perfectly normal! If your baby blues last for more than two weeks or if you feel more and more sad or irritable, you may be experiencing depression. You can contact Info-Sant\u00e9 or Info-Social at any time by calling 8-1-1 . iStockphoto Hormonal changes and fatigue are largely responsible for baby blues.262Delivery The first few daysDepression After the birth of a child, new mothers and fathers sometimes go through a depressive episode. Women and men often experience depression differently. Depression in women About two in ten women experience depression after childbirth. Women suffering from depression usually experience sadness or a general loss of interest and overall pleasure in daily activities. They can also show some of the following signs: A decrease or increase in appetite A sleep disorder (sleeping too much, difficulty sleeping, or inability to sleep, even when baby is sleeping) Agitation or psychomotor impairment (e.g., slowed speech) Fatigue or loss of energy Excessive anxiety and irritability Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt (e.g., the impression of not being a good parent or not being able to establish an emotional bond with the baby) Difficulty developing a sense of attachment, feelings of ambivalence or disinterest toward the child Difficulty concentrating or indecisiveness Thoughts of death or suicidal ideas Some of these signs can be confused with normal changes that occur after the birth of a child (e.g., fatigue from lack of sleep due to caring for the baby). Unlike the baby blues, which is temporary, the changes in behaviour and mood associated with depression are present almost every day for at least two weeks.Delivery 263 The first few daysDepression in men As many as one in ten men may suffer from depression after their baby is born. Men experience the same feelings as women but may express their distress differently. For example, they may be more aggressive or irritable, have mood swings, or feel physical discomfort such as stomach aches, headaches, or difficulty breathing. Some men may also show hyperactive behaviour (escaping into work or sports for long hours) or excess consumption of alcohol or drugs. Seeking support Treatments exist for depression. If you have noticed these changes in yourself or your partner, consult a health professional. You can also contact your local CLSC or a psychologist, or call Info-Social at 8-1-1 .Sexuality after birth Some people feel less sexual desire after the birth of the baby. Fatigue, the adaptation to parenthood, the time and energy invested in caring for the baby, physical or emotional complications, and hormonal changes can all lead to a decreased interest in sexual activity. After the birth of a child, the time available for intimacy can also be limited. Many partners aren't sure when to resume sexual activity after the delivery. If there are no medical reasons to put it off, partners can engage in sexual activity without fear when they feel like it.264Delivery The first few daysWhile breastfeeding, the body releases hormones that can prevent the vagina from producing sufficient lubrication. If that happens, you can use a lubricant to facilitate genital fondling and penetration. Choose a water-based lubricant if you use a condom. Don't pressure yourself. Adapt your sex life to your new reality.The timing for resuming sexual activity with penetration will vary depending on you and your partners' individual needs and preferences.Birth control During your pregnancy, start thinking about what kind of birth control you will use after the baby arrives. You can still get pregnant even if you haven't had your period yet. Ovulation can occur as soon as the third week after vaginal or caesarean delivery. Use an effective birth control method to prevent an unplanned pregnancy. Breastfeeding and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) If you breastfeed exclusively, ovulation may be delayed. To use breastfeeding (lactation) as a birth control method, you have to understand the principle behind the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM).Delivery 265 The first few daysTo be effective, LAM requires the following conditions: Your baby is less than six months old. You breastfeed exclusively (no commercial infant formulas, food, or water is given to the baby) - Breastfeeding is on demand and not according to a set schedule (see Breastfeeding on demand or often enough to meet baby's needs , page 177) . For LAM, feedings should be no more than four hours apart during the day, and six hours apart at night. You haven't had any bleeding or started having your period again. Before using LAM or another natural method of birth control (e.g., Billings or symptothermal), it's a good idea to contact the Serena organization for further information and support. Serena Organization promoting natural family planning methods 514-273-7531 / 1-866-273-7362 serena.caYou can also visit the following website: World Alliance for Breastfeeding Action (WABA) waba.org.my/resources/lam Birth control methods Your choice of a birth control method depends on your preference and your personal situation, which should be assessed with your health professional. This assessment can be done at the end of pregnancy or before you leave the hospital or birthing centre. The table on page 266 describes the birth control methods available.266Delivery The first few daysBirth control methods Method When you can start if you have no contraindications Hormonal IUD (Kyleena \u00ae, Mirena \u00ae) Any time after giving birth, depending on your state of health Copper IUD Any time after giving birth, depending on your state of health Contraceptive injection (Depo-Provera \u00ae) Any time after giving birth Progestin-only pill (Micronor \u00ae) Any time after giving birth Combined hormonal contraceptives that contain estrogen and progestin: Pills Contraceptive patch Contraceptive vaginal ring 6 weeks after giving birth Depending on your situation, your healthcare provider may recommend you start three to four weeks after giving birth Diaphragm Cervical cap6 weeks after giving birth Condom From the start of sexual relationsDelivery 267 The first few daysIUDs, contraceptive injections, the progestin-only pill (Micronor \u00ae), and combined hormonal contraceptives are the most effective types of birth control. Don't stop your current birth control method before starting another. To avoid unprotected sex, keep a supply of condoms handy. The withdrawal method, or coitus interruptus, and the calendar method are not effective. Learn about birth control methods by visiting the website prepared by the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada sexandu.ca .Possible effects of hormonal contraceptives on milk production Hormonal contraceptives do not affect the quality of your milk or the health of your baby. However, if you use a combined hormonal contraceptive and you are breastfeeding, it's possible you will experience a slight drop in milk production. If this happens, contact a lactation consultant, your midwife, your doctor, or a CLSC nurse. If you use a hormonal IUD, contraceptive injection, or progestin-only pill, it is unlikely that any of these methods will affect your breastfeeding. If you do notice a problem, contact a lactation consultant, your midwife, your doctor, or a CLSC nurse.268Delivery The first few daysEmergency contraception If you have had unprotected or poorly protected sex, there are emergency contraception methods you can use. Emergency oral contraception (EOC; the morning after pill) This method works up to five days after unprotected or poorly protected sex, at any time after a vaginal delivery or a caesarean, whether or not you're breastfeeding. The sooner it is taken after poorly protected or unprotected sex, the more effective it is. You can get it from a pharmacist without a doctor's prescription. If you're breastfeeding, be sure to mention it to the pharmacist or doctor. They can prescribe an EOC that you can take while you're breastfeeding.Copper IUD Provided it is not contraindicated for you, your doctor can insert a copper IUD up to 7 days after unprotected or poorly protected sex.Delivery 269 The first few days Odile Ste-MarieDominique BelleyBAByThe newborn 272 Talking with your baby 280 Sleep 294 your child's development 310BABy 272The newborn Fetal position 273 Size and weight 273 Skin 273 Eyes 274 Head 274 Swollen breasts 276 Genitals 276 Spots 277 Sneezing 277 Hiccups 277 The need for warmth 277 Urine 278 Stools 279 Genevi\u00e8ve HamelBaby 273 The newbornFetal position During his first few weeks of life, your baby will often take up the same position he did in your belly. We call this the fetal position. Size and weight Babies born from 37 to 42 weeks of pregnancy are said to be full-term. They usually measure 45 to 55 centimetres (18 to 21 inches) and weigh 2,500 to 4,300 grams (5.5 to 9.5 lb.). It's normal for a baby to lose up to 10% of his weight in the first few days of life. He eliminates his meconium and first stools. He also loses water because he was immersed in liquid throughout the pregnancy. And he's only drinking a little milk at a time. If born at term and in good health, he will be back up to his birth weight 10 to 14 days after birth.Skin A newborn's skin colour can vary from pink to dark red. His hands and feet are sometimes paler and may stay blueish for up to 48 hours. The skin may also be mottled. This is due to cold - your baby is still learning to control his own temperature. In most cases, the mottling disappears once your baby is in a warm place. The skin is usually smooth, soft and transparent in places. It may wrinkle and peel, especially on the hands and feet. It is sensitive to heat and cold. At birth it may be covered with a whitish coating, which will be absorbed in a few hours or days. Some babies, even premature ones, can also have skin covered with a fine down, which goes away after a few weeks.274Baby The newbornEyes The eyes of white-skinned newborns are blue-grey or slate blue. Darker-skinned babies often have dark eyes at birth. The eyes usually adopt their permanent colour at about 3 months old but may change up to 1 year. Newborns usually cry without tears, which appear at 1 or 2 months.Head Your baby has a delicate neck, but should be able to turn it sideways easily. If he has trouble moving it and it seems to hurt, he may have a stiff neck. If the stiffness persists, get advice from a health professional. Pressure during labour and delivery sometimes deforms your baby's head. It will regain its round shape in a few weeks. The bones of the skull are not yet knitted. They are attached by a diamond-shaped membrane, the anterior fontanel. Baby 275 The newbornLocated on top of the head, the anterior fontanel is supple to the touch and forms a small depression when your child is sitting. You can sometimes see it beating with the heart. A smaller triangular fontanel is located on the back of the head. Fontanels are the most fragile areas of the head, but you can safely wash them and touch them gently. The bones of the skull will knit between 9 and 18 months, and the fontanels disappear. A bump or swelling containing blood and/or other liquid may be visible beneath the scalp. It will cause the brain no harm and disappear without a trace, usually in a few days. Mathieu Lachance The baby's head is large and heavy. It needs to be supported when you pick him up.276Baby The newbornSwollen breasts Both boy and girl babies may have swollen breasts, which may even produce a little milk. Do not try to release any milk. Everything will take care of itself in a few days. Genitals In girls the labia minora are swollen for 2 or 3 days after birth. There may be a whitish deposit between the lips of the vulva. Don't clean it off - it is excellent protection against bacteria. During the first week, a few drops of blood may drip from the vagina. Don't worry; this mini-menstruation is caused by extra hormones coming from the mother before birth.In full-term boys , the testicles have usually descended into the scrotum, which is purplish red. If they haven't, tell the doctor. The foreskin is the skin covering the head of the penis. Don't try to force this skin to move. It would be painful and might injure your child. Leave it to nature - in 90% of boys it will dilate and descend naturally at about 3 years old. In only a few cases, this won't happen until adolescence. Circumcision is an operation in which all or part of the foreskin is removed. It is not recommended because it serves no purpose. Some parents call for circumcision for religious or cultural reasons.Baby 277 The newbornSpots The newborn may have small red spots between the eyes, on the eyelids or along the back edge of the scalp. They turn white when touched under slight pressure, and become more visible when your baby cries. They will disappear during the first year. Babies sometimes have bluish spots on the buttocks or back, which should be gone by the age of 3. Other marks are permanent. Sneezing It's normal for your baby to sneeze often. Because the hair inside his nose hasn't grown enough, he may sneeze up to 12 times a day to eliminate secretions that interfere with his breathing. It's not because he has a cold.Hiccups Your baby may also get the hiccups, especially after feeding. This isn't serious. It won't hurt him and the hiccups stop by themselves in a few minutes. Putting him back on the breast may also end his hiccups. The need for warmth Newborns need warmth but not too much. They shouldn't perspire. If the room temperature is comfortable for you, it is for him too. A temperature between 20\u00b0C (68\u00b0F) and 22\u00b0C (72\u00b0F) is perfect. Use light blankets; add and remove them according to the temperature. Don't wrap him up too much.278Baby The newbornUrine A baby who is drinking enough will urinate regularly (see Is your baby drinking enough milk? , page 370) . His urine is pale yellow and has no detectable smell. During the first week of life, he will urinate more and more often. By day 5, he will be wetting at least 6 diapers a day. During the first couple of days, you may notice orange spots (urate crystals) in your baby's diaper. These crystals are normal and not dangerous. But if they are still present two days after birth, it may be a sign that your baby is not drinking enough. If you are still seeing orange spots in your baby's diaper after a week, consult a doctor. Is your baby urinating less often than usual? Does his urine look darker and have a distinct smell? It may be because he's very hot or overdressed and is a little dehydrated.What to do \u00b7 Remove a layer or two of clothing. \u00b7 If he is breastfeeding, increase the number of feedings. \u00b7 If you're using a commercial baby formula, make sure it is prepared correctly, because a mistake during mixing (dilution error) can result in dehydration (see Handling commercial infant formula , page 402) . Make sure he is drinking enough milk. You can then give him a little water in between feedings. If the situation persists, call Info-Sant\u00e9 ( 8-1-1 ) or consult a health professional. A baby with a fever may also have darker urine that has a smell. You may need to check his temperature (see Fever , page 642) .Baby 279 The newbornStools During the first 2 or 3 days, your baby will eliminate the residue remaining in his intestines from before he was born. The stools will be very dark and sticky: this is meconium. Afterwards, the stools will be yellowish, greenish or brownish. If your baby is drinking enough (see Is your baby drinking enough milk? , page 370) , his stools will be liquid or very soft. During the first 4 to 6 weeks, your baby may have 3 to 10 bowel movements per day. If your baby doesn't have at least one bowel movement per day, he might not be drinking enough.After 4 to 6 weeks, some babies fed with breast milk will have fewer bowel movements even if they are drinking enough (e.g., one bowel movement every 3 to 7 days). If your baby is defecating infrequently but the stools remain soft, it is not a problem. During the first year, the frequency, consistency, and colour of the stools will vary depending on what your baby is fed. You will gradually learn to recognize your child's normal stools. If your baby's stools suddenly change from soft to liquid, it may be a sign of a transient trouble. If your baby is healthy, continue to feed him normally. If you think he is sick, call Info-Sant\u00e9 ( 8-1-1 ) or consult a health professional. See your doctor if your baby's stools are red or black because this may indicate blood. If the baby's stool is discoloured (white, grey, or beige), consult a physician promptly because it could be a sign of a serious liver problem.BABy 280 H\u00e9l\u00e8ne BouffardTalking with your baby Crying 282 The need to suck 288 Touch 289 Taste and smell 291 Hearing 292 Eyesight 293Baby 281 Talking with your babyYour baby starts \"talking\" to you from birth onward. She cries, moans, babbles, wriggles and sometimes sucks intensely. By paying attention to all this, you are communicating with your baby. You can also talk to her with loving words; tell her what you are doing as you take care of her. She will feel safe and secure just at the sound of your calming words. Your baby will listen more than talk during her first two years of life. This is normal because her brain is still developing. She is absorbing what she hears. She will learn to talk by repeating the sounds and words that she hears. Genevi\u00e8ve Rondeau She feels safe and happy when she hears your voice.282Baby Talking with your babycrying Babies can't communicate with words, so they use crying as one way of expressing themselves. All babies cry and it's normal. Some cry more than others. Crying tends to increase starting in the second week of life. It reaches a peak around the sixth week and usually decreases by the third or fourth month. It can be hard to understand why a newborn is crying. By spending time with her, you will learn to recognize what her different cries mean. For example, you'll know if she is hungry or tired, needs to burp, needs affection, wants your attention, or has a dirty diaper. You will also learn how to soothe your baby's crying. Her reactions will help you understand what makes her feel better and what she doesn't like.Sometimes, despite your efforts, you won't understand why your baby is crying. When that happens, stay with her and try to remain calm. This will teach her that she can trust you. During her first nine months, your baby doesn't have any sense of time. She needs you to respond quickly when she cries. Comforting a baby when she cries will not spoil her. It teaches her that you are attentive to her needs. She will feel loved. That said, even if your baby cries, she can be put down in a safe place if you need a bit of time to yourself.Baby 283 Talking with your babyExcessive crying (colic) All babies can cry heavily at times, whether they are full-term or premature, breastfed or bottle-fed, or boy or girl. Some babies cry for more than three hours a day, especially at the end of the day, and seem inconsolable. During a crying spell, your baby may appear to be in pain: her face is red, her fists are clenched, and her legs are curled up on her tight belly. She may have gas because when babies cry, they swallow air. These episodes of excessive crying, often called colic, are completely normal. They are rarely associated with a health problem and have no long-term consequences for the baby.What to do Make sure your baby's needs are being met and that she isn't exhibiting any other concerning signs (see the red box, page 285 ). You can try different techniques to help soothe your baby: Find a calm area and turn down the lights. Put on soft music, some background noise, or speak softly to her. Massage, caress, or touch her, for example by placing her on your stomach with her skin against yours, in a warm place. Offer your breast. Many babies calm down while sucking at the breast: it can satisfy their hunger and be a source of comfort. Move her around, rock her, take her for a walk in a stroller or infant carrier, or take her for a car ride Give her a bath. Some babies find water soothing. Place your baby face down on your forearm with her back against your belly, her head in the crook of your elbow, and your hand between her legs. Often babies find this position soothing.284Baby Talking with your babyKeep in mind that if the method you use to soothe your baby works once, it may not work the next time. If you've tried these various techniques for several days and nothing is working, or if you have any concerns, do not hesitate to consult a health professional. He or she can reassure you about your baby's health and suggest other options if necessary. Medication and natural health products for \"colic\" are usually not recommended. Jean-Claude Mercier This is a soothing position for your baby.Baby 285 Talking with your babyIf your baby is inconsolable Bouts of excessive crying is hard on the whole family. It's normal to feel perplexed, helpless, irritated, or even frustrated. When you are feeling tired or impatient, it's good to have someone you can trust who can give you a hand. You can ask someone to look after the baby for you so you can rest. When you come back, you will be able to pass along your sense of calm.In general, excessive crying is only something to be concerned about if it is accompanied by other signs. For example, you should see a health care professional if, in addition to being inconsolable, your baby Behaves differently Won't eat or sleep Has a fever (see Fever , page 642) Is vomiting or has abnormal stools (see Stools , page 279) May have been injured Is showing other signs that worry you286Baby Talking with your babyAre you feeling overwhelmed and have no one to replace you? Put your baby in a safe place, like her crib, close the door and leave the room for a few minutes. It's normal to need a break. Check on your baby every ten minutes to make sure she is still safe, but don't pick her up again until you have calmed down. Don't be afraid to seek help from a babysitter, relative, doctor, CLSC, or volunteer centre. You can also phone the LigneParents help line, at 1-800-361-5085 . Never shake an infant or young child: shaking can cause permanent brain damage or even death. Put her down and get help. Breath-holding spells Starting at 6 months of age, some babies may cry until they stop breathing for several seconds and briefly lose consciousness. They may turn blue or pale. An episode like this is called a breath-holding spell. Babies do this unintentionally when they are experiencing something unpleasant. It's normal to be worried if this happens, but don't worry: your child's health is not in danger. Remain calm, stay with your baby, and reassure her. She will quickly start breathing again on her own. However, if a breath-holding spell occurs before the age of 6 months or lasts for more than one minute, it's a good idea to talk to her doctor.Baby 287 Talking with your baby Karine Henry288Baby Talking with your babyThe need to suck All newborns have the reflex to suck. Sucking the breast is natural and ideal for your baby. It is more satisfying than any replacement. Not all newborns need a pacifier (soother). Many are content with the breast. If your baby sucks her thumb or fingers, encourage her to change this habit as soon as possible: try a pacifier because it's easier to control. Your baby may occasionally need her pacifier for comfort but she should not have it in her mouth all the time. Gently remove the pacifier when it's no longer needed, to avoid creating a habit. A pacifier can act as a gag. Don't be too quick to use it to calm your baby. She is trying to tell you something through her cries. Be attentive to find out what she really needs.Sucking her thumb, fingers or pacifier can sometimes change the position of her teeth. Around the age of 2 or 3, help her gradually give up this habit. It's important she stop before her first adult teeth come in. The dentist or dental hygienist can give you advice. Sucking a pacifier can sometimes affect your child's pronunciation. A child who talks with a pacifier in her mouth is hard to understand and she will not learn to express herself properly. To attach a pacifier to clothing, use the clips designed for this purpose. Never use a string to attach the pacifier to the crib or around your baby's neck or wrist. The string could strangle your baby. Don't use a safety pin to attach the pacifier to your baby's clothing as she could injure herself. Baby 289 Talking with your babyChoosing a pacifier If your baby needs a pacifier, choose one for her age. There are several silicone and latex models. If your baby uses her pacifier for chewing, give her a teething ring instead. The pacifier disk must remain outside her mouth. If the baby chews it, it could break and she could swallow the pieces and choke. Cleaning the pacifier Before using a new pacifier, disinfect it according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Each time your baby asks for it, wash it in hot, soapy water and rinse it. Do not put it in your mouth; you may give her cavity causing bacteria. Pull on the disk to make sure it is properly attached to the nipple. This safety precaution is important, especially when your baby has teeth.Check the condition of the nipple regularly. It must be very flexible. If it has changed colour or shape, is sticky or cracked, throw it out immediately. Recommended by Health Canada Health Canada suggests you replace pacifiers after two months of use, no matter their condition. Touch Touch is the first sense a baby develops while in the uterus, from rubbing against the walls of the uterus or from feeling you stroke your belly to make contact. For newborns, feeding time is a comforting, reassuring, and special time you spend together. Touch fulfills a need that is as important as drinking and eating.290Baby Talking with your babyTouch is a form of communication newborns seek. Holding her against your chest or your shoulder, and the way you rock her is comforting. Your caresses help her feel well, and calm her fears. Your kisses encourage her awareness of life. Through touch, you are showing your love. Your baby will be thrilled if you like giving her massages! And it's not hard to do. You can begin the massage on your baby's temples or the soles of her feet. Repeat the movements that she seems to like and follow your intuition. There are good books available about baby massage, or you can contact your CLSC. Baby massage workshops are also available. Use bath time if there isn't a better routine time for the massage. Wash your baby with your hands rather than a cloth. Take the time to rub her body with cream. She'll appreciate this contact and the time you spend with her. iStockphoto Massaging an infant is easy and relaxes her. It helps her body work properly and promotes her growth.Baby 291 Talking with your babyHow to give a baby massage Choose a time when your baby is awake and receptive, preferably not too close to a feeding. Make sure the room is warm, comfortable and cozy. It's best to sit on the floor. Use a firm but gentle touch with your entire hand to avoid tickling her. Use a small quantity of vegetable oil (such as sunflower) warmed in your hands for pleasant contact. Try the oil on a small part of the body first to make sure there's no allergic reaction. Stay relaxed and be attentive to your baby's preferences.Taste and smell Newborns already have a sense of taste and smell. Very early on, they are able to recognize their mother by her smell. The scent of milk draws your baby to the nipple to satisfy her hunger. Sucking gives her an intense feeling of well-being. The taste of breast milk can vary depending on the mother's diet. When the father takes her in his arms for the first time, the newborn will also recognize her father's scent. It is good for father and child to share skin contact in the first few hours after birth.292Baby Talking with your babyHearing Your baby can hear at birth, and even before she is born. She is especially sensitive to the voices of her mother and father, possibly because she has often heard them while she was in the womb. She may turn her head toward your voices. Familiar sounds reassure your baby. Calling her in a soft voice can often calm her. Loud or sudden noises, however, will make her jump and may upset her. Most babies born in Qu\u00e9bec have normal hearing. At birth, about six babies in 1,000 may have hearing problems. However, it's difficult for even the most attentive parents to evaluate a baby's hearing during the first few months of life. Some hospitals are beginning to offer screening for deafness at birth through a simple, quick and safe test. The test is normally given while the mother and baby are still in hospital.If your baby doesn't have this test, you should make sure she reacts to the sound of voices and noises without seeing what is making the noise; for example, the sound of a dog barking behind her head or the doorbell ringing. Normally around the age of 6 to 9 months, she will turn towards the sound of the noise. If this doesn't happen, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor who can direct you to resource people that can help (audiologist, ORL or ear, nose and throat doctor). The ears of newborns can stick out somewhat. Nothing can be done to correct it at this age. You can talk to your doctor about it before your child starts school.Baby 293 Talking with your babyEyesight From birth onward, an infant can see faces, shapes and colours, and prefers faces and geometric shapes. Sight is an important way for your baby to communicate. At the age of 1 month, she will look for and at light that is not too bright. At 2 months, she can start seeing the difference between colours and can use her eyes to follow a person or object that moves slowly. Her field of vision increases to that of an adult's at about 1 year. For more information, Eye problems , page 632 . Catherine St-Laurent Sight is an important way for your baby to communicate.BABy 294Sleep Sleeping safely 295 Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) 298 Preventing a flat head 300 Sleep in the first weeks 301 Sleep at around 4 months 302 Sleep after 6 months 304 Sleep between 1 and 2 years old 306 Genevi\u00e8ve TrudelBaby 295 SleepSleeping safely Your baby should sleep on her back on a firm mattress in a crib that meets Canadian safety standards, from birth onwards (see Crib, cradle, and bassinet , page 685) . The blanket should be the only extra thing in the crib. Recommended by the Canadian Paediatric Society Tragically, every year there are reports of deaths of babies who were sharing their parent's bed. For this reason, the Canadian Paediatric Society states that during the first six months of life, the safest place for a newborn to sleep is in her parents' room in her own crib. For her own safety, your baby should sleep on her back, in her own crib. Roxane Lauz\u00e9 296Baby SleepDo you sleep with your baby? To avoid an accident, make sure you Do not sleep on a couch or similar piece of furniture (armchair) with your baby Use a firm mattress (no soft surfaces or water beds) Keep enough distance between the mattress and wall that your baby doesn't get stuck Never let a newborn sleep alone in an adult bed In all circumstances Never sleep with your baby if you have been drinking, taking medication that makes you drowsy, or have taken any other drugs (marijuana, crack, etc.) Never sleep with your baby if you are extremely tired (more than usual)In these cases, it is much safer for your baby to be in her crib. If you are unable to sleep well when you're in the same room as your baby, you could have her sleep in a secure crib in another room. The quality of your sleep is very important. Your baby must sleep in a safe place even when you are travelling. Never, under any circumstances, put your baby to bed in an adult bed and don't use pillows. If you don't have a crib, a blanket placed directly on the floor can act as a temporary safe bed for a baby who is less than 6 months old. Using a playpen or a mattress on the ground can be a solution for putting your baby to bed when you are travelling.Baby 297 SleepA car seat should be used only for transporting your baby in the car. Car seats and baby seats should not be used in place of a crib as they are not a safe place for sleeping. When you go for walks, your baby will be safest and most comfortable sleeping on her back in a stroller. The back of the stroller should fold down flat or almost flat, and your baby should be properly strapped in. Be careful; your infant is not safe in her baby carrier if you are sleeping or lying down while wearing the carrier. When you go for walks, your baby will be safest and most comfortable sleeping on her back in a stroller. Emilie Audy298Baby SleepSudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) The sudden death of an infant under the age of one occurs while the baby is sleeping. We still do not know the cause of sudden infant death syndrome (crib death). The main risk factors for sudden infant death syndrome are Being exposed to her mother's smoking during pregnancy Sleeping on her tummy Ending up with her head completely covered by blanketsHere are some recommendations to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome: Avoid smoking during pregnancy. Tobacco by-products absorbed by mothers who smoke are passed from the mother's blood to the baby's blood via the placenta. Place your baby on her back to go to sleep. Tell anyone who looks after your baby to do the same. Healthy babies won't suffocate when they sleep on their backs. When your baby begins turning over on her own, you can allow her to sleep in the position that she prefers without any danger. Avoid using comforters because they can easily cover your baby's head as she moves around. Avoid using pillows, bumper pads or other similar items in your baby's crib. Your baby could suffocate against these objects if she is on her stomach or accidentally turns onto her side or stomach.Baby 299 Sleep Marie-\u00c8ve Gallienne You can swaddle your baby in a blanket. In this case, make sure that she sleeps on her back and isn't too warm.You can swaddle your baby in a blanket. In this case, make sure that she sleeps on her back and isn't too warm. Infant sound and movement monitors do not replace these precautions. All these safety measures must be followed even if you use a baby monitor.300Baby SleepPreventing a flat head Sudden infant death syndrome happens 50% to 70% less often since paediatricians have recommended that infants sleep only on their backs. But if a baby always stays in the same position, in her crib or car seat, she may end up having a flat head. The medical term for this is positional plagiocephaly. Since the bones of the baby's skull are still soft, the part of the head lying on the mattress flattens with pressure. A slight flattening of the head will disappear on its own. A more pronounced flatness may be permanent but will not harm your baby's brain or development. Genevi\u00e8ve Germain Your baby needs to spend some time on his tummy every day.Baby 301 SleepSleep in the first weeks Your baby will sleep and wake according to her needs and feelings. Some babies wake almost only to nurse. Others are awake longer from their first days out of the womb. The amount of time they stay awake will be longer as the weeks pass. As with adults, newborn babies go through different sleep cycles: drowsiness (light wakefulness), calm sleep and agitated sleep. When your baby is in her agitated sleep cycle, she may make sucking movements, frown, cry, smile, jump, tremble, groan, breathe hard or move. This is normal. No need to wake and comfort her. However, you may want to wake her if she needs to be encouraged to feed. Recommended by the Canadian Paediatric SocietyTo prevent a flat head, the Canadian Paediatric Society recommends changing your baby's position in the crib every day. One day, place your baby with her head at the head of her crib. The next day, place her head at the foot of the crib. Make sure she is always looking towards the room, not towards the wall. You can also put a mobile on the side of the crib facing the door to encourage your baby to look in that direction. Your baby needs to be placed on her tummy for short periods of time every day when she's awake and is with a parent. This will help her grow and prevent flat spots from forming on the back of her skull.302Baby SleepSleep at around 4 months At 4 months, the average amount of time a baby sleeps is 14 to 15 hours per day. Babies will start to sleep longer through the night. At about 4 months, babies usually have a more regular and predictable daily routine. Because you've paid close attention to your baby from the time of birth, she will feel safer and more secure. She will be able to wait a bit longer for things. She learns to comfort herself by putting her hand in her mouth. Little by little she learns to fall asleep on her own. Beginning at between 4 and 6 months, some babies won't need to feed during the night anymore. Others will still need to - possibly even more so than during the weeks before.Bedtime routine It's a good idea to make bedtime a relaxed, happy time. Repeating the same actions every night will create a bedtime routine that makes going to sleep easier. Turn on a night light in the hall and leave the bedroom door partly open. If you stick fairly close to your routine each day, your baby will start to understand when it's bedtime. For example, develop a routine of a warm bath, quiet game, a story, soft music or a song. Gradually you will recognize more and more of your baby's signs of fatigue.Baby 303 SleepA lot of parents enjoy this time of the day with their baby, and take the time to rock her to sleep. Others prefer that the baby learns to fall asleep on her own. If you want, once the routine and quiet time are finished, put your baby in her crib even if she isn't fully asleep. When your baby learns to go to sleep on her own it means she can go back to sleep on her own in the middle of the night if she wakes up during a period of light sleep. There's no right or wrong way in your bedtime routine. The important thing is for you to feel comfortable with the routine you choose. Elisabeth Martel-Olivier The bedtime routine helps your baby get ready to sleep.304Baby SleepSleeping through the night Sleeping through the night is what adults do; babies have different sleep patterns. A baby's sleep schedule can in fact vary quite a bit from one baby to the next. \"Sleeping through the night\" generally means five or six hours of sleep between 11 p.m. and 8 a.m. About 70% of 3-month-old babies sleep five hours at night; 85% do at 6 months, and 90% at 10 months. Follow your baby's rhythm and needs. When feeding at night, you can keep things calm and quiet so she learns the difference between night and day. For example, keep the lights very dim and resist the very natural urge to speak to her.Sleep after 6 months Most babies between the ages of 6 and 12 months sleep 8 to 10 hours a night for a total of about 15 hours a day. Sometimes, 6- to 12-month-old babies start waking up again in the night. This is the normal period for separation anxiety. You might also notice during the day that your baby reacts more strongly when you leave her, when you go to another room or when you put her to bed. When she wakes up crying at night, you can reassure her simply by being there and talking softly to her. Often, just your voice and touch will make her feel better. Remember that it's normal for babies to have wakeful periods. Your baby can learn gradually to go to sleep by herself.Baby 305 Sleep Val\u00e9rie Milot306Baby SleepRemember that whatever your baby needs to go to sleep is the same as what she will need to go back to sleep when she wakes in the middle of the night. If she needs to be breast- or bottle-fed or to be rocked to go to sleep, she will probably need you to help her go back to sleep when she wakes in the middle of the night. If you want her to learn to go back to sleep on her own, you need to teach her first to go to sleep on her own in the evening. If she does need you there, you can try teaching her to go to sleep on her own by gradually decreasing the amount of time you stay with her each evening. If your baby cries a lot at night, you should check to make sure she's not sick. Take her temperature. If it happens often, talk to your doctor. He or she can reassure you about your baby's physical well-being and support you during the difficult period. If your baby doesn't have any health problems, think about your bedtime routine and see if it can be improved to encourage sleep.Sleep between 1 and 2 years old A 1- or 2-year-old child sleeps 8 to 12 hours per night. Generally, up to 18 months, your child needs two naps per day, one in the morning and the other in the after -noon. Beginning at about 18 months to 2 years, she may need only one nap. Sometimes she will be in a bad mood when she wakes up. Be patient and wait a bit before getting back to regular activities. Remember that each baby's sleep needs are different, and they decrease as she grows. Sleep problems A lot of children aged 1 or 2 cry at bedtime. They are going through a normal period of separation anxiety, which can last to 18 months or more. Their fears make it harder for them to be without you at bedtime. Keep your bedtime routine with a gentle firmness. This will help reassure your child.Baby 307 SleepNightmares and night terrors Beginning at age 1, many children have night terrors. The child may scream and cry, yet seems to be sleeping deeply. You don't need to wake her or do anything in particular, unless you think she might hurt herself. If you can't console her, don't worry, she will calm down soon. If she wakes up in a panic and seems very awake, she probably had a nightmare. Being there to reassure her will help her fall back to sleep calmly. And don't worry, night terrors and nightmare problems generally go away as your child grows. Several books offer tips on how to teach older children to deal with the problem.Disturbed sleep If your child wakes up at night, try the bedtime routine we suggested previously for children over the age of 6 months. If you have trouble creating a bedtime routine, or if your child keeps waking up at night despite your routine and you're concerned, talk to a health professional. Your child's sleep is disturbed if She wakes often during the night (more than two times) She wakes for a long period during the night (more than 20 minutes) She needs you when she wakes at night She wakes more then four or five nights out of seven She's woken up during the night for at least three months In these cases, getting help is a good idea. Reading about the problem or talking to a professional can be useful.308Baby Sleep Baby 309 Sleep Genevi\u00e8ve TrudelBABy 310your child's development Bonding 312 Temperament 314 To interact is to stimulate 316 Playing to learn 317 Toys 318 Screens 319 Questions about language 320 Setting limits 325 Stages of growth 332 Toilet training 358 Emergent reading and writing 361 Langis MichaudBaby 311 Your child's developmentChildren grow and develop gradually. But some days the progress is surprising and delightful! Your child needs simple but essential elements to grow in mind and body. He needs food, physical care, sleep and security. He needs to develop significant relationships with the people who take care of him, and in whom he trusts. For this bond to be created, your baby needs to be Loved as he is, with all his strengths and weaknesses Surrounded by love and be touched Encouraged and supported with gentle words Stimulated by people who talk and play with him Guided in his experiences by a few clear rules Sarah Witty Bit by bit the bond between you and your child grows through the care, affection, attention and time you give him.312Baby Your child's developmentBonding In order to grow, a child needs to develop a bond of trust with one or more people who are sensitive to his needs and who reassure him when he is afraid. This bond known as \"attachment\" is created through the daily care, affection and attention you give to your baby and the time you spend with him. Few tips to help your child gain confidence Hold him often in your arms, especially when he cries. Take time to play and talk with him. Learn to get to know him and to take his personality into account.Sense of confidence Your baby sends you signals (sounds, crying, arm and leg movements, frowns, etc.) to express his needs. You learn to understand them as you try to respond. It is important to pay close attention to these signals to determine the appropriate response to his needs. Your response should also be prompt and reassuring for your baby, especially when he is crying. That's how he'll gain confidence in you. Your baby will know you're there for him.Baby 313 Your child's developmentFor example, if your baby begins to cry, you can pick him up to comfort him. If your baby is colicky, you can take him for a walk in the baby carrier. It's a good way to soothe colic and build trust with your child. If your baby has confidence in you, he will have confidence in himself. This sense of confidence is necessary for your child to explore his world. He will feel safe if he knows his parent is there to help and comfort him in a moment of trouble. Some more sensitive children need more time to feel confident.Since children gain confidence from the people that take care of them regularly, it's normal for them to react against separation from their parents. It is usually around the age of nine months that toddlers have a difficult time coping with separation. When you're back together with your child, he may show he was unhappy about the separation or instead show his joy at you being there again. After a bit of time close to his parents, he will feel safe and confident again.314Baby Your child's developmentTemperament From birth, a newborn has a character and manner of his own. Each baby has his own ways. Take time to observe your baby to get to know him. Your observations are important. They will help you adjust how you treat and care for your child. You'll also learn to guide your child in his learning and discoveries. Here are the kinds of differences you can see in babies: How energetic they are How regular they are in terms of appetite, sleep and bowel movements Their reactions to new experiences Their ability to adapt to new things Their sensitivity to noise, light and texture How much they react to good and bad events Their mood Their ability to concentrate Their ability to persevereSome babies are considered \"easy.\" They wake and eat according to a regular schedule. They're generally in a good mood and are somewhat active. These babies, like others, also need a routine but they adapt well to changes and new situations. In response, their parents simply learn their own way of taking care of them. Other babies are \"more sensitive.\" The care and attention they need change from one day to the next. They don't adapt as easily to new things and sometimes cry a lot. They may be irritable for a number of reasons. Some are more sensitive to light, others to noise and others to movement.Baby 315 Your child's developmentSome babies are more \"cautious.\" They're calm and take time to observe before acting. They're a little more timid about new activities. They take their time, and may resist change. Because they often make less noise and require less attention, they may seem to be more independent. But even though they take their time, they understand and learn to explore, to socialize and to play with others. It is good to encourage them to discover new things at their own speed. Your child will feel understood, respected and encouraged in his learning. Be sure to take plenty of time to play often and regularly with your child even if he's calm and undemanding. Quiet children need physical games too.These children require flexibility and patience. Daily care becomes a routine that is good for them and reassures them. It's important that you keep up your efforts to give warm and constant care even when your child is irritable and unhappy. Your presence and your calm make them feel better. If your six-month old baby is very active, you can help him focus his attention and concentration. Looking at children's books with him for several minutes is helpful. Over time, his interest and attention increase.316Baby Your child's developmentTo interact is to stimulate Children need a lot of contact with the people around them, especially their parents. From the time they're born they have everything they need to interact: sight, hearing and touch. As they grow, their ability to interact improves. You can enjoy great times with your baby while caring for and playing with him. Use those times to stimulate your child's abilities. Interaction with your child creates a happy relationship that allows your baby to get to know you and learn to predict what comes next. From birth, he needs you to be able to relate to objects and the world around him. You are introducing him to life outside the womb. Your baby understands language several months before knowing how to express himself. Speak to him, use words to describe what you are doing and your actions. \"Look, Mummy's going to feed you now.\" \"Daddy is giving you a bath.\" Don't be afraid of repeating yourself; he is taking in what he hears and learning to remember. iStockphoto By playing with your child, you help his development.Baby 317 Your child's developmentPlaying to learn Playing is essential to your child's growth. Through play, he shows his joy for life and discovers his body, family and home. All children love to play. Not only is it fun and instructive, but it also promotes development. Play is what helps your child learn important skills and gain confidence. He will make his greatest discoveries during the first two years of his life.He will learn to Crawl, walk, climb, run and dance (general motor skills) Use his hands and fingers to hold and handle objects and develop hand-eye coordination (fine motor skills) Understand language, talk, interact Develop his intelligence Get to know the world around him and his place in it Be proud of his successes and develop a sense of confidence318Baby Your child's developmentToys The toys you choose should be appropriate for his age and be safe (see Choosing toys , page 688) . Be sure to give him stimulating toys. For example, a dog on wheels that he has to pull is better than a battery -oper ated puppy that he just has to watch. And be sure to take time to play with him. He needs help learning to discover his new playthings. Time with his parents is always better than a more complicated toy, especially if it's forgotten in the bottom of the closet. The best toys aren't the most expensive. Many household objects can amuse young ones: pots, plastic utensils, bowls and of course the quintessential cardboard box (beware of staples!), which becomes a house, tunnel, car, hat and so on.Parents - no need to buy your child every toy on the shelf. Just spend quality time with him. Play with him, pamper him, and discover the joy of just being together. A few suggestions Store some toys for awhile. When you take them out again, your child gets to discover them all over. That way you can rotate the toys in your house or even trade with friends. Toys play different roles at different ages. At first, your baby will handle them and put them in his mouth. Then he will figure out how they work or start piling them on top of one another. After very active games or before bedtime, it's a good idea to choose a calm activity. Read a story, rock the teddy bear to put him to bed, hum a lullaby.Baby 319 Your child's developmentScreens Recommended by the Canadian Paediatric Society According to the Canadian Paediatric Society, screen time for children younger than 2 years is not recommended. The Society also recommends turning off all screens (TV included) when spending time together as a family, and to avoid leaving the TV on in the background. Your child learns about the world by interacting with the people around him. His skills development (e.g., motor skills, language) and his ability to relate to others depend on his interactions with his parents, friends and family (see Stages of growth, page 332) .Talking to your child, telling him stories and interacting through games are the best ways to help him develop. Learning will be more rewarding if there are no distractions from your phone or from a screen in the room. Your child needs your attention\u2014and your gaze. Understanding what's on the screen Children under 2 years of age are attracted by the sounds and colours on screens and electronic devices. But that doesn't mean they understand what they see. What's more, it is difficult for children under the age of 2 to reproduce the actions they see on screen. For example, your child will learn better by building a block tower on his own instead of watching another child do it on screen.320Baby Your child's developmentChildren under 2 get no benefits from screen time, whether with a tablet, television, smart phone, or e-book. Screens with an educational function are also discouraged at this age. Communicating via screen However, applications like Skype, Facetime, and WhatsApp can be used to stay in touch with loved ones who are far away. During the chat, help your child interact with the person on the screen to ensure he has a positive experience with this method of communication.Questions about language Babies begin communicating from the time they leave the womb. Slowly they learn the language that will let them express themselves and interact with the people around them. The step-by-step development of language is described beginning on page 332 in Stages of growth . Parents may worry about how well their child is learning language. Before worrying, remember that children learn at different speeds. Some are slow to speak, others are quick. Temperaments are different too: some children are quieter, others like to talk. In this section, we will try to answer the most common questions from parents about language.Try to cut back on your screen time when you're with your kids, and make a habit of shutting off screens at home when they are not in use. Remember\u2014you're the best models for your children.Baby 321 Your child's developmentHow should I speak to my child? Use simple words and short sentences that are not much longer than your child's. Speak more slowly and repeat what you say often. Your child will no doubt come up with words like \"wawa\" for water, \"woof-woof\" for dog, and \"banket\" for blanket. Help him learn the right words. When he says \"wawa,\" offer \"Yes, water.\" You can also use words and sentences to describe what you and your child are doing. As he grows, you will naturally adapt to his level. Nicole April It's best to be at the same level as your child so he can see your face when you speak.322Baby Your child's developmentHe doesn't talk; what do I do? It's important not to pressure your child. Keep your interaction enjoyable. Try these strategies to get him to express himself: Create funny situations that will interest him. For example, pretend to try to put his boots on your feet, or pretend to fall asleep when you're playing with him. Try to avoid responding to his needs before he asks. Wait for him to indicate what he wants using gestures, words, or a look. Ask questions that require more than a yes or no answer. For example, \"What would you like to eat?\". Offer a choice when he points to what he wants: \"Would you like an apple or a banana?\". Say the beginning of the word or sentence: \"You want the ba...\" (balloon); or \"You want the...\" (balloon). Place things out of reach so he has to ask for them. Encourage all his attempts at using a new word and congratulate him.I don't understand what he's saying. What do I do? Without blaming him, tell him that you don't understand. It's important to encourage all his attempts to communicate, even if you don't understand. If you understand a few words, try to ask about the rest of the sentence: \"Something happened to your teddy bear?\" If you have no idea, ask him to show you. His pronunciation is wrong; what do I do? When a child learns to speak, some sounds come early, like p, b, m, t, d and n , while others develop later. Children should be able to correctly pronounce the sounds f , v, k, g, h, s, and z by age 3 or 3 1/2. The l sound can usually be articulated by age 4. Mastery of the sounds ch , j, and r may not come until age 5, and the th sound usually comes at about age 6. The sh and j sounds appear at around 3 1/2 years and may be learned at only 7 years in some children - no reason to worry before then. Many children replace sh with s and z (e.g., shoe soe, jam zam).Baby 323 Your child's developmentTo help your child learn to say sounds correctly, repeat the words in the right way, emphasizing the sound he mispronounced. For example, if he says \"woud\" for \"loud,\" help him by stretching the correct sound and saying it louder: \"LLLLLLoud.\" Don't force him to repeat the word. Indirectly encourage him by asking follow-up questions. When to consult a health professional? Remember that to speak your child needs first to be able to hear. If you're worried about your child's hearing, talk to your doctor. Your child's hearing can be tested from birth. Some aspects of learning to speak and communicate are very important. We encourage you to ask for advice from a health professional if: At about 6 months, your child does not react to your voice or noise. He doesn't babble and doesn't smile.At about 12 months, he stops making sounds. He doesn't react to familiar words, like his name and the names of people close to him, his teddy bear and favourite games. Your child doesn't look you in the eye, and doesn't seem interested in communicating through gestures or sounds. At about 18 months, he isn't using any words. He doesn't point. He doesn't understand simple and familiar instructions, such as \"give\" or \"come here.\" At about 24 months, he doesn't combine two words, and expresses himself mainly with gestures. He doesn't imitate sounds or words. He says less than 100 words. At about 3 years, strangers are unable to understand him. He doesn't speak in sentences. He doesn't try to communicate. He doesn't understand simple sentences. He's not interested in other children.324Baby Your child's developmentSome situations can increase the risk of language problems. You should talk to a health professional about such situations, which are listed below. Together, you will be able to decide if a special consultation is required: Speech, language or learning difficulties in the family Hearing problems in the family Drug or alcohol consumption during pregnancy Your child speaks loudly or needs things repeated oftenShould he see a speech-language pathologist? Language is essential to your child's growth and ability to communicate. When he gets to school, he will need to be able to express himself and be understood. If you notice that he has specific troubles, it would be worthwhile to see a speech-language pathologist. Your doctor can help you find one. The local CLSC, hospital or rehabilitation centre might offer such services. Schools also offer support, but it's better to help your child before he gets to kindergarten. Waiting times for seeing a speech-language pathologist lead some parents to pay for one through the private sector. A complete list of speech-language pathologists and audiologists in your region is available through the Ordre des orthophonistes et audiologistes du Qu\u00e9bec. only)Baby 325 Your child's developmentSetting limits All children need limits. As parents, you respond to this need according to your values but also taking into consideration your child's character, age, and physical and emotional needs. It is important for him that the rules in your family be simple and clear. Providing clear, simple rules Love also means setting rules. Rules exist to help keep your child from getting hurt, from hurting others and to teach him to respect others and the world around him. He needs rules and limits, but since he doesn't know what they are, he needs you to teach him.We usually begin to teach a child rules when he starts to move around on his own with ease; in most cases, that's at about 9 months. From that age on he's able to learn simple rules. Your little one will follow a rule if you explain it to him taking into account his age and his ability to understand and remember what you are asking him. Teach him one rule at a time and go on to the next only when the last one has been well integrated into his day-to-day routine. At the age of 18 months, take time to explain the \"why\" of a rule. Use clear, simple, descriptive language that shows him exactly what you expect from him. This will make it easier for him to understand, accept and respect this rule.326Baby Your child's developmentLearn to say NO Be consistent: when you say no, stick to your word. For example, if you've just told your child he's not allowed to touch the oven door, but he tries to do it anyway, you should say NO firmly. You can then move him away from the door and offer him a toy as a distraction. If he starts playing with it, praise him. If he cries, repeat no softly, taking care to reassure him. If he is old enough to understand, explain why this is not allowed. If he gets up and returns toward the oven door, simply say no once again and repeat the process. Usually it takes several times, so don't be too discouraged. Individual parents have their own style of educating their children, probably learned from their own parents; they can be adapted to today's realities. Some are more permissive, others more strict. The most important thing is to trust your instincts and respect your child.Keep the emotional bond From the time your baby was born, you've created a strong emotional bond with him. This will help you a lot when it comes to setting rules. A child who feels loved, understood and respected will be much easier to guide than one who doesn't feel appreciated. Discipline is necessary Discipline exists first to keep little ones physically and emotionally safe. It also makes living with others possible - for your child today and in the future. For discipline to work, both parents must decide together what is and isn't allowed. That way, you can set clear rules without contradicting each other. Some children need more structure than others. As parents, you are in the best position to judge your child's specific needs and personality.Baby 327 Your child's developmentClear rules for staying physically safe This means preventing behaviour that could be dangerous for your child and that could result in him being hurt. For example, you don't allow him to climb something that's not stable. You can make discipline easier by not having too many unsafe things around - make your house safe. A routine for emotional well-being Your child needs a routine. He likes things to happen in about the same order each time. That way he can learn to predict what's happening and how it will affect him. He will feel reassured if meals, bedtime and leaving for daycare follow a predictable routine. Having a routine also keeps you from having to repeat rules and instructions. Simple, clear instructions are followed more promptly. Sarah Witty328Baby Your child's developmentRules that teach cleanliness and politeness You can teach your child to eat with a spoon, put objects away, use the potty and brush his teeth morning and night. You can also teach him some basic rules that will make his life in the outside world easier later on: Washing his hands before meals Saying please and thank you Not talking at the same time as someone else Waiting his turnA few tips for making discipline easier Place yourself at eye level with your child so that he looks at you and is listening when you teach or repeat a rule. Be sure to get his attention before explaining a rule; avoid having him be distracted by noise or a game. Use games to pass on certain rules. For example, little ones love to be with their parents and to imitate them. Playing a game of pretending to be a grown-up can help teach your child to pick up his toys and clothes. Congratulate your child with a kind word or a smile each time he listens and follows a rule.Baby 329 Your child's developmentReward good behaviour Help your child learn good behaviour through the rules you set by congratulating more than scolding. Put more time and energy into encouraging than arguing. Work to guide him toward acceptable and good behaviour. The results will be much better than constantly having to reprimand. A child that is given too many instructions and scolded too often is likely to become upset or discouraged. Recognize and congratulate your child's good actions. This will teach him about your expectations and reassure him about his skills and abilities. A child's self-esteem grows through his daily experiences; this is how he develops a positive image of himself. The challenge for parents is to balance encouragement and correction. Isabel Olivier photographe Don't hesitate to acknowledge your child's good behaviour and to congratulate him on it.330Baby Your child's developmentTeach patience By around 12 months, you can start teaching your child that he can wait a few minutes before getting what he needs. This will help him learn to be patient little by little in daily situations, for example, while you're making supper, taking care of another child or answering an important phone call. Be sure to be reassuring during these first waiting periods. Keep talking with him, saying for example, \"Mommy's on the phone; I'll be with you in two minutes,\" or offer him a toy. The terrible twos During this infamous time of no-no-no, which is usually between about 18 months and 3 years, children experience the need to go against anything asked of them. They are in fact going through their first assertiveness crisis. They are testing what they've learned and learning more. Little by little, they understand that not everything is allowed, that there are consequences to our actions, and that rules and limits are part of living with others. Avoid confrontations. It's a good idea to offer choices within limits that are acceptable to you. This will satisfy his need for independence. For example, if the child has to put away his toys, ask if he would like to pick up the blue blocks or the red blocks first. He won't follow the rules? Your job of parent isn't easy. But it's crucial. The sooner your child learns the rules of the house, the easier and more enjoyable it will be to live with him. You'll have more time to do interesting things together. It will also be easier for him to accept rules in other situations, like at daycare. Your household rules get him ready for life outside home, where the rules will be similar to yours.Baby 331 Your child's developmentWhat to do Withdrawal - In this kind of situation, a good trick is to say \"enough!\" with a firm tone and get your child out of the situation. Once away and at a distance from spectators, explain calmly but firmly to your child that you will not continue getting the groceries until he understands that he will not be getting any candy. This kind of radical change in the situation should surprise him and get him to change his mind. Wait for the calm to return before going back to get your groceries. It may seem that you're wasting time, but the limits you're setting with your child are essential and will save you time in the months ahead. This approach - called withdrawal - means you remove your child from a difficult situation for several minutes to explain what you expect of him. It's better than punishment, which often leaves the child not understanding why he's being scolded or what's expected of him.When the rule is essential to your child's well-being, such as bedtime, don't hesitate to keep your word. Be persistent without being aggressive. Try not to repeat instructions without follow-through. If there are no consequences, your child will learn he doesn't have to follow directions. If your child refuses to follow a rule you've taken care to explain, you must be firm. It will show in your face and the tone of your voice. Don't hit your child. It will only teach him to be afraid, to be disrespectful and to be aggressive. It will teach him to hit to get what he wants, because that's the model you'll be showing. There are more effective ways. Be firm Firm means clear and consistent. Some children need more rules and supervision than others. As parents, you are in the best position to adapt to the needs and character of your little one. Look at a common example: the grocery store crisis. Your little angel throws a devil's fit because you won't give him the candy he sees. He cries, kicks and screams. He even tries to hurt you and rolls on the floor. Obviously, everyone is now watching, some who understand, others who don't.332Baby Your child's developmentWorthwhile efforts Parents need to work together to create healthy discipline. The daily and necessary efforts you make are an investment in the future. By gradually teaching your child the rules of life as a family and as a society, you are making him able to follow the rules on his own later in life. Many books are available in stores or libraries if you would like to read more about discipline.Love, respect, flexibility, patience and persistence are the qualities you have that will allow you to raise your children well.Stages of growth Here are a few tips to help guide you on the great adventure of being a parent. They offer guidelines on your child's growth and give you some ideas for ways to have fun with him. Remember that the ages we use are only approximate. Children grow at their own individual pace and may learn new skills sooner or later. The following pages offer information about different levels of growth at each age: Motor skills Communication and language Understanding (cognitive growth) Relationships (socio-affective growth)Baby 333 Your child's developmentTo correct the age of a baby born before term, count from the birth date that was expected. For example, if the expected birth date was March 1 st but your baby was born on January 1st, he is two months early. In this case, when you calculate your baby's corrected age, subtract the two months from his actual age. On April 1 st, his real age will be 3 months, but his corrected age is 1 month. We encourage you to consult the Association des parents d'enfants pr\u00e9matur\u00e9s - Pr\u00e9ma-Qu\u00e9bec (see Associations, agencies and support groups , page 814) .For premature babies (born before the 37th week of pregnancy) Babies born early must make up the weeks they lost in their mother's womb. This doesn't happen magically when they're born but takes place slowly over the first 2 years. Use your baby's corrected age when looking at progress on growth charts and comparing with other children. If not, you may expect too much.334Baby Your child's developmentBirth to 2 months Fine motor skills During his first few weeks, your baby moves but has little control over his movements. His senses are awakening. If you touch the inside of his hand, he'll try to grasp your finger. He will look at a mobile over his crib. Around 1 month of age, his eyes will follow a moving object. Shake a rattle near him and he will react to the sound. The baby's fine motor skills are poorly organized and his movements are not voluntary. This is normal. This is the reflexive stage, which will disappear as the brain matures.Moro's reflex means that your baby will jump when he hears a loud noise or is moved quickly. This is not a sign that your baby is nervous. The sucking reflex is well developed. This allows your baby to feed himself or to calm down by putting his hand in his mouth. An offshoot of the orientation reflex will make your baby turn his head if you tickle his cheek or arm. It helps your baby look for the breast. The automatic stepping reflex appears when babies are held standing. He will try to walk on the examination table (the doctor can show you this). Your baby can't support his own weight yet, nor will stimulating this reflex help him walk sooner.Baby 335 Your child's developmentUnderstanding Watch your baby and you will see he is born with some extraordinary abilities. He does exciting new things every day. He is not too small to play, and can imitate some gestures like sticking out his tongue and opening his mouth. He can tell the difference between black and white and bright colours. Relationships Newborns immediately begin recognizing faces, and their memory is growing. They look for your face, and can find it. Their emotions are intense and hard to control; they need your help in doing so. Their emotions are expressed through everything from crying to cooing and babbling. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Dufour Look at your baby when he is in your arms; both of you will get to know each other better.336Baby Your child's developmentLanguage Crying is your baby's first way of communicating. At first, babies cry as a reflex, not by choice, usually when something is bothering them. They have different ways of crying to tell you about different needs, such as food or sleep. They coo from the earliest months. They don't understand the meaning of words but can sense emotions such as joy, anger and tenderness in your tone of voice. They react to loud noises. Your baby recognizes your voice and likes to hear it. In his own way, he is already communicating!Activities Talk with him - Talk softly. Tell him a story or sing him a song. Imitate the sounds he makes and watch for his reaction. By doing this, you will be helping him to pronounce sounds and learn tones and rhythms. He will want to join in the conversation. Say his name often; soon he will recognize it. Move around while calling him; he will move his head in the direction of your voice. Do this often. It is important for learning speech.Baby 337 Your child's developmentLanguage Your child will make different sounds depending on what he needs. He's moving toward babble (\"dada, mama, baba\"). He reacts to familiar voices and the sound of his toys. He will also smile in reaction to your stimulations. He doesn't understand words yet, but likes it when you hum or sing to him because he recognizes your voice and feels safe. He pays attention to the tune and your gestures. If he cries, talk softly, he may calm down. He may pay attention to music. Relationships The first social smile usually appears in the second month. The human face interests the baby, who answers a smile with a smile. At 2 months, he starts becoming interested in other babies and may become excited when he sees one. At 3 months, he is becoming more and more aware of other members of the family.From 2 to 4 months Fine motor skills Your child is beginning to control his head movements and hold his head up better and better. He is becoming more active. When lying face down, he raises his head and pushes up bit by bit using his arms. He moves his legs and explores his hands and feet. He loves to be touched and kissed and nuzzled, and for you to move his feet like pedals and to play with his hands. He will grab a rattle and try to suck on it. Don't be surprised; for quite a while he will try to put everything in his mouth. This is how he learns. You'll see him playing with his tongue and saliva and making bubbles.338Baby Your child's developmentUnderstanding Your baby repeats pleasant actions he has learned by accident, such as sucking his thumb and putting toys in his mouth. Activities Touring the home - Give the baby a detailed tour of your home. Show him and tell him what's in it. He will try to grab things, practicing his hand-eye coordination. Tickling - At bath time or while playing, help your child discover textures. Tickle him with paper tissue, teddy bear, dry washcloth, etc. iStockphoto Introduce your child to new textures.Baby 339 Your child's developmentLanguage He expresses his needs by yelling, crying and babbling. He is improving the babble with sounds that respond to yours. He roars with laughter and sometimes shouts for fun. Exploring his voice, he tries sounds, repeats them and tries to imitate others. He watches people talking to him and looks for the source of a noise. When he is babbling, answer him. He will find out he can affect the world around him and learn to take turns speaking. Talk to him often. Relationships Now that your baby is more aware, he will be more active in seeking your attention. He may cry because he's bored and hopes you will come and move him around and babble with him. He may even interrupt feeding to look at mom and dad. It's a good idea to keep him in the same room you are in and talk to him. You can pick him up as often as you want, even if he's not crying.From 4 to 6 months Fine motor skills Your baby is stronger now and holds himself better. Lying on his back, he raises his head, pedals and puts his feet in his mouth. If you pull on his hands, he rises and his head follows the movement. His back is straight but he still needs to be supported. Lying on his front, he rolls over onto his back with pleasure. He looks at his hands, puts them in his mouth, grabs things easily, holds them well but sometimes drops them. He will follow objects with his eyes but may sometimes squint. His vision is very good and he can distinguish small details. Understanding He likes fairly big, coloured objects hanging within reach. He enjoys looking at them, touching them and turning them around. He knows that if he moves the rattle, it will make a noise. He also knows that if he babbles, you'll pay attention for a longer time. When he drops something, he doesn't look for it.340Baby Your child's developmentAt this age, the child is interested in the people around him. He looks for the sources of noise. He also recognizes family and friends. Take advantage of this to check If he reacts when you smile at him If he stops crying when you talk to him If he turns toward you when you say his name If he follows your movements without constantly squinting If he shows little reaction and you are worried, don't hesitate to talk to the doctor about it. Activities Lying face down - Place your child on his belly and put some safe and interesting objects in front of him. He will want to reach out, grab them and handle them. Rattle - Your child will want to shake a rattle to make noise. Lying face down, your baby will learn to coordinate his movements. Charles Samba Charles SambaBaby 341 Your child's developmentLanguage Deliberate communications begin at about 7 months, mainly by gesture until 18 months. Meanwhile, the baby's babble is becoming more diverse and sophisticated, copying the sounds he hears. He is interested in people who talk to him, looking at them and answering to his name. He now starts using a few familiar words (\"daddy, baby\"). By about 9 months, your child understands familiar gestures. If you hold out your hand and ask for his toy, he might give it to you. A baby understands language before he tries to use it voluntarily. At this age, your child understands many words even if he can't yet say them.From 6 to 9 months Fine motor skills He is starting to move around on his belly. He rolls over. He's learning to crawl, backwards first, becoming more skilled and moving faster. Lying face down, he holds himself up with his arms. You can get him to move forward by offering him a teddy bear or a small ball. He can grab smaller and smaller objects and move them from hand to hand. He holds the breast with two hands while feeding. He may even turn around while suckling to watch what's going on around him. His teeth sharpen and he will probably learn the joy of biting. He is beginning to eat food. To be safe while eating, he must be close to you and fully secure in the highchair. He likes to play with his bowls and food. At about 9 months, his hand-eye coordination will improve. He can drink by himself from a bottle with a spout.342Baby Your child's developmentUnderstanding He likes mirrors and articles he can handle, turn and move. He enjoys large plastic cubes. He is fascinated by noisy games and will bang things against each other or the table, walls and floor. He likes squeeze toys that make noise. He will play the same game over and over. He doesn't throw things on the floor to make you angry - he's learning how to throw and how things fall. Your child learns from the things you do with him. He is gathering knowledge and putting it to use. At about 8 or 9 months you will notice that your child likes to look at his cubes, his teddy bear and his bowl from every angle - top, bottom, left, right, back and front. He's learning perspective. In front of a mirror, he tries to capture his image and yours; he examines himself. Tell him that it's him, and say his name, which he has known for a long time now.Relationships The baby is discovering his body and his parents' faces. He feels the need to touch them, to put his fingers in their mouth, nose and eyes. He pulls at their clothing. He laughs at the faces they make and becomes something of a tease. He tries to attract the attention of other babies by smiling and babbling when they meet. The fear of strangers may make him cry when he sees unfamiliar faces. At 8 or 9 months, it will be hard to separate your child from the person who takes care of him the most. He will cry when you leave. Try playing peekaboo so he will understand that you're not disappearing forever when you leave. He'll learn to keep an image of you in his mind.Baby 343 Your child's developmentActivities Peekaboo - Several times in a row, hide your face behind your hands then reveal yourself while calling \"peekaboo.\" Start the game over using his favourite toy; he will be surprised and happy to see it reappear so quickly. At this age, children think that people or things they can no longer see have really disappeared. Mirror, mirror on the wall - Put yourself and your baby in front of a mirror. Make lots of smiles and faces; he is learning to recognize both you and himself. Make noises with your mouth and he will try to answer them. The wide world - Whatever the season, take him outdoors. It's good for his health and yours. Help him discover the world around him - trees, birds and flowers - and other children.After you have left or when he wakes up, he may be worried to discover you aren't there. Always tell him, particularly if he's taking a nap, that you are going away and will be back soon. A child may become attached to substitute objects such as a doll or blanket to make up for absent parents. Be careful of this precious article and wash it secretly. Keep an identical spare if possible and switch on laundry day. Help make the baby's separation from his mother easier by having the father or partner also spend lots of time with him. This will make it easier for the child to turn to another person in the family circle (see Importance of the father -child re lationship , page 732) .344Baby Your child's developmentThe tunnel - A big cardboard box with holes in both ends makes a fine tunnel to crawl through. Be sure to remove any staples first. Get down on all fours with your baby and you'll see the world from his point of view. Blocks, balls, bottles - Give him blocks to pile, balls to push and floating toys. In the bathtub he will play with plastic bottles and small containers; he will love to fill and empty them. Don't use toys that don't drain because they make a fine home for bacteria and other nasty microbes. Words and books - Reading stories is a good way to learn new words. Choose a book with simple colour pictures.Parts of the body - You can now play at identifying parts of the face. Then name parts of the body. iStockphoto Play peekaboo with your baby, he will be surprised and happy to see you reappear.Baby 345 Your child's developmentFrom 9 to 12 months Fine motor skills Your little one will want to explore every corner of the home. He races around on hands and knees and disappears before you know it. He's becoming more and more independent. He may not walk yet but he can stand up, squat and bend over. Using furniture for support, he stands up, takes a step or two and falls down. And starts over! His hand coordination is improving and he is becoming more and more capable of doing things. He picks up crumbs and tiny objects and holds them between thumb and forefinger. He still puts things in his mouth because that's how he discovers. So pay attention! Language Your child can understand what you tell him, especially if you speak plainly and use gestures as well as words. This is the stage when your baby starts to follow simple instructions (e.g., show me your nose). He knows \"bye-bye\" and \"clap\" and how to hide. He is beginning to communicate for specific reasons, to get something or attract attention. You have to know what he wants because he illustrates his babble with gestures while saying \"ba ba ba, ma ma ma\" and so on, holding out his hand and eventually pointing to the thing he wants. He turns when his name is called and imitates the sounds you make. He also still enjoys noise-making toys, and can locate the source of a familiar but hidden noise or voice (from several metres away). Relationships He is becoming very sociable. He and the children he plays with are beginning to imitate each other. He cries when he can't see you any more. You are still the centre of his life but he is exploring the world around him with great curiosity. It can put your patience to the test but this curiosity is a sign of good development. He can begin playing alone, but would much prefer that dad be there to give him a friendly hard time. He still doesn't play with the same toy for very long, but can show his appreciation for one specific object.346Baby Your child's developmentUnderstanding Your child enjoys imitating you. He is beginning to show interest in books and music. He really enjoys games of emptying and filling. He is able to use his knowledge in new situations. If you prevent him from taking something, he will look for other ways to get it. He can coordinate several actions to achieve a goal, such as crawling across the room to get a toy. He links events and reactions, such as how his parents react to his crying. He is fascinated by the results of his actions, and may pull on the tablecloth to get the glass of milk on the table. Activities A ball - Sit on the floor face to face with your legs open. Roll the ball between his legs. Ask him to send it back the same way. He will be proud of himself when he sees you're happy he succeeded. Isma\u00eblle Michelot Your baby will love simply playing with a ball.Baby 347 Your child's developmentA toy chest - Give him a box full of colourful, washable toys such as balls, blocks, stacking rings and fabric animals. Keep him fairly near to you. He'll start playing by himself. A cupboard for baby - Give him permission to go through a cupboard located away from the stove and full of plastic containers in various shapes and colours. While he plays with them you can work quietly in the kitchen. Don't forget to use security locks on all the other drawers and cupboards. Smells - Use mealtime to introduce your baby to different odours, such as bread, meat, fruit, vegetables and spices. This will help develop his sense of smell. Books - Let him handle his first books, made of cardboard or cloth. Point at things on the pictures and tell him their names. He will learn to identify them and later to name them. Dominique Belley Help him explore his surroundings by letting him play with everyday objects.348Baby Your child's developmentFrom 12 to 15 months Fine motor skills Your baby can walk, or almost. But there's no rush. Children grow at their own pace. Maybe he prefers to wait until 15 to 18 months. Don't push it. He'll soon be climbing on the furniture and moving chairs around you. He is very capable on all fours and can climb the stairs this way. He is learning about shapes, putting small cubes inside big ones, balls in holes, rings on a cone. Understanding He sorts objects by shape and colour. And he likes testing different actions. For example, if he drops an article down the stairs he'll throw another one down to see what happens.Language Children generally say their first words at about 12 months. A baby's first words will refer to people close to him (e.g., mommy, daddy) and to familiar articles (e.g., ball, doll). It's important to know that some words will not match adult speech (e.g., banky for blanket). He recognizes the names of familiar people and things. He enjoys repeating what he hears and continues to babble. Relationships Your child is very sensitive to his parents' emotions, especially in unfamiliar or threatening situations. A parent's worried or confident expression will affect his behaviour and feelings. Your young child is more sensitive to family mood than anything else.Baby 349 Your child's developmentDuring your baby's one-year medical exam, the doctor will ask you some questions about your child's growth; for example: Does he turn toward you when you call his name? Does he look directly in your eyes? Does he point at things to show his need or interest? Is he beginning to pretend (feeding a baby, talking on the phone)? Activities The falling tower - Show him how to make a stack of three or four blocks. Put one down and ask him to add a second, and so on. Then tell him to knock the stack down - and start over. Nicole April Play with your baby at building - and rebuilding - a tower. This will help him learn to gather and handle objects.350Baby Your child's developmentDecorating the refrigerator - Your child will have fun with fridge magnets. Moving them around helps teach the finger and thumb to pinch, and improves hand-eye coordination. Careful! Be sure the magnets are firmly assembled and too big to swallow (see Choosing toys , page 688) . Mastering the stairs - Once he starts walking, there's a new game he'll love: going downstairs backward. Nursery rhymes and chitchat - Chatting with him frequently is a good way for your baby to learn language skills. He will enjoy having body parts named, for example. To add to your choices, your local library may have CDs of the nursery rhymes and songs that children love so much.From 15 to 18 months Fine motor skills By now your child is walking. He happily struts around with legs apart and arms out for balance. It's a good time to buy him some soft shoes for walking outdoors (see First shoes , page 767) . He climbs stairs on all fours, goes downstairs backward, gets into cupboards, climbs on chairs and touches everything. He's learning to handle screw tops, door handles and the pages of a book. He helps you dress him, and undresses quickly and throws away his boots. He can take a few steps sideways or backward. He can roll a ball toward an adult. He can also draw pictures with a large crayon. He can stack two or three cubes and put things in a bowl. He likes to fill and empty containers.Baby 351 Your child's developmentCareful! He still puts things in his mouth, including stones. He is so excited he wants to eat and sleep less. Understanding He is still experimenting with gravity, dropping things on purpose from his highchair. Throwing things is still part of his learning program. He looks for various ways to do what he wants and tries out new behaviour. For example, if he steps on a plastic duck it makes a noise. He may then try to squeeze it in his hands or sit on it to make the same noise. He's starting to solve problems by trial and error.Relationships This is the beginning of independence, and a very important time in a child's social development. It can be very hard on parents. He will follow you and imitate the things you do around home - toilet, housekeeping, toothbrushing, preparing meals. Lend him a cleaning cloth, a spoon and a bowl. Name the things he does. Invite him to imitate the sounds of things he hears: cars, airplanes, the vacuum cleaner, dogs and cats. He likes to pretend he's on the phone. Play music for him and he will dance to the rhythm. Play chase and hiding games with him and he'll be delighted. He loves playing in sand and splashing water. He likes playing alongside other children of his age but each will play independently. Interactions between two children of the same age become longer and more complex. Periods of mutual imitation indicate that, to a certain extent, the child is conscious of the other's intentions.352Baby Your child's developmentLanguage He is starting to grasp simple instructions (e.g., \"go get your teddy bear\") and depending less and less on your gestures. When he hears a noise, he looks toward the source of it. By 18 months, he knows at least 18 words that his parents understand, and he speaks one word at a time. He says \"daddy\" and \"mommy\" and a few useful terms such as \"down\", \"wait\" and \"more\". He may name some body parts (nose, eyes), pets (dog, cat), and articles of daily life (ball, car). He tries to repeat words and imitate the sounds of animals. Give him time to talk and encourage conversation, because he will learn through practice. When he says a word, add more words to it. For example if he says \"turn\", you say \"yes, the top is turning fast.\" Genevi\u00e8ve Colpron Rather than responding to what he wants before he asks, let him express his needs.Baby 353 Your child's developmentActivities Puzzles and a tool box - He is becoming more capable with his hands. He loves toys he can put together and take apart, nesting and stacking games. It's time for his first jigsaw puzzle (with large parts), a plastic tool box and some big building blocks. A pull toy - He likes to push and pull a vehicle. Give him toys with long handles, carts, wagons, balls and boxes full of various things. Tie a piece of string to an empty shoe box and suggest that he put his teddy bear in it. This makes a great sled. Bubbles - You can blow bubbles for him to catch in the bathtub. He will get very excited so be sure to keep him sitting down. This will be just as much fun outside on the grass. Drawings - Give him paper and non-toxic wax crayons. Show him how to doodle and he will immediately see the link between action and result. After praising the artist, hang the masterpiece on the fridge. Mireille Lewis Your child is able to pick up ever-smaller objects.354Baby Your child's developmentFrom 18 to 24 months Fine motor skills Your child has a wild need to move now. He runs, stops, starts, stops again, legs wide, chest forward, crouches as if urinating, stands up, starts running again and falls down. He bumps into everything. He kicks his ball to move it. He dances by spinning around and around when he likes the music. He loves playing outside. He needs room to walk, jump and run the way he wants. Teach him to rest when he's tired by sitting cross-legged. It's a good position for the legs. By about 2 years he can do a standing jump and between 2 and 3 years he will be able to hit the ball with his foot. He will also learn to walk on his toes.He is becoming more coordinated every day. He may be able to run a piece of string through something hollow or a bobbin of thread. Between 2 and 3 years old, he will be able to hold scissors and turn the pages of a book one at a time. He doesn't want help at the table. He holds his spoon well but still has trouble getting it to his mouth. He willingly splashes his soup on himself. He can easily take off his hat and socks, and you can encourage him to dress himself by choosing clothes that are easy to put on.Baby 355 Your child's developmentLanguage By about 18 months, your child will clearly understand simple sentences like \"go get your ball\" with no gesturing. He will also turn his head toward a noise. By 24 months, he can do what you ask (e.g., point at a picture in a book). He likes listening to little songs and stories. By 30 months, he can correctly answer questions about who, what and where with words and actions. His vocabulary is now growing quickly. From the 18 words he knew at 18 months, he has learned 100 by 24 months. The first 2-word sentences appear at about 2 years (e.g., daddy gone, more milk), and grow to 3 words by about 2 1/2 years. At this age, your child is also starting to use small words like \"me\" and \"one.\" Little conversations will soon become possible. You'll be able to talk with your little one about an event or a thing. Don't worry if he still can't pronounce all the sounds and syllables. Children make lots of language mistakes at this age.Relationships Your child is becoming more self-assured and independent. Do you feel the distance is growing between you? In fact, he's discovering the world around him. He sometimes talks a lot and continues to imitate you. He feeds his teddy bear, washes it, walks it and puts it to bed. He's playing the role of mother and father. At 2 years old, he wants to do everything by himself: eat, drink and undress, mainly. He loves learning. Sometimes he makes a mess but never mind. Let him experiment while you watch. His success will make him confident. Your child will have fun with you or with an older child but not yet with a toddler his own age. He may find it hard to lend his toys but you will gradually convince him to share. It will be easier at 3 or 4 years. Many children go through a phase when they push, bite and hit. Say NO clearly but don't hit or bite your child.356Baby Your child's developmentUnderstanding Between 18 and 24 months, he learns that objects exist even when he can't see them. When your child sees an object moved from one place to another, he looks for it in the last hiding place. He also looks for articles he hasn't seen moved. Your child can understand symbols now, and can think of people, things and events he doesn't see. He can imitate someone who isn't there, or pretend to. He can draw objects. At about 2 years old, he will be able to sort articles based on common characteristics such as colour. He is also beginning to understand cause and effect. When your child bangs on things with a spoon, he realizes that each one has its own sound. Sabrina Jalbert Your child is ready for his first construction games.Baby 357 Your child's developmentActivities A story every night - As often as possible, take the time to read your child stories. Point out pictures by naming objects and actions. Ask him to turn the pages and let him handle the book. Your child will learn that reading goes from left to right and from the top of the page to the bottom, and that stories have a beginning and an end. He will express his emotions. This is a great time to share precious moments of pleasure and togetherness. Choose books he likes. You can go to the library, and ask family members to give him books as presents. Other word games - Writing is everywhere. While taking a walk, satisfy his curiosity by reading things that attract his attention: posters, the names of stores, advertising, road signs, etc. He will learn to recognize logos, which is the first step toward understanding words.The sound of music - He is also discovering music. Listen to CDs and sing his favourite songs with him. He often prefers songs accompanied by simple gestures. Since he is using toys with more ability, you can provide him with simple instruments like drums, a xylophone and cymbals. Free creativity - It's time to use toys that let him create things. He likes finger painting, modelling clay and mud pies. Say something about what he makes. He will want to talk about it. Don't forget to show off his handiwork - he will be very proud of it. Long live the outdoors - Your child needs to move. He needs space to run and jump. Play with him outside in your yard or the park as often as possible. He likes playing outside and it's good for him. Costumes - He loves disguises and will borrow grownups' hats and shoes. Set aside some old clothing that doesn't matter if it gets dirty.358Baby Your child's developmentToilet training Toilet training usually begins at about 2 years old. Most children are fully toilet trained through the day between 2 and 4 years old. Toilet training usually takes from 3 to 6 months. We recommend that you do not set a timetable. There is no use forcing a child who isn't ready. Night-time bladder control may take several months or even several years. iStockphoto The age of toilet training varies greatly from one child to another.Baby 359 Your child's developmentA child is capable of toilet training somewhere between 18 months and 3 years of age. Here are a few signs that your child might be ready for this new experience: Your child can walk to his potty. He is starting to undress (he can pull down his pants). His diaper stays dry for several hours. He understands simple instructions, like \"take this to Daddy.\" He can express his needs with words like \"want milk\" and he will soon be able to say \"need to pee!\" He is proud he can do things by himself.It's important to go at your child's speed so this major new step in life is positive. Never try to force him to toilet train before he's physically and mentally ready. Trust him!360Baby Your child's developmentHow to make toilet training easier Here are some ways to make toilet training easier: Get him ready a bit at a time by teaching him the words and gestures of elimination - \"poop\", \"pee\", \"potty\", \"toilet\". Ask him to imitate you. Your child will want to copy you in the bathroom the same way he copies your speech. Put the potty close to the toilet and urge your child to do the same thing you do. When he's ready, he'll want to be like mommy and daddy. Use the potty rather than the toilet during the first steps. Your child will feel safer and more stable. Ensure that he is well seated on the potty, feet on the floor. If he's too high, use a small footstool so he can relax. To begin with, ask your child to sit on the potty with his clothes on, and then again after the wet diaper has been removed. Congratulate your child every time he shows interest in sitting on the potty. Later, have him sit on the potty at set times of the day (for example, after waking up, after eating and before naps, baths and bedtime) to establish a routine. Start using training pants or cotton pants after your child has been using the potty regularly for a few days. Don't be discouraged by accidents. This is all part of learning. Encourage his efforts and avoid punishing him if he has an accident. One of these days your child will want to go in the potty. There's no rush, and it will be easier if there's no stress. It's not a good idea to start toilet training during an unsettled time in your child's life, such as when you move, hire a new sitter or a new baby arrives.Baby 361 Your child's developmentEmergent reading and writing Now that your child has learned to handle books, he's beginning to discover the written word. Long before he goes to school, you can use everyday events to help him take the first steps toward reading.Your child watches you and wants to imitate you. Do some of your reading and writing while he's watching. Here are a few suggestions for activities: When your child begins to talk, you can write the first words in large letters and put them on the fridge. Point at them and read them out loud from time to time. When he begins naming the people around him, you can write each person's name beside their photo. If he says \"daddy\" for example, you can write the name in big letters under a picture of daddy. When he brings you a drawing, write his name at the bottom of it.362Baby Your child's development Genevi\u00e8ve Germain The more your child is exposed to writing, the better he'll be able to read and study in school.Your child will make the connection between speech and writing a bit at a time. He will discover the purpose of writing and decide it is a good idea.

It is the only milk that meets all of their nutritional and immunity requirements. Breastfeeding is more than a matter of ensuring baby is well nourished. It offers mother and child a moment of intimacy that provides baby with a feeling of warmth and security. An act of love If delivery goes well, the baby is put on mom's tummy right after birth. This \"skin-to-skin\" contact is a source of comfort and reassurance that helps your newborn adapt to life in the outside world. It also gives mom an opportunity to get to know her baby. This is an intense and moving moment for the whole new family. These intimate moments give parents a chance to observe their newborn child. In the hour after birth, most babies will put their hands to their mouth, stick out their tongue and try to suck. Your baby might want to suck without necessarily needing to drink much milk.Feeding your baby is a time of intimacy and sharing. Frequent contact is important and will play an important role in the lives of you and your baby. Snuggled in your arms, your baby feels the milk filling her stomach. She loves the sound of your voice and the warmth of your body! Feeding your little one can be so much more than a simple task that needs to be done. Make the most of such moments to interact with your baby. Hunger signs Your baby will show you he is hungry in any number of ways. His breathing will change, his eyes will move beneath his eyelids, he will move his arms and legs, stretch, bring his hands to his mouth or face and make sucking motions. These are all signs that your baby is hungry. You will recognize them more easily if you keep your baby close to you.368Feeding your child Feeding your babyThere's no point waiting for your baby to cry or get angry before starting to feed him. Changing a diaper to wake a sleeping baby is sometimes a good idea, but is best avoided if your little one is very hungry. Do whatever works best for you. Feeding schedule Over the first few days, most babies can't distinguish between hunger and their need to suck. They want to be fed every time they wake up. Some babies, especially those with jaundice, may remain drowsy until they regain their birth weight and sometimes may forget to wake up to feed. They need to be stimulated, even during the night, to make sure they drink enough. Keep in mind that newborn babies are in a period of intense learning. They must \"learn\" to feed, which is why they may need to feed longer and more often.As the weeks and months pass, feeding frequency and duration, like sleeping patterns, may vary from one time or one day to the next. No two babies are the same. Some babies have a regular schedule, while others are more unpredictable. As your baby gets older, feedings tend to become shorter and less frequent. Your baby's schedule depends on a variety of factors: Age Appetite Temperament and mood How effective she is at sucking and the speed at which the milk flows The time of day Breast milk is easy to digest since it is perfectly adapted to babies. Breastfed babies usually feed 8 times or more per day, especially during the first few months.Feeding your child 369 Feeding your babyMost commercial infant formulas are made from cow's milk. They take longer to digest because the baby's stomach has to work harder. This is probably why babies fed on commercial infant formula tend to feed 6 or more times a day. It's hard to tell how many times your baby will feed per day; and it's just as hard to know how much milk she will need each feeding. Instead, you will have to learn to recognize signs that your baby is hungry or full. Let her drink when she shows signs of hunger, but don't force her when she's full in the hope that she will wait longer between feeds. In the beginning, you may have difficulty understanding your baby's needs. Is she hungry? Has she drunk enough? Is she crying because she's uncomfortable and wants you to pick her up? If you get the impression that your baby is drinking too much or too little, your midwife or CLSC nurse may be able to help. \u00c9tienne St-Michel Whether you breastfeed or bottle-feed, it's important to adapt to your baby's appetite.370Feeding your child Feeding your babyIs your baby drinking enough milk? Before you go back home, make sure you can tell if your baby is feeding well and getting all the milk he needs. Talk to your midwife or a nurse at the hospital if in doubt. When your baby is feeding enough, the appearance and quantity of his stools and urine will change. Here are a few signs to help you determine if your newborn is getting enough milk. Urine Urine is darker and more concentrated over the first 2 or 3 days. Your baby may also have orange stains (urate crystals) in her diaper: this is normal for the first 2 days. In the first week, the number of times your baby pees will increase by one every day: Day 1 = 1 time Day 2 = 2 times Day 3 = 3 times, etc.After the first week, your baby will urinate at least 6 times in 24 hours if she is drinking enough milk. Each miction (urination or pee) generally contains 30 ml to 45 ml of urine. The urine is clear and odourless. Stools Over the first 2 or 3 days of your baby's life, stools will be dark and sticky; this is called meconium. Digesting milk will bring about a change in stool appearance. Gradually, they will become less sticky and a dark green colour. If your baby is drinking enough, there will be no meconium at all left in his digestive system after the fifth day. Stools will be yellow or green if he is drinking breast milk, or greenish beige if he is being fed commercial infant formulas. If your baby is drinking enough, his stools will be liquid or very soft. He may have 3 to 10 bowel movements per day over the course of the first 4 to 6 weeks. If your baby doesn't have at least one bowel movement per day, he might not be drinking enough. After 4 to 6 weeks, some babies fed with breast milk will have fewer but very substantial bowel movements even if they are drinking enough (e.g., one bowel movement every 3 to 7 days).Feeding your child 371 Feeding your babyWeight gain Even if your newborn is drinking enough, he will nonetheless lose a little weight (5 to 10%) over the first few days. He will start putting it back on again around the fourth day and will regain his birth weight by around the second week (10 to 14 days). Once your baby has regained his birth weight, he can gain between 0.6 to 1.4 kg per month until the age of 3 months. Regular weight gain is a good sign that your baby is drinking enough. There's no point weighing your baby every day to see if he is drinking enough. If you are worried that your baby is not drinking enough, contact a CLSC nurse, your midwife or your family doctor. For more information on urine, stools and the size of your infant, read The newborn , page 272 . The number of times your baby pees and poops every day is a good way to tell if she is drinking enough.Signs that your baby is drinking enough He wakes up on his own when hungry. He feeds well and often (8 times or more per day for breastfed babies and 6 times or more per day for formula-fed babies). He seems full after drinking. He pees and poops in sufficient quantities. He is putting on weight. Signs that your baby is not drinking enough He is very drowsy and very difficult to wake for feeding. His urine is dark yellow (like an adult's) or there is very little of it. There are orange stains in his urine after the first two days. His stools still contain meconium after the fifth day. He has fewer than one bowel movements per 24 hours between the age of 5 days and 4 weeks.372Feeding your child Feeding your babyGrowth spurts During your baby's first months, she will experience rapid growth spurts. Her appetite will suddenly increase and she will want to be fed more often, sometimes every hour. Such growth spurts generally last a few days and may occur at any time during the first few months. Some babies will have more growth spurts than others. Growth spurts occur most frequently around: 7 to 10 days 3 to 6 weeks 3 to 4 months During growth spurts, your baby will need to drink more and very often in order to meet her needs.Hiccups It's normal for your baby to get the hiccups, especially after drinking. Hiccups don't seem to bother babies. They will stop by themselves after a few minutes. Burping All babies swallow varying amounts of air as they drink. If your baby is calm during and after feeding, he probably doesn't need to burp. But if your baby seems to be in a bad mood or squirms while drinking, the first thing to try to calm him down is to burp him. One or two burps are usually enough, but more may be required for babies that drink quickly or from a bottle.Feeding your child 373 Feeding your babyHow to burp your baby Here's how to burp your baby: Hold your baby in an upright position against your shoulder or sit him down on your lap. Gently rub or tap his back for a few minutes. After he burps, check to see if he's still hungry. Don't insist if your baby won't burp: some babies don't. Let him be if he's asleep. He'll wake up if he needs to burp. To burp your baby, gently rub or tap his back for a few minutes. Genevi\u00e8ve Colpron374Feeding your child Feeding your babyGas Gas is perfectly normal and isn't caused by milk! Newborns' intestines start digesting milk right away after the first feedings. This new sensation may make babies uncomfortable for the first few days. They may squirm or cry and often have lots of gas. They may need to be calmed and comforted in their parents' warm arms. Even as they get older, most infants will continue to have a lot of gas. Some babies burp less and expel air this way instead. If gas is making your baby uncomfortable, try to soothe her in your arms, shifting her position or moving her legs.regurgitation Most babies regurgitate or \"spit up,\" some more than others. They may regurgitate right after feeding or a little later. Sometimes, you may have the impression your baby has regurgitated almost everything he drank, but even though it may seem a lot, most regurgitations only contain a small amount of milk. Regurgitation happens because the valve that prevents milk flowing back toward the mouth has not fully developed. Regurgitation tends to diminish at around 6 months, and stop completely around one year. Although it is a nuisance to parents, it is normal for babies.Feeding your child 375 Feeding your babyAs long as your baby is in good spirits and gaining weight, there's no reason to be concerned. Most of the time, regurgitation is perfectly harmless. It is best to see a doctor if your baby Seems to be in pain Projectile vomits several times a day Wets his diapers less than before Isn't gaining enough weightExcessive crying (colic) During the first few months, a healthy baby may cry very hard and for a long time (see Excessive crying (colic) , page 283) . Most of the time, excessive crying is completely normal and is unrelated to diet. If your baby drinks too fast, chokes and starts to cry, she may swallow lots of air. This can make her feel bloated and uncomfortable. Burp your child or take feeding breaks to soothe her.376Feeding your child Feeding your baby Feeding your child 377 Feeding your babyAllergies and intolerances Babies cannot be allergic to their mother's milk. In rare situations, they may react to certain proteins ingested by their mothers and passed on to them in her milk (see Breastfed babies and allergies , on page 574) . In rare cares, babies fed with commercial infant formulas may be intolerant to them and require a special formula. A doctor can recommend a formula adapted to your baby's needs.Social pressure In Qu\u00e9bec, the way babies are fed has changed a great deal over the past two generations. People around you will have made similar or very different choices to your own. They will regularly give you tips, information and advice. Some will be in favour of breastfeeding, others not. Some will say you should introduce other foods very early; others will tell you to wait. As a mother or father, you may end up feeling pressure to do things a certain way. Just remember that there is no single recipe for how to feed and take care of your baby. As the days go by, you will find what works best for your baby and you.378Feeding your child Feeding your babyBaby's changing needs The first few weeks are a learning experience for the whole family. Feeding your baby will become an important part of your day. And it's not always easy to know if your baby is hungry or getting enough milk. Over time, you'll fall into a routine as your baby learns to show her needs more clearly. She will become more skilled and efficient at sucking. She will spend less time feeding and sometimes drink less frequently. Feeding your baby will be easier. After 3 months, your baby will start interacting a lot with others. She will be alert and interested in everything happening around her\u2014even when she's drinking! Feeding will become a time of sharing between you and your baby.Feeding a premature baby A premature baby may not be able to feed by himself for the first few weeks. It all depends on how early he was born and how healthy and heavy he is. At the start, he may need to be fed a special formula intravenously. Then he will be able to be fed milk directly into his stomach through a tube. After that he will gradually start drinking from his mother's breast or a bottle. Premature babies' digestive systems are immature (not yet developed). Premature babies are also more susceptible to certain infections.Feeding your child 379 Feeding your babyBreast milk is easily digested and contains antibodies that help prevent infections. The medical team will encourage you to express your milk to give to your baby. Breast milk meets all the special needs of your premature baby. By expressing your milk, you are helping care for your baby. If you weren't planning to breastfeed your child, it's never too late to change your mind.If your baby is born very prematurely, minerals or calories may be added to the milk you express for a time. If your child is not breastfed, special milk for premature babies will be used.380Feeding your child Feeding your babyVitamin D: not you r ordinary vitamin! Vitamin D plays an essential role in calcium absorption and bone health. It's true that exposure to the sun's rays provides vitamin D. However, direct sunshine isn't recommended for babies. Because of this, you have to find another way to fulfill their vitamin D needs.Your healthcare professional will help you determine whether your baby needs a vitamin D supplement. If so, you can find the necessary supplements at your drug store. Your drug insurance plan should cover vitamin D supplements if you have a prescription from your doctor.Feeding your child 381 Feeding your baby Dominic RoyFEEDI nG yoUr cHIlD 382 Mahalia GagnonMilk Which milk is best? 383 Mother's milk 385 Producing breast milk 386 The composition of human milk 387 Handling expressed milk 394 Commercial infant formula (commercial milk) 398 Handling commercial infant formula 402 Other types of milk 409Feeding your child 383 MilkIn the first year of life, milk plays a crucial role in your baby's diet. In fact, it's the only food you will give your baby in the first months. In this chapter, you'll find everything you need to know about which milk to give your newborn or older baby. Mother's milk , page 385 explains what's in mother's milk, how it's produced, and how to store it.Commercial infant formula (commercial milk) , page 398 presents the different types of formula (ready-to-serve, concentrated liquids, and powders) and discusses how to prepare and store them safely. At the end of the chapter, you'll find information on cow's and other milks and the best time to introduce them.Which milk is best? Health professionals the world over recommend that babies be fed breast milk exclusively for the first six months of life. The Canadian Paediatric Society, Dieticians of Canada, and Health Canada all echo this recommendation. Once babies have started eating solid foods, it is recommended that they continue breastfeeding until the age of two years or more. Today, close to 85% of Qu\u00e9bec mothers breastfeed their babies at birth, and close to 50% continue for six months or more. You can decide to breastfeed for a few days, a few months, or over a year. It's up to you. Some women find that breastfeeding doesn't work for them, despite the benefits. Others find that breastfeeding is not what they'd expected or hoped and decide to give their babies commercial infant formula.384Feeding your child MilkIt is recommended that babies who are not fed breast milk be given cow's milk that has been processed and adapted into commercial infant formula. The baby formula industry processes cow's milk to make its nutritional content closer to that of mother's milk. But commercial infant formulas still can't match mother's milk. They don't contain the same proteins, they don't supply antibodies , and they don't provide immune factors, growth hormones or white blood cells (see The composition of human milk , page 387) . Babies who aren't fed with breast milk have a higher risk of ear infections, gastroenteritis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia and other problems.For babies who are not fed breast milk, the Canadian Paediatric Society, Dietitians of Canada and Health Canada all recommend using an infant formula enriched with iron up to the age of 9 to 12 months. Cow's milk is completely inappropriate for babies under 9 months. However you feed your baby, your baby needs you, your attention and your love. You can fulfill his need for warmth, security and affection by holding him in your arms when you feed him and maximizing skin-to-skin contact, particularly in his first few weeks. You can also massage him, take a bath with him and use a baby carrier to help you \"stay in touch.\"Feeding your child 385 MilkMother's milk The thick, yellowish milk that comes in the first few days after birth is called colostrum. Colostrum is very rich in proteins, vitamins and minerals\u2014just what your newborn needs. It supplies large amounts of white blood cells and antibodies that protect your baby from infections. It also cleans her intestines of the residues that build up before birth. Between the second and fifth day after giving birth, milk production increases rapidly. The milk becomes clearer and takes on a blueish - or yellowish-white colour. This is when your milk \"comes in.\" It is caused by hormonal changes and will happen even if you don't breastfeed your baby or express your milk. If breasts are stimulated often during this period, including at night, milk seems to come in more quickly. Frequent stimulation also helps reduce discomfort if breasts are engorged.Your milk changes over time to adapt to your baby's needs as she grows. Milk also changes over the course of a feeding and according to the time of day. A supplement of Vitamin D is recommended for breastfed babies until they are getting enough of it from their food (see Vitamin D: Not your ordinary vitamin! , page 380) .386Feeding your child MilkProducing breast milk Pregnancy hormones prepare the breasts for breastfeeding. Milk production begins at the end of pregnancy, which is why some women experience some leaking during this time. Whether your baby is born on his due date or earlier, there will be milk for him. When milk is removed from the breast, it stimulates the breast to produce more. This stimulation can come from the sucking action of your nursing baby or from expressing milk by hand or with a breast pump. Your breasts will produce milk as long as your baby nurses or the milk is expressed.The breast produces milk continuously all day long. It accumulates in breasts waiting for your baby to nurse or for the milk to be expressed. The speed at which milk is produced depends on how much milk has accumulated in the breast. Breasts have a natural mechanism that adjusts to the baby's needs and prevents the mother from being uncomfortable. It works like this: The more the breast is emptied, the more quickly it will produce milk. The longer the breast is left full, the more slowly it will produce milk. The more often the breasts are emptied, the more milk they will make. The less often the breasts are emptied, the less milk they will make.Feeding your child 387 MilkIf the breasts are stimulated more often, milk production self-adjusts in a few days. If you gradually stop removing milk from your breasts, they will progressively stop producing it. This will prevent your breasts from becoming engorged and sore. If you stop all at once, your breasts will become engorged and stop making milk after a few days. Each breast produces milk independently. If only one breast is stimulated, the other breast will stop making milk within a few weeks.The more often the breasts are emptied, the more milk they will produce.The composition of human milk Breast milk composition changes throughout the breastfeeding period to adapt to your baby's needs and age. Breast milk is made up of proteins, sugars, and all the fats your baby needs, including omega 3 fatty acids that support brain and eye development. It provides each baby with the exact amount of vitamins and minerals they need to develop, with the exception of vitamin D (see Vitamin D: Not your ordinary vitamin! , page 380) . What's more, it contains enzymes that facilitate digestion. Breast milk has antibodies that help your baby fight infections and develop his immune system . It is also rich in good bacteria that are thought to provide him with lifelong protection. To date, over 200 components have been identified in human milk. Certain factors influence the composition and taste of breast milk.388Feeding your child MilkWhat influences the composition of milk The mother's diet Drinking a lot of fluids doesn't increase the amount of milk you produce. While you're breastfeeding, you'll naturally be thirstier than usual. Listen to your body\u2014you don't need to force yourself to drink a lot. However, if you notice your urine is dark or cloudy, it means you're not drinking enough. There aren't any foods that increase milk production. Eat regularly and eat enough. You can also have snacks if you're hungry. Some foods can have a slight effect on the taste of the milk you produce, but your baby will adapt. Some studies suggest that it can help babies develop their taste for food if mothers eat a varied diet while breastfeeding.Most breastfeeding mothers can eat whatever they like, including foods deemed risky during your pregnancy (sushi, deli meats, cheese). If you think your baby is having a reaction to something you're eating, read Breastfed babies and allergies , page 574 . Eat foods rich in protein, iron, calcium and Vitamin D. It might be a good idea to consult a nutritionist. If you are a vegan (i.e., you don't eat any animal products, that is, meat, fish, eggs or milk products) and you are breastfeeding, you should take a Vitamin B 12 supplement.Feeding your child 389 MilkFish Fish belongs on your menu. However, some fish species absorb pollutants that make their way into breast milk and could harm a baby. To take advantage of the benefits of eating fish while minimizing the risk from contaminants such as mercury, read Fish and seafood, page 88 . Coffee, tea, chocolate, herbal tea and other drinks Caffeine passes into breast milk. If you consume a lot of it, it can make your baby nervous and irritable until the caffeine is eliminated from his system. Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, energy drinks, chocolate, and some soft drinks.Energy drinks are not recommended while breastfeeding because they contain other substances that might harm your baby. Other products (coffee, tea, etc.), may be consumed in moderation, up to two cups or so per day. Decaffeinated drinks such as cereal-based beverages and herbal tea can be good substitutes for caffeinated beverages.390Feeding your child MilkAlcohol Any alcohol you do drink goes into your breast milk and into your bloodstream. Depending on your weight, it takes your body two to three hours to eliminate the alcohol from one drink from your blood and milk. Once the alcohol is gone from your bloodstream, there is none in the breast milk for the next feeding. Even though a breastfeeding baby only receives a tiny share of the alcohol his mother drinks, he eliminates it more slowly than an adult and his system is more sensitive to its effects. Avoid drinking large quantities of alcohol while breastfeeding. Alcohol can interfere with milk production and reduce the amount of milk your baby drinks. It may also have harmful effects on his motor development and sleeping habits.Breastfeeding mothers can enjoy the occasional alcoholic beverage. The benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the risks of occasional light alcohol consumption (around two drinks a week or less). This level of consumption has not been shown to harm a nursing baby. If you do have a drink, you can reduce your baby's exposure to alcohol in one of these ways: Breastfeed your baby right before having a drink. Or wait 2 to 3 hours per serving of alcohol before nursing again. After waiting, simply nurse normally at the next feeding. If you have more than one serving, feed your baby milk you expressed in advance (frozen or refrigerated) while the alcohol remains in your system. You may need to express milk to relieve engorgement of your breasts, but this milk should be discarded because it contains more alcohol.Feeding your child 391 MilkTo find out how long it takes for your body to eliminate alcohol according to your weight, visit beststart.org/resources/alc_reduction/pdf/brstfd_alc_deskref_eng.pdf . Size of a standard drink 340 ml or 12 oz of beer (5% alcohol) 140 ml or 5 oz of wine (12% alcohol) 85 ml or 3 oz of fortified wine (e.g., Port wine) (20% alcohol)45 ml or 1.5 oz of spirits (40% alcohol) Illustrations : Maur ice Gervais= = = If you have questions about alcohol consumption while breastfeeding, talk to your health professional or call the Motherisk Helpline at 1-877-327-4636 . Good to know ... In Canada, one serving or 1 drink = 13.6 g (17 ml) of pure alcoholEach serving or glass of an alcoholic beverage takes 2 to 3 hours to be eliminated from your blood and milk.392Feeding your child MilkTobacco Tobacco is harmful to your baby when you're breastfeeding, just as it is during pregnancy. Tobacco can interfere with milk production. Nicotine from tobacco also passes into breast milk and can cause crying, irritability and insomnia. Try to avoid smoking just before feeding. Talk to your doctor if you are thinking about using pharmacological aids such as patches or nicotine gum to quit smoking. Even if you do smoke, breastfeeding provides many benefits for you and your baby, including protecting him from respiratory infections.Cannabis and other drugs Drug use and exposure to second-hand drug smoke is not recommended during breastfeeding. It is not known what effect a nursing mother's use of marijuana and other cannabis derivatives might have on her baby, but it is a source of concern. Other drugs, such as amphetamines, cocaine, heroin, LSD and PCP pass into breast milk and are dangerous for your baby.Feeding your child 393 MilkMedications Most medications pass into breast milk, but in very small amounts. Some medications are a better choice because more is known about their effects on nursing babies. Many medications may be taken while breastfeeding, including acetaminophen, ibuprofen and most antibiotics. Decongestants containing pseudoephedrine can reduce milk production. It's best to ask your pharmacist to recommend another product.Talk to a health professional before taking any medication or natural health product. Some medications may decrease your milk supply or cause other problems. It's very rare to have to stop breastfeeding because of medical treatment. If a health professional advises you to stop breastfeeding because of a medication, here's what you can do: Say that breastfeeding is important to you and your baby. Ask if there are any medications that can be taken while breastfeeding instead.394Feeding your child MilkExposure to contaminants In Qu\u00e9bec, environmental pollution is not generally a problem for breastfeeding mothers and babies. Breastfeeding mothers who come in contact with or breathe in chemical substances contained in household products may pass these substances on in small amounts to their babies through breast milk. This is only a problem in the case of regular and prolonged exposure, such as occurs at work. In day-to-day life, exposure to the following products on an occasional basis is nothing to worry about: At the hairdresser: hair styling products, dyes and perms At the dentist: local anaesthetic, fillings and root canals In the home: latex paint and varnish, home cleaning productsIf you work in an environment where you are exposed to contaminants like solvents, inks or dyes that may be dangerous to your breastfed baby, you may be eligible for reassignment or preventative withdrawal (see For a Safe Maternity Experience program , page 777) . You can also consult your doctor. Handling expressed milk Before handling expressed milk, make sure your hands, breast pump and accessories are clean. Storing breast milk Breast milk is best when fresh and taken directly from the breast, but it refrigerates and freezes well, too. If you only feed expressed breast milk to your baby, it's preferable to use freshly expressed or refrigerated milk. Prolonged freezing slightly reduces the nutritional value of breast milk. However, it's still better than any other milk.Feeding your child 395 MilkBreast milk can be kept in glass or hard plastic containers or even in special, thicker baby bottle liners designed for breast milk. Baby bottle liners for commercial formulas are too thin and don't freeze as well. They need to be doubled up because they are too fragile. Milk that has just been expressed or taken out of the refrigerator can be kept at room temperature for up to 4 hours. If it will be used later than that, keep it in the refrigerator. If you don't plan to use it within 8 days, freeze it as soon as possible. You can put it straight in the freezer after expressing it. Here are a few tips: Save milk in different amounts (between 30 and 90 ml) to reduce waste. Don't fill containers past 2/3 full. Liquids take more space after they freeze. If you want to store a lot of milk in a single container, put it in the refrigerator until you have the amount you want. Mark the date on the container and seal it tightly. Store milk in the back of the freezer away from the door to avoid changes in temperature. You can put all your frozen breast milk containers inside a larger, tightly closing container. Use the oldest milk first. If the fresh, refrigerated or thawed milk has been warmed up but your baby changes her mind, you don't need to discard it unless it has been in contact with bacteria from your baby's mouth. You can keep it in the refrigerator for 4 hours or more. Use it for the next feeding; otherwise you'll need to throw it out. Information on thawing milk can be found under Warming milk , page 501 .396Feeding your child MilkBreast milk storage time Room temperature Refrigerator Freezer* Fresh breast milk 4 hours at 26\u00b0C (79\u00b0F) 24 hours at 15\u00b0C (59\u00b0F) (in a cooler with ice pack)8 days at 4\u00b0C (39\u00b0F) 6 months (refrigerator freezer, but not in the door) 12 months (chest freezer) Previously frozen breast milk 1 hour 24 hours Do not refreeze * The freezer temperature must be cold enough to keep ice cream hard (-18\u00b0C or 0\u00b0F). The storage times in the table above don't always apply for hospitalized babies. For hospitalized babies, follow the recommendations of the hospital staff.Warning Storage times can't be added together. For example, you can't keep milk for 4 hours at room temperature, then put it in the refrigerator or freeze it.Feeding your child 397 MilkAppearance of expressed milk Expressed breast milk doesn't look like cow's milk or commercial infant formula. Since it's not homogenized, it separates after a while and the cream floats to the surface. Warm milk just needs a shake to mix it together again. Human milk can have a whitish, bluish, yellowish or brownish tinge. The colour and smell of breast milk can vary From one mother to the next According to the mother's diet Depending on the baby's age Depending on whether the milk was expressed at the beginning or the end of a feeding C\u00e9cile Fortin Expressed breast milk separates after a while and the cream floats to the surface. Don't throw it out\u2014it's still good! The amount of cream varies from one time to the next and from one mother to another.398Feeding your child MilkThe smell and taste of some mother's milk changes when the milk is refrigerated or frozen. This is caused by lipase, an enzyme that helps babies digest fats. The digestive process can begin while the milk is still in its container. Don't worry\u2014it's still good for your baby. Some babies don't like the taste of refrigerated or frozen milk and refuse to drink it. Sometimes you can solve the problem by freezing your milk without refrigerating it first. If that doesn't work, try Heating it to just below the boiling point Then, cool it off immediately And freeze it This will deactivate the lipasecommercial infant formula (commercial milk) The Canadian Paediatric Society, Dietitians of Canada, and Health Canada recommend that babies not fed on breast milk be given iron-enriched commercial infant formula up to the age of 9 to 12 months. When properly prepared, commercial infant formula is a safe alternative to breast milk. Unlike cow's milk, goat's milk and soya drinks, commercial infant formula is adapted to meet infants' basic needs. Pay attention to the expiration date: don't buy formula if the date on the can has passed. Return any dented, bulging, or abnormally shaped container to the store.Feeding your child 399 MilkWhich formula to choose? To prevent anemia , it is recommended babies be fed iron-enriched formula right from birth. Most parents wonder what brand of commercial infant formula is the best. Companies advertise their products extensively to parents, doctors, nurses, and nutritionists. Each sales representative will say that their product is better than the others or that it is closer to mother's milk. Additives and claims listed on product labels are only there to boost sales. They are of no benefit to your baby and can even be misleading.Most babies have no problem changing brands, but others can be bothered by it, especially during the first few days. If this is the case with your baby, avoid changing brands too often. To date, there is no proof that one brand is better than another. Commercial infant formulas are comparable in quality.400Feeding your child MilkReady-to-serve, liquid, or powdered Commercial infant formula is sold in three forms: Ready-to-serve Concentrated liquid Powdered The same brand of formula may look different in its ready -to-serve form than it does when prepared from concentrated liquid or powder, but the composition and nutritional value remain the same. You can use any of these forms or alternate depending on the situation, (e.g., at home, on an outing). Remember, however, that powdered infant formulas are not recommended for premature babies or those with health problems (e.g., heart problems).Characteristics of the different forms of commercial infant formula Ready-to-Serve Sterile at time of purchase. Easiest to use. Is used as is. Very expensive. Concentrated liquid Sterile at time of purchase. Easier to use and safer than powdered form. Must be diluted with water. Costs about the same as powder. Powdered Not sterile at time of purchase. Greater risk of contamination because it requires more handling. Requires greater care during the dilution step than concentrated liquid. Costs about the same as concentrated liquid.Feeding your child 401 MilkRead the label carefully to make sure you buy the desired product. It is easy to confuse concentrated liquid formula with the ready-to-serve variety. If you do, you run the risk of giving your baby undiluted concentrate, thinking it is a ready-to-serve product. \"Transition\" formulas There is a range of commercial infant formulas on the market for babies 6 months and over. There are even products for babies age 12 to 36 months. These products are cheaper than commercial infant formula, but much more expensive than cow's milk. \"Transition\" formula is not suitable for babies under 6 months because it contains too much calcium.Compared to commercial infant formula, transition products can be a cheaper alternative for babies age 6 to 12 months, but they are not necessary. You can continue using your regular formula until you start feeding your baby cow's milk around the age of 9 to 12 months. For babies over 9 months who eat a varied diet, transition formula is no better from a nutritional point of view than cow's milk. Soy-based infant formula Commercial infant formula made from soy protein is suitable for babies whose families don't consume dairy products or for babies with certain health problems. However, using soy-based infant formula does not reduce excessive crying in infants.402Feeding your child MilkSpecial infant formulas In rare cases, babies fed with a commercial infant formula may have trouble tolerating formula. Talk to a doctor if this seems to be the case. The doctor can recommend a special formula for your baby. Special formulas are intended for babies with specific problems, such as allergies or severe intolerances. Medical insurance plans reimburse the cost of certain products when purchased with a prescription. If your baby has trouble tolerating commercial infant formula, you can also go back to breastfeeding (see Restarting milk production , page 451) .Handling commercial infant formula Diluting commercial infant formula requires care and certain precautions. It is important to avoid mistakes so as not to contaminate the milk with bacteria. Among the different types of commercial formulas, powdered products require the most care because they are not sterile and may contain bacteria. Bacteria may get into powdered formula at the factory where it was manufactured, or at home when you use the container and the measuring scoop provided. Some babies have gotten sick after drinking milk made from powdered formula contaminated with bacteria. To avoid contamination, you can do two things: Destroy bacteria Prevent bacteria from developing and multiplyingFeeding your child 403 MilkFor premature, immunocompromised, and low -birt h-weigh t babies, it is recommended to destroy bacteria when preparing powdered formula. For term babies who are in good health, it is sufficient to prevent bacteria from developing, although you can also destroy bacteria if you wish. To destroy bacteria , prepare the infant formula using very hot water. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended using boiled water cooled to 70\u00b0C or higher to prepare powdered formula. To ensure the water is hot enough, use it within less than 30 minutes after boiling. It is preferable to follow the WHO recommendations, even if they differ from the manufacturer's directions.To prevent bacteria from developing, prepare the infant formula with boiled water that has been cooled to room temperature. Once the formula is prepared, it's best to serve it immediately. Formula that's prepared in advance can also be kept in the refrigerator at 4\u00b0C for a maximum of 24 hours. Never use hot tap water to prepare infant formula because it is more likely to contain lead, contaminants, and bacteria. Until your baby is 4 months old, boil cold water.404Feeding your child MilkFirst step For all types of formula Here's how to prepare infant baby formula. Regardless of the type of formula you use, the first step is always the same. Clean the work surface. Wash your hands thoroughly. Sterilize and assemble all the required equipment and utensils*. Clean the formula container with hot water before opening it with a clean can opener. * For additional information on sterilizing and using baby bottles, see Cleaning bottles, nipples and breast pumps , page 507 .Second step Depending on the type of formula Concentrated liquid Powder Note: Follow the manufacturer's directions to the letter regarding the quantities of powdered formula and water to use.Ready-to-serve For babies under 4 months: For babies under 4 months: Pour the formula into the baby bottles. Immediately put the nipples and caps back on the bottles. If any ready-to-serve formula remains in the can, cover the can and put it in the refrigerator. Fill a saucepan with cold tap water. Bring to a rolling boil for one minute. Mix equal quantities of boiled water and concentrated liquid formula. Stir to mix well. Cool the mixture rapidly in cold water before putting it in the refrigerator or feeding it to your baby. If any concentrated liquid formula remains in the can, cover the can and put it in the refrigerator. Fill a saucepan with cold tap water. Bring to a rolling boil for one minute*. Pour the recommended quantity of water into the baby bottle or other container. Measure the powdered formula with the measuring scoop provided; scoop size varies from one brand to the next. Add the required quantity of powdered formula to the water. Stir to mix well. If needed, cool the mixture rapidly in cold water before feeding it to your baby or putting it in the refrigerator. Wash the measuring scoop and put it away in a sealable bag or clean container to protect it from dust. Do not put it back in the can in order to avoid contamination. For babies 4 months and over: For babies 4 months and over: Follow the same directions, but you can use cold, unboiled tap water. Follow the same directions, but you can use cold, unboiled tap water. * To know what temperature of water to use when preparing powdered formula, see page 403 .Feeding your child 405 MilkSecond step Depending on the type of formula Concentrated liquid Powder Note: Follow the manufacturer's directions to the letter regarding the quantities of powdered formula and water to use.Ready-to-serve For babies under 4 months: For babies under 4 months: Pour the formula into the baby bottles.

First, observe your baby. Does he seem uncomfortable? How long does commercial infant formula keep? Room temperature Refrigerator Freezer Milk reconstituted from concentrated liquid or powderMaximum 2 hours 24 hours Close the can properlyDo not freeze Open can of liquid formula (concentrated liquid or ready-to-serve)Maximum 2 hours 48 hours Close the can properlyDo not freeze Open can of powder 1 month if kept dry Unnecessary Do not freezeMost babies have no problem if a mistake like this is only made once or twice. If it happens more often, it can cause digestive or kidney problems, dehydration, or insufficient weight gain. If you are worried or your baby seems sick, see a doctor or call Info-Sant\u00e9 ( 8-1-1 ).Always check the expiration date before giving commercial infant formula to your baby.Feeding your child 407 Milk Marie-Christine Hogue408Feeding your child Milk Feeding your child 409 Milkother types of milk Cow's milk Cow's milk should never be given to a baby under 9 months old because it contains too much protein and too many minerals for baby's kidneys to handle. Cow's milk does not provide enough lactose or linoleic acid, a fatty acid required for the development of your baby's nervous system and brain. In addition, it does not contain enough vitamin A, B 1, B6, C, D, and E, copper, manganese, or iron. It deprives your baby of important protein building blocks like taurine, cysteine, and alpha-lactalbumin, and it doesn't provide the immune protection of mother's milk. Cow's milk is completely unsuitable for infants under 9 months old.Before 9 months - Cow's milk often causes anemia because it contains very little iron, reduces intake of other foods, and can cause bleeding in the intestine. This light bleeding is often invisible to the naked eye. If you are thinking of giving cow's milk to your baby before age 9 months of age because commercial infant formula is too expensive, contact your CLSC for information about financial assistance you can apply for. After 9 months - You can start giving your baby cow's milk, but not more than 750 ml (25 oz) a day. Buy pasteurized whole milk (3.25% milk fat).410Feeding your child MilkIntroducing cow's milk Your child can start drinking cow's milk at 9 months, providing she eats a varied diet. Every day she should eat Iron-rich foods (e.g., meat, meat alternatives, iron -enriched baby cereals) Vegetables and fruit Otherwise, wait till your baby is 12 months old before introducing cow's milk.If you give cow's milk to your child, choose whole milk (3.25% milk fat): Ordinary homogenized milk, enriched with vitamin D or Unsweetened evaporated milk, enriched with vitamins C and D, diluted in an equal quantity of water Cow's milk can be introduced gradually. You can begin by replacing some of the breast milk or commercial infant formula with cow's milk. Then you can gradually increase the proportion of cow's milk at each feeding.Feeding your child 411 MilkDo not serve 2% or skimmed milk Young children need fat for growth and brain development. It's better to avoid giving them 2% milk before age 2. Do not serve them 1% or skimmed milk. You can continue serving whole milk (3.25% milk fat) to your child throughout early childhood, up to school age. Never serve sweetened concentrated milk.Pasteurized goat's milk For infants, goat's milk has the same disadvantages as cow's milk. It is also low in folic acid and vitamin D, although goat's milk enriched with folic acid and vitamin D is available at grocery stores. Like cow's milk, you can start serving goat's milk to your child between the ages of 9 and 12 months. Choose pasteurized whole goat's milk (3.25% milk fat). Some people recommend goat's milk for preventing or treating allergies to the proteins in cow's milk. Unfortunately, goat's milk often causes the same reactions. Many children who are allergic to cow's milk are also allergic to goat's milk.412Feeding your child MilkEnriched soy drinks Enriched soy drinks are not suitable for infants. They are incomplete and much less nutritious than breast milk or even commercial infant formulas. Since babies grow very rapidly, they need a complete, balanced diet. These drinks can hinder your baby's growth. Soy drinks contain fewer calories and less fat than whole cow's milk (3.25% milk fat). This is why it is recommended that you wait till your child has reached 2 years of age before serving her soy drinks.Some parents want to serve soy drinks to younger children. You can give your child soy drinks after 1 year of age, as long as she eats a varied diet and is growing normally. Make sure that the soy drink you choose for your 1 to 2 year old has the following terms listed on the label: \"Enriched,\" because drinks that are not enriched do not provide enough nutrients to meet the needs of a young child \"Plain\" or \"Original,\" because \"light\" or flavoured drinks are not suitable Shake the drink container well (around fifteen times) before serving to make sure the nutrients are well mixed, especially the calcium.Feeding your child 413 MilkWhy serve pasteurized milk It is essential to pasteurize animal milk. In fact, the sale of unpasteurized milk is illegal in Canada. Many diseases can be transmitted through raw or unpasteurized milk, including poliomyelitis, typhoid, encephalitis, tuberculosis, diarrhea, salmonella and brucellosis. The pasteurized milk sold in food stores is just as nutritious as raw milk and poses no risks to your child's health. Do not give raw (unpasteurized) milk to your child, even if the milk comes from a perfectly healthy herd.Industrial pasteurization consists of heating the milk very rapidly to very high temperatures, and then cooling it equally rapidly. The process only takes a few seconds. Dangerous microorganisms are destroyed and the nutritional value of the milk remains unchanged. It is recommended that you not try to pasteurize milk at home. It is too slow, less effective, and causes significant loss of milk's natural nutrients : vitamins A, B 1, B2, B6, B12, C, D, and folic acid.FEEDI nG yoUr cHIlD 414 Ren\u00e9 DeryBreastfeeding your baby Breastfeeding: A learned skill 415 Getting help 416 Your breasts during nursing 418 Breastfeeding, step by step 421 How often to nurse\u2014and how long? 432 Breastfeeding phases 437 Is breastfeeding still possible? 444 Expressing milk 452 Combining breast and bottle 462 Weaning 466 Breastfeeding problems and solutions 468Feeding your child 415 Breastfeeding your babyIn this chapter, you'll find information on how to breastfeed, express milk, use a breast pump and wean your infant. Information on breast milk, how it is produced and how to get milk production off to a good start can be found under Mother's milk , page 385 . Breastfeeding: A learned skill As your baby snuggles up to your breast right after delivery, the act of nursing for the first time will soothe your baby and help stabilize his body temperature. Breastfeeding sustains the relationship that started between you and your baby during pregnancy. Breastfeeding, like giving birth, is totally natural. And just as it's normal to have assistance during delivery, it's normal to need help with breastfeeding, especially at the beginning. While your milk will come in on its own, you will need to learn how to breastfeed. Louis Guilbault Breastfeeding promotes a closer mother-child bond.416Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyThe first days with a new baby are an intense experience. Your baby will need frequent attention and will nurse at any time of day and night. The initial weeks of breastfeeding are critical because they are a time of adaptation and learning. Mastering the technique of latching the baby to your breast is your first priority. Give yourself plenty of time, and have confidence in yourself and your new baby. As you gain experience, getting your baby to latch onto the breast will become easier. With time, you and your little one will come to enjoy the nursing experience more and more. Learning to breastfeed is a little like learning to dance. At first, you focus on your steps, not the music. But with time and practice, you forget the technique and the music carries you away.Getting help There are many resources for breastfeeding mothers. Depending on where you live, you may be able to find IBCLC lactation consultants (International Board Certified Lactation Consultants) or clinics or doctors that specialize in breastfeeding. You also might discover that your local CLSC or local breastfeeding mentor group has the best-trained breastfeeding resources in your area. If you encounter problems, it's important to contact a person trained in breastfeeding. If that person can't help you, she will be able to suggest other resources that can.Feeding your child 417 Breastfeeding your babyCommunity breastfeeding support groups can provide a great deal of information and advice. They are run and led by women who have nursed one or more children. They keep their knowledge up-to-date and offer support at no charge. Most of these community groups hold information sessions to help parents and parents-to-be prepare for breastfeeding. A number of them also offer specialized services from IBCLC lactation consultants. Check with organizations in your area to find out what's available. Ask your CLSC for contact information. Various CLSC professionals \u2014like nurses or nutritionists\u2014 can also be of help. Nurses offer home visits after your baby arrives. Depending on where you live, these visits are either automatic or based on your needs. Your nurse can start helping you as soon as you return home, or later on. She can weigh your baby, check her overall health and help you with breastfeeding technique.The Info-Sant\u00e9 telephone helpline is staffed by nurses and is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, throughout the province. Just call 8-1-1. An IBCLC lactation consultant can help you deal with breastfeeding difficulties that you may experience. The IBCLC credential\u2014for International Board Certified Lactation Consultant\u2014certifies that they have the necessary skills. Some healthcare institutions and community breastfeeding support groups offer the services of IBCLC lactation consultants. Many of them are in private practice from either their homes or offices. To learn more or find the IBCLC consultant nearest you, visit the AQC website (Association consultantes child Breastfeeding your babyBreastfeeding clinics can be found in many areas. They offer more specialized services\u2014from nurses, IBCLC lactation consultants and sometimes doctors\u2014which may or may not be free. Clinics can be very helpful if you are experiencing problems. Your doctor will examine your baby on a regular basis. If you're worried about your child's health, the best person to turn to is your doctor, who can also help if your breasts or nipples become infected. Midwives provide followup for their patients up to six weeks after delivery.If you have special problems, all of these individuals should be able to direct you to other sources of help.your breasts during nursing Breast and nipple shape Breast and nipple shape, size and colour vary from one woman to another, and sometimes even from one breast to the other. Most newborns adapt easily to their mothers' breasts. For unknown reasons, however, there are some babies who have more difficulty latching onto flat or inverted nipples. Breast care The breasts are often bigger and heavier during the first six weeks of breastfeeding. Whether or not you choose to wear a bra depends on your comfort. Nursing bras are usually more practical than regular bras, but you don't have to wear one. Regardless of what you choose, your bra should be comfortable and large enough to avoid squeezing your breasts. Don't hesitate to sleep barebreasted if you feel comfortable doing so.Feeding your child 419 Breastfeeding your babyIf you use nursing pads, choose cotton or disposable ones without a plastic lining and be sure to change them often. A daily shower or bath is all you need to keep your breasts clean. Creams, ointments and other products are not necessary. You don't need to wash your breasts each time you nurse; this may irritate them. However, washing your hands with soap and water before nursing is the best way to prevent infections. When your milk comes in Having your milk \"come in\" is a normal phase of milk production. It generally happens between the second and fifth days after delivery. Your breasts become warmer, the appearance of the milk changes and production increases rapidly. Most women also find that their breasts become larger.Some women experience no discomfort when their milk comes in. But for most women it can be uncomfortable, especially if their breasts become engorged and firm to the touch. To ease the discomfort, which generally lasts from 24 to 48 hours, thorough and frequent feedings (8 times or more during a 24-hour period) are recommended at regular intervals, both day and night. Your baby will generally want to nurse more often during this phase, which will ease the discomfort in your breasts and help him gain weight. What if he has difficulty latching on because the breast is too firm, or your breasts become painful? You'll find advice in the table entitled Engorgement , page 492 .420Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyProducing a good supply of milk Milk production is a matter of supply and demand. The more your breasts are stimulated, the more milk they'll produce. To get milk production off to a good start during the first few days Nurse your child or express milk within 6 hours of delivery to stimulate your breasts Nurse your child or express milk at least 8 times during a 24-hour period, with no more than 6 hours between Express your milk if your baby isn't sucking effectively or latching on properly. During the first few days, expressing manually is often more effective than using a breast pump Milk production fluctuates during the first 4 to 6 weeks, depending on demand. That's why it's important to stimulate the breasts during the day and at night during this phase.Some women produce substantial milk without much stimulation, even if breastfeeding was difficult for them at the start. For others, however, milk production can be less reliable, decreasing as soon as stimulation lets up or becomes more infrequent. A person trained in breastfeeding can often help new mothers increase milk production, especially during the first weeks (see Insufficient milk production , page 480) . Let-down reflex Stimulating the breasts also results in the release of oxytocin into the bloodstream. Oxytocin is a hormone that causes the breasts to contract and expel milk. This is known as the \"let-down reflex.\"Feeding your child 421 Breastfeeding your babyThis reflex might be triggered when you put your baby to your breast, or if you stimulate the nipple and areola when expressing milk. Just hearing your baby cry or thinking about him can trigger the let-down reflex, too. It ensures that milk will be available when your baby begins nursing. It's not unusual to experience the let-down reflex several times while nursing. The results typically last from 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Some women feel a tightening or tingling in the breast; others feel no sensation. During the first few days after delivery, you may experience intense thirst and uterine contractions in conjunction with the let-down reflex. During the let-down reflex, milk flows more rapidly and babies will swallow more quickly for several minutes. Sometimes the let-down reflex is so strong that your baby will need to let go of the breast to take a breath of air. Women expressing milk can see the pace quicken and even notice spurts during the let-down reflex.Breastfeeding, step by step Mothers have been breastfeeding their babies since time immemorial, and each nursing mother and child discover their own style. This section will guide you step by step, explaining what to do so your child nurses properly and effectively. A person trained in breastfeeding can provide help if you need it. Pick the right time (signs of hunger) It's hard to get a baby who is upset or crying to nurse. As soon as you see signs that your baby is hungry, offer her your breast (see Hunger signs , page 367) . That way she'll be more patient and cooperative, especially if it takes a couple of tries to latch on.422Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyFind a comfortable position Give yourself plenty of time for your first breastfeeding sessions. Take a few minutes to make sure you're comfortably settled. There are various positions, so choose the one that feels best for you: cradle, cross-cradle, football or lying down. Whichever you choose, your baby's whole body is turned toward your breast, with her ear, shoulder and hip forming a straight line. Cross-cradle position With a newborn, the cross-cradle position offers two advantages: it allows you to properly support your baby and to clearly see how she latches on (see picture page 424) . Many mothers find it useful during the first weeks of breastfeeding. In this position, the baby rests on the arm opposite the breast she is nursing from. If you are nursing from the right breast, you support your baby with your left arm. Hold your baby in place against your breast by supporting his bottom with your forearm. Anouk Jolin A comfortable chair, music, cushions or pillows and a glass of water or milk will help you relax.Feeding your child 423 Breastfeeding your babyYour fingers, with the exception of the thumb, should support the weight of your baby's head in a way that still allows for some freedom of movement. The palm of your left hand should be placed beneath his shoulder blades, not behind the head (as shown in the photos). Avoid putting pressure on the head with your fingers or the palm of your hand. Babies don't seem to like this. They draw their heads back and some may have difficulty latching back on. If this happens, readjust your position. Hold your right breast with your right hand. Your thumb should rest on the outer site of the breast and the other fingers on the inner side, far from the nipple and areola , forming a \"U\" (see picture page 435 ). Lying-down position Breastfeeding while lying down is enjoyable and can promote rest (see picture page 425) . Most mothers really like this position once latching on becomes easier. If you tend to doze or sleep while nursing, follow the recommendations on page 295 to make sure your baby stays safe. Marie-Jos\u00e9e Santerre C\u00e9cile Fortin Yes No424Feeding your position child Breastfeeding your babyBringing baby to your breast Whether you choose a seated or reclining position, make sure that your baby latches on to more than just the nipple; she should also be taking much of the areola , adjacent to the nipple, in her mouth. If your baby reaches for the breast at this point, her hands may end up in her mouth before your breast does. If this happens, ask the child's father or someone else close to you to gently hold the baby's hands. As soon as she latches on and starts sucking, you'll see her hands relax.You'll need to coordinate your movements with that of the baby as she opens her mouth. It's the baby who latches onto the breast, but you must bring her close to it at the right moment. You'll be more comfortable if you don't lean toward the child. During your baby's early weeks, feeling the breast near her mouth stimulates the sucking reflex. If your child sees your breast but doesn't sense it against her face, she will probably not open her mouth very wide. Bringing her close enough so her chin grazes your breast will probably make her open her mouth more willingly. With your help, your baby will learn how to latch on and will soon be almost able to do it alone.Feeding your child 427 Breastfeeding your babyHow to bring your baby to your breast Once both of you are settled, you're ready to bring your baby to your breast: 1. When her chin touches your breast, gently brush your nipple against her upper lip. 2. Wait till she opens her mouth wide, as if she were going to yawn or take a bite out of a large apple.3. At this point, quickly bring your baby to the breast, supporting her shoulder blades with the palm of your hand: Her head should be tilted backwards just a tiny bit. Her lower lip should touch your breast first, with the nipple very near the upper lip. Your nipple should point toward her palate, not her tongue.During the first few days, you may have to start over several times to get your baby to latch on properly. She might sometimes close her mouth partially or completely before getting to the breast. This can be painful for you. Latching on takes a little time in the beginning. But with practice, your baby will learn and everything will become easier. 1 2 3 Jean-Claude Mercier428Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyLatching on When your baby latches onto your breast, and not only the nipple, he will have a large part of the areola in his mouth. This makes it easier to get milk. If the baby sucks mainly on the nipple, painful cracks may result and he will get less milk. Some babies will then ask to nurse more often, which will irritate the nipples even more. Others will get tired and fall asleep before they're full.Signs of a good latch: The baby's mouth is wide open. He latches onto not only the nipple only but also a large part of the areola. His lips are curled outward. His lower lip covers a larger part of the areola than the top lip does. If needed, gently press your breast to reveal the lips. His chin touches your breast and his nose is free. You can hear or see him swallow. Latching on shouldn't be painful for you.Feeding your child 429 Breastfeeding your baby If you feel pain, try bringing the baby to your breast again. You can also try to improve the latch. In some cases, you can gently lower your baby's chin to reposition his lower lip once he's nursing. If that doesn't work or pain persists, contact someone trained in breastfeeding. How to tell if your baby is sucking effectively When your baby sucks effectively, you can see motion in the jaw. When she first starts to nurse, the movements are quick and light. As milk starts flowing, the movements become slower and deeper. You can see and hear your baby swallow. If you experience painful nipples, try to improve the latch. Nursing shouldn't be painful. Latching on properly is the key to pain-free nursing! Marie-Jos\u00e9e Santerre430Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyIf your baby's breathing is noisy during nursing, free up her nose by pressing her bottom against you to bring her chin closer to your breast. Don't worry, she won't suffocate. If she has trouble breathing she will release the breast. In some cases, you might need to press gently on your breast with your finger to free up her nose. Breaking the suction It's important to break the suction properly when removing your baby from your breast, to avoid hurting your nipples. To break the suction 1. Put your finger in the corner of your baby's mouth between the gums, if needed 2. The nipple will release easily once the suction is correctly broken Marie-Jos\u00e9e Santerre 1 2Feeding your child 431 Breastfeeding your child Breastfeeding your babyHow often to nurse\u2014and how long? How often you nurse varies a great deal from one baby to another. What's important is that your baby latches on properly, nurses effectively and swallows your milk. Mother's milk is rapidly digested, and infants' stomachs are small, so it's normal to breastfeed frequently during the first weeks of life. When you're at the learning stage, the process of nursing, stimulating, burping and diaper -chan ging can take from 45 to 90 minutes. With time, as your baby develops the ability to nurse more effectively, breastfeedings will become shorter and less frequent. During growth spurts, your baby will nurse more frequently during the day and at night\u2014sometimes as often as every hour. Frequent breastfeeding increases milk production. This is a passing phase, but it's a very intense one for moms. Family support can be very important during these periods.Giving your baby commercial infant formula or baby cereal results in less stimulation for your breasts and may interfere with milk production. Does your baby seem satisfied after nursing, only to seek your breast 15 or 20 minutes later? That's completely normal, especially during the first weeks. Don't hesitate to nurse again for a little \"dessert\". When you're breastfeeding, don't watch the clock\u2014watch your little one. Trying to nurse on a schedule won't protect against irritated nipples and could deprive your baby of needed nourishment. Better to watch your baby for signs of hunger and satisfaction!Feeding your child 433 Breastfeeding your babyYour Baby's Age 1 DAY 2 DAYS 3 DAYS 4 DAYS 5 DAYS 6 DAYS 7 DAYS 2 WEEKS 3 WEEKS Your Baby's Average Tummy Size Size of a cherry Size of a walnut Size of an apricot Size of an egg Number of Feedings On average over 24 hours8 times or more per day Your baby sucks vigorously and swallows often Number of Wet Diapers On average over 24 hoursAt least 1 WETAt least 2 WETAt least 3 WETAt least 4 WETAt least 6 HEAVY WET WITH PALE YELLOW or CLEAR URINE Number of Soiled Diapers Colour of Stools On average over 24 hoursAt least 1 to 2 BLACK OR DARK GREENAt least 3 BROWN, GREEN OR YELLOWAt least 3 large, soft and seedy YELLOW Adapted and revised on October 2017 with permission from the Best Start Resource Centre. Download our guide at: publications.msss.gouv.qc.ca/msss/sujets/allaitementFact Sheet For Nursing Mothers 434Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyCluster feeding Feedings are more frequent at certain hours of the day and less frequent at other times. Evenings can be a challenging time because most babies tend to get cranky and nurse a lot. They sleep a bit, cry a bit, nurse a bit and need comforting. Some babies may want to nurse almost non-stop for a few hours. They may then sleep for longer periods. \"Cluster feeding\" is normal, although it can leave you with the impression you don't have enough milk because your breasts are soft and have less time to produce new milk. One breast or two? Or more? The number of times that your baby will want to change breasts during a feeding will depend on The quantity of milk accumulated in the breast His appetite and age The time of dayYour baby might nurse from one breast or both during a feeding, and you should go along with his preference. Let him nurse from the first breast until he's full. When he starts to let go or becomes drowsy, try burping him. Then offer the other breast: he'll take it if he's still hungry. You can change breasts more than once during a feeding. Some babies release the breast as the flow of milk slows. Offering the second breast gives the milk glands in the first breast a chance to refill. If your baby isn't full after nursing at the second breast, he can return to the first one. And if he's still hungry, change once more to give him the second breast again. At the next feeding, start with the breast that was offered last or the one your baby nursed from least. If you don't remember, offer the breast that feels heavier.Feeding your child 435 Breastfeeding your babyBreast compression Breast compression is a technique you can use if your baby doesn't nurse effectively enough to get the milk he needs. It increases milk flow and keeps your baby nursing more actively. Use this technique if your baby Falls asleep quickly when nursing Isn't gaining enough weight Wants to nurse very often or for long periods Seems dissatisfied It's also a very good way to get your baby drinking colostrum during the first few days of life. The cross-cradle position is best for this technique. With your hand, make a U shape at the base of the breast, with your thumb on one side and your fingers on the other. Keep your fingers away from the areola so as to not interfere with your baby's sucking. Squeeze the breast with your whole hand without moving your fingers. This should not be painful or stretch the areola. Maintain pressure for 5 to 10 seconds or as long as your baby continues swallowing. Release the pressure as soon as he stops drinking, then start again, continuing until he stops swallowing. Offer the other breast in the same way if your baby seems to want it. You can return to the first breast\u2014and the second one again\u2014if needed. Stop using this technique once your baby starts nursing more effectively. Jean-Claude Mercier436Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyPacifiers (soothers) A crying baby is trying to tell you something. He may need food, sleep, comforting or contact; it's not always easy to know exactly which. Breastfeeding is more than a way to provide your baby with nourishment. Don't worry; letting your baby nurse for comfort won't create bad habits. In many cultures, breastfeeding is used as much to calm infants as it is to nourish them.The Canadian Paediatric Society makes the following recommendations about pacifiers: \"It's best not to start using a pacifier until breastfeeding is going well. Talk to your doctor or lactation specialist if you feel your baby needs to use one at this early stage. One exception is for premature or sick babies in the hospital who can benefit from using one for comfort.\" \"Always see if your baby is hungry, tired or bored before giving him the pacifier. Try solving these things first\". Babies also find the warmth of skin-to-skin contact with their fathers soothing. Rocking or carrying your baby in your arms is another great way to provide comfort and reassurance.Feeding your child 437 Breastfeeding your babyBreastfeeding phases A nursing woman's breasts undergo changes as her milk supply fluctuates in response to her baby's needs. As children get older, their behaviour changes too\u2014they'll state their needs more and more clearly. Everything seems to get easier with time. Breastfeeding with your baby snuggled in your arms comforts him and helps meet many of his important needs. Mireille Lewis438Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyThe table below provides an overview of breastfeeding phases between birth and the age of 6 months, describing your baby's behaviour and what may happen at feedings. Right after birth: Mother and child get acquainted The first 14 days: A time of learning for mother and child Your baby Your baby Will instinctually seek your breast within an hour of birth. Will then sleep for several hours. May find it harder to breastfeed if she has taken more time to recover from delivery. May be drowsy, especially if she is jaundiced. May sleep so much that you need to waken her up to ensure she gets enough nourishment, i.e., 8 times or more per day (24 hours). Tends to fall asleep at your breast as soon as the flow of milk slows, even if she hasn't drunk enough. Feedings Feedings Offer baby your breast if she seems interested. If she doesn't nurse right away, hold her close until she shows interest. The interval between the first two feedings can vary. If necessary: - Let a few drops of milk drip onto her mouth, but don't insist if she refuses\u2014be patient; - Express milk and give it to her from a spoon or small cup. Avoid bottles for the time being. It can take a long time to get ready and latching on may be difficult. A feeding session (breastfeeding, stimulation, burping and diaper-changing) may take between 45 and 90 minutes. The number and length of feedings is less important than the quality of the latch and effectiveness of the sucking. Babies who suck effectively spend less time at the breast and are less likely to hurt your nipples. If your baby falls asleep while you breastfeed, try tickling her, uncovering her, holding her close or talking to her. Make sure she latches on properly. Try using the breast compression technique. Feeding your child 439 Breastfeeding your baby2 to 8 weeks: Mother and child are more comfortable with each otherFrom 2 to 6 months: Mother and child have their own routine Your baby Your baby Awakens on her own for feeding and stays awake for longer periods. Expresses her needs more readily\u2014for example, when she wants to change breasts. Needs more stimulation; it's not always easy to know if she's hungry or wants to do something different. Feedings Feedings You're getting better at latching on and feeling more at ease as you get to know your little one better. Between weeks 6 and 8, your breasts produce as much milk as before but become softer to the touch and smaller in size as they adjust to your baby's needs. Feedings are shorter. At 3 months, baby tends to look around her while nursing. At 4 months, baby's appetite changes: she may ask for the breast more often. She may still wake up at night for feeding\u2014or start doing so again.440Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyBreastfeeding an older baby (6 months and up) Breastfeeding an older baby and a newborn are two very different things. Once children start eating other foods at around 6 months of age, the rhythm of breastfeeding gradually changes as your baby adapts to the family's mealtime routine. But you and your child can still benefit from the advantages of breastfeeding, which will continue as long as you carry on nursing. As your child gets older, he will start to show curiosity and initiative, and this can carry over into breastfeeding. His newfound independence may sometimes pose problems\u2014he might ask for your breast at inconvenient times. But trust yourself: in breastfeeding, as in parenting in general, you'll learn to set limits on what you consider to be acceptable or not. Your baby will learn to be a bit more patient and will get used to breastfeeding on your terms.As children near one year of age, they typically breastfeed only a few times per day, although some may still do so more frequently. At this age, the number of feedings varies from one day to the next, depending on the child's activities and mood. In Qu\u00e9bec, an increasing number of women are continuing to breastfeed beyond age 1\u2014even if only once a day\u2014because it helps prolong the special mother-child relationship they cherish. Breastfeeding for a longer period has ongoing health benefits for the baby. Many find that breastfeeding in the evening is an enjoyable part of the bed-time ritual. Support group volunteers are very comfortable with the idea of breastfeeding a toddler. Feel free to discuss it with them.Feeding your child 441 Breastfeeding your babyBreastfeeding in public More and more women are breastfeeding in public. It's your right to breastfeed your child, regardless of the location. In Qu\u00e9bec, that right is protected by law. Breastfeed with self-confidence and simplicity. To make things easier, try wearing layered garments (for example, a T-shirt and sweater) or a blouse. Some places provide special breastfeeding and baby care areas for parents who don't feel comfortable nursing in public. Breastfeeding and mother-child separation One practical side of breastfeeding is that it makes family outings easier. However, your personal or professional activities may also require you to be separated from your child. Breastfeeding makes it easier for a family to get out and about! Night or day, milk is always handy\u2014whether you're at the movies, outdoors, visiting or traveling. Mireille Lewis442Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyYou can continue breastfeeding even if you're not always with your child. You'll need to consider The child's age His preferences, and yours The length and frequency of separation Once babies reach 6 months of age, they don't necessarily need to be bottle-fed when you're away; they can learn to satisfy their thirst by drinking from a cup. Occasional separations Need to go out for a few hours? If you breastfeed your baby before you leave and once you return, it may not be necessary for anyone to bottle-feed him while you're out.If you know that you're going out for a while, you can express milk that your baby can drink from a cup or bottle, depending on his age and abilities. He may only drink a small amount\u2014that happens sometimes. But don't worry\u2014he'll probably have a \"full-course meal\" once you return. And while you're out, you may need to express milk in order to relieve breast discomfort. Take along what you need (for instance, a cooler and ice packs) to keep the milk cool until you return home. Returning to work or school Returning to work or school will require you to be away from your baby on a regular basis for longer periods. Yet many women in this situation continue breastfeeding. A number of them talk about the pleasure they get from snuggling up with their nursing babies before they go out or after they return.Feeding your child 443 Breastfeeding your babyOnce expressed, breast milk can be refrigerated or frozen, then given to your child in a cup or bottle in keeping with his age and abilities. This way you continue to provide excellent nourishment that will help your infant develop and stay healthy\u2014whether you're by his side or not. At age 6 months or so, it's not unusual for some babies who are separated from their moms to prefer food until they can breastfeed. They may drink very little while their mothers are away, but make up for this by nursing more heavily the rest of the time. You may also decide to breastfeed when you're with your child and to provide another type of age-appropriate milk for him when you're not around. Your milk production will adjust if you opt for what is called \"mixed feeding\". C\u00e9line Leheurteux This special relationship can be continued as long as you and your child wish.444Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyIs breastfeeding still possible? If you've had a Caesarean section Whether you planned to have a C-section or not, there's nothing to prevent you from breastfeeding soon after your baby is born. Most C-sections are done with an epidural, in which anaesthesia (freezing) is injected near the base of the spine. So you should be able to breastfeed soon after, ideally within an hour of delivery, even if you're still feeling the effects of the epidural. If you have a general anaesthetic (you are put to sleep during the operation), you'll be able to breastfeed as soon as you are completely conscious and feeling comfortable. Many hospitals encourage new mothers to nurse for the first time while in the operating room or recovery room.To keep your baby in your room, you need to have your spouse or someone close to you on hand. The hospital staff can help you start nursing, if necessary. Soon you'll be able to take care of your baby by yourself. Many dads also enjoy holding the new baby skin-to-skin on their chest. It's a good way to get the father-child relationship off to a warm start. If your baby is premature Premature babies have special needs and benefit even more from mother's milk. Breast milk is ideally suited for meeting a premature baby's needs, and you alone can provide this made-to-order nourishment!Feeding your child 445 Breastfeeding your babyDepending on how far along the pregnancy was at the time of birth, your baby may be fully able to nurse or only able to breastfeed a little bit, if at all. If he's not yet capable of sucking, the nurses will use a very thin tube to get your milk directly into his stomach. If your baby's health allows, hold him often and for long periods with his skin against yours. Your little one will get used to you and your smell, which will make it easier to get him to nurse once he's ready. This intimate contact has been shown to be beneficial for both babies and their parents. In fact, it is considered as valuable for newborns as the food they receive. While waiting until your baby is able to breastfeed on his own, you'll need to use a breast pump to get your milk production started and keep the supply ongoing. Breast pumps are often available in intensive care units, or you can rent one if necessary from a drug store or certain breastfeeding support groups. Julie Deschamps You can breastfeed even if your baby is premature.446Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyThe milk that you express can be refrigerated or even frozen until your baby is ready for it. When it's fed to him, hospital staff may add nutritional supplements, if necessary. Various factors influence how long it takes before a premature baby is ready to start breastfeeding. Your doctor or nurses will tell you when your child is ready. At first, he may not be able to nurse for very long, so it will probably be a good idea to express milk afterward in order to relieve your breasts and sustain milk production. Little by little, your baby will nurse more effectively and you'll be able to do without the breast pump.You'll need lots of patience and perseverance during this phase: premature babies need time to learn to breastfeed. Most of them become more skilled at it once they reach their original due dates. A person trained in breastfeeding can provide invaluable support and encouragement. Pr\u00e9ma-Qu\u00e9bec, an organization for parents of premature infants, may also be able to help.

The most demanding aspect of mothering twins isn't breastfeeding itself, but the challenge of caring for two newborns at the same time. So accept all the help you can get! It's possible to feed your two babies exclusively on breast milk. The more your breasts are stimulated, the more milk they produce. If your twins are born prematurely, they'll benefit even more from your milk. You should pump milk while waiting for your twins to be able to nurse. This will ensure that there's enough milk for both of them. With twins, one baby is often ready to nurse before the other one is, so keep expressing milk for the second child. Alexandra Jacques Breastfeeding both twins at once can be practical.450Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babySome women prefer to breastfeed each baby separately. Others find it more practical to nurse both twins at the same time. Most women use a combination of these two approaches. Generally, mothers of twins nurse each baby at one breast for one feeding and change to the other breast for the next feeding. As babies' appetites and sucking capacities will vary, this allows equal stimulation for both breasts. There are other approaches that may be more suitable in certain situations. Some women use mixed feeding, a combination of breastfeeding and bottle-feeding using expressed breast milk and commercial infant formula. A person trained in breastfeeding can put you in contact with a mother who has breastfed twins.There are organizations that can help you, regardless of where you live.

The impact of such surgery on milk supply also varies from one woman to another. Whatever your situation, learning about breastfeeding and having support can help you get off to a successful start. Breast reduction (surgery to make the breasts smaller) appears to decrease the breast's capacity to produce milk. That said, some women who have undergone reductive procedures produce enough milk to breastfeed their babies exclusively for several weeks or more. It may be necessary to monitor the baby's weight more often during her first weeks of life to make sure that she's receiving enough milk. If you aren't producing enough milk to meet all your newborn's nutritional needs, you'll need to supplement feeding with a commercial infant formula. Breast augmentation appears to have less impact on breastfeeding.Restarting milk production If you've stopped breastfeeding, didn't breastfeed your child at birth, or are finding that your baby has trouble tolerating commercial infant formulas, it's possible to resume breastfeeding regardless of your baby's age. With determination\u2014and support from someone trained in breastfeeding\u2014you'll be able to resume lactation, even if you never nursed your baby. You've adopted a baby? It's even possible to begin producing milk without having gone through a pregnancy.452Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyIf you're breastfeeding\u2014and pregnant If you're newly pregnant and have been breastfeeding, you can continue to nurse. It's safe for both your fetus and your nursing baby. If your baby is less than 6 months old, you may not produce enough milk to satisfy her nutritional needs, a situation that could affect her growth. In this case, you may have to supplement feeding with a commercial infant formula. The hormonal changes that occur in pregnancy affect the composition of milk (reversion to colostrum) and can also reduce your milk supply. Some older babies don't like these changes and lose interest in breastfeeding.Expressing milk Pumping or manually extracting breast milk lets your baby enjoy your milk when you're not there to feed her, or if she is premature or sick. Expressing milk not only allows you to maintain your milk supply, but also helps relieve the effects of engorged breasts. Tips to keep your milk flowing Your baby's nursing stimulates the let-down reflex, which increases milk flow. It's sometimes harder to stimulate this reflex when you're expressing milk by hand or with a breast pump, especially on your first attempts. With a little practice, you'll become good at it.Feeding your child 453 Breastfeeding your babyDepending on what you prefer, you can use any of the following methods to stimulate the let-down reflex Self relaxation Breast massage Warm compresses Visualization of your baby nursing Thinking about your baby Distracting yourself with another activity (for instance, watching television)Choosing a method for expressing milk Breast milk can be expressed in a number of ways. Your choice of method will depend on The situation How frequently you express milk How you are feeding your baby\u2014that is, breastfeeding or not And of course, your own preference Regardless of the method you choose, it's important to handle your breasts gently and to wash your hands before expressing milk.454Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyHow to do a breast massage To relax your breasts before expressing milk, try a technique borrowed from massage. The idea is to use the knuckles to gently stimulate the breast. Make a fist and keep it closed throughout the massage. Place the knuckle of your index finger at the top of your chest and roll your knuckles down toward the nipple. To massage the underside of the breast, place the knuckle of your little finger against your ribs and roll your knuckles up toward the nipple. Move your fist to the other breast and repeat the rolling motion. Work your way around the breast once or twice, then start expressing milk. Massage shouldn't be painful. You can repeat this massage once or twice while you're expressing milk.How to express milk by hand Manual expression is a technique every mother should know. It's the most effective way to express colostrum, you can use it any time, anywhere to relieve an engorged breast, and it's free. This technique is easier than it sounds. Ask hospital staff, your midwife, or a CLSC nurse to teach it to you. Wash your hands. Use a large, clean container. To prompt the let-down reflex, massage your breast gently. Lean forward slightly so the milk can flow into the container. Make a \"C\" with your thumb and index finger. The tip of each should line up like a pair of pliers (see photo no. 1 ). Place your thumb and index finger on either side of the nipple, 2 to 5 cm (1 to 2 inches) away. With practice, you'll find the best distance (see photo no. 2 ). Press your fingers into your breast, pushing horizontally toward the ribs (see photo no. 3 ). While maintaining pressure on your fingers, pinch your thumb and index finger together as if they were a pair of pliers. You don't need to press hard. This motion shouldn't leave any mark on your breast or cause any pain. Repeat this pinching motion several times, reproducing the same rhythmic movements your baby uses when nursing. Be careful not to slide your fingers along your breast. Maintain firm pressure on your breast without stretching the nipple, which is painful and not very effective. Work your way around the breast with your fingers until it's emptied. Your milk will flow drop by drop at first, then begin to spurt. With practice, you'll be able to work more efficiently and quickly. 1 2 3 Jean-Claude MercierFeeding your child 455 Breastfeeding your babyHow to express milk by hand Manual expression is a technique every mother should know.

Many women prefer to use one, however, especially if they have to express their milk on a regular basis. To find a breast pump that suits your needs, contact a community breastfeeding support group or a person trained in breastfeeding. A number of models are available on the market: Manual breast pumps Various types of electric breast pumps, including some that allow you to express milk from both breasts at the same time.You should also consider the following factors: Quality - A poor quality breast pump may hurt you or reduce your milk production. The number of sucking movements per minute - Choose a breast pump that allows for 60 to 70 sucking movements or cycles per minute so that it imitates as closely as possible the rhythm and strength of your baby's sucking. Suction - A breast pump with insufficient suction reduces the quantity of the milk expressed, whereas suction that is too strong and prolonged irritates the nipples. Size and shape of the cup - The breast pump's cup, which fits on the nipple and areola , must be properly adjusted to your nipples to avoid injuring them. Some companies offer a number of models and sizes.Feeding your child 457 Breastfeeding your babyCharacteristics of a good breast pump A good breast pump should Be leakproof and maintain proper suction Fit your nipples properly Protect your nipples by avoiding suction that is too strong or prolonged Electric breast pump Create and release suction at 60 to 70 cycles per minute Manual breast pump Be comfortable and not tire your handYou can rent hospital-grade electric breast pumps from community breastfeeding support groups and some drugstores. These sturdy, good-quality pumps are intended for use by many people, so they are designed in such a way that the pump motor never comes into contact with the milk. In fact, it is the motor you rent: each woman must buy a new set of tubes, which includes all parts that come in contact with the milk. Regardless of the type of breast pump you choose, it's important to clean it properly. Read Cleaning bottles, nipples and breast pumps , page 507 .458Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babySecond-hand breast pumps A breast pump is a personal item, like a tooth brush or piece of underwear. Breast milk can transmit diseases like HIV and hepatitis, or less serious infections like thrush. If you decide to use a second-hand breast pump, the only way of making sure that it's safe is to sterilize it in an autoclave, like they do in the hospital. Boiling a used breast pump does not make it safe, even if it does reduce the risk of disease transmission. If you do decide to use a second -hand b reast pump, take the following precautions first: Take the breast pump apart. Put all the parts in a large pot. Cover the parts completely with water. Make sure there is enough water so the parts remain covered until the boiling is complete to avoid burning them. Boil for 5 to 10 minutes.If you buy a used breast pump that is not hospital grade, keep in mind that there may be milk remaining in the motor. Since there is no way to check this or to clean the motor, there is a risk of contamination, even though the risk is low. For this reason, it is recommended that you not buy a used breast pump. If you decide to do so, be sure to buy a new set of tubes. Expressing milk occasionally or regularly If you breastfeed, your milk production has adjusted to your baby's demand. So it is normal to express only a few drops on your first few attempts. Be patient. There is no ideal time to express your milk. The ideal moment is the one that suits you the best! Try these suggestions: When your baby has fed at only one breast In the morning When your breasts are engorged Between feedings While your baby is feeding at your other breast When you skip a feedingFeeding your child 459 Breastfeeding your babyIf you express milk between feedings, you will probably get only a small amount of milk. You will get more if you express the milk from a breast that your baby has not fed from for some time. Expressing milk without breastfeeding Some women express milk for a baby who won't breastfeed. Others simply prefer this method. Depending on your situation, you can express your milk for several days, weeks, months, or throughout the entire period you feed your baby breast milk. It is normal to get only a few drops the first few times you express your milk. The more you stimulate your breasts, the more milk they will produce.During the first month, many babies who did not breastfeed at birth succeed in doing so if your milk production is high. Don't hesitate to ask for help if you want to try breastfeeding again. Remember that premature babies are smaller and their intestines are not yet fully developed. In the first few days, or even weeks, they only drink a little if at all and they do not suck as effectively. However, to get your milk production off to a good start, it's better to express your milk as if your baby were full term. The way you express your milk when not breastfeeding will change as your milk production gets going and adapts to your baby's individual needs.460Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyFeeding your baby with your milk without breastfeeding Before your milk comes in When your milk comes in Frequency Frequency If possible, start stimulating your breasts within 6 hours after the birth. Express your milk 6 to 8 times a day. Use the breast pump at least once every 6 hours, even at night. Express your milk as often as necessary for comfort's sake, but at least 8 times a day. Use the breast pump at least once every 4 hours, even at night. Duration Duration After expressing the colostrum by hand, use the breast pump for 5 to 10 minutes. Express your milk until your breasts are soft and comfortable. Quantity Quantity You will produce from a few drops to several milliliters. The colostrum (first milk) is thicker. Expressing milk by hand seems to produce more milk than the breast pump during the first 24 to 48 hours. As your milk changes, it will become easier to express with the breast pump. The quantity of milk usually increases from 48 to 72 hours after the birth. The quantity of milk increases rapidly. Take advantage of this period to get your milk production off to a good start, even if your baby drinks much less that you express. Stock up. Mothers who express at least 500 ml of milk per 24 hours after the first week seem to produce more milk afterwards.Feeding your child 461 Breastfeeding your baby1 to 6 weeks After 6 weeks Frequency Frequency Express your milk 6 to 8 times a day. Use the breast pump at least once every 6 hours, even at night. Depending on how much milk you produce, you can adapt to your baby's needs. Some women can stop expressing milk at night, and others not. Duration Duration Express your milk until the milk has stopped flowing for about 2 minutes. Express your milk until you have have the quantity of milk your baby needs. Quantity Quantity Try to express a little more milk than your baby drinks. That way you will always stay ahead of her needs, which will increase rapidly. It's normal that the quantity of milk you express varies each time. Mothers who express at least 750 ml per 24 hours after two weeks seem to produce more milk afterwards. Adjust the quantity of milk you express according to your baby's needs. Ideally, try to express a little more milk than your baby drinks in order to stay ahead.462Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babycombining breast and bottle To suck from a bottle or from your breasts is not the same. Here are the main differences: Your baby has to open her mouth wide to latch on to the breast, which is not the case with a bottle. Milk sucked from your breasts flows faster at first and when you have a let-down reflex, while milk from a bottle flows at a constant rate. Most bottles will drip into your baby's mouth even when she doesn't suck, which is not the case when she drinks from the breast.Some babies will switch back and forth between breast and bottle without any trouble, while others find the transition more difficult. After being fed from the bottle several times, some babies don't open their mouths as wide to take the breast or get frustrated when the milk doesn't flow as fast. Here are some tips to make the breast/bottle combination easier: Don't introduce the bottle until breastfeeding and milk production have settled into a pattern (around 4 to 6 weeks). Wait until your baby opens her mouth wide before giving her the bottle. Opt for a slow-flow bottle nipple. Give your baby breast milk in a bottle rather than commercial infant formula. It will help you maintain a good milk supply.Feeding your child 463 Breastfeeding your babyPartial or mixed breastfeeding Although exclusive breastfeeding is the best way to feed your baby, you may find yourself in a situation where partial breastfeeding is the only way you can continue nursing. This approach may allow you and your baby to enjoy breastfeeding longer. Some babies adapt well to this type of breastfeeding while others don't. Partial (or mixed) breastfeeding is when your baby drinks both breast milk and commercial infant formula every day.Women may choose partial breastfeeding for a number of reasons, and for different periods of time. However, whatever your reason for choosing partial breastfeeding, you should be aware of the following: The more your baby nurses, the longer your milk production will last. If you feed your baby commercial infant formula every day, your milk production will drop because your breasts are less stimulated. Some babies gradually lose interest in breastfeeding when milk production drops. Some babies may prefer the bottle and lose interest in the breast, even if your milk supply is plentiful. Complete weaning may occur earlier than anticipated.464Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyIf your baby refuses the bottle Some babies, regardless of their age, simply don't like drinking from a bottle. This is perfectly normal; after all, bottle and breast are quite different. Occasionally, babies who have had no problem drinking from both breast and bottle may suddenly start refusing the bottle after a few months. As they grow, babies learn to express their preferences better, and some make their choice perfectly clear! This can be a difficult situation for parents, especially if the mother feels trapped or obliged to breastfeed. Be patient, and don't force your baby one way or the other. He is not likely to accept something new if he's frustrated.Here are a few tips to help ease the introduction of the bottle: Wait until your baby is in a good mood and not too hungry before making the change. Introduce the bottle for a milk \"snack.\" Your baby will probably drink very little to start with. Get the father to give the bottle. Discreetly leave the room at feeding time. Try with breast milk first, then with commercial infant formula. Try giving the bottle differently from the way you present the baby your breast. Change routines. Patience! If it doesn't work the first time, try again a few days later. If you have tried these tips and your baby still refuses to take the bottle, you can try giving him some milk in a little cup. He may be more willing to take it.Feeding your child 465 Breastfeeding your baby Julie Desrosiers466Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyWeaning Weaning age varies from one child to another. Whether it's the mother or child who initiates the process, various factors affect weaning: the child's age and temperament, the mother's feelings and the approach used. Give yourself time. Be attentive to your child's reaction and stay flexible. If possible, it's better to delay weaning a sick child. She needs her mother's milk and the comfort she gets from breastfeeding.Weaning babies under 9 months old Milk production declines gradually as breast stimulation is reduced. Gradual weaning helps you to avoid engorged breasts and reduces the possibility of mastitis . The time it takes to stop producing milk altogether varies from one woman to another, however it generally takes about four weeks to wean your baby completely. This gives your child time to adapt. Weaning faster may be hard on both you and your baby. Start by replacing one daily breastfeeding with an iron -enriched commercial infant formula served in a baby bottle or cup. Between feedings you can empty your breasts by expressing some milk or letting it flow under a hot shower.Feeding your child 467 Breastfeeding your babyOnce your breasts no longer feel engorged, replace a second feeding when you're ready. At first, don't skip two breastfeedings in a row. You can gradually replace as many breastfeedings as you want. Many mothers continue the main bedtime and morning feedings. Some mothers will feel their breasts engorged with milk for a few days after the \"last\" breastfeeding. Don't hesitate to express some milk to ease the discomfort. You can also let your baby breastfeed for a few minutes. At about the age of 6 months your baby can start drinking from a regular cup. At first, he will probably only drink a small amount of milk. This is perfectly normal. Finish up with a baby bottle if needed. Offer him the cup often, and make sure he's getting enough milk\u2014it will remain his primary food for his first full year of life, providing the calcium and protein he needs to grow.Weaning babies older than 9 months As your child gets older, you can decide how quickly you wish to wean her. Gradually encourage her to develop other ways of satisfying her needs for nutrition and contact. Many children lose interest in the breast when they lose the need to suck. For older babies, breastfeeding is often a moment of comforting contact. If you're trying to wean your child, it's a good idea to introduce other such moments\u2014rocking, massage, back-rubs and so on. You will breastfeed less and less as your baby eventually starts going days at a time without wanting to nurse. By about 9 months, provided she is eating a balanced diet, your baby can start to drink 3.25% homogenized milk instead of breast milk.468Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyHere are a few suggestions to ease the transition: Don't refuse your baby the breast if she wants it, but gradually stop offering it. Delay feedings if she's not too impatient so they are spaced further apart and reduced in number. Offer her a nutritious snack. Distract her with a game or other stimulating activity. Reduce the length of feedings. Change your daily habits, e.g., don't sit in the chair you usually use to breastfeed her. Consult a community breastfeeding support group, if needed.Breastfeeding problems and solutions Some new moms find breastfeeding easy right from the start. Others find it more challenging, especially in the first few weeks. If you fall into the second category, you will find all kinds of information and solutions in the next few pages. If you are experiencing one of the following problems, it is advisable to seek professional advice: Difficulty getting the baby to latch on Pain or lesions on the nipples or breasts Baby not gaining enough weight Problems with milk productionFeeding your child 469 Breastfeeding your babyDiscouraged and thinking of weaning your baby? Some women get discouraged when they can't find a solution to their breastfeeding problems. When breastfeeding doesn't go as planned, many new mothers will think about weaning their baby, even if they were originally very determined to breastfeed. Feeling tired, discouraged, ambivalent or confused? This is probably not a good time to make such an important decision. If you are experiencing problems, consider these options: Consult someone trained in breastfeeding. Express milk from one or both breasts so you can temporarily or permanently reduce or stop nursing. Try a nipple shield. It can sometimes reduce pain and help your baby latch on (see Nipple shields , page 474) . Opt for partial (or mixed) breastfeeding by introducing commercial infant formula. Jean-Claude Mercier If you don't think you can continue breastfeeding and are considering weaning your baby, maybe you just need some extra assistance or encouragement. Don't be afraid to seek help.470Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyWhen breastfeeding doesn't go as planned Giving birth to and caring for your baby is one of the most intense experiences you will ever have. In the first few weeks, you may often find yourself crying from fatigue and hormonal changes. Breastfeeding, too, is an emotional time. Breastfeeding is not always easy and for some women, it can be downright difficult. Even with excellent support and specialized assistance, there is a possibility that your breastfeeding experience simply doesn't live up to your expectations. Some women feel regret, sadness, frustration and even anger because they are unable to achieve the goal they had set for themselves. Others feel guilty for wanting to stop breastfeeding. Remember, it's not your fault! Successful breastfeeding depends on a number of factors that you can't always control. It's good to be able to talk about your feelings with someone you trust and who will lend an ear. Every birth and breastfeeding story is unique. Jean-Claude Mercier Having the support and reassuring presence of the baby's father or someone close to you can often make all the difference.Feeding your child 471 Breastfeeding your babyYour baby sleeps a lot If your baby sleeps a lot, you probably wonder whether you should wake him to nurse. It's not always easy to know what to do. Follow his rhythm and let him sleep if he Wakes on his own to nurse 8 times or more in a 24 hour period Is active and sucks and swallows well when nursing Pees at least 6 times and passes at least 3 stools a day Is calm and seems satisfied after nursing Has regained his birth weight and continues to gain weight Babies each have their own rhythm that changes over time. Some babies sleep so much they may skip some feedings, especially during the first 2 or 3 weeks. This means they will have a hard time getting all the milk they need. You should stimulate your baby if he sleeps a lot and is not showing the signs described above.It's easier to wake a baby who is dozing than one who is in a deep sleep. Babies generally alternate between light and deep sleep. What to do If you have to wake your baby to nurse him, start by observing him. Is he moving in his sleep, making sucking motions or moving his eyes beneath his eyelids? These are signs that he is in a light sleep phase. Now is a good time to try to stimulate him or change his diaper, as he will be easier to wake. If your baby falls asleep while nursing, check the tips on helping him drink more in the section Your baby is not drinking enough milk during feedings , page 477 .472Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyYour baby has trouble latching on Newborns don't all develop at the same pace. Some take longer to learn how to latch on properly. If your baby has trouble latching on in the beginning, you can continue to breastfeed by expressing your milk. Don't worry, your baby is not rejecting you! If she gets frustrated and pushes on your breast, it's because she's hungry and can't quite manage to latch on. Babies may have trouble latching on if they Were born prematurely and are less efficient at sucking Have a sore head following the delivery Have difficulty sucking Have a tight lingual frenum (membrane under the tongue is short and impedes tongue movement) Prefer the bottle (if they have already been bottle-fed) Refuse to take the breast after having been forced to nurseIn other cases, it may be that the mother Has flat or inverted nipples Has nipples that are usually erect, but that retract when the baby tries to latch on Has very hard or engorged breasts Most of the time, babies have difficulty latching on due to a combination of factors. However, there may be cases when there is no obvious reason.Feeding your child 473 Breastfeeding your babyWhat to do Here are a few tips: If your breasts are engorged, try to relieve them (see Engorgement , page 492) . Breastfeed your baby before she gets too hungry. If she seems too hungry, start by giving her a bit of your milk in a spoon or little cup to calm her. Try different positions. Some babies prefer specific nursing positions. If your baby gets frustrated, remove her from your breast for a few minutes to calm her down. C\u00e9cile Fortin Let your baby discover her innate sucking reflex. Strip her down to her diaper, remove your bra and lay her skin-to-skin between your breasts. Relax and wait until she starts seeking out the breast, then gently guide her. Be patient, this can take a few minutes.474Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyIf your baby doesn't latch on, there's no point insisting. You can always complete the feeding with expressed breast milk: Keep feeding your baby. Don't skip a feeding because your newborn can't latch on properly. Express milk to keep your milk production up. Babies seem to find it easier to learn to latch on when milk production is plentiful. This period requires lots of patience, confidence and support. Try to avoid introducing the bottle or using a nipple shield during this time. Many babies will eventually learn to latch on, especially if they are less than 6 weeks old and milk production is good.Your baby refuses one breast but takes the other Some newborns will have no trouble taking one breast, but refuse the other. Don't worry, this is quite common. If this happens, express some milk from the breast the baby refuses, to stimulate production. Keep offering him the breast in question but don't force him. He will eventually take it. Nipple shields Nipple shields are a breastfeeding accessory made of moulded silicone that adjusts to the shape of the breast. They come in various sizes and models. They are sometimes recommended when the baby does not take the breast or when the mother's nipples are painful.Feeding your child 475 Breastfeeding your babyNipple shields must be used only as a last resort and preferably not in the first few days of breastfeeding. There is almost always an alternate solution. They are best avoided for the following reasons: With a nipple shield, the baby doesn't learn to latch on properly. The baby quickly gets used to it and can subsequently refuse to take the breast without a nipple shield. Their use results in reduced breast stimulation and can cause a drop in milk production.If a nipple shield seems to be the solution for you Choose one that is closest in size to your nipple Use it only on one side, if only one breast is causing problems Use it for part of the feeding only Express your milk after each feeding several times a day to keep up your milk production Stop using it as soon as you can Nipple shields are generally for temporary use. You should stop using yours as soon as the problem has been solved. If you are finding it hard to breastfeed without it, contact a person trained in breastfeeding. In some cases, nipple shields may be used throughout the breastfeeding period.476Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyYour baby was breastfeeding but now refuses to Sometimes a baby who was perfectly happy to take the breast will start to refuse it. In some cases this will happen all of a sudden, while in others, the baby gets increasingly impatient while nursing until she eventually refuses the breast altogether. What if you know your baby is hungry, but she can't seem to latch on or simply refuses to take the breast? While there may be no obvious reason, there are a number of possible causes: Your breasts are engorged, making it difficult for your baby to latch on. Your milk flow is slowed by a blocked duct or mastitis . Your baby has a growing preference for the bottle. Your baby is not feeling well or has a stuffy nose. This situation usually sorts itself out in a few days.What to do Healthy babies who are at least a few weeks old can easily go for several hours without feeding. Here are a few tips: Try for short periods (10 minutes) when she's calm and not too hungry. Don't force your baby to take the breast. Calm your baby before nursing by offering her a small amount of breast milk in a spoon or small cup. Offer your baby the breast just as she's about to wake up. Hold your baby in your arms and offer her the breast while you're moving or walking. Try taking a bath with your baby and nursing her in the water once she's fully relaxed. If the situation doesn't resolve itself after a few feedings, contact someone trained in breastfeeding.Feeding your child 477 Breastfeeding your babyYour baby is not drinking enough milk during feedings Some situations can cause your baby to nurse less effectively. In cases like these, she may not get enough milk from your breasts, even if your milk supply is plentiful. This is most often the case with babies who are Born before term (between 35 and 37 weeks) Exhausted from the delivery Suffering from jaundice Losing weight or failing to gain weight If your breasts lack proper stimulation for too long, your milk production is likely to decrease. Sophie Cliche A small cup may be used under certain conditions if your baby isn't drinking enough milk when breastfeeding.478Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyWhat to do Check that your baby is latching on properly and improve his latch, if possible. Breastfeed more frequently, at least 8 times every 24 hours. Wake your baby to nurse if need be. Offer the breast rather than a pacifier to comfort your baby. Pacifiers don't provide milk and can mask signs of hunger. Compress your breasts at each feeding (see Breast compression , page 435) . Stimulate your baby so that he nurses effectively and swallows regularly throughout the feeding (talk to him; massage his back, legs, arms, etc.). Switch breasts once your baby stops swallowing during the feeding. Express milk between feedings and offer it to your baby, preferably from a spoon or little cup. Avoid using a bottle.If these tips don't work, or if your milk production drops off, you may have to use a commercial infant formula to fulfill your baby's milk requirements (see Insufficient milk production , page 480) . Contact someone trained in breastfeeding if the situation doesn't resolve itself quickly or if you are concerned.Feeding your child 479 Breastfeeding your babyWorried you don't have enough milk? Many new moms worry they aren't producing enough milk because their baby cries and wants to nurse often or for long periods. This is highly unlikely so long as your baby is latching on correctly and you nurse her on demand. Newborns cry for all kinds of reasons that often have nothing to do with a lack of milk (see Temperament , page 314) . Try not to let yourself be influenced by what other people say. Before concluding that you aren't producing enough milk or that your milk isn't nourishing enough, take the time to consider the situation. It's normal for infants to breastfeed often and for your breasts to be softer after a few weeks of breastfeeding.What to do Make sure your baby is latching on properly. Stimulate your baby to ensure she continues to suck actively. She may get more milk faster if she sucks more effectively. Breast compression can help (see Breast compression , page 435) . You can also offer both breasts more than once during each feeding.480Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyInsufficient milk production Sometimes, milk production is low right from the start of breastfeeding. In other cases, it can drop off suddenly. This may be temporary, and can be due to any of a number of different causes: Your breasts are understimulated because: - they are not being stimulated often enough (less than 8 times a day); - they are not being stimulated correctly by your baby or your pump; - you give your baby commercial infant formula in a bottle every day. You have undergone breast surgery (breast reduction). You suffer from poorly controlled hypothyroidism or another health problem. You have an insufficient number of mammary glands, regardless of the size of your breasts (glandular insufficiency). You are pregnant again. You are taking contraceptives or a decongestant containing pseudoephedrine. Sometimes insufficient milk supply cannot be explained by any of these reasons. Regardless of the quantity produced, the quality of breast milk is always excellent. Even in small amounts, your breast milk provides your baby with a host of nutrients that are not found in commercial infant formula. If your milk production is insufficient, make sure your baby is drinking enough and continuing to gain weight. Even if you supplement feedings with commercial infant formula, you can still continue to breastfeed.Feeding your child 481 Breastfeeding your babyShe can also discuss with you the possibility of using a little tube or catheter called a lactation aid that is placed on the breast while you nurse. These aids can help you continue to breastfeed. Your midwife or a nurse at your CLSC can supply the tubes and show you how to use and clean them. If your milk production is still low, don't get discouraged. Talk to your doctor, who can recommend a drug that helps boost milk production.What to do The best way to boost your milk production is to stimulate your breasts often and express as much milk as possible. To help your baby nurse more effectively, see Your baby is not drinking enough milk during feedings, page 477 . You can also talk to a trained breastfeeding support person. This can help you Assess your milk production Increase your production as much as possible482Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyMilk flow Your breasts may leak milk between feedings or at night. This is a normal, natural way for your breast to relieve themselves. If it bothers you, you can protect your bed linens with a towel and wear nursing pads during the day. Very fast milk flow (strong let-down reflex) After nursing for a few minutes your baby will start swallowing loudly. He may even choke a little or stop nursing and start crying when milk runs onto his face. Your baby is upset because the milk is flowing too quickly. This happens most often around the age of 1 month. As babies grow older, they adapt better.What to do Here are a few suggestions to make nursing more enjoyable. Try the first suggestion, then add the others one at a time to see what works best for you. Remove your baby from your breast for a few minutes if the milk starts flowing too fast. Try different breastfeeding positions to see if there is one that suits you and your baby better. If you have a lot of milk, try offering only one breast per feeding; this may be enough to satisfy your baby. Express just enough milk from the other breast so you're comfortable. If your breasts are very full before nursing, express about 15 ml (1 tablespoon) of milk to trigger the first let-down reflex and slow the initial milk flow.Feeding your child 483 Breastfeeding your babyPainful nipples During the first week, your nipples may be sensitive, especially at the beginning of a feeding. You and your baby are still in the learning period. After this time, breastfeeding should not be painful. It is not normal to feel pain after the first 30 seconds of nursing or to be fearful of nursing because of the pain. The most common cause of pain is an incorrect latch. As soon as the cause of the discomfort is corrected, the pain will quickly lessen. Persistently painful and cracked nipples are one of the main reasons women decide to wean their babies early. The following charts list some of the most common causes of nipple pain, along with advice and recommended treatment.Causes of painful or cracked nipples Painful and cracked nipples can have various causes: Poor latch Eczema or dermatitis Vasospasm Milk blister Thrush484Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyPoor latch What is it? What to do? Most common cause of nipple pain and chapping. Pressure on the nipple between the baby's tongue and palate when he hasn't taken enough of the areola into his mouth. Improve the latch so it looks like the photo on page 429 . Begin nursing with the less sensitive breast. Vary breastfeeding positions. Put a few drops of breast milk onto the nipple at the end of a feeding. Use an analgesic such as acetaminophen (e.g., Atasol \u00ae or Tylenol \u00ae). You should feel a difference as soon as the baby improves the latch. N.B.: Over-the-counter ointments and creams provide some relief but won't solve the problem.Possible signs You'll feel You'll see More pain at the start of feeding. A deformed, flat or pinched nipple when the baby releases the breast. Chapping or cracks that may bleed.Not feeling any better? If nursing your baby is too painful, it's important to express your milk to prevent engorged breasts and maintain your milk production. If you're in too much pain, promptly ask for help. If your cracked nipples don't heal or improve after correcting the latch, see a doctor: you may need antibiotic ointment.Feeding your child 485 Breastfeeding your babyEczema or dermatitis What is it? What to do? Skin reaction to frequent or excessive moisture. Allergic reaction to a product or material. Stop applying any creams, lotions, lanolin or other products. Apply a thin layer of over-the-counter 0.5% hydrocortisone after every feeding for 3 to 5 days. There is no need to remove the product before feeding. Possible signs You'll feel You'll see A burning or hitching sensation during and between feedings. Pinkish or bright red patches, which tend to be most visible on the areola . Dry, cracked or peeling skin.Not feeling any better? See a doctor for diagnosis and to get appropriate treatment.486Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyVasospasm What is it? What to do? Spasm or contraction of the blood vessels brought on by the nipple coming into contact with cold air when the baby releases the breast. May come and go one or more times between feedings. Caused by a poor latch. Worsened by nicotine and caffeine.Vasospasms are harmless, so no treatment is needed if you aren't in any pain. To prevent or reduce pain, try these tips: Check and correct the latch as needed. Apply dry heat, such as the palm of your hand or a magic bag to the nipple immediately after nursing. Keep your body warm. Possible signs You'll feel You'll see A burning sensation in the nipple or throughout the breast. Pain on contact with a cold wind or when you come out of the shower. Pain completely disappears a few seconds to a few minutes after nursing. Part or all the nipple turns white. Nipple returns to its normal colour a few seconds to a few minutes after nursing.Not feeling any better? Vitamin B6 may provide relief. The dose is 150 mg per day for 4 days, followed by 25 mg per day until the pain disappears. Discontinue use if there is no improvement after a few days. Prescription medication can also be effective. See a doctor if needed.Feeding your child 487 Breastfeeding your babyMilk blister What is it? What to do? A thin layer of skin that blocks milk coming out of the end of the nipple. Take a long, hot bath to soften the skin on the nipple. Nurse your baby right after your bath: she may be able to open the blister. Apply an ice cube to the end of the nipple for 1 to 2 minutes to numb it and make the start of feeding less painful.Possible signs You'll feel You'll see Intense pain in the nipple and sometimes throughout the breast, especially at the start of feeding. Possibly a lump or hard area in the breast. Small (1-2 mm) white pimple on the tip of the nipple that may protrude slightly.Not feeling any better? If this doesn't work, contact a person trained in breastfeeding.488Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyNipple thrush What is it? What to do? Fungal infection that can Appear in a baby's mouth (see Thrush in the mouth , page 626) Cause diaper rash Occur in the mother, even when the baby has no visible thrush in his mouthAn ointment is often all you need to treat an infection that is limited to the nipple and areola: Apply a thin layer after each feeding. You don't need to remove it before nursing Continue treatment for a few days after the pain goes away Possible signs You'll feel You'll see Pain in the nipple or inside the breast, which Burns, more intensely at the end of feeding Strikes out of the blue Comes gradually or in addition to existing pain No changes to the nipple or areola . Cracked or redder nipple. Red, smooth and shiny areola.Not feeling any better? If there's no improvement after 5 days or you experience breast pain, see a doctor for diagnosis and to get appropriate treatment.Feeding your child 489 Breastfeeding your baby 490Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyBreast pain Breast pain is less common than nipple pain. Often the pain is accompanied by a lump or hard area on the breast. Breast pain is not normal. Treat the problem promptly or see a health professional if necessary.Causes of breast pain There are several possible causes for the pain: Thrush in the breast Engorgement Blocked milk duct MastitisFeeding your child 491 Breastfeeding your babyThrush in the breast What is it? What to do? Fungal infection that can occur in the breast. Consult a doctor for a diagnosis and to receive the appropriate treatment. Possible signs You'll feel You'll see Burning inside the breast. Pins-and-needles sensation through the breast. Pain during or between feedings that may wake you at night. Pain similar to vasospasm, but much more frequent. Normal breast with no redness or lumps. Thrush sometimes visible on the nipple. Thrush sometimes visible in the baby's mouth.Not feeling any better? See a doctor if the prescribed treatment does not work. The doctor may prescribe another treatment. A drug administered orally may also be prescribed. In the past, gentian violet was recommended as a treatment for nipple and breast thrush. However, it is now known that exposure to this product may increase the risk of cancer, and its use is no longer recommended. If you have any concerns about this issue, talk to a health professional. 492Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyEngorgement What is it? What to do? Surplus of milk in the breast. Milk production exceeds baby's demand. May occur when your milk comes in, during periods when baby drinks less than usual or during abrupt weaning . Nurse more frequently, particularly when your milk is coming in. Apply ice for 10 to 15 minutes every 1 to 2 hours between feedings to help reduce swelling and pain. Express enough milk to soften the areola if your baby has trouble nursing . Express milk after nursing if your baby hasn't drunk much. Express enough to be comfortable without trying to empty your breasts. As needed, acetaminophen (e.g., pain and is not dangerous for the baby.Possible signs You'll feel You'll see Heavy, tight breasts. Breasts that may be slightly or very painful, according to severity of engorgement. You do not have a fever. Breasts that are hard to the touch. Tight skin on breasts. Skin that may be red and warm.Not feeling any better? If your breast is very red or you start to run a fever, you might have mastitis .Feeding your child 493 Breastfeeding your babyBlocked milk duct What is it? What to do? Milk blocked inside a duct. Caused by a breast that was full for too long or because the breast was pinched by a bra or infant carrier.If the milk stays blocked for too long, you may get an infection. To prevent infection, follow these steps: Nurse your baby more often, especially from the affected breast. Start with the sore breast and vary the positions so that milk flows easily. If possible, direct the baby's chin or nose so that it points to the hard area when she nurses. Gently massage the affected area during nursing. Apply ice for 10 to 15 minutes every 1 to 2 hours between feedings. Apply wet heat just before nursing. Use a damp facecloth or, better still, massage the affected area while having a warm bath. Avoid wearing an overly tight bra.Possible signs You'll feel You'll see Pain in an area of one breast. You have no fever or aches. Possible redness when you touch your breast after nursing. Hard or red lump or area. Milk blister.Not feeling any better? can soothe the pain as needed. If your breast is very red or you start to run a fever, you might have mastitis . If you do not experience any pain, redness or fever, but the lump persists for more than a few days, see a doctor.494Feeding your child Breastfeeding your babyMastitis What is it? What to do? Signs of improvement Not feeling any better? Breast infection caused by bacteria. You are more at risk if - You have cracked nipples - Engorgement lasts a long time - You are tired May turn into an abscess. Continue nursing with the infected breast; the milk is fine. Empty the painful breast as much as possible. Express milk, if need be. Start with the affected breast and vary the positions so that the milk flows freely. If possible, direct the baby's chin or nose toward the lump when he nurses. If nursing is very uncomfortable, start on the other side first and change sides as soon as milk is flowing freely from the painful breast. Apply ice for 10 to 15 minutes every 1 to 2 hours between feedings. Take acetaminophen to soothe the pain and reduce fever. Cut back on your activities and try to get more rest.It takes 2 to 5 days for mastitis to clear up. The fever generally disappears within 24 hours. The pain and redness decrease in under 48 hours. The hardened area shrinks within a few days.

Bottles can be used to feed your baby expressed breast milk or commercial infant formula. Regardless of the type of milk you're using, you'll need to prepare and use baby bottles in a similar way. This chapter contains information on: Choosing bottles and nipples Bottle-feeding your baby Food-related problems for bottle-fed babies Cleaning bottles, nipples and breast pumps You'll find everything you need to know about milk types and choices in the Milk chapter on page 382 .General information on feeding your baby (burping, gas, eating behaviour, feeding schedule, etc.) can be found in the Feeding your baby chapter on page 366 . If you are breastfeeding your baby, be aware that some babies find it hard to return to the breast after drinking from a bottle a few times. Bottle -feed ing is also associated with shorter nursing periods, particularly when using commercial infant formula. Keep an eye on your baby's behaviour.498Feeding your child Bottle-feeding your babychoosing baby bottles and nipples There are a number of types of baby bottles and nipples. Most companies try to sell their products by claiming they \"prevent colic\" or are \"closer to the breast.\" Such marketing claims have not been scientifically proven.Bottles Various types of bottles are available: glass, plastic or with disposable bags. Broadly speaking, they come in two sizes: 150 ml to 180 ml (5 to 6 ounces) and 240 ml to 270 ml (8 to 9 ounces). Each bottle type has its own advantages and disadvantages. Choose the type that best suits you. Bottles currently on sale in Canada do not contain polycarbonate, a hard, transparent plastic that can release bisphenol A when it comes into contact with hot or boiling liquids. The Canadian government recently banned the sale and import of polycarbonate bottles to protect the health of newborn babies and nursing infants, even though it acknowledges that the quantities of bisphenol A released by bottles are not sufficient to cause harm. All the same, it's best to buy new bottles and avoid using second-hand ones.Feeding your child 499 Bottle-feeding your babyNipples Every baby is unique. Your baby might prefer one kind of nipple, and your neighbour's baby might prefer another. No nipple really resembles the breast; nor can it guarantee that the breast/bottle combination will work for all babies. Nipples come in different shapes, sizes, materials (latex or silicone) and degrees of firmness. There is no scientific evidence that one type of nipple is better than another for your baby. Some babies find it easier to drink with one particular type of nipple, while others have no trouble adapting to any kind. You will probably have to try a few different types before you find the one that works best for your baby. Most companies sell nipples with different flow speeds. For newborns, a slow-flow nipple is best, because your baby is still learning. Many newborns tend to choke when milk flows into their mouth too quickly. As your baby gets older, you can choose a faster-flowing nipple.How much milk? The amount of milk consumed varies widely from one baby to the next, and from one day to another. Over the first few days, your baby will drink only a small amount because his stomach is still very small. This amount will increase gradually. Your baby may be very hungry in the evening and less so in the morning. It's best to observe and watch for signs of hunger or fullness and let him decide how much milk he needs. Respect your baby's appetite! No research has been conducted into how much milk babies need at a given age. The information in the table on the following page is only meant to illustrate how much a baby may drink in a day.500Feeding your child Bottle-feeding your babyDaily amount of milk: an illustration Age Daily amount (24 hours) Within the 1st week Steady increase from 180 ml to 600 ml 1st week until the end of the 1st month450 ml to 800 ml 2nd and 3rd months 500 ml to 900 ml 4th, 5th and 6th months 850 ml to 1,000 ml 7th to 12th months 750 ml to 850 ml 1 oz = 30 ml 1 cup = 250 ml Remember that tables don't take into account the individual needs of your baby, who is unique. Observing your baby will likely teach you much more than reading this table. You can also ask a doctor, midwife or CLSC nurse for advice, if you feel the need. Maroussia Beaulieu Your baby is unique. Watch him and he'll let you know if he has had enough to drink.Feeding your child 501 Bottle-feeding your babyWarming milk There is no nutritional reason to heat milk, but most babies prefer it lukewarm. Children usually begin drinking refrigerated drinks like milk, water and juice at 10 to 12 months, but if your child doesn't like cold milk, you can continue warming it up. To reheat milk: Put the milk container in warm water for a few minutes until lukewarm. Shake gently. Disposable bags heat more quickly than plastic or glass bottles. To check the temperature, pour a few drops on the back of your hand or the inside of your wrist. The milk should be neither hot nor cold to the touch.To thaw or reheat frozen breast milk: Run cold water over the container, then gradually add hot water until the milk is lukewarm. Or put the milk in the refrigerator for 10 to 12 hours, then warm it in hot water. Stir, check the temperature and feed it to your baby. Do not warm milk in a microwave oven. Microwaves heat unevenly, often at dangerously high temperatures.502Feeding your child Bottle-feeding your babyDo not warm a bottle of milk in boiling water on the stove. All foods\u2014both liquid and solid\u2014lose some of their nutritional value when overheated. And babies have been accidentally burned with milk that was too hot or was heated in a microwave oven. Microwave ovens are also unsuitable because there is a risk that bags and glass bottles might explode. Also breast milk loses some of its vitamins and antibodies when reheated in the microwave. Don't leave reheated milk for more than two hours at room temperature. Throw it away if it is left out for this long because bacteria multiply quickly and could cause diarrhea.Bottle-feeding your baby Feeding will go more smoothly if you bottle-feed your baby as soon as he shows signs of hunger. Make yourself comfortable. If need be, slide a pillow under the arm holding your baby. Tilt the bottle slightly to keep the neck full of milk and to make sure your baby doesn't swallow any air. Change positions between feedings, moving your baby from one side to the other. This will help your baby's eyesight develop. It's sometimes a good idea to take a break or two while feeding, especially in the first few months.Feeding your child 503 Bottle-feeding your babyFeeding time is a great opportunity to bond with your little one. Don't hesitate to make skin-to-skin contact with your baby. This makes him feel safe and warm. Taking time to relax while feeding your baby in your arms is good for both of you. It's not advisable to let your baby hold the bottle by himself in his bed or baby chair because he may choke while drinking. Feeding your baby is something you learn how to do gradually. Give yourself time and learn to trust yourself!Bottle-feeding problems and solutions Babies can sometimes have trouble feeding. Usually, the problem is temporary. The first thing to do is observe your baby. Try to get a feel for her temperament as well as her feeding and sleeping routine. Your baby sleeps a lot If your baby sleeps a lot, you probably wonder whether you should wake her to feed. Knowing what's best isn't always easy. You can follow her routine and let her sleep if she Wakes up on her own to feed Is an active and effective feeder Pees at least 6 times and passes at least 3 stools a day Is calm and seems satisfied after feeding Has regained her birth weight and continues to put on weight504Feeding your child Bottle-feeding your babyIn this case, there is nothing to worry about. Babies each have their own routine that develops over time. Some babies sleep so much they may skip some feedings, especially during the first 2 to 3 weeks. This means they will have a hard time getting all the milk they need. If your baby sleeps a lot and doesn't show the signs described above, you need to stimulate her to drink more. What to do Keep an eye out for signs that she's sleeping lightly (she's moving, making sucking motions, or moving her eyes beneath her eyelids) when it will be easier to wake her up. Stimulate her: talk to her, massage her back, legs, arms, etc. Leave her in an undershirt or diaper: babies drink less when they are warm. See a professional if you're worried or see no improvement after a few days. Marie-\u00c8ve Bolduc You may need to wake your baby up to feed her if she sleeps a lot.Feeding your child 505 Bottle-feeding your babyYour baby drinks very slowly Babies can't always suck effectively at the start. This is more common among babies who were born a few weeks prematurely (between 35 and 37 weeks of pregnancy). Even full-term babies may need a few days or weeks to get the hang of things. This situation usually improves with time. Be patient: your baby is learning. Some babies, however, will continue to drink slowly even as they get older. What to do Change to a faster nipple. Stimulate your baby as she feeds by rubbing her feet and tickling her back and sides. Run your finger under her chin and across her cheeks to stimulate her. Change her diaper or change her position for a few minutes.Your baby often chokes while drinking If the nipple you are using flows too quickly and your baby has too much milk in her mouth, she may choke (i.e., she swallows noisily, coughs and spits up a little milk). What to do Change to a slower nipple. Take short feeding breaks. Avoid laying your baby on her back during feeding since milk will flow into her mouth even when she's not sucking. Try to feed her in a near-sitting position so that the bottle is tilted only slightly downward (just enough for the nipple to fill with milk and not air). Your baby will then be able to drink at her own pace.506Feeding your child Bottle-feeding your babyYour baby regurgitates a lot As long as your baby is happy and putting on weight, regurgitation (\"spitting up\") is generally nothing to worry about (see Regurgitation , page 374) . Some babies drink very fast, and their stomachs expand too quickly. This makes it easier for them to regurgitate, especially if they are very active and start moving around right after feeding. If milk is coming out of the bottle too quickly, your baby will drink too much just to satisfy her need to suck. If she regurgitates a lot, the nipple on the bottle may be too fast.What to do If your baby is in good spirits and gaining weight, there's nothing to worry about. You don't need to do anything. If regurgitation seems to be bothering her, watch her drink. If necessary, try these strategies: Change to a slower nipple. Take short feeding breaks. Try to burp her more. Avoid laying your baby on her back during feeding. Try to feed her in a near-sitting position so that milk will flow into her mouth more slowly. Try to keep activity to a minimum right after feeding.Feeding your child 507 Bottle-feeding your babyIt's best to see a doctor if your baby Seems to be in pain Projectile vomits several times a day Wets fewer diapers Isn't putting on enough weight Your baby refuses the bottle Your baby normally breastfeeds, and you want to bottle -feed her? If she has trouble bottle-feeding or refuses to altogether, see the tips on Combining breast and bottle , page 462 . cleaning bottles, nipples and breast pumps Breast pumps and baby bottles need to be kept very clean when feeding your baby breast milk or commercial infant formula. Be sure to carefully wash bottles, nipples, breast pumps and other articles used for feeding. This will help prevent gastroenteritis and prevent fungal infections in your baby's mouth.Cleaning recommendations for bottles and nipples are slightly different depending on which milk you use. Breast milk contains white blood cells and other components that prevent bacteria from growing for a while. Commercial infant formulas contain no such components and may also have been contaminated during preparation. Inspect the nipples regularly. They will wear out over time due to the effects of suction, heat, contact with milk and exposure to sunlight. Replace them before they become soft or sticky, and throw them away immediately if they have holes, are torn or change texture. Disposable bags are too flimsy to be reused. Don't pour hot milk into them either as they could burst. It is important to thoroughly wash baby bottles, nipples, breast pumps, and other items used for feedings to prevent gastro-enteritis and the development of thrush in your baby's mouth.508Feeding your child Bottle-feeding your babyCare and cleaning recommendations for baby bottles, nipples and breast pumps Germs, particularly bacteria, may develop and survive in milk, so be sure to remove all traces of milk from bottles, nipples and breast pumps every time you use them. Cleaning When: After every feeding, clean everything thoroughly no matter what type of milk you use. How: Immediately after feeding, take everything apart. Rinse the bottle, nipple and cap or breast pump in cold water. Be sure to run water through the hole in the nipple to remove surplus milk. Use hot, soapy water and a nipple and bottle brush. Scrub the bottle and nipple well, inside and out. Make sure to thoroughly clean all grooves on both the plastic ring and the bottle. Rinse in warm tap water. Drain and cover with a clean towel.Once the bottles and nipples are clean, you can disinfect them to reduce the number of remaining bacteria.Cleaning is the most important step in caring for these items. Once the bottles and nipples are clean, you can disinfect them to reduce the number of remaining bacteria.Feeding your child 509 Bottle-feeding your babyDisinfection (sterilization) When: Disinfect everything before using it for the first time, whether it's for breast milk or commercial infant formula. If you're using commercial infant formula, disinfect your material after every feeding until your baby is 4 months old. You can disinfect all your bottles and nipples once a day if you have enough of them to use for a full day's feeding. How: In boiling water In the dishwasher With an appliance sold to disinfect baby bottles and nipples Take everything apart, clean all parts thoroughly and put them in a large saucepan. Cover in water, taking care there are no bubbles trapped in the bottles. Cover the saucepan to prevent too much water evaporating. Bring the water to a boil and boil for at least 5 to 10 minutes. Let cool and remove the items with clean hands. Drain and cover with a clean towel.To disinfect items in the dishwasher, your dishwasher must have a high -temperature washing and drying cycle.

They don't need to drink water between feedings. Babies fed with commercial infant formula generally don't need water between feedings if the formula has been prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions. Around 6 months of age, when your baby starts to eat foods, offer her a small amount of water at a time in a cup.Boil water for babies under 4 months All water given to babies under 4 months must be boiled, whether it comes from a municipal system, private well, bulk container or bottle. You should also sterilize the containers in which you store boiled water, as well as baby bottles (see Cleaning bottles, nipples and breast pumps , page 507) . How to prepare and store boiled water: Fill a pot with water. Boil at a full rolling boil for at least 1 minute. Cool the boiled water by placing the pot in cold water. Transfer the boiled water into sterilized containers.512Feeding your child WaterYou can also use a kettle, but make sure it doesn't have an automatic shutoff, because the water must boil for 1 full minute. Boiled water can be kept in sterilized, properly sealed containers in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days or for 24 hours if kept at room temperature out of direct sunlight. From 4 months on, your baby can drink unboiled water. choosing the right water Some micro-organisms that are harmless to adults can cause diarrhea or other illnesses in young children. That's why the water you give your infant, whether in a cup, or mixed in formula or pur\u00e9es, must always be good quality. Plus, it must not contain high levels of mineral salts. Pascale Turcotte If you give your baby water before she is 4 months old, make sure it has boiled thoroughly for 1 minute, whether it comes from a municipal system, private well, bulk container, or bottle.Feeding your child 513 WaterWater recommended for infantsWater not recommended for infants Municipal tap water Water from lakes or rivers Water from a private well that meets quality standardsWater from a natural source whose quality is not tested regularly Commercial bottled or bulk-packaged waterMineral or mineralized water If you are unsure of the quality of the water or if there is a public advisory against drinking or cooking with your water, do not give it to your baby. Give him recommended bottled water or water from a clean well or water supply that has been tested and approved.Municipal tap water Water from municipal water supplies is subject to quality control. When such systems supply water to more than 20 people, the system operator must monitor water quality in accordance with strict standards. Water from municipal systems that serve more than 5,000 residents must be monitored even more closely. If the water fails to meet microbiological standards, the system operator is required to immediately inform the population through radio or newspaper announcements, individual notices, or other means.514Feeding your child WaterPrivate well water You can use water from a private well (surface or artesian well) provided recent tests show that it meets quality standards. If it is a new well, the water should be tested for chemicals and bacteria by a lab accredited by minist\u00e8re de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques. For the names of accredited labs in your region, log onto ceaeq.gouv.qc.ca/accreditation/PALA/lla03.htm . If you own a private well, it is recommended that you have your well water tested at least twice a year. Tests can detect undesirable bacteria like E. coli and chemical compounds such as nitrites and nitrates. For more information, visit: mddelcc.gouv.qc.ca/eau/ potable/depliant/index-en.htm . When concentrations of chemical substances in drinking water exceed allowable levels, use another source of drinking water, like bottled water. Genevi\u00e8ve Colpron When using tap water, let it run until the water is cold. This gets rid of possible buildup of lead, copper, and certain bacteria.Feeding your child 515 WaterIf you have doubts about the quality of well water in your area, you can contact A local well digger Your municipality For more information, contact Minist\u00e8re de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques Your local public health department A lab in your area accredited by minist\u00e8re de l'Environnement et de la Lutte also consult: quebec.ca/en/environment-and-natural-resources/drinking-water/contaminants-in- drinking-water-wells/ . Do not drink warm tap water and do not use it to prepare your baby's bottles or for cooking as it may contain more lead, contaminants, and bacteria than cold water.Bottled water Only two types of bottled water are suitable for your baby. Spring water comes from an underground spring and contains low mineral levels. It is tested twice for quality control\u2014once at the spring and again at the bottling plant. Spring water that is labelled \"natural\" has not been treated or modified in any way. Generally speaking, water bottled in Qu\u00e9bec is disinfected with ozone or UV rays to eliminate microorganisms. Non-mineralized treated water is tap water that has been filtered and purified to resemble spring water. It does not contain any added mineral salts.516Feeding your child WaterBulk water If you drink bulk-packaged water, make sure that it comes from a source known for its quality and stability. Keep in mind that bulk containers can be contaminated during the filling process, which is why all containers used to hold bulk water must be washed in very hot soapy water and thoroughly rinsed before filling.Water coolers If you use a water cooler, be sure to clean it regularly according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Also, be sure to keep the cooler spout very clean, as it can be easily contaminated by children or adults with dirty hands or by pets. Water treatment devices Some people use home water-treatment devices to improve the quality or taste of their water. Products certified by the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF), among others, meet the quality standards for which they were designed, when used according to instructions.Feeding your child 517 WaterHowever, it is best not to give water treated with these devices to babies younger than 6 months since there are no official standards for these devices. Little is known about the safety and efficiency of home water-treatment systems. There are, however, a number of known risks related to some of these devices: Water softeners connected to the tap or water intake increase the amount of sodium (salt). Charcoal filters (with or without silver) can increase the silver content and the amount of some bacteria. Distillation units (stills) and reverse osmosis devices reduce mineral content. In addition, these devices are difficult to clean. You must also remember to change the filter or membrane regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions.Water problems Water can change colour, smell, and taste. Got doubts about the quality of your water? If you are connected to a municipal water supply, contact the municipality or waterworks operator.

Introduce them in keeping with your baby's own pace and needs. Your baby's first taste of food will be a whole new experience. It takes time to get used to eating foods. Gradually, your baby will develop a taste for new foods and textures. By age 1 or so, she will be eating most of the same foods as the rest of the family.When should I introduce foods? Babies' nutritional needs change as they grow. Before 6 months, most babies meet all their nutritional needs with their milk. At about six months of age, it becomes necessary to introduce foods into your baby's diet. These foods provide the extra energy babies need to grow. They also help prevent problems like iron deficiency. If you introduce foods earlier, they will replace milk instead of complementing it. If you wait until later, your baby may not get all the nutrients he needs and could have more difficulty adapting to foods.Breast milk or infant formula will be your baby's main food during the first year of life. Foods can complement\u2014but not replace\u2014milk.520Feeding your child FoodsContrary to popular belief, eating cereal at supper does not help infants sleep through the night. How long they sleep at night depends on their biological rhythm and temperament.How do I know my baby is ready? It's not always easy to determine the best time to introduce foods to your baby since she can't talk yet. But it is possible. Here's how to tell she's ready: Your baby is around 6 months old. Your baby can sit in a high chair without support. Your baby has good control of her head and can turn away to indicate refusal. She may also try to bring food to her mouth. Keep in mind that a baby under 6 months old isn't necessarily ready for foods just because she nurses more often for several days. More frequent feedings could be due to a growth spurt or a temporary need for more milk (see Growth spurts , page 372) .Feeding your child 521 FoodsHowever, some babies may need to start eating foods a little earlier than 6 months. When you start introducing foods to your baby, the quantity of milk she drinks shouldn't decrease all that much. Interest in food varies greatly from one baby to the next. Some need several tries before they get used to foods, while others like them so much that they lose interest in milk. A baby under 6 months old isn't necessarily ready for foods just because she nurses more often for several days. What about premature babies? Premature babies are introduced to foods the same way as term babies are\u2014with one key difference. The decision about when to start foods must be based on the corrected age\u2014i.e., the age the baby would be had he been born on the original due date\u2014to ensure his system is mature enough.522Feeding your child FoodsHow should I introduce foods? Order of introduction The order in which foods are introduced varies from country to country, depending on customs and culture. The important thing is to start with iron-rich foods, then continue with a nutritious variety of foods (see Start with iron-rich foods , page 540) . Note, however, that cow's milk should not be introduced before 9 to 12 months. The important thing is to start with iron-rich foods, then continue with a nutritious variety of foods. Jean-Claude Mercier Once your baby starts eating foods, continue breastfeeding as often as he wants. If you feed your baby commercial infant formula, give him at least 750 ml (25 oz) of milk a day.Feeding your child 523 FoodsA word about food allergies The foods most likely to cause allergies are eggs (see Eggs , page 549) , peanuts and other nuts (see Peanut and nut butters , page 549) , fish and seafood (see Fish , page 546) and foods that contain cow's milk protein (see Milk and dairy products , page 557) . In the past, it was recommended that parents wait until their babies had reached a certain age before introducing foods more likely to cause allergies. We now know that delaying the introduction of these foods does not prevent allergies, even in children with a greater risk of developing food allergies.A child is at greater risk of developing a food allergy if A member of his immediate family (mother, father, brother, or sister) has an allergic disorder or The child suffers from severe eczema (shows signs of eczema most of the time) Talk to your doctor. New foods It is often suggested to introduce one new food at a time to your baby, and to wait 2 or 3 days before adding something new. That way, if your baby shows signs of discomfort or allergies, it will be easier to identify the food that is responsible. 524Feeding your child FoodsAfter your baby has tried a new food, watch her. To learn more about the signs of an allergic reaction and the steps to take, see How do I recognize allergies? , page 572 . When introducing new foods, continue to give your baby the foods she already knows on a regular basis. Don't insist if your baby refuses a new food for a few days. Try introducing it again later. You may have to present a food a number of times (up to 10 and sometimes even more) before your baby accepts it. This is how she learns to like new flavours. It's best to avoid foods with added salt or sugar until your baby is at least 1 year old. This will help her develop a taste for foods in their natural state. Quantity and frequency Your baby has a small stomach, so he needs to eat small portions several times a day. Your baby's appetite is your best guide to knowing how much food he needs. The quantity will depend on how much milk he drinks and will vary with his growth rate. When your baby starts eating foods, he will probably continue drinking about the same amount of milk. At around 8 or 9 months, he will gradually start drinking less. When your baby starts eating foods, the number of breast or bottle feedings can stay the same. The amount of milk he drinks will probably not decrease very much.Feeding your child 525 FoodsAt the start, your baby has to adapt; he will probably eat a few small spoonfuls of food once or more during the day. Little by little, the amount of food and the number of meals and snacks will increase. You could, for example, give him two or three meals a day. Depending on how much he eats, you could add snacks between meals. By around 1 year of age, your child will be able to adopt a more regular schedule for meals (breakfast, lunch, supper) and snacks (between meals and at night, as needed). Appetite A baby's appetite is like an adult's: it can vary from one day to the next. It's normal for babies to sometimes eat less, and it's possible that they may not like certain foods or textures. By watching your baby for specific signals, you'll learn to know her appetite. If your baby shows interest in the food you give, it's because she is still hungry, and you can continue feeding without hesitation. However, if she closes her mouth, refuses to eat, pushes her spoon away, turns her head, cries, or plays with her food, she is signalling that she has had enough to eat. It's possible that your child will eat less when she starts eating independently. Don't insist. Mealtime will be more pleasant for the whole family and your child will get to know her appetite. Trust your child to know when she is full.526Feeding your child FoodsTexture When first introducing foods, you can start by giving your baby smooth pur\u00e9es. Some babies will be ready right away for thicker, lumpier pur\u00e9es blended for only a short time or mashed with a fork. Others will find it more difficult to adapt, in which case you can gradually alter the texture from one meal to the next. Pascale Turcotte Your baby can gradually start eating soft foods mashed with a fork or cut into small pieces.Feeding your child 527 FoodsSome babies will rapidly accept food that is finely chopped or cut into small pieces. There is no need to wait until your child has teeth, since he can already chew with his gums and enjoys doing so. The goal is to progress so that by around 1 year of age, your baby is able to eat foods in a variety of textures. But be careful with foods that present a risk of choking (see Choking risk: Be extra careful until age 4 , page 530) .Gagging When your baby starts eating, small amounts of food may lodge in the back of his throat without being swallowed. This can cause your baby to gag, as if he were about to vomit. Your baby will cough and spit up the food he was given. Don't worry, this is a normal reaction (gag reflex) that protects against choking. However, if this happens at every meal for several days in a row, see a doctor.528Feeding your child FoodsIndependence Babies love bringing food and objects to their mouths. Let your child start eating with her fingers as soon as possible while at the same time keeping a close eye on her. It's messier and takes more time, but it's a lot more fun! Encourage her, because that's how she learns to eat by herself\u2014it's an important step to becoming more independent! First meals While some babies have no trouble adapting to meals, others find it difficult. To make things easier, choose a time when your baby is in a good mood. The movements involved in eating are very different from those your baby uses for nursing. It takes time to learn. Your baby will need several weeks of practice to develop his abilities and tastes. Your baby can have his milk before or after foods. If you wish, you can give him some of his milk before and the rest after. Carolann Rioux-Beauchamp By around 1 year of age, your child should be able to eat foods in a variety of textures.Feeding your child 529 FoodsMy baby refuses to eat If your baby refuses to eat, she may not be ready. If you're not sure, see How do I know my baby is ready? on page 520 . If you think your baby is ready, but she still refuses to eat, try again at the next meal and keep trying for one or two more days. You can also offer her a different food: maybe she didn't like what you served. If your baby is over 6 months and still refuses to eat after repeated attempts, consult a health professional. France Tremblay Your baby needs time to develop her sense of taste and adapt to change.530Feeding your child Foodschoking risk: Be extra careful until age 4 Certain foods can become stuck in your child's throat or block her airway. Many children choke on food each year. Foods that are hard, small, round, smooth, or sticky present the greatest risk. Certain foods require careful preparation. To prevent the risk of choking, be sure to Remove bones from meat and fish Remove cores and pits from fruit Cut grapes into quarters Grate raw hard vegetables and fruits like carrots, turnips, and apples Toward age 2, you can start giving your child whole apples (peeled) and whole small fruit, except for grapes, which you should continue cutting into quarters. Certain foods present a choking risk for your child up until the age of 4: peanuts, nuts, seeds, hard candy, cough drops, popcorn, chewing gum, whole grapes, raisins, sliced sausage, raw carrots or celery, food on toothpicks or skewers, ice cubes, etc.Feeding your child 531 FoodsRules to prevent choking Make sure your child is always supervised when eating. Sit your child in a high chair or at the table. Don't let your child walk or run with food in her mouth. Avoid feeding your child in the car. Keep dangerous foods out of reach. Ask older children to follow these rules. A first aid course will teach you what to do if your child is choking. To familiarize yourself with the appropriate techniques, you can read the advice on page 718 . Pascale Turcotte To prevent choking, be sure to take certain precautions when preparing food.532Feeding your child FoodsHoney\u2014never for babies under age 1 Never give honey to a child before the age of 1, even as an ingredient in recipes or cooking. Both pasteurized and unpasteurized honey can cause a serious form of food poisoning known as infant botulism. After age 1, healthy children run very little risk of contracting infant botulism because their intestines contain useful bacteria that protect against the disease. Baby food basics This section features all the information you need to prepare homemade baby pur\u00e9es and purchase commercial baby food. It also provides instructions on warming and storing baby food. Remember that your baby will learn quite quickly to eat foods of varied textures. There's no need to stock up on large quantities of baby food! Never add honey to any food for a baby under age 1\u2014not even during cooking!Feeding your child 533 FoodsHomemade baby food Homemade baby food provides excellent nutritional value. It is fresher, more varied, better tasting, and less expensive than commercial baby food. What's more, it has the advantage of containing only the ingredients you choose. Purchasing foods Select the freshest fruits and vegetables possible. If using frozen products, make sure they don't contain any salt, sugar, or seasoning. Buy lean meat whenever possible.Canned vegetables, meat, and fish are not good choices if they contain salt. You can use canned fruit, however, if it's packed in fruit juice with no added sugar. Hygiene Wash your hands and clean your cooking utensils and work area carefully before you start preparing baby food, as well as each time you change foods. 534Feeding your child FoodsHow to prepare vegetable and fruit pur\u00e9es Preparing fruit and vegetable pur\u00e9es Wash all fruits and vegetables before cooking. If necessary, remove peels, cores, pits, and seeds. Cut the fruits and vegetables into pieces. If necessary, steam the food item (in a vegetable steamer, for example) or cook in a microwave. Check if it is done. You should be able to stick a fork into it easily. Pur\u00e9e the food using a fork, blender or food processor. You can add liquid to obtain the desired texture, e.g., fresh water or cooking water (see Nitrates in vegetables , page 552 ). 3 Sarah Witty 2 Am\u00e9lie Bourret 1 Sarah Witty It is not necessary to add salt or sugar.Feeding your child 535 FoodsHow to prepare meat, poultry, and fish pur\u00e9es Preparing meat and poultry pur\u00e9es Take certain precautions when cooking meat or poultry for your child. Remove skin from poultry and any visible fat from meat. Cut meat or poultry into pieces. Cook in plenty of water. Meat is cooked enough when you can easily cut it with a fork. Remove bones. Put the meat or poultry in a blender. Pur\u00e9e, adding enough cooking liquid to obtain the desired texture.Preparing fish pur\u00e9es Certain precautions should also be taken when preparing fish pur\u00e9es: Cook fish in water on the stove or in the microwave, without adding any salt. Carefully remove any bones. Break up the fish with a fork or pur\u00e9e it with the cooking liquid. Don't add salt or other seasoning during or after cooking.536Feeding your child FoodsHow to freeze homemade pur\u00e9es If you want to make pur\u00e9es in advance, it's best to freeze them immediately after preparation. To do so: Pour the pur\u00e9e into ice cube trays while it is still warm. Cover and cool in the refrigerator. Put the ice cube trays in the freezer for 8 to 12 hours. Transfer the frozen pur\u00e9e cubes to a freezer bag. Remove the air from the bag. Write the name of the food and the cooking date on the bag and then put it in the freezer. To find out how long you can keep pur\u00e9es, see Storing baby food , page 539 .Commercial baby food Whether jarred or frozen, commercial baby food has good nutritional value. It's very practical since it's always ready to eat, but it costs more than homemade baby food. Some commercial baby food contains unnecessary ingredients like starch, sugar, flour, tapioca, or cream that decrease the nutritional value. Read the list of ingredients on the packaging to choose products without unnecessary additions. Purchasing commercial baby food Vegetable-meat combinations - These can be handy on occasion, but don't contain very much meat. Frozen products generally contain more meat than jarred ones. If you choose meat-only pur\u00e9es, it will be easier for you to estimate how much meat your child eats and serve the vegetables of your choice.Feeding your child 537 Foods\"Junior\" pur\u00e9es - These pur\u00e9es contain small pieces of food designed to facilitate the transition from baby food to regular food that the family eats. However, they are of limited benefit because you can achieve the same results by mashing foods with a fork. There are also ready-to-eat meals. These products contain salt and should not be given to children under 12 months old. After this age, your child can simply start sharing meals with the family.Handling commercial baby food Here are a few steps to take in order to eliminate the risk of food poisoning: Throw out or return any jars that have rusted lids or chipped glass, or do not make a popping noise when you open them. Store unopened jars according to the best-before date and use the jars with the closest date first. Put only as much food as you will use in a small bowl and refrigerate the rest immediately. Commercial baby food can be frozen for the period indicated in the Storing baby food table on page 539 .538Feeding your child FoodsWarming baby food Whenever possible, warm only as much baby food as you will need. Before feeding your child, always check the temperature using the inside of your wrist or the back of your hand. To limit the risk of contamination, throw out any leftover baby food. To warm fresh or refrigerated baby food, use one of the following three methods: Put the pur\u00e9e on the stovetop in a small saucepan or double boiler and warm over low heat. Put a small amount of food in a glass bowl and let it warm slowly in hot water for a few minutes. Put the food on a small plate and heat it in the microwave. Carefully read the section on microwave precautions. Pascale Turcotte Make sure family members and babysitters fully understand how to warm baby food.Feeding your child 539 FoodsStoring baby food Homemade and commercial baby food can be stored according to the storage life indicated in the table below: Type of food Refrigerator Freezer Vegetables and fruit 2 to 3 days 2 to 3 months Meat, poultry, fish 1 to 2 days 1 to 2 months Meat with vegetables 1 to 2 days 1 to 2 months Do not refreeze thawed food.Microwave precautions Microwaves do not heat food evenly. That's why it is important to take certain precautions: Warm the baby food in a small, microwave-safe dish. Stir it well once it is warm. Wait around 30 seconds. Before serving the pur\u00e9e, check the temperature using the back of your hand or the inside of your wrist.540Feeding your child FoodsStart with iron-rich foods Your baby's first foods should be rich in iron. Why? Because iron plays a number of key roles in her development. Iron is found in Iron-enriched baby cereal Meat and poultry Fish Tofu Legumes Eggs Choose foods based on you and your baby's preferences. Give him iron-rich foods at least twice a day.A vegetarian diet may be suitable for your baby if it is well balanced. However, if too many foods are excluded, your baby's diet may be lacking in certain nutrients . It's best to see a nutritionist about this. Good to know ... Fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamin C, which helps the body absorb iron. Introduce them early into your baby's diet.6 to 12 months\u2014Your baby's first foods Between 6 months and 1 year, give iron-rich foods to your baby at least twice a day. After, serve some at each meal.Feeding your child 541 Foodscontinue with a variety of foods After your baby has been eating one or more iron-rich foods for several days, it's time to add a growing variety of foods into her diet. You can introduce new foods in whatever order you please. Remember, however, that your baby should not drink cow's milk before the age of 9 months. You don't need to introduce all of the foods from the same food group before starting on the next group. For ideas on foods to give your baby, see Food ideas for your baby on page 560 . A tear-off version of this table can be found after page 576.Ideally, your baby will be eating foods from all the food groups within a few weeks. Toward the age of 1 year, your child will be eating a wide variety of foods. In the upcoming pages, you'll find practical information about the four food groups: Grain products Meat and alternatives Vegetables and fruit Milk and alternatives542Feeding your child FoodsGrain products This food group includes grains like oats, wheat, barley, rice, buckwheat, rye, millet, and quinoa. It also includes pasta and bread. Iron-enriched cereals Iron-enriched baby cereals not only contain iron, but other vitamins and minerals as well. They are among the first foods that should be introduced. How to choose cereal Start by giving cereals containing only one type of grain (e.g., barley). At the beginning, opt for cereals containing no fruit, vegetables, or other additions. Choose sugar-free cereals. Carefully read the ingredients list on the packaging. Sugar hides behind many names, including dextrose, maltose, sucrose, inverted sugar, glucose polymers, fructose, syrup, and honey. How to prepare cereal To prepare cereal, use breast milk or infant formula. Some cereals already contain powdered milk, in which case all you have to do is add water. It's important not to add sugar to cereal.Serving cereal or any other food in a baby bottle is not recommended.Feeding your child 543 FoodsHow to get started Start by mixing 3 to 5 ml ( 1/2 to 1 te aspoon) of dry cereal with liquid and give it to your baby. If she readily accepts it, continue until she is satisfied, adapting to her appetite. Gradually increase the quantity over time. Keep in mind that your child is already nourished with her milk. Later, you can flavour the baby cereal with fruit or buy different flavours of cereal. Pascale Turcotte Iron-enriched baby cereals are among the first foods you should introduce to your baby.544Feeding your child FoodsOther grain products Once your baby is eating iron-rich foods at least twice a day and has a varied diet, you can introduce other grain products. It's best to opt for whole grain products like whole wheat bread and pasta. They contain more fibre, which ensures your baby has regular bowel movements. To help you choose, read the list of ingredients: the first ingredient must be a whole grain (e.g., whole grain oats or whole wheat flour).If your baby accepts different textures, offer her foods like toast, pita bread, naan bread or chapati, tortillas, breadsticks, unsalted crackers, unsweetened oat ring cereal, and all types of pasta. Be careful with rice because your child can choke on it. It's best to start with sticky, short-grain rice and mash it with a fork.Feeding your child 545 FoodsMeat and alternatives This food group is made up of foods that are rich in proteins: meat, poultry, fish, and alternatives such as legumes, tofu, and eggs. Because they are rich in iron, they are among the first foods you should introduce to your baby.Meat and poultry Meat (beef, pork, veal, lamb, etc.) and poultry (chicken, turkey, etc.) provide protein. They also provide vitamins and certain minerals, especially iron and zinc. How to prepare meat and poultry All meat and poultry must be well cooked. To begin, serve meat pur\u00e9es, then gradually modify the texture as your baby learns to chew. For example, you can serve finely chopped meat or tender and juicy bite-sized pieces. How to get started Start by giving your baby 3 to 5 ml ( 1/2 to 1 te aspoon) of meat or poultry. During the meal or at subsequent meals, gradually increase the quantity, taking into account your child's appetite and preferences. Meat and alternatives are rich in iron. They are among the first foods you should introduce to your baby.546Feeding your child FoodsGame meat You can also serve game meat, though it's preferable to serve game killed with lead-free ammunition. Lead can negatively affect children's development. Do not give your child organ meats (e.g., liver, heart) from game animals, as they are often contaminated. Deli meats It's best to avoid deli meats (e.g., ham, sausage, p\u00e2t\u00e9s, salami, bologna, mock chicken, bacon) because they contain nitrates, and nitrites that can be harmful to your child's health. If you decide to serve deli meats to your family and to your child when he is older, choose those that are the leanest and contain the least amount of salt and spices.Fish Fish is a source of protein, iron, vitamin D, and good fat. In the past, parents were recommended to wait until babies reached a certain age before introducing fish. We now know that this does not prevent allergies. Are you concerned about allergies? Read A word about food allergies on page 523 .Feeding your child 547 FoodsDon't hesitate to make fish a regular part of your baby's diet. You can serve your baby many of the types of fish available at the supermarket and in fish markets. See Fish and seafood , page 88 .Canned fish is usually very salty. However, you can occasionally serve unsalted canned fish like salmon or light tuna (but not white tuna). Don't give raw or smoked fish to your child, since young children are more sensitive to the parasites they sometimes contain. 548Feeding your child FoodsLegumes and tofu Legumes and tofu are a nutritious and inexpensive. They are a good source of vegetable protein and iron. Legumes are also rich in fibre. There are many kinds of legumes, including lentils, chickpeas, kidney beans, black beans, white beans, etc. Serve them in pur\u00e9es, mashed with a fork, or in soups.Opt for regular tofu (firm, semi firm, or extra firm) rather than soft tofu. Soft tofu contains more water, and therefore has less protein and iron. Tofu can easily be mashed with a fork or crumbled and mixed with vegetables. Feeding your child 549 FoodsEggs Eggs are nutritious, convenient, and inexpensive. In the past, parents were recommended to wait until their babies had reached a certain age before introducing egg whites. We now know that this does not prevent allergies.You can give your child whole eggs (the yolk and the white). Serve eggs hardboiled, poached, scrambled, or in an omelette. Make sure the egg is well cooked, and never raw or runny. Are you concerned about allergies? Read A word about food allergies , page 523 .Peanut and nut butters Peanut and nut butters are convenient and nutritious. In the past, parents were recommended to wait until their babies had reached a certain age before introducing these foods. We now know that this does not prevent allergies. You can serve your child smooth nut butters, spread thinly on warm toast. Crunchy nut butters, peanuts, and nuts should not be given to children under age 4 because they present a choking hazard. It is not safe to give your child nut butter by the spoonful either.550Feeding your child FoodsVegetables and fruit Vegetables and fruit are vital for good health. Not only do they add a wide variety of flavours to your baby's diet, they also provide minerals and vitamins like vitamin C. They are rich in fibre, too, which helps your baby have regular bowel movements. After a certain time, you can make fruits and vegetables part of every meal. For example you can serve vegetables at lunch and supper, and give your baby fruit at breakfast and for dessert. Fruits and vegetables also make good snacks. Sophie Roy Once your baby is eating iron-rich foods every day, you can add fruits and vegetables to her diet. Feeding your child 551 FoodsVegetables Give your baby a variety of vegetables. More colourful vegetables are generally more nutritious. For this reason, it's good to regularly serve orange vegetables (e.g., carrots, squash, yams) or dark green vegetables (e.g., broccoli, green peas, green beans, peppers). How to prepare vegetables You can begin by introducing cooked vegetables served in pur\u00e9e or mashed with a fork. Your baby will gradually get used to eating cooked vegetables cut into little pieces. Give your child a variety of vegetables. Pascale Turcotte552Feeding your child FoodsNitrates in vegetables In the past, parents were recommended to wait before introducing nitrate-rich vegetables like carrots, beets, turnips, and spinach to their babies' diet. It was also recommended to not use cooking water from these vegetables, especially carrots, to prepare pur\u00e9es. It's true that nitrates can cause health problems in very young babies. But if you introduce these vegetables toward the age of 6 months\u2014not before\u2014and give your baby a variety of vegetables, there is no cause for concern.Fruit Give your child a variety of fruits. You can use fresh or frozen fruit. Commercial canned fruit and compotes are also convenient. Choose brands without added sugar. How to prepare fruit You can start with soft fruit in pur\u00e9es or mashed with a fork (e.g., banana, pear). You can also cook fruit to make compote (e.g., apple, peach). Don't add sugar when preparing fruit. If the fruit is very ripe, you can cut it into pieces that your baby can eat with her fingers.Feeding your child 553 FoodsBerries like strawberries, raspberries, blueberries and blackberries can also be mashed with a fork or cut into small pieces. Later, you can serve your baby firmer fruits like melon, plums, or cherries cut into small pieces. You can also give your child grapes cut into quarters, small pieces of orange, grapefruit, or clementine, and grated or lightly cooked apples. Pascale Turcotte Give your child a variety of fruits. 554Feeding your child FoodsWhat about fruit juice? Most children like juice. But it's important to remember that fruit is more nutritious than juice because it contains fibre. In fact, fruit juice is not essential. To quench your child's thirst between feedings, water is the best choice.Good to know ... Fruit juice has a number of disadvantages: It increases the risk of early childhood tooth decay, since it naturally contains sugar. There is a risk of it replacing milk and foods essential to your child's health and development if given in too great a quantity. It can spoil your child's appetite if served within an hour of mealtime. It can cause diarrhea if it is served in too great a quantity.Fruit juice is not essential. To quench your child's thirst between feedings, water is the best choice.Feeding your child 555 FoodsIf you give your child fruit juice... Here are a few helpful tips: Wait until your child is at least 1 year old and limit the quantity of juice to a maximum of 125 to 175 ml (4 to 6 oz) per day. Never serve juice in a baby bottle. Don't let your child drink juice for prolonged periods. This will help protect her teeth. Serve juice no more than once or twice a day. Choose pasteurized, 100% pure fruit juice with no added sugar. There's no need to buy special juice for babies, since it's the same as regular juice only more expensive. Avoid fruit drinks, cocktails and punches, as well as fruit-flavoured powders\u2014they have little nutritional value and are made with sugar. Avoid unpasteurized juice. Freshly squeezed juice bought directly from the producer is not pasteurized. Certain chilled juices sold in the grocery store are not pasteurized either. They may contain harmful bacteria. Young children are very sensitive to these bacteria. Does your child like juice too much? See Beware of sugar on page 615 . Avoid giving your child unpasteurized juices. 556Feeding your child Foods Patrick H\u00e9naultFeeding your child 557 FoodsMilk and dairy products This section covers cow's milk, yogurt, and cheese. Breastmilk, commercial infant formula, and other milks are covered in the first chapters of Feeding your child . Milk, yogurt, and cheese contain protein and minerals, including calcium. They help build and maintain healthy bones and teeth. Cow's milk is also enriched with vitamin D, which helps the body use calcium more efficiently.You can give your baby yogurt and cheese once he has started eating iron-rich foods at least twice a day. Choose high-fat milk and dairy products rather than \"light\" or low fat options. Your child needs these fats to grow and develop properly. Make sure that milk and dairy products are pasteurized (see Why serve pasteurized milk , page 413) .558Feeding your child FoodsCow's milk: not before 9 months Between 9 and 12 months, once your baby is eating a varied diet including iron-rich foods, she can gradually start drinking pasteurized 3.25% cow's milk (3.25% milk fat). For more information, see Other types of milk , page 409 . Cheese Choose pasteurized cheeses. Start with cheeses that can be eaten with a spoon, like cottage cheese or ricotta. Next introduce grated or thinly sliced hard cheeses (mild and white). Since cow's milk can reduce your baby's appetite for other foods, including iron-rich foods, don't give her more than 750 ml (25 oz) per day. Sophie CharestFeeding your child 559 FoodsYogurt It's best to choose plain yogurt, to which you can add pureed fruit or pieces of fresh fruit. Commercial fruit yogurt contains added sugar or sugar substitutes. As with all dairy products, opt for high-fat yogurt. Low -fat and fat-free yogurt are not suitable for the needs of young children. If you make your own yogurt, use whole milk (3.25% milk fat). Fats Fats and oils are essential to your child's development. There is no need to limit them in his diet. For cooking and food preparation, it's best to use vegetable oils like olive or canola oil, or nonhydrogenated margarine. 560Feeding your child FoodsFood ideas for your baby Grain products Meat and alternatives Iron-enriched baby cereals Oat Soy Barley Mixed (multigrain) Rice Other grain products Barley Chapati, naan bread, pita bread, tortillas Couscous Cream of wheat Millet Oatmeal Quinoa Pasta Short grain sticky rice Toasted bread Unsalted crackers Unsweetened oat ring cereal Eggs Fish Brook trout and other trout Cod Haddock Halibut Salmon Sole Tilapia Legumes Chickpeas Edamame (soy beans) Lentils White, black, or kidney beans Meat and poultry Beef Chicken Lamb Pork Turkey Veal Tofu Smooth nut butters, plain Peanut butter Almond butter Note: Generally speaking, the foods in this table are presented in alphabetical order and not in order of introduction. tear-off version of this table after page 576 Vegetables and fruit Milk and dairy products Vegetables Asparagus Avocado Broccoli Brussels sprouts Carrots Cauliflower Corn Mushrooms Onions Peas (baby peas) Peppers Potatoes Squash Sweet potatoes Tomatoes Turnip Yellow and green beans Zucchini Fruit Apricots Apples Bananas Blackberries Blueberries Cantaloupe Cherries Clementines Grapefruit Grapes Mangos Melons Oranges Peaches Pears Plums, prunes Raspberries Strawberries Fresh cheese Cottage Ricotta Mild Pasteurized cow's milk or goat's milk (3.25% milk fat)562Feeding your child FoodsYour child now has a highly varied diet that includes almost all the same foods your family eats. He shares the three main meals of the day with you and probably needs one or two snacks as well. At this age the growth rate starts to slow down a bit. His appetite may decrease or vary from day to day. Because your child loves to explore and play, he may also be less interested in food. Although this change worries many parents, there is no need for concern as long as your child is healthy and happy, having fun, and developing normally. From 1 year onward\u2014Sharing meals with the family Cindy Eng By age 1 or so, she will be eating most of the same foods as the rest of the family.Feeding your child 563 FoodsDeveloping good habits As much as possible, accustom your child to eating the same meals as the rest of the family. You can start giving him homemade foods and dishes containing a little bit of salt (e.g., spaghetti sauce) or sugar (e.g., muffins). One good way to provide a balanced diet: at every meal, try to include foods from at least three of the four food groups shown on the preceding pages.You can take inspiration from the Food Guide Snapshot , which presents balanced meal ideas for the whole family. Go to food-guide.canada.ca/en/food-guide-snapshot/ .What matters is to adapt food quantities to your child's needs, based on his preferences and appetite. 564Feeding your child Foods Nicole AprilFeeding your child 565 FoodsGood to know ...

Limit consumption of the following: Salt All forms of sugar (sucrose, glucose, fructose, etc.) Sugar substitutes (e.g., aspartame, sucralose) Fats and oils containing harmful fats (shortening, hydrogenated oils, coconut oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, etc.)It's best to prepare homemade meals using simple, minimally processed ingredients. For example, choose plain rice instead of prepared rice containing added ingredients.Feeding your child 567 FoodsMaking family meals easier At mealtime, avoid distractions such as electronic devices and toys. Serve small portions to keep your child from getting discouraged. Don't force your child to eat everything on the plate. Wait until your child has finished the main course before serving dessert to other family members. This will help maintain interest in the meal. Serve nutritious desserts like fruit salad and stewed fruit, yogurt, homemade cookies and muffins, and milk desserts.CLSC services CSLCs may offer various nutrition and diet-related services for children under 2 years of age.

Some allergies are permanent and very serious. A child with a known allergy to a particular food must never eat that food. It's important to always take allergies seriously. Some children may not be able to tolerate certain foods, but are not necessarily allergic to them. This is known as a food intolerance. The difference between food intolerance and food allergy is that food intolerances do not trigger an immune system reaction.Is my child at risk of developing a food allergy? A child is at greater risk of developing a food allergy if A member of his immediate family (mother, father, brother, or sister) has an allergic disorder or The child suffers from severe eczema (shows signs of eczema most of the time) Talk to your doctor.572Feeding your child Food-related problemsPreventing allergies In the past, it was recommended that parents wait until their babies had reached a certain age before introducing foods more likely to cause allergies. We now know that delaying the introduction of these foods does not prevent allergies, even in children with a greater risk of developing food allergies (see A word about food allergies , page 523) . Don't hesitate to consult a doctor if you have concerns.How do I recognize allergies? An allergic reaction can be sudden and severe, or it can be delayed. Sudden and severe reactions (known as anaphylaxis) usually occur anywhere from a few minutes to two hours after eating the food in question. Such reactions are rare. See the red box ( page 573 ) for the most common symptoms.Feeding your child 573 Food-related problemsDelayed reactions can occur several days after eating the food in question. They are harder to diagnose. The most common symptoms include diarrhea, blood in the stools, and excessive irritability. Any child can experience these symptoms at times, but they last longer in children with allergies. If you suspect that your child has a food allergy, stop giving him the food in question and consult a doctor.Call 9-1-1 if your child develops red patches on the skin accompanied by any of the following: A sudden and severe change in his general condition (e.g., irritability, drowsiness, loss of consciousness) Swollen lips or tongue Difficulty breathing Sudden vomiting He could be having a severe allergic reaction.574Feeding your child Food-related problemsBreastfed babies and allergies There is no evidence linking the food breastfeeding mothers eat with the risk that their babies develop food allergies. Even if other members of the family have food allergies, you don't need to stop eating allergy -causing foods when you're breastfeeding. Babies are not allergic to breast milk, since it is perfectly adapted for their intestines. In rare cases, babies who are more sensitive can have a delayed allergic reaction to foods that mothers eat and that pass into their breast milk. Various foods can cause this, most often dairy products.If your baby shows one or more delayed allergy symptoms (see How do I recognize allergies? , page 572) , she may be intolerant or allergic to something you have eaten. The most common symptoms include excessive crying, blood in the stools, and repeated refusal to feed.Feeding your child 575 Food-related problemsWhat to do If your baby reacts to your breast milk after you eat a particular food, he will feel better as soon as you eliminate it from your diet, but will react if you eat the same food again. Try proceeding by elimination to see whether your baby is allergic: Stop eating the suspected food for 7 days. Keep an eye on your baby's behaviour. If your baby is feeling better after 7 days, try eating the food in question again. Keep an eye on your baby's behaviour. If the symptoms reappear, it means your baby is reacting to that particular food. Refrain from eating it. If you need to make changes to what you eat, consult a nutritionist to help you maintain a balanced diet. If there is no real improvement after you eliminate the food, it's best to consult a doctor.576Feeding your child Food-related problemsSevere allergies If your child has a severe allergy, you will have to be very vigilant. If you buy prepared meals, read ingredient lists carefully to be sure they don't contain the product your child is allergic to. When dining out, ask what's in the dishes you order for your child. For more information contact Allergies Qu\u00e9bec at 1-800-990-2575 / 514-990-2575 or visit allergiesquebec.ca (in French only). If your child has an epinephrine injector (e.g., EpiPen\u00ae), make sure you know when and how to use it. Explain the allergy symptoms to babysitters and post the emergency procedure to be followed in a visible location. Have your child carry a card or wear a bracelet (e.g., MedicAlert\u00ae) indicating her allergy.Feeding your child 577 Food-related problems Am\u00e9lie Bourret578Feeding your child Food-related problems Feeding your child 579 Food-related problemslactose intolerance Lactose intolerance is one form of food intolerance that we hear a lot about. Lactose is a sugar present in all milk\u2014breast milk, cow's milk and commercial infant formula. It contributes to the development of children's nervous systems and to the absorption of calcium. Lactose intolerance is rare in children under 3. There is no need to buy lactose-free products unless a doctor confirms the intolerance. Julie Desrosiers Lactose intolerance is rare in children under 3.580Feeding your child Food-related problemsAnemia Iron deficiency anemia is a fairly common problem among babies between the ages of 6 and 24 months. It must be treated as it can harm your baby's health and development. To prevent anemia, make sure your child's diet includes iron-rich foods at each meal. Iron supplements are not necessary, except in the case of premature babies. Symptoms of iron deficiency in children include lack of energy, poor appetite, irritability, difficulty concentrating, slow weight gain and recurrent infections. However, these symptoms can also indicate other health problems. When in doubt, consult a doctor.Warning about cow's milk Babies who are fed cow's milk before the age of 9 months can become anemic because Cow's milk can cause blood loss in the delicate intestines of infants. Cow's milk reduces absorption of iron from other foods. Cow's milk in your baby's diet reduces intake of other foods rich in iron. Once your baby is over 9 months and is eating a variety of foods, she can drink cow's milk without the risk of developing anemia. However, she should not drink more than 750 ml (25 oz) of cow's milk per day.Feeding your child 581 Food-related problemsPreventing anemia Your baby's daily diet should contain foods rich in iron. The following foods are the best sources of iron: Iron-enriched baby cereal Meat and poultry Fish Tofu Legumes EggsVitamin C helps the body absorb iron from foods. It's a good idea to serve foods that are rich in vitamin C at every meal. The following fruits and vegetables are good sources of vitamin C: Citrus fruits (orange, grapefruit, clementine, tangerine, mandarin orange) Strawberries, cantaloupe, melon, mango, kiwi, pineapple Cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, pepper (green, red or yellow)582Feeding your child Food-related problemsIf your child refuses to eat baby cereal, try different kinds or add fruit. If she accepts different textures, you can also try giving her cereal O's for children. You can also add baby cereal to recipes for pancakes, muffins, cookies and other baked goods by replacing half of the flour with iron-enriched dry cereal, like in the recipe below.Baby-cereal cookies (for ages 1 and over) 125 ml ( 1/2 cup) butter, margarine or oil 125 ml ( 1/2 cup) sugar or fruit pur\u00e9e (e.g., apple, date, banana) 10 ml (2 tsp.) vanilla 1 egg, beaten 150 ml ( 2/3 cup) white or whole wheat flour 150 ml ( 2/3 cup) iron-enriched baby cereal 5 ml (1 tsp.) baking powder 1 pinch of salt 30 ml (2 tbsp.) cocoa powder (optional) Preheat oven to 190\u00b0C (375\u00b0F). Grease two cookie sheets. Cream butter with sugar or fruit pur\u00e9e. Gradually add vanilla and beaten egg. In another bowl, mix remaining ingredients. Carefully add the dry ingredients to the liquid ingredients. Shape into 24 balls and place on cookie sheets. Flatten with a fork. Bake for 10 minutes.Feeding your child 583 Food-related problemsPoor appetite Children, like adults, may have periods when they experience reduced appetite. Sometimes the reason is discomfort caused by sore throat, teething or the effect of medication. Other times, poor appetite in children can be due to overexcitement, fascination with new discoveries, fatigue or a normal slowing of growth. Serious food-related problems are rare. So long as your child is growing normally, he is eating enough to satisfy his needs. It is more important to make family mealtime fun than to insist that your child eat a specific amount of food.What to do Take the time to observe what's going on in your child's life. The older he gets, the more he wants to do things by himself. Learn to accept his pace, his clumsiness and a bit of wasted food without scolding him. Give your child small servings of age-appropriate healthy foods. Let him choose how much he wants to eat and in what order. Milk can be served at the end of the meal. If your child hasn't eaten anything after a certain time, simply remove his plate without scolding him or making a big deal of it, then let him leave the table. Offer snacks between meals, but keep serving sizes small so you don't spoil your child's appetite for the next meal. Serve fruit, vegetables, cheese and water. Avoid giving too much juice or milk between meals. Normally, your baby shouldn't need vitamin or mineral supplements. When in doubt, ask your doctor or a nutritionist whether your child's nutritional requirements are being met.584Feeding your child Food-related problemschubby babies There is no evidence to suggest that chubby babies become obese adults. In most cases, baby fat will disappear as your baby grows. Don't worry if people comment on your baby's plumpness. And don't worry either if your breastfed baby seems chubby during the first few months. It won't last! In fact, breastfeeding actually reduces the risk of obesity in children. Continue breastfeeding as long as you like. Take the time to observe your baby. Learn to recognize her needs (often emotional) and fulfill them with other means than food. Try not to reward or punish your baby with food.Feeding your child 585 Food-related problems Fran\u00e7ois Laplante586Feeding your child Food-related problemsStools and foods Babies who eat a variety of foods will pass stools that vary in colour and consistency, depending on what they have eaten. New foods such as fruits or vegetables may result in soft stools for a few days if the food is not completely digested, and they may be a different colour than usual. For example, a baby who eats green vegetables may pass green stools. Don't worry if your baby's diaper contains bits of vegetable or fruit. This is common and normal. constipation If your baby has infrequent bowel movements during her first few weeks of life, she may not be drinking enough milk. After the age of 6 weeks, babies don't absolutely have to have a bowel movement every 24 hours. Your baby may sometimes go several days without a bowel movement. If this is the case and her stools are soft, everything is normal and there is no cause for concern.Feeding your child 587 Food-related problemsDoes your baby strain and turn red during bowel movements? If her stools appear normal, there's no need to worry, either. However, if she is in pain and her stools are small, hard and dry, she is probably constipated. Hard stools can cause anal fissures (small tears), which can further complicate the problem. Good to know ... Iron contained in commercial infant formula does not cause constipation. Introducing food or juice before the age of 6 months or so does not prevent constipation.Babies under 6 months who are exclusively milk-fed (breast milk or commercial infant formula) What to do If your baby appears to be suffering, try the following helpful tips: Make sure your baby is drinking enough breast milk or commercial infant formula (see Is your baby drinking enough milk? , page 370) . If your baby is being fed with commercial infant formula, make sure you are diluting the formula with the proper amount of water, as recommended on the label. Whether you are breastfeeding or using commercial infant formula, giving your baby water before the age of about 6 months is not recommended (see When to give your baby water , page 511) . See a doctor if you don't think your baby is getting any relief. 588Feeding your child Food-related problemsBabies 6 months and older who are eating food No single food causes constipation.

And, remember, there are health professionals there to help you. Holding your newborn Until your baby is about 3 months old, his neck muscles are not strong enough for him to hold up his head by himself. It's important to always support his head and back when you pick him up. That way you prevent his head from wobbling and causing injury. You may choose to swaddle your newborn in a blanket when you hold him, because some babies like to feel bundled up. However, make sure that he's not too hot. Nowadays, people agree that you won't \"spoil\" a child by giving him the comfort and love he needs. On the contrary! Carrying and hugging your baby stimulates him and helps him develop. So hold your baby in your arms as often as possible, when he cries or is not feeling well, or just to give him a cuddle. 594Health A healthy babyBabies like to be carried and rocked. It probably reminds them of the movements they felt in the womb. Carrying your baby in a baby carrier or rocking him in your arms is a wonderful way to spend some quality time with him. These intimate moments help your baby develop a feeling of confidence, which is so essential for his emotional well-being.

It drops off by itself between the 5th and 21st day. Here are a few tips for cleaning the umbilical cord and keeping it dry: Clean around the umbilical cord every day until the belly button heals. Gently clean the area with a cotton swab (Q-Tips\u00ae) soaked in warm water. Don't use alcohol because it delays the cord dropping off. Dry with another cotton swab. Rub the cotton swab around the umbilical cord (in the folds). You won't hurt your baby, and that way you make sure that the cord is properly dried. Avoid covering the cord with the diaper or a compress. It must always stay dry. Fold the diaper under the belly button to prevent irritation. Remember to dry around the cord after bathing your baby. The cord may remain half attached for 2 to 3 days. Don't try to pull it off. It can also leave traces of blood on your baby's diaper or clothes. Once the cord has fallen off, a few drops of blood may flow from the scar. This isn't dangerous; the belly button will heal on its own. If redness appears and becomes more intense, if the belly button oozes fluid and smells bad, or if you have doubts, talk to your health professional.With a cotton swab, clean around the umbilical cord every day until the belly button is healed. Don't worry, this doesn't hurt your baby.Joanne Aub\u00e9-Maurice598Health A healthy babyBathing your baby Most children love bath time. It's a special moment with mommy or daddy. It's also enjoyable and relaxing. These private moments will help you get to know your baby. With time you'll become more and more sure of yourself. The ideal moment You can bathe your baby at any time of day. There's no ideal time. It's really a matter of when your baby appears willing. Bath time will be less pleasant if your baby is hungry or tired. You'll get to know when the ideal moment is for your baby. Frequency You can clean your baby's face, neck, genitals, and bottom with a washcloth every day. In the first few weeks, there's no need to bathe your baby in the tub more than two to three times a week. Older babies don't need to bathe every day either. Let your baby's individual needs be your guide. Getting ready Being prepared for bath time is essential for making sure your baby's safe and comfortable. Before undressing her, gather together all the necessary items. That way, everything will be within reach so you don't have to leave your baby's side during her bath. Health 599 A healthy babyHere are a few items you might need: Washcloth and towel Mild, unscented soap and baby shampoo Clean clothes One or two diapers One or two cotton swabs for cleaning her belly button Small nail scissors or a nail clipper and nail file Zinc oxide ointment for her bottom Unscented moisturizing cream or lotion (for places where her skin is dry) Brush or comb Adjust the room temperature if you can, ideally to 22 to 24\u00b0C. Soap: mild and unscented Children, especially newborns, have sensitive skin. Soap removes the natural protection of your baby's skin and can irritate it. So it's best to use mild, unscented soaps. Avoid antibacterial soaps because they contain alcohol and aren't necessary. Use a small amount of soap and apply it only to your baby's hands, bottom, and genitals. The rest of her body doesn't need soap. Scented products such as bubble bath and bath oils are unnecessary and can cause irritation. 600Health A healthy babyBathing in the bathtub You can wash your baby in an ordinary bathtub, a baby bath, or the bathroom or kitchen sink if it's clean. You may also choose to take her in the bath with you. If so, put a nonskid bath mat in the bottom of the bath tub to reduce the risk of slipping. Health Canada advises against using bath seats to ensure the safety of babies in a bath tub. They give adults a false sense of security, which can lead to drowning. Illustration Si\u00e8ges de bain pour b\u00e9b\u00e9 : Sant\u00e9 CanadaA few centimetres of water in the tub are enough to wash your baby. For older children, the water level in the tub should not be higher than their belly button when they're seated. Run the hot and cold water at the same time. The water should be warm, i.e., at your body temperature (34 to 37\u00b0C). To avoid burning your baby, always check the water temperature with your elbow or wrist. Undress your baby only when everything's ready so she doesn't get cold. Put her slowly in the water, starting with her feet. Then gently immerse the rest of her body. Hold her head, supporting her neck with your forearm and sliding your hand under her armpit. Health 601 A healthy babyBaby bathing technique Whether you wash your baby with a washcloth or in a tub, here are a few practical tips. Clean her face first with a wet washcloth (without soap): - Clean her eyes starting from the inside corner (near the nose) toward the outside corner. Use a different corner of the washcloth for each eye. - With another corner of the moistened washcloth, gently clean outside and behind her ears. Avoid going too far inside the ear. Don't use cotton swabs (Q-Tips\u00ae), because they can injure the eardrum and push earwax even farther into the ear. Then carefully wash all the folds of the body: - Don't forget the folds of the neck, armpits, thighs, and bottom. Rinse well.

Wipe from front to back. That way you avoid traces of fecal matter from coming in contact with the entrance to the vagina and urethra. Rinse well. - For baby boys , wash the penis and scrotum. Rinse well. The foreskin is not detached from the tip of the penis at birth. Avoid doing anything that will detach it. It's not necessary to dilate it to clean it. Dry your baby well without rubbing. Dry all the folds well to prevent redness and dampness. It's not a good idea to use powder because it can cause breathing problems. Babies are covered in vernix caseosa at birth, a white paste that protected their skin in the amniotic fluid. This paste is reabsorbed within a few days so you don't need to rub it off. Hair You don't need to wash your baby's hair every day. Once or twice a week is enough. Avoid rubbing, and pass gently over the fontanelle (soft spot). Then rinse well with clean water and gently pat it dry. Never leave your baby alone, for whatever reason, even for just a second. A baby can drown in as little as 2.5 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in.) of water. If the telephone or doorbell rings, take your baby with you. You can also simply choose not to answer.Health 603 A healthy babycutting your baby's nails During the first week of life, your baby's nails are stuck to the skin. Don't try to cut them because you could hurt him. The tips of the nails will come away from the skin after a few days. When his fingernails are long enough for him to scratch himself, they will need to be trimmed or gently filed. You can trim or file your baby's nails after his bath, when they're softened by the water, or when he's sleeping. Try to cut his toenails straight across with small scissors or a nail clipper. This will prevent the nails from piercing the skin (becoming what are known as ingrown toenails). However, it's better to trim fingernails around the curve of the finger to prevent scratches. Nails grow quickly, so you will need to trim or file them regularly. choosing diapers Diapers will be part of your baby's wardrobe for about two and half years. Disposable or washable diapers? It's a matter of choice. Opt for the diapers that correspond best to your values, needs, and situation, and to your baby's skin. Washable diapers can be less costly than disposable diapers in the long term, but your initial investment will be higher. 604Health A healthy babyDisposable diapers Disposable diapers contain crystals that convert the urine into a safe gel and separate it from the stools. This eliminates the mix of urine and fecal matter that can irritate your baby's skin. Some scented disposable diapers can also irritate the skin. If this happens, try another brand. Disposable diapers should be changed regularly because they can seem dry even if they're not. The accumulated urine, when in contact with your baby's skin, can cause irritation. Washable diapers There is a wide choice of washable diapers available that are easy to use and clean and that fit your baby's bottom well. Washable cloth diapers are less absorbent than disposable diapers so they have to be changed more often. Some brands of washable diapers offer a more absorbent, nighttime diaper or a second, absorbent layer you can insert in the diaper. To keep the diapers in good condition, it's important to follow the manufacturer's directions carefully. For example, some suggest you soak them before washing, while others don't. Health 605 A healthy baby Delphine Descamps606Health A healthy babyChanging diapers Whether you use disposable or washable diapers, it's important to change your baby regularly, and as soon as possible after she poops. Changing her diaper often helps prevent irritation. To change a diaper Wash your baby's genitals and bottom with water and soap every time you change her diaper, whether she's a newborn or older (see Genitals , page 276) - If you don't have water and soap handy, use baby wipes (moist disposable towelettes). It's best to use them only on healthy skin. Opt for unscented types to avoid irritating her skin. France Lalibert\u00e9 Most newborns need frequent diaper changes.

If her skin is irritated, you can apply a layer of zinc oxide ointment (see Redness on the bottom (diaper rash) , page 630) . Make sure she doesn't fall! Never leave your baby alone on a changing table. Always keep one hand on her when you have to reach for something. You can also change her on a towel or change pad on the floor.608Health A healthy babyMedical checkups Regular visits to a doctor or nurse allow you to discuss your child's health and development. They are also occasion to ask questions about her growth, feeding, vaccination, or any other subject that you're wondering about. You can ask your parents and friends, or the health professionals you're already seeing, to help you find a family doctor or other health professional you need to consult for your baby. consulting health professionals If your child is well but you would like to see a health professional, you should contact your CLSC. Your CLSC is the gateway to a number of services including vaccination, breastfeeding clinics, and referrals to other resources. It can also provide information on available services and explanations on how to access services elsewhere, if necessary. When your child is ill, it can be hard to know where to turn. Here's a tip: start by calling Info-Sant\u00e9 8-1-1 . This service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You can talk to a nurse, who will evaluate the situation with you.

Baby's growth Your baby is unique! He will grow in spurts, at his own pace. All children of the same age don't necessarily have their growth spurts at the same time. A variety of factors, such as gender, method of feeding, and genetic makeup, can influence the speed at which a child grows.

For health advice from a nurse 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, call Info-Sant\u00e9.610Health A healthy babyOne of the best ways to make sure your baby is growing properly is to measure his weight and height at regular intervals, for example at his regular checkups. The health professional will record your baby's measurements on a growth chart and compare his development to that of other children. But more than anything, the measurements allow you to check that your baby's development is proceeding at a pace that is normal for him. Your baby may be much bigger or smaller than other children of his age. Provided he continues to grow at his own pace, there's no need to worry. Claude Fortin Your child is unique!

At birth, she has 20 baby teeth, or primary teeth, that are still growing under the gums. Good to know ... The formation of baby teeth and permanent teeth is influenced by diet in early childhood and by the mother's diet during pregnancy. Teething Teeth grow gradually until they break through the gums, a process known as teething.First teeth Baby teeth generally appear at around 6 months. But they can come in earlier or later, even as late as 12 months. The lower front teeth (incisors) usually break through first.Upper jaw Tooth eruption Central incisor 6-12 months Lateral incisor 8-13 months Canine 16-2 2 months First molar 11-1 9 months Second molar 20-3 3 months Lower jaw Tooth eruption Second molar 20-3 1 months First molar 11-1 9 months Canine 16-23 months Lateral incisor 7-16 months incisor 5-10 months Illustration: Bertrand Lachance612Health A healthy babyTeething may go unnoticed or may cause discomfort. When your baby is teething, she may drool more and feel the need to chew on something. Your baby may also have red or irritated skin on the face and may fret more than usual or refuse to eat. In some babies a blue swelling (also known as an eruption cyst) appears on the gum up to two months before the tooth breaks through. This cyst usually needs no treatment. Don't immediately assume that your baby's fever, diarrhea, and red bottom are related to teething. Even if these symptoms occur at the same time, they are often caused by something else. For more information, see Fever , page 642 , Diarrhea and vomiting (stomach flu or \"gastro\") , page 663 , and Redness on the bottom (diaper rash) , page 630 .What to do during teething If necessary, give your baby a clean washcloth soaked in cold water or a teething ring. You can cool the teething ring in the refrigerator, but don't freeze it: your baby could injure her mouth. You can also rub her gums with a clean finger. Give her acetaminophen, if needed.If your child is in serious discomfort, contact a health professional. You can also call Info-Sant\u00e9 at any time by dialing 8-1-1 .Health 613 A healthy babyProducts to avoid Various products are available to relieve the discomfort of teething. However, they have not been shown to be effective and can be dangerous: Teething necklaces: Babies can choke on the wooden beads or other parts of a teething necklace, or can strangle themselves with it. Teething syrups and gels: These products contain an ingredient that can increase the risk of developing a serious blood condition. They also increase the risk of choking. Teething biscuits: These products do not relieve your baby's discomfort. What's more, they contain sugar and can therefore cause tooth decay (see Tooth decay , page 616) . Certain pieces of raw fruit or vegetables can also be a choking hazard if given to baby to chew on (see Choking risk: Be extra careful until age 4 , page 530) .Brushing The purpose of brushing is to clean your baby's teeth as well as possible using a fluoride toothpaste. As soon as the first teeth start to appear, brush them at least twice a day. Brushing before bed is the most important time to brush. There is less saliva in your baby's mouth when she's sleeping, which means tooth decay can develop and progress more easily. If your child wants to brush her teeth herself, encourage her, and then do a final brushing. Since children love to imitate, you can also brush your teeth at the same time.Using a fluoride toothpaste helps prevent cavities. Teething necklaces, syrups, and gels pose serious risks to your baby's health.614Health A healthy babyToothbrush Use a children's toothbrush with soft bristles. Change it as soon as the bristles start to bend. Rinse the toothbrush after every use. Let it air dry upright. Do not put a cap on it. To prevent the spread of germs, make sure it doesn't touch other toothbrushes. Make sure your child has her own toothbrush and doesn't share it with anyone. Toothpaste As soon as you start brushing your child's teeth, you can use the toothpaste of your choice as long as it Contains fluoride, an effective protection against cavities Is recommended for children under 6Anne-Marie Turgeon Anne-Marie Turgeon As soon as the first teeth appear, brush them at least twice a day. Brushing before bed is the most important time to brush.Health 615 A healthy babySince children tend to swallow toothpaste, use only a very small amount, about the size of a grain of rice. To prevent children from ingesting too much toothpaste, store it out of their reach. Beware of sugar The more your child's teeth are in contact with sugar, the more your child risks developing cavities. Watch out\u2014sugar is often added to drinks, food, and drugs for children. Sugars also naturally occur in fruits, juices and milk (e.g., breast milk, commercial infant formula and cow's milk). Baby bottle Prolonged contact between your child's teeth and her bottle containing milk or sweet liquids can cause tooth decay. Don't let your baby drink from or suck on her bottle for long periods of time. Don't let her sleep with or carry around a bottle or sippy cup containing juice or any other liquid except water.If your baby has gotten into one of these habits, gradually dilute the contents of the bottle or cup with water until it contains nothing else. To reduce the risk of tooth decay, it's best to wean her off the bottle when she's about a year old. Pacifier Don't dip your baby's pacifier in honey, corn syrup, or any other sweet product. \u00a9 Gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec, 2019 Use only a small amount of fluoride toothpaste: the size of a grain of rice is enough.616Health A healthy babyTooth decay Tooth decay (also known as cavities or dental caries) can occur when your child is small, even before age 2. Once it appears, it can quickly get worse. The decay is caused by bacteria producing acid that attacks the structure of the tooth. It can cause pain and may interfere with your child's sleep or feeding. If you see dull white, yellowish, or brownish stains on your child's teeth, it is advisable to see a dentist or dental hygienist. It could be the start of tooth decay. It's important for the health of young children to have tooth decay treated, even though they will eventually lose their baby teeth. Visits to the dentist It's a good idea to schedule a first visit to the dentist for your child after her first birthday. R\u00e9gie de l'assurance maladie du Qu\u00e9bec covers the cost of dental exams and some treatments for children under 10.Vaccination When a person gets sick from a germ, their body reacts by naturally producing antibodies to get rid of the germ. It is the immune system . It fights against the thousands of germs present on objects and in food, water, and air. Vaccines stimulate the immune system. They help your child make his own antibodies against certain diseases without him suffering the ill effects of the diseases themselves. Vaccination is one of the most effective ways of protecting your children's health. It prevents a number of serious illnesses. All children should receive the recommended vaccines, even healthy children with a good diet. Breastfed children also need to be vaccinated, even though breast milk protects them against some infections. Health 617 A healthy babyVaccines are not only effective, they are very safe. If you have any questions or concerns about vaccination, feel free to talk to a health professional or visit the following website: quebec.ca/en/health/advice-and-prevention/vaccination/ . Where and when should you get your child vaccinated? You can get your child vaccinated for free at any CLSC. Some doctor's offices also offer vaccinations. It is recommended that your child get his first vaccinations at the age of 2 months, in order to follow the regular schedule. Premature babies should also receive their first vaccine at the age of 2 months (2 months after birth). Jean-Marc H\u00e9bert By having your child vaccinated, you are providing him with the best possible protection against a number of serious diseases. 618Health A healthy babyVaccination schedule Since it's important to follow the vaccination schedule, it is advised to make an appointment as early as possible to avoid delays. The chart on the next page shows the regular vaccination schedule for children up to two years of age. For more information, visit the \"Recommended immunization schedule\" section of the following website: quebec.ca/en/health/advice-and-prevention/vaccination/ . You can also consult the \"Reducing the Pain and Anxiety of Vaccination in Children\" section of the same website for some tips and tricks. Your child may be given several vaccines for different diseases during the same visit. Administering multiple vaccines in a single visit is recommended because it will protect your child more quickly against infections. This method will not increase the frequency or severity of undesirable side effects to vaccines. It will also reduce the number of visits you need to make to the clinic or CLSC.Your child will require several doses of certain vaccines in order to produce enough antibodies to fight the disease. By having your child vaccinated at the recommended age in the vaccination schedule, you are providing him with the best possible protection. It is recommended that all children, including premature babies, start being vaccinated at the age of 2 months. This ensures them the best protection when they need it most and prevents them from falling behind in their vaccination schedule.Health 619 A healthy babyRegular vaccination schedule for children 2 and under Child's age Suggested vaccine 2 months DTaP-HB-IPV-Hib vaccine Pneumococcus vaccineRotavirus HAHB vaccineMeningococcal C vaccineMMR-Var vaccine * It is recommended that your child receive these three vaccines on his first birthday or as soon as possible after this day.Protection offered by vaccines Vaccine Protection against DTaP-HB-IPV-Hib vaccineor DTaP-IPV-Hib vaccineor DTaP-IPV vaccine Diphtheria (D or d) Tetanus (T) Whooping cough (aP or ap) Poliomyelitis (IPV) Serious H\u00e6mophilus influenz\u00e6 type b (Hib) infections Pneumococcus (R) HAHB vaccine Hepatitis A (HA) Hepatitis B (HB) Meningococcal C vaccine Serious meningococcal C infections (meningitis, meningococcemia)620Health A healthy babyPossible reactions to vaccines Vaccines are very safe. Most of the time they cause no undesirable reactions. Sometimes they can cause short -lived reactions that are not serious, such as a mild fever, redness, or discomfort at the site of the injection. To reduce redness and discomfort, apply a cold water compress. A small bump may appear, but it's not dangerous and will disappear within a few weeks. Today's vaccines are very well tolerated. It is not suggested that the child be given acetaminophen or ibuprofen before the injection. If your child seems to feel unwell or has a fever after receiving a vaccine, acetaminophen may make him feel better. Ibuprofen can also be used if he is over 6 months (see Fever medication, page 649) . If your child cries abnormally or if you're worried about him, follow the advice you were given at the time of vaccination. If necessary, talk to a health professional or call Info -Sant\u00e9 ( 8-1-1 ). In (measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox), children can come down with a fever 5 to 12 days after the vaccination. Serious allergic reactions to vaccines are very rare. If such a reaction occurs, it will start within minutes after the vaccination. That's why you are advised to stay at the vaccination clinic for at least 15 minutes after your child has received the vaccine. If there's a reaction, the health professional who vaccinates him will be able to treat it immediately.Health 621 A healthy babyContraindications There are few cases in which a child cannot be vaccinated. A cold, an ear infection, a runny nose, or the fact that he's taking antibiotics are not reasons to put off a vaccination. If your child is ill to the point he is feverish or irritable, or crying abnormally, take him to his appointment anyway and discuss it with the health professional. Vaccination record This important document is a record of your child's vaccinations. You must bring it with you to the vaccination appointment. The health professional who vaccinates him will record the dose and date in it. It's also worth bringing it along to your child's medical checkups. It may be used to record the child's growth (weight and height), as well as other information related to vaccination and your child's health. Keep it safe, because it will be useful to your child all his life. Bring the vaccination record to each checkup, whether it's for a vaccination or not.

Most of them will have occasional minor health problems, but very few infants develop serious illnesses. However despite all your care, your baby will sometimes become ill. You will want to find a way to make her feel better. This chapter discusses common health problems among children age 2 years and under. So it provides very little information on rarer illnesses or those that affect only a handful of babies. It does however give you Tips on preventing some common problems Assistance recognizing signs that help you decide if and when to call a health professional Advice on how to care for your baby Although this chapter describes the main signs and symptoms of certain illnesses, it is not intended to be used by parents to diagnose their baby's health problems themselves.

Don't hesitate to consult one.624Health Common health problemsA well-stocked medicine cabinet There are a few items that can be handy when it comes to caring for your child. Consider stocking your medicine cabinet with the following: Digital thermometer Acetaminophen (e.g., Tempra\u00ae, Tylenol\u00ae, or any generic brand for pediatric use) Oral rehydration solution (ORS) Zinc oxide ointment Antibiotic ointment Vaseline A sweet oil (e.g., olive oil) Saline solution for the nose Adhesive bandages and dressing Unscented moisturizing cream Before adding an item to your medicine cabinet, such as an over-the-counter medication (available without a medical prescription) or a natural health product, you can ask your pharmacist if the product is safe for your baby. The products in this list, like any medication or natural health product, should be stored safely, i.e., out of the reach of children. newborn jaundice Jaundice, also known as icterus, is common in newborns. It causes the whites of the eyes and the skin to turn yellow. This is due to an accumulation of an orange pigment called bilirubin in the blood. Health 625 Common health problemsIn full-term babies, jaundice generally starts 2 to 3 days after birth, peaks at 3 to 5 days, and is gone by the end of the first week. In premature babies, it can last several weeks. Bilirubin is partially eliminated in the baby's stools. This means jaundice is worse in babies who don't drink enough and whose intestines are not very active. Some breastfed babies develop a type of jaundice that lasts up to 2 months. If your baby is growing well, gaining weight, and pees and poops normally (see Stools , page 279) , this form of jaundice is not serious and requires no treatment. Breastfeeding can continue normally. The best way to prevent jaundice is to make sure your newborn drinks enough milk (see Is your baby drinking enough milk? , page 370) . What to do No treatment is necessary for most cases of jaundice. There is no benefit to exposing your baby to daylight in front of a window. It isn't easy to tell how yellow a newborn is. Check her skin and the whites of her eyes. If your baby looks yellow, is drowsy, or isn't feeding well, consult your doctor, a CLSC nurse, or the hospital or birthing centre where you gave birth. They will measure your baby's jaundice with a blood test or a device that evaluates skin colour. In some cases, treatment will be necessary. If your baby looks yellow, is drowsy, or isn't feeding well, consult a doctor, a nurse at your CLSC, or the hospital or birthing centre where you gave birth.626Health Common health problemsThrush in the mouth Thrush is an oral yeast infection caused by the fungus Candida albicans . It is usually not painful and often disappears by itself. White patches appear in your baby's mouth, especially inside the lips and cheeks. These patches do not disappear when rubbed.What to do You can see a doctor. He or she will decide whether it is necessary to prescribe oral drops for your baby. To prevent thrush from coming back, sterilize objects that come into contact with your baby's mouth (bottle nipples, pacifiers, rattles) in boiling water (see Cleaning bottles, nipples and breast pumps , page 507) and replace them regularly. Candida albicans is easily passed from your baby's mouth to your breasts during breastfeeding. If you feel symptoms in your breasts (see Nipple thrush , page 488 and Thrush in the breast , page 491) , see a health professional. Health 627 Common health problemsPimples, redness, and other skin problems Small pimples, redness, and other types of skin rashes are common in babies. They are seldom serious and usually disappear on their own. However, some skin problems can be a sign of more serious problems, in which case you should see a health professional. Contact Info-Sant\u00e9 or your doctor if Red, raised, very itchy patches appear suddenly on your baby's body The rash bleeds or seems infected. It becomes very red, cracks, runs or becomes covered with a thin, yellowish crust The rash doesn't disappear after a few days and your baby seems unwell and has a fever (see Fever and skin rashes (contagious diseases) , page 652) You have any other concerns Common skin problems in newborns Pimples and spots (milia, toxic erythema, newborn acne) often appear in the first days of life. In most cases these problems are not serious and disappear within a few weeks without treatment. 628Health Common health problemsDry skin and eczema Your baby's skin is very fragile and sensitive. It can become very dry. Newborns' skin can peel and crack around the joints. This problem usually goes away within a few weeks. What to do Bathe your baby less often. Use only a small amount of mild, unscented soap. Soap and hot water tend to dry the skin. If you wish, moisturize the dry areas with an unscented lotion or cream. If your baby has a rash or redness as well as dry skin, he could have eczema, in which case you may have to see a health professional. Heat rash (prickly heat) Heat rash is characterized by small, round, sometimes raised red spots on the forehead, around the neck, and in the folds of the skin. This is a normal reaction when it's hot out or when your baby has a fever. What to do If it's hot out, don't overdress your baby so she doesn't sweat too much. The heat rash will disappear once your baby is in a cooler environment. Crusty patches on the scalp (cradle cap, seborrhea) Many babies have yellowish or greyish crusty patches on the scalp. They can be in the form of scales or small patches that peel and can sometimes cause itchiness. These crusty patches occur when a surplus of oily secretions (seborrhea) is produced or the baby's hair is frequently washed without being rinsed properly. This is a very common problem and is not a sign of infection, allergy, or lack of hygiene. Health 629 Common health problemsWhat to do A simple hair wash can get rid of the crusty patches. Apply the shampoo, massage it in, and leave it for 10 to 15 minutes to soften the crust. Rinse well with warm water. If crusty patches remain, apply a vegetable oil (e.g., olive oil) or mineral oil to your baby's scalp. After a few hours, gently peel off the crusts with a soft brush or fine comb. Then wash again with warm water, rinse, and dry. If necessary, repeat the treatment once a day for a few days. If this treatment doesn't work or if the crusty patches spread, you can use a medicated shampoo sold in drugstores. If necessary, talk to your pharmacist or another health professional. Redness in the folds of the skin (intertrigo) The skin becomes irritated when two skin surfaces rub against each other. This can occur under the chin, on the neck, under the arms, on the thighs, under the scrotum, or behind the ears. Redness appears in areas that are damp from perspiration, stool, or milk, which encourages germs to develop. What to do Clean the affected areas with a mild soap and dry them well by gently patting the skin with a towel. If the redness persists, see a health professional. 630Health Common health problemsRedness on the bottom (diaper rash) Your baby's bottom becomes red. The redness can spread to the thighs, vulva, or scrotum. Your baby appears uncomfortable and irritable, especially when he or she pees. These symptoms of diaper rash are very common. They are mainly caused by the skin coming in contact with urine or stools and sometimes the diapers themselves. Washable diapers can irritate the skin if they are not rinsed well enough or are not changed often enough. Some brands of scented disposable diapers can also irritate your baby's skin. What to do Leave your baby with a bare bottom as much as possible. Your baby will feel better and the diaper rash will heal faster. If you use cotton diapers, rinse them well and avoid using strong laundry detergent. If you use disposable diapers, choose the unscented type. Avoid using baby wipes because they can also irritate your baby's skin. They should be used only occasionally and should not contain alcohol or perfume. Health 631 Common health problemsChange your baby's diaper as soon as it's wet or soiled. Make sure the diaper is not too tight. Wash your baby's bottom gently with water or a mixture of water and unscented oil, then pat dry with a towel, without rubbing. If redness is minimal and not widespread, apply a generous layer of a protective ointment containing 10% to 20% zinc oxide. The ointment protects the skin and doesn't have to be wiped off completely at each diaper change.If redness is more severe and widespread, use a protective ointment containing 20% to 40% zinc oxide. In this case, it's best to avoid ointments that contain allergenic ingredients like lanolin or irritating ingredients such as fragrance. If necessary, ask your pharmacist which product may be best for your baby. If the redness persists for a few days and your baby seems unwell, see a health professional. 632Health Common health problemsEye problems Children under two can sometimes have eye problems. Most commonly, their eyes can be red, sticky, or watery, or they can be cross eyed. Red, sticky, or watery eyes A red, sticky, or watery eye can often be explained by an infection. Other causes are also possible: Blocked tear duct - If your baby has a watery and crusty eye when he wakes up, but there's no pain, redness, or swelling of the eyelid, it could be that the eye's tear duct is not fully open. Your baby's tears, which normally flow into the nose, accumulate when the duct is blocked, causing the eye to water. You can gently wash the eye with a clean washcloth soaked in warm water. Openings Tear gland Tear duct Tears are secreted by the tear gland. Tears spread across the surface of the eye. They then flow through small openings, from the eye to the nasal cavity. When the tear duct is blocked, tears build up and the eye gets watery. Illustration: Bertrand LachanceHealth 633 Common health problemsIf the tear duct is not already open at birth, it usually opens by itself during the first year of life. Massaging can help the tear duct open more quickly. To learn how to perform this massage or if the problem persists after one year of age, talk to the nurse or doctor at your next visit. Foreign object in the eye - If one of your baby's eyes becomes red all of a sudden, tears up a lot, or if your baby refuses to open his eye or is uncomfortable, he may have a foreign object in his eye. To find out what to do, read the section on Foreign object or chemical product in an eye, page 716 . Allergies - If your baby's eyes are itchy, irritated, or watery, and the redness is mild to moderate, an allergy may be the cause. What if it really is an infection? Check for the following signs of infection: Red eye Swollen, sticky eyelids Yellowish secretion (pus) Trouble opening the eyes and looking at a light Eye infections can be caused by a bacteria or a virus. They can sometimes occur after a cold, flu, or sore throat caused by a virus. 634Health Common health problemsWhat to do If your baby has one or more of the signs of eye infection just mentioned Wash your hands often to avoid spreading the germs Gently wash the eye with a clean washcloth soaked in warm water See a doctor or optometrist, who will prescribe treatment if necessary Don't use an anti-infective medication prescribed for someone else. Vision problems and crossed eyes (strabismus) Very few young children complain of vision problems because they tend to think their vision is normal. To prevent vision problems from becoming permanent and having long-term consequences, they should be corrected as soon as possible. Your newborn's eyes may occasionally be crossed. Don't worry, this happens to many babies. This phenomenon, called strabismus, often disappears by the time the baby is 2 months old when he develops the ability to focus and move both eyes in the same direction. Health 635 Common health problemsYou can be attentive to early signs that may indicate that your baby has a vision problem. See a doctor or optometrist if your baby Is constantly cross eyed from birth Appears to be cross eyed after the age of two months Has a white reflection (not red) in the pupil Doesn't follow moving objects with his eyes Blinks frequently Is very sensitive to light and has very watery eyes Cries when one of his eyes is covered Knocks into things and has trouble orienting himselfAllergies An allergy is an excessive sensitivity to normally harmless substances. These substances are called \"allergens.\" Allergens can come from a number of sources: Food (see Food allergies , page 571) Tree and grass pollen Animal fur and secretions Dust Molds and dust mites Insect stings (e.g., wasps or bees) Medications (e.g., penicillin)636Health Common health problemsAny number of the following signs in your child can indicate an allergy, depending on the area affected: Skin: redness, swelling, itchiness Respiratory system: sneezing, runny nose, cough, shortness of breath Digestive system: vomiting, diarrhea, mucus or blood in the stool, stomach pain Eyes: redness, itching, wateringWhat to do Allergies are not common in young children so they are hard to diagnose. If you suspect that your child has an allergy, you can consult your doctor. Sudden and severe reactions can occur after your child eats food, takes medication, or is stung by an insect. See the red box for the most common symptoms. Call 9-1-1 if your child develops red patches on the skin accompanied by any of the following: Sudden and severe change in her general condition (e.g., irritability, drowsiness, loss of consciousness) Swollen lips or tongue Difficulty breathing Sudden vomiting She could be having a severe allergic reaction.Health 637 Common health problemscommon childhood infections Many parents have the impression that their youngster is always sick. Young children are very vulnerable to germs (viruses and bacteria) that cause infections. They easily catch colds, tummy bugs, and other infections. Why? Because their immune system , which protects them against germs, is not developed enough yet\u2014and because they touch everything! Infections in young children are most often caused by viruses. These viral infections are generally not serious, don't last long, and go away by themselves. They often occur more frequently during the child's first year in daycare. They gradually diminish as the child gets older and his immune system develops. Preventing infections Germs are everywhere in your child's environment: on toys, floors and door handles, for example. They are present in the nose, mouth, stools, and skin, and in the adults and children your child is in contact with. They can also be carried by animals. It's impossible to completely avoid germs. In fact, some exposure to germs enables your child's immune system to develop properly, helping her build up her own personal stock of antibodies for the future. Germs can be spread to your little one in different ways. For example, someone with an infection may kiss her or sneeze around her, or your child can put a contaminated object in her mouth. But usually germs are spread by the hands. 638Health Common health problemsWhen should you wash your hands? Before preparing meals, eating, breastfeeding, and feeding or giving medication to your child After using or accompanying a child to the toilet, changing a diaper, caring for someone who is ill, cleaning up vomit or diarrhea, coughing or sneezing into your hands, wiping a nose, throwing out a soiled tissue, touching or playing with a pet, or cleaning an animal cage or litter box Wash your children's hands as often as necessary, especially Before meals and snacks After they use the potty or toilet and after they play outdoors, in the sandbox, or with petsHow to do a good hand washing The best way to reduce the spread of infections is to wash your hands with soap often throughout the day. How should you wash your hands? Wet your hands in warm running water. Water that is too hot dries out the skin and is no more effective. Rub your hands together with mild soap (bar or liquid) for 15 to 20 seconds (there's no need to use antiseptic or antimicrobial soap). Rinse your hands well in warm running water. Dry hands thoroughly with a clean towel. If necessary you can use a moisturizing lotion or cream to prevent chapping.Health 639 Common health problemsIf your child is too small to reach the sink The above method is the most effective but is not always easy with small children. In that case First wash your child's hands with a paper towel or clean washcloth soaked in warm water and soap Rinse her hands with a washcloth soaked in warm water Dry her hands well Waterless disinfectants If water is not available, you can use a towelette or alcohol-based waterless disinfectant (hand rinse). These products should only be used as an alternative solution, however. When hands are very dirty, washing them thoroughly with soap and water is still the best option. If you use a hand rinse, choose one that contains alcohol. A small amount in the palm of your hand is enough. Dip your nails in the product, then rub your hands together until the product completely evaporates. Since the hand rinse contains alcohol, make sure to keep it out of the reach of children. Marie -Julie Martel The best way to prevent infections is to wash your hands often throughout the day.640Health Common health problemsOther ways to prevent infections Vaccination is one of the most effective ways of protecting your child's health. You are advised to have your child vaccinated according to the suggested schedule (see Vaccination , page 616) . Cough or sneeze into a paper tissue or into your elbow rather than your hands. Throw out the paper tissue right after using it and wash your hands. Thoroughly wash toys and other objects (e.g., cups, utensils) that other children put in their mouths before giving them to your child. Don't clean your baby's pacifier by putting it in your mouth. As much as possible, prevent healthy children from coming into direct, prolonged contact with people who have contagious illnesses. If your child has diarrhea, a fever, or any other highly contagious illness, it's best to keep her at home. If your baby is under the age of 3 months, take special care to keep her away from people with colds or other infections. If your child has a cold, is coughing a lot, or has diarrhea, it's a good idea to notify any visitors or people you are intending to visit. Childcare services usually have clear policies about keeping sick kids at home and administering medication. Reading these rules beforehand will save you some unpleasant surprises and help keep everyone healthy (other children, the staff, and other parents). If your child is sick, tell the staff about your child's symptoms and ask if she can attend that day. Your sick child may not have the energy to engage in her usual activities. If necessary, keep her at home. Carol-Anne Pedneault642Health Common health problemsFever Fever is an increase in body temperature above normal levels. It's the body's way of defending itself against infection. Fever is very common in young children. The child has a fever if his rectal temperature (in the rectum) is 38.0\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) or higher.The temperature of children under 2 years of age can be taken in the rectum or the armpit (see How to take the temperature , page 644) . Rectal temperature is the only reliable measurement for children age 2 and under.Health 643 Common health problemsWhen to take your child's temperature You don't have to check the temperature of a child who is in good health. If your child looks ill, is hot, red, irritable or whiny, take his temperature. Record the temperature and the time you took it, so you can tell Info-Sant\u00e9 ( 8-1-1 ) or your doctor, if need be.What thermometer to use The best choice is an unbreakable plastic digital thermometer without glass or mercury. Digital thermometers can be used to take temperature using the rectal (in the rectum), armpit (under the arm), and oral (in the mouth) method. Mercury thermometers are not recommended because if they break the mercury can poison both you and the environment.644Health Common health problems Meggie B\u00e9rub\u00e9 Rectal temperature is the only reliable measurement for children age 2 years and under.How to take the temperature In the rectum Rectal temperature is the only reliable measurement for children age 2 and under. Here's how to take it: Clean the thermometer in cool, soapy water, then rinse. Cover the end of the thermometer in petroleum jelly (e.g., Vaseline). Place your baby on his back, with his knees bent. Gently insert the thermometer about 2 cm (\u00be in.) into the rectum. Keep the digital thermometer in place until it beeps. Take it out and read the temperature. Clean the thermometer.You can also cover the thermometer with a disposable plastic tip (probe cover) sold in drugstores. Follow the manufacturer's directions for using and lubricating it.Health 645 Common health problemsUnder the arm Taking a child's temperature using the armpit method is not as accurate as with the rectal method. The armpit method is convenient for checking if your baby has a fever. However, your child's temperature must be confirmed using the rectal method if It is above 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F) It is equal to or less than 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), but your child is hot to the touch and seems sick Here's how to take it: Clean the thermometer in cool, soapy water and rinse. Place the tip of the thermometer in the centre of the armpit against the skin. Make sure that the child's arm is held snugly against his body. Keep the thermometer in place until it beeps. Remove it and read the temperature. Clean the thermometer. In the ear Taking a child's temperature in the ear is very quick but is not recommended because it's less accurate. In the mouth Taking a child's temperature in the mouth is not recommended for children under five.646Health Common health problemsWhat to do if your child has a fever Baby under 3 months old - See a doctor promptly or take your child to the emergency room. Baby 3 to 5 months old - Consult Info-Sant\u00e9 or a doctor. They will advise you. Baby 6 months of age or older - Observe your baby: if she is feeding well and seems healthy to you, you can treat her at home. However, she should be examined by a doctor if her fever lasts more than 72 hours (3 days). In some cases, you should promptly see a doctor or go to the emergency room if your child is feverish. See the red box on page 647 .Make sure your child is dressed comfortably and is neither too cold nor too hot. Don't undress him completely because he may get cold. To prevent him from becoming dehydrated, have him drink often. Cool or lukewarm baths and alcohol rubs are not recommended. They are stressful for a feverish child and their effect doesn't last. If your child is unwell or irritable, medication may help (see Fever medication, page 649) . Has your child recently been vaccinated? Your child may be feverish after being vaccinated. In this case, the fever does not necessarily mean he has an infection. It's better to assess his general condition. Review the advice you were given when he was vaccinated. If necessary, consult a health professional or Info-Sant\u00e9.Health 647 Common health problemsWhen to consult a health professional High fever does not always mean a serious illness. Keep a close eye on your child's general condition, behavior, and other symptoms. It's normal for a feverish child to need more cuddling and be less hungry than usual. Contact Info-Sant\u00e9 or your doctor in any of the following cases: You're worried about your child's condition. He has a fever and is less than 6 months old. He's had a fever for more than 72 hours, regardless of his age.See a doctor right away or take your child to emergency if he has a fever and has one or more of the following characteristics: Is less than 3 months old Has had a seizure (see page 648 ) Is vomiting a lot Cries constantly and won't calm down Is hard to wake or much sleepier than usual Is pale or has abnormal color Responds very little to others Has difficulty breathing or is breathing rapidly Has other symptoms that are worrying you An Info-Sant\u00e9 nurse is always on hand to advise you on what to do: just dial 8-1-1 . Dial 9-1-1 if the situation seems serious and urgent enough that you need an ambulance.648Health Common health problemsFebrile seizures (convulsions caused by fever) From 2 to 5% of children age 6 months to 5 years are affected by febrile seizures, which are convulsions caused by fever. During a fever, their arms and legs twitch and jerk and they may faint. Febrile seizures can be terrifying for parents, but they generally have no lasting effect on the child. Most of the time they last for a few seconds to a few minutes and stop by themselves. Afterwards, the child may appear to be asleep for a short period before recovering and returning to how she was before the seizure. What to do Lay your child on her side, on a flat surface in a safe spot. Do not try to stop her movements. Do not put anything in her mouth. After the seizure: In all cases, see a doctor quickly (within a few hours) or go to the emergency room. The doctor will check that your child is alright and does not have any other problems. An Info-Sant\u00e9 nurse is always on hand to advise you on what to do: just dial 8-1-1 .Call 9-1-1 in one or more of the following situations: Your child is under 6 months old. The seizure lasts more than 3 minutes. Your child's condition worsens (e.g., trouble breathing, bluish skin). Your child does not fully recover within a short period of time.Health 649 Common health problemsFever medication Medication is more useful for easing discomfort than for bringing down the fever. A feverish child who doesn't look ill doesn't necessarily need medication. You can give him either acetaminophen or ibuprofen (see First choice: acetaminophen and Second choice: ibuprofen , page 650 ), unless your doctor makes a specific recommendation for your child. Don't give both types of medication at the same time, unless your doctor advises it. Never give aspirin to your child.It's a good idea to record the type of medication, the dose you give, and at what time. You need to know your child's weight in kilograms in order to give the right dose. If you don't know his exact weight, use the last weight recorded on his vaccination record or check the age indicated on the medication packaging. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's recommendations on the packaging. You can ask a pharmacist or Info-Sant\u00e9 what dose to give. Measure the dose with the tool provided with the medication or with a graduated syringe you can get from your pharmacist. Kitchen teaspoons or soup spoons are not accurate enough. 650Health Common health problemsFirst choice: acetaminophen Acetaminophen (e.g., Tempra\u00ae, Tylenol\u00ae, or any generic brand for pediatric use) has been used for a long time and should be your first choice. Calculate 15 mg per kilogram. You can give one dose every 4 to 6 hours, but not more than five in any 24 hour period. Your pharmacist or Info -Sant \u00e9 can help you calculate the right dose. Don't give acetaminophen to a baby under 3 months old. Talk to your doctor first. Second choice: ibuprofen Ibuprofen (e.g., Advil\u00ae, Motrin\u00ae,or any generic brand for pediatric use) can also be used provided certain conditions are met. Calculate 10 mg per kilogram. As its effect lasts longer than that of acetaminophen, you can give it every 6 to 8 hours, but no more than 4 doses per 24 hours. Your pharmacist or Info-Sant\u00e9 can help you calculate the right dose.Do not give ibuprofen in the following situations: Your child is under 6 months old. Your child is dehydrated due to severe gastroenteritis (stomach flu) or is not drinking. Your child has chickenpox. Immediately before or after an operation (unless a doctor recommends it). Good to know ... Both acetaminophen and ibuprofen will usually make your child more comfortable and will bring down the fever within 30 to 60 minutes. After a few hours, the temperature may go up again and your child may once again seem unwell. You may have to give him another dose. But it's important to avoid exceeding the recommended dose and frequency. Health 651 Common health problemsWhat to do if your child throws up the medication If your child vomits within 30 minutes of taking the medication, don't give him another dose. Wait an hour, and then take his temperature again. If he's not feeling well and still has a fever, give him the same dose. If he throws up the medication again, do not repeat the dose. Consult your doctor. If your child vomits more than 30 minutes after taking the medication, he has probably already absorbed the medication so you shouldn't give him another dose right away. Keep medications in their containers, with a child-proof lid. Store medications and thermometers out of the reach of children in a cabinet with a lock or safety catch.652Health Common health problemsFever and skin rashes (contagious diseases) Many children develop fever and a rash (pimples or red patches, or both) at the same time. This could be a sign of infection. Most of these infections are caused by viruses and last a few days. They go away by themselves and have no long-term effects. The most common infections are roseola and hand, foot and mouth disease. There's also fifth disease and scarlet fever, but they rarely occur in children under two. Thanks to vaccination programs, measles and rubella are now very rare. Chickenpox is also becoming less common due to the recent introduction of a vaccine. Roseola Roseola is characterized by a high fever that stops after 3 to 5 days. Small pink spots then appear on the face, neck, and trunk. By the time the spots or redness appear, the child is almost healed. Roseola is caused by a virus. It is common in children 3 to 24 months old. We don't know how it spreads. There is no vaccine to prevent it, but it's not very contagious. Once better, the child is probably protected for life. In most cases, the child's general condition is good during the illness. She may return to her normal activities as soon as she's feeling well enough. Health 653 Common health problemsWhat to do There is no treatment for roseola. You can give your child acetaminophen if she's not feeling well and is feverish. You can also use ibuprofen if she's over 6 months old. You don't have to quarantine her. She can return to her usual activities as soon as she's feeling better. Hand, foot, and mouth disease Hand, foot, and mouth disease is another type of viral infection. It usually occurs in the summer and generally affects young children. It can cause fever, discomfort, and small, painful ulcers in the mouth. Small red pimples or little blisters may appear on the hands and feet, and sometimes on the rest of the body. Hand, foot, and mouth disease is generally not serious. What to do There is no treatment for this infection, which can last 7 to 10 days. Your child can continue to go to daycare if he feels well enough to join in the activities. 654Health Common health problemsBacterial meningitis Children are vaccinated against the three main bacteria that cause meningitis: meningococcus, pneumococcus, and H\u00e6mophilus influenz\u00e6 . As a result, these infections are now rare. They do occur occasionally because vaccines don't cover all strains of the bacteria. Children with meningitis quickly become very ill. They have fever, pain, and headache. They may become irritable and very sleepy. Red or blue spots may appear on the body. Children with bacterial meningitis appear very ill, and parents will want to consult a doctor right away. Viral meningitis Various viruses cause this type of meningitis. There is no specific treatment. It is usually not dangerous and generally goes away without causing any lasting effects. What to do if your child has a fever and a rash Generally the presence of a rash (i.e., pimples or red patches on the skin) with fever does not indicate a serious illness. It's usually better to consider the child's general condition rather than the presence of a rash or how high the fever is. Health 655 Common health problemsKeep a close eye on your child's general condition, behavior, and other symptoms. It's normal for a feverish child to need more cuddling and be less hungry than usual. Contact Info-Sant\u00e9 or your doctor if your child has a rash and has been feverish for over 72 hours. The Canadian Paediatric Society has a website for parents that provides more information on these contagious illnesses and on vaccination: caringforkids.cps.ca/handouts/illnesses-index .Colds and flu Colds and flu are caused by viruses. Children under 2 can catch up to 10 or so colds per year. If they do catch the flu, it generally will be only once a year. A child's cold symptoms include a stuffy or runny nose, sneezing, coughing, mild sore throat, loss of appetite, and mild fever. Usually these symptoms will last one to two weeks. Cold and flu symptoms can be similar, but flu is a much more serious illness. There is a flu vaccine available that your child can be given. 656Health Common health problemsWhat to do There is no cure for the common cold. It will go away by itself. You can let your child continue his normal activities and playing if he feels well enough. You can also try to ease some of the symptoms: If necessary, gently clean out his stuffed-up or runny nose (see Stuffed-up or runny nose , page 658) . Make sure he drinks enough fluids, especially if he has a fever. If your child seems uncomfortable and has a fever, you can give him some acetaminophen. You can also use ibuprofen if he is over 6 months old. These medications will make your child feel better, but they won't cure his cold. There are many over-the-counter cough and cold medications on the market. These medications should not be given to children under 6. They are not effective and can be dangerous for them. Using a humidifier is no longer recommended. If the humidity is too high or the humidifier poorly maintained, harmful molds can develop. If there is water running down the windows, the humidity level is most likely too high. Health Canada advises against giving cough and cold medications (syrups, suppositories, etc.) to children under the age of 6. They are not effective and can be dangerous for young children. Fran\u00e7ois Gervais658Health Common health problemsStuffed-up or runny nose A child may have a stuffed-up or runny nose for a number of reasons. It may simply be because she is crying, but it could also be because she has a cold or other infection. If this is the case, the color of the mucus is in no way related to how serious the infection is. Coloured mucus is not a sign of a bacterial infection. If your child has a stuffed-up or runny nose, you don't necessarily have to clear it. However, if she is having trouble feeding or sleeping because of a stuffy nose, you can try clearing it out. There are several ways of doing this: Take a long bath or shower with your child or let her play in the bath. The water and steam can make the mucus more liquid and help clear her nose. If the mucus is thick, use a saline solution (salt water) in nasal mist or nasal drop form. - When the bottle's empty, you can make up another batch of saline solution yourself (see page 659 ). - Nasal mist works better to clear out a baby's nose and some people find it easier to use, but it costs more. If you opt for nasal mist, choose one that's appropriate for your child's age and be sure to follow the directions on the bottle. - Always opt for a saline solution (salt water) rather than medicated drops or sprays (e.g., decongestant). When necessary, use a nasal suction device or bulb syringe to remove mucus from your child's nose, being careful to follow the manufacturer's instructions. A nasal suction device is more effective than a bulb syringe and is less likely to injure your child's nose, and many parents find it easier to use. Health 659 Common health problemsYou can also apply a non-medicated ointment (such as Vaseline) if the skin around the nose is irritated. If your child has had a runny nose for more than 10 days and you are concerned about her health, call your doctor. Saline solution (salt water) recipe to treat stuffy noses There are several recipes for saline solution (salt water) to treat stuffy noses. Here is one: Add 10 ml (2 level tsp.) of salt and 2.5 ml ( 1/2 tsp .) of baking soda to 1 litre (4 cups) of cooled boiled water. Store this solution in a glass container with a tight-fitting lid in the refrigerator for up to 7 days. Take the desired amount out of the refrigerator and wait until it reaches room temperature before using it.How to clean your child's nose with salt water Lay your child on her back. Insert a dropper with salt water (1 ml) into the nostril. Don't push the dropper too far in: place it gently at the entrance of each nostril. Wipe the child's nose or get her to blow it by breathing out through her nose if she's able to. Repeat as necessary. Wash the dropper in hot water and wipe dry. 660Health Common health problemscough In most cases, coughing is simply the body's way of getting rid of mucus. What to do If your child has a cough, don't give him cough syrup. Coughing is a defensive mechanism and cough syrups can actually be dangerous for young children. Health Canada advises against giving cough and cold medications (syrups, suppositories, etc.) to children under the age of 6. They are not effective and can be dangerous for young children.Talk to your doctor if your child Has had a cough for more than 10 days Is coughing to the point of choking or vomiting Has a cough and is wheezing or breathing rapidly. This could be bronchiolitis or asthma. You should consult a doctor right away. A hoarse voice or barking cough, like a barking dog, is usually a sign of laryngitis (previously referred to as \"false croup\"). To relieve your child's cough, have him breathe cold air: bundle him up warmly and take him outdoors or open the window. Cold air will calm the inflammation in his throat (larynx). You will likely notice an improvement within a few minutes. If it's hot out, open your freezer door so he can breathe in the cold air. If he has trouble breathing, see a doctor right away. Health 661 Common health problemsSore throat If your child has a sore throat, she may find it painful to swallow and may eat and drink less. She may drool more or have a hoarse voice. So long as she is able to breathe easily, it's not serious. In children 2 years and under, sore throat is usually caused by viruses (cold and flu viruses, for example). In this case, antibiotics are not effective, but there are several things you can do to make your child more comfortable. What to do Make sure she drinks plenty of liquids. It may be easier for her to drink with a straw or sippy cup when she has a sore throat. She may also prefer to eat cold foods. If your child appears to have a sore throat, acetaminophen may provide her some relief. Or ibuprofen may be given if she's over 6 months. Consult your doctor if she has trouble breathing or swallowing. Good to know ... Don't give cough drops to children under 5 because they can choke. Don't give honey to children under 1 year. They can catch a very serious infection called botulism (see Honey\u2014never for babies under age 1 , page 532) .662Health Common health problemsEar infection Otitis media is an ear infection of the inner ear. It is not visible from the outside. Most ear infections develop following a cold. Symptoms of ear infection include fever and crying. Your child may sometimes roll his head on the bed and be more irritable or less active than usual. He may seem to have less appetite. He may also vomit or have diarrhea. Some children touch the ear that hurts. In some cases fluid can run out of the ear. What to do Consult your doctor if your child is crying a lot and has a fever or seems to be in pain. If your doctor diagnoses an ear infection, he or she may suggest an antibiotic. If so, it's important to continue giving the antibiotic right to the end of the treatment, even if your child seems better before then. To relieve the pain, you can give your child acetaminophen. Ibuprofen can also be used for children over 6 months. An ear infection can temporarily affect your child's hearing. If you think your child is not hearing as well a few months after the ear infection, consult your doctor. Health 663 Common health problemsDiarrhea and vomiting (stomach flu or \"gastro\") Each child is unique, with their own particular bowel movement patterns. The frequency, quantity, consistency, and colour of their stools vary. For example, a baby may have up to 10 bowel movements per day in the first weeks of life and much fewer afterwards. Some babies have very soft, even liquid, stools. Breastfed babies' stools are often yellow or green. Babies fed commercial formula will tend to have greenish beige stools. Some babies spit up a lot more than others. So it's important to get to know your baby and what is normal for her. You should worry only if her habits change, if she's drinking or eating less, losing weight, or seems ill. If her stools are softer than usual, but not more frequent or abundant, and if she doesn't seem ill, it's probably not stomach flu (gastroenteritis). Keep an eye on her to see if the situation resolves itself within a few days. If not, consult your doctor. 664Health Common health problemsGastroenteritis (stomach flu or \"gastro\") Gastroenteritis is a very common infection in children. Almost all children come down with it at least once in their first year. A child with gastroenteritis is clearly ill: She feels sick, is irritable, and eats and plays less. She has diarrhea: her stools are liquid (almost like water) and are more frequent and abundant than normal. She may also vomit (more abundantly and violently than usual). She may have a fever. Gastroenteritis germs are easily spread from one person to another, especially from one child to another. To prevent spreading the infection, it's important to wash your hands regularly, especially after handling dirty diapers, stools, or vomit, and before handling food. What to do Most cases of gastroenteritis are caused by a virus and disappear on their own within a few hours or days. A calm environment and plenty of liquids can help your child feel better. The most important thing is to regularly offer her something to drink to prevent dehydration. Don't give your child any anti-nausea or anti-diarrhea medication without your doctor's advice. This type of medication can have serious side effects and is rarely recommended for young children. Health 665 Common health problemsDehydration Dehydration can occur when your child doesn't get enough water and minerals from her food to replace those lost due to diarrhea and vomiting. When your child has gastroenteritis, it's important to check for the following signs of dehydration: Dry mouth Lack of tears Increased thirst Less urine than usual Drowsiness or irritabilityPreventing dehydration If your baby is a bit fretful but otherwise seems ok, if her eyes and mouth are moist, and she wets her diaper regularly, she's probably not dehydrated. Keep giving her the usual amount of milk and offer her a drink more often than usual if she'll take it. A normal diet will help reduce the diarrhea. If your child vomits or refuses to eat, keep giving her her usual milk. If she's started eating solid food, offer her foods that she particularly likes and is able to keep down, then gradually reintroduce her normal diet when she feels better, ideally within 4 to 12 hours. Avoid giving her juice, even if it's diluted, or soft drinks, even if they're flat, because they're too sweet and can sometimes even make the diarrhea worse. 666Health Common health problemsPreventing dehydration during gastroenteritis Breastfed baby Baby fed commercial infant formula or 3.25% milk Keep breastfeeding. If your baby only takes a little milk at a time, breastfeed more often. If she refuses to breastfeed, give her small quantities of expressed breast milk using a sippy cup, spoon, dropper, or straw.Offer her her usual formula or 3.25% milk more often and in smaller quantities. If she isn't taking her bottle well, use a sippy cup, spoon, dropper, or straw. Regardless of the type of milk, if your baby has started eating food Offer her food she particularly likes and can keep down. Avoid juice and soft drinks.Dehydrated baby One or more of the following signs indicate that your baby is somewhat dehydrated: Her mouth and tongue are a little drier than usual. She seems to be thirstier than usual. She is peeing a little less than usual. One or more of these signs indicate that you need to start rehydrating her. You should frequently offer her small quantities of fluid. Breast milk or oral rehydration solutions (ORS) are the best choice, depending on the case. Health 667 Common health problemsJust as you would do to prevent dehydration, avoid giving her juice, even if it's diluted, or soft drinks, even if they're flat, or sports drinks like Gatorade \u00ae because they're too sweet and can sometimes even make the diarrhea worse. If the diarrhea is abundant, avoid giving only water because it doesn't contain enough sugar and salt, which your baby needs to rehydrate. Your child will probably not feel like eating if she has vomited a lot and is dehydrated. Keep her on a liquid diet and gradually phase in solid food when she feels a little better and has stopped vomiting. Treating dehydration Breastfed baby Baby fed commercial infant formula or 3.25% milk Keep breastfeeding. Breastfeed more often, for shorter periods at a time. If she has difficulty nursing, give her small quantities of expressed breast milk using a sippy cup, spoon, dropper, or straw. If your baby vomits breast milk, offer her ORS, according to the instructions in the column on the right.Stop giving her her usual formula or 3.25% milk for about 4 hours. Instead, give her small quantities of ORS in a bottle, sippy cup, spoon, dropper, or straw. ORS in the form of ice pops can be given to children 1 year and older. Regardless of the type of milk, if your baby has started eating food Keep her on a liquid diet, for only a few hours. If your baby vomits, gradually start reintroducing her usual food when the vomiting becomes less frequent. After 24 to 48 hours, most children are able to return to their normal diet. 668Health Common health problemsIt is particularly important to keep giving your baby regular fluids, according to what she can keep down. If the vomiting persists, give her small quantities of liquid, more often. For example, you can give her 5 to 15 ml (1 tsp. to 1 tbsp.) of breast milk or oral rehydration solution every 5 to 15 minutes. Once your baby is feeling a little better, gradually increase the quantities, so long as she can keep her food down. Oral rehydration solutions (ORS) Oral rehydration solutions (ORS) contain precise ratios of water, salt, and sugar to replace what has been lost through diarrhea and vomiting. You can buy ready-made ORS in drugstores, in various flavours of ready-to-serve drinks, ice pops, and packets of powder. Your pharmacist can help you choose the right product. The Canadian Paediatric Society suggests that parents always keep ORS on hand. The powdered form, which you dissolve in cooled boiled water, is less expensive and more practical when you're away from home, but you run the risk of making a measuring mistake when diluting it. The Canadian Paediatric Society therefore prefers pre-prepared ORS. Encourage your child to drink as much of this solution asshe can, using a bottle, sippy cup, spoon, dropper, or straw. She may prefer it cold or in the form of an ice pop if she's over 1 year old. Health 669 Common health problemsThe Canadian Paediatric Society does not recommend using homemade ORS because mistakes can be made in preparing them. However, if you can't get hold of a store-bought ORS (late at night, for example), you can make a homemade, emergency ORS yourself using the following recipe. Mix together the following ingredients: Ready-to-serve orange juice without added sugar: 360 ml (12 oz.) Cooled boiled water: 600 ml (20 oz.) Salt: 2.5 ml ( 1/2 lev el tsp.), never more Follow this recipe carefully. Measure out the exact quantities, using a measuring spoon and measuring cup. Improper solution preparation can actually worsen dehydration. Only use a homemade ORS as a last resort (while you're waiting for the drugstore to open, for example) and never for more than 12 hours. When to consult a health professionnalGastroenteritis symptoms usually lessen over the course of a few days. If the diarrhea continues for more than 1 or 2 weeks, consult your doctor. Consult a doctor right away if your child is showing the following signs: She is very irritable and constantly cries. She shows signs of severe dehydration (she's very drowsy, wets less than 4 diapers in 24 hours, cries without tears, has a dry, pasty mouth and tongue, and sunken eyes). She vomits often for a period of more than 4 to 6 hours. There is blood in her stools.HEAlTH 670 Gabrielle Th\u00e9riaultKeeping baby safe Travelling safely: Car seats 673 Babyproofing the nursery 684 Babyproofing the kitchen 687 Choosing toys 688 Preventing falls 690 Preventing drowning 692 Preventing suffocation and choking 694 Preventing burns 696 Preventing dog bites 698 Living in a smoke-free environment 699 Preventing poisoning 700 Protecting your baby from the sun 703 Protecting your baby from insect bites 704Health 671 Keeping baby safeYour babyproofing checklist will change as your child grows and develops. Take electrical outlets, for example. Though they are not dangerous for newborns, babies who are crawling could suffer electrical burns if they touch them. So from time to time you need to re-assess the dangers that may be lurking in your child's surroundings. Childhood injuries are a leading cause of death and doctor's visits. It is essential that you be vigilant and never under-estimate your child's natural curiosity, which drives him to constantly explore his environment. As soon as your baby can move about and pick things up, you need to pay special attention to his immediate surroundings. Any objects, big or small, can pique his interest. Get in the habit of looking around your home from your child's vantage point. See what could be done to reduce the risk of accidents. A good tip for inside the home is to physically get down to your child's level and examine every room from his perspective. Are there any toxic products within his reach? Store them in a secure location he can't get to. Don't forget the outside of your home. Do you have a pool your child can access easily? Install a gate so children can't get to it without your knowledge. Babyproofing your home is well and good, but what about when your child is visiting grandparents or family and friends who don't have small children? Is it best to teach babies about potential dangers? Yes! If your baby doesn't know the dangers, he is likely to stick his finger in the first uncovered electrical outlet he finds.672Health Keeping baby safeAs soon as your child can move around on his own, you can teach him some basic rules (see Setting limits , page 325) .

Alexandra Linteau injury.Health 673 Keeping baby safeTypes of car seats The type of car seat you should use depends on your child's weight and height. To choose the proper seat, check the car seat manufacturer's recommendations for maximum weight and height. There are three types of children's car seats: Infant car seats (also known as bucket seats), from birth until at least 10 kg (22 lb.). Many models of infant seats can also be used by children over 10 kg. Child seats for children who weigh at least 10 kg (22 lb.). Most child seats go up to 29.5 kg (65 lb.). Booster seats for children who weigh at least 18 kg (40 lb.). Booster seats are mandatory for children up to 145 cm in height or 9 years of age. There are also convertible seats that can be used as an infant seat, child seat, or booster seat.Travelling safely: car sea ts An appropriate car seat, when used properly, can reduce the risk of death and injury by 70% in the event of a collision.Car seats are essential for all car travel with your infant, right from birth.674Health Keeping baby safeWhere to install a car seat in a vehicle For your child's safety, the car seat should always be installed on the back seat of a vehicle.Warning regarding air bags Never put a child of 12 years or less in the front seat if your vehicle has a passenger-side front airbag. If you need to sit your child in the front seat due to exceptional circumstances (e.g., the vehicle has no back seat or your child has a health issue that requires close supervision), you must first submit an airbag deactivation application to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'assurance automobile du Qu\u00e9bec (SAAQ). For more information, go to saaq.gouv.qc.ca/en/ road-safety/modes-transportation/automobile/safety-devices/airbags/deactivation/ .Health 675 Keeping baby safeCar seat orientation Rear-facing car seats Infant car seats (or bucket seats) and convertible seats used as infant seats must always be installed facing the rear of the vehicle. For safety reasons, Transport Canada recommends using a rear-facing infant or child seat as long as possible, i.e., as long as your child hasn't reached the car seat manufacturer's recommended weight and height limits. There must be a space of at least 2.5 cm between the top of the child's head and the top of the seat. Parents who wish to seat a child facing the front before he has reached the car seat manufacturer's recommended weight and height limits may only do so if the three following conditions are met: The child is at least one year old. He weights over 10 kg (22 lb.). He can stand up by himself. Front-facing car seats Once your child has grown too tall or too heavy to use a rear-facing car seat, you'll need a front-facing child seat or a convertible seat used as a front-facing child seat. At this stage, the child is still secured in his seat by the seat harness, but now faces forward. Booster seats and convertible seats used as booster seats must always face forward.676Health Keeping baby safe Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'assurance automobile du Qu\u00e9bec Phase 1How to install a car seat and secure your child To properly secure your child in his seat, you'll need to consider the type of seat and the direction it faces (front or rear). Car seat use is divided into three consecutive phases, starting with the birth of the child. Read the manufacturer's instructions very carefully before putting your child in a car seat. Health 677 Keeping baby safe Phase 1Types of seats: Infant seat (bucket seat), child seat or a convertible seat used as an infant seat or child seat Direction: Facing the rear of the vehicle The harness straps must go through the slots in the back of the seat at the height of your child's shoulders or a little lower. The chest clip connecting the two harness straps must be placed at armpit level (middle of your child's chest). The harness straps must be tightened as close as possible to your child's body. Don't leave more than a finger's width between your child's body and the harness.During baby's first month of life, try to avoid taking him on trips of more than one hour at a time. If you must take your newborn on a long trip, it is a good idea to take frequent breaks. Newborn babies have very little muscle tone and they tend to slide down in their seats, which can constrict their breathing. Stop every now and then to take your baby out of his seat and move him around. 678Health Keeping baby safe Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'assurance automobile du Qu\u00e9bec Phase 2Types of seats: Child seat or convertible seat used as a child seat Direction: Facing the front of the vehicle Attach the tether strap located at the top of the car seat back to the anchor bolt in the vehicle.

Make sure the car seat bears a compliance label before you use it. It is illegal to use car seats purchased in other countries because their safety standards are not the same as ours. Expiry date An expiry date is usually engraved on the plastic part of car seats sold in Canada. If you can't find the expiry date, see the seat's user manual or contact the seat manufacturer. Be sure to have the following information on hand: serial number, date of manufacture, and date of purchase of the seat. Accidents If your child's car seat is in an accident, check the seat owner's manual to see if the collision was serious enough to require seat replacement. If in doubt, it is recommended that you replace the car seat, even if it does not look damaged. Manufacturer recalls Every year, car seat manufacturers issue a number of recalls. That's why it's a good idea to register your car seat. You can register your seat on the manufacturer's website or fill out the product registration card that came in the original box and return it to the manufacturer by mail. Once your car seat is registered, you'll be able to receive recall notices from the manufacturer.Health 681 Keeping baby safeUsed car seats Parents are strongly advised not to get a used car seat because you need to know the full history of seat your child will use. If you do decide to get a used car seat, make sure it meets the following criteria: It is in good condition and has all its parts. It has the Transport Canada compliance label (the one with the maple leaf). It has not been in an accident. It has not been recalled by the manufacturer. It is not past its expiry date.To find out if a car seat has been recalled, visit the Transport Canada website at tc.gc.ca , click on \"Child car seat safety,\" and go to the section \"Safety alerts and notices for child car seats\".682Health Keeping baby safeNetwork for the Inspection of Child Safety Seats SAAQ, in partnership with CAA-Qu\u00e9bec, offers a child car seat verification service as well as advice on how to use car seats properly. This service is available free of charge throughout Qu\u00e9bec. If you would like to have your child's car seat checked and make sure it's installed properly, contact a CAA network member in your area. Go to caaquebec.com/en/on-the-road/services/child-car-seat-verification-network .Taxis For safety reasons, taking a taxi with your child is not recommended unless you can put him in a car seat suitable for his weight and height. If you must take a taxi with your child and don't have a car seat, the Highway Safety Code requires him to wear a seat belt, unless he is unable to sit up on his own. If your child can't sit up on his own, it is recommended that you put your own seatbelt on first, then hold the child in your lap.Linda Perron684Health Keeping baby safeBabyproofing the nursery Your baby's room should be bright and well ventilated. It should also have a window. When it's cold out, the room should be kept around 20\u00b0C (68\u00b0F). At that temperature, if your child is sweating it's because he has too many covers on. When it's cold out, the humidity should ideally be kept between 30% and 45%. Wood and vinyl floors are best because they are easier to keep clean than carpeting which absorbs moisture from the air and traps dirt. If you have carpet, vacuum regularly to eliminate dirt and dust mites. Blinds Cords used to operate blinds should be kept out of your child's reach because they are a strangulation hazard. Blind and curtain cords in the nursery and throughout the house should be secured high up so your child cannot reach them. The best way to keep your child safe is to remove any window blinds with cords. Many stores sell cordless blinds. Install your baby's crib away from the window. Make sure your child cannot reach the blinds by climbing on furniture or anything else near the window. The sale of blinds containing lead has only been regulated since 2009 in Canada. Low-cost PVC mini-blinds from China, Taiwan, Indonesia, Hong Kong, and Mexico made before 2009 may contain lead, which can cause lead poisoning and neurological problems in children. Health Canada recommends throwing out such blinds to avoid this type of problems. Health 685 Keeping baby safeSecuring blind cords Illustration: Maurice Gervais Crib, cradle, and bassinet The safest place for a baby to sleep is in a crib that meets Canadian safety standards. This type of bed can be used until your child is over 90 cm tall or is able to climb out of the crib, whichever happens first.Cribs made before September 1986 do not comply with Health Canada's Cribs, Cradles, and Bassinets Regulations and should not be sold or used. Since December 2016, this regulation has prohibited the sale, import, and manufacturing of drop-side cribs. Neither new nor secondhand drop-side cribs should be used. You should regularly check the crib to make sure it is in good condition. Make sure all the parts are secured and undamaged. The mattress must be firm and fit the crib. There should be no more than 3 cm (1 3/16 in.) between the mattress and the sides of the crib. Do not use removable S or Z hooks to secure the mattress support as they are unsafe. It is illegal to sell cribs with these types of hooks. Make sure the base of your baby's crib is securely in place. It should not move. The side slats should not be more than 6 cm (2 3/8 in.) apart.686Health Keeping baby safeBe wary of hand-me-down cribs and cribs from consignment stores, flea markets, and garage sales. If you are thinking of using a bassinet or cradle instead of a crib during your baby's first month, make sure the products you choose meet Health Canada's regulations. Carefully read the manufacturer's instructions before using them. Bunk beds are dangerous because children can fall out of them. Children under the age of 6 should not use them.

You can also contact Health Canada toll-free at 1-866-662-0666 or by email at cps-spc@hc-sc.gc.ca .Bedding The only bedding your baby needs is a fitted sheet and a blanket. It is best to thoroughly wash and rinse them before use. Do not use bumpers, crib skirts, pillows, positioners, and stuffed toys as they present a suffocation hazard. These items should also be avoided when your child starts to move around in his crib because he could use them to climb out and could hurt himself if he falls. Wash bedding regularly with hot water to kill dust mites, which feed on dead skin and live in warm, moist beds.Health 687 Keeping baby safeBabyproofing the kitchen All kinds of accidents can happen in the kitchen. By taking a few simple precautions, you can protect your child from injury. The high chair should be kept away from counters and tables because your child could push off with her feet and tip over. Belt your child into the high chair so she cannot slide out or climb over the backrest or the tray. Keep an eye on your child at all times. Some babies manage to get out of their high chair even if they are belted in! When you use a portable booster chair, your child must be belted in at all times. Even if she is belted in securely, avoid putting the chair on a table or counter. This will help reduce the risk of falls. When your baby starts to crawl, you must be even more vigilant. It's best not to use a tablecloth because your baby could pull on it, bringing everything crashing down on herself. Pot handles should be turned toward the centre of the table, buffet, or counter. Don't leave utensils lying about. The risk of getting burned is also highest in the kitchen. Turn pot and pan handles inward on the stove. When you are frying food, keep your child away so she doesn't get splattered with grease or oil. Also keep her away from the oven when it is on so she can't touch it. Use the back burners whenever possible. See the Preventing burns section on page 696 for additional safety tips.688Health Keeping baby safechoosing toys Safe toys are Washable Non-toxic (check the label) Unbreakable Non-flammable (flame-resistant) Big enough so children cannot swallow them or put them in their mouth Compliant with Canadian government safety standards (canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/consumer- product-safety/reports-publications/consumer- education/your-child-safe/play-time.html ) It's best to avoid soft vinyl (PVC) toys and rattles because some substances used to make them more flexible are toxic. Children can absorb these substances by chewing on them. In the bath and wading pool, avoid rubber toys that retain water because they can breed germs.Before you buy a toy Read the label to find out the recommended age. Examine the toy to see if it is easy to handle. Check that there are no sharp edges or pointed tips. Make sure the eyes and noses of stuffed animals are sewn on securely. Parts on large toys should not come off easily. Avoid toys with cords, especially elastic cords that could get wrapped around the child's neck. Be careful with small items, small parts, and watch batteries-style, as the child could put them in his nose or mouth and choke. Make sure baby toys like rattles and teething rings are large enough so they cannot get caught in your baby's throat and choke him.Health 689 Keeping baby safe Musical toys are great because they stimulate baby's sense of hearing and sight, but check the gears and make sure small parts do not come apart. Be careful however with toys that are too noisy as they can damage children's hearing and irritate parents. Try them out before you buy them. You can find all kinds of low-cost second-hand items for baby, including toys and furniture. Be aware, however, that more stringent regulations are in place now to safeguard children.

Properly install the right type of batteries in toys to prevent leaks. Battery fluid is corrosive and should not come into contact with your child's skin, let alone his mouth, nose, or eyes. Do not let your child play with batteries.690Health Keeping baby safePreventing falls Babies fall a lot, even when you think they are in a safe place. Supervision is needed whenever falls are likely and your baby could hurt herself. Here are some examples: A child is left alone in her high chair. She tips over her high chair or falls trying to get out. An adult is changing a baby's diaper on a changing table and steps away to get something. A child climbs onto a bookcase, which then falls onto her because it is not secured to the wall. A child climbs on furniture and falls out a window that does not have a window guard preventing it from opening more than 10 cm.Stairs A gate must be installed at the top of every set of stairs. It's also preferable to install one at the bottom of the stairs. It must be securely attached to the doorframe or hallway walls. If the gate is second-hand, make sure it meets current safety standards by checking the Health Canada website at canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/consumer- product-safety/reports-publications/consumer-education/your-child-safe/is-your-child-safe.html . Baby walkers Baby walkers are prohibited in Canada because children can fall down the stairs in them, causing head and other injuries. Health Canada recommends using stationary activity centres for babies instead. They are safer than walkers because they do not have wheels.Health 691 Keeping baby safePlay structures Playgrounds and slides Make sure your child is under adult supervision whenever she uses equipment like play structures and slides. Teach your child how to play safely on each type of equipment. Falls are the leading cause of playground injury. The risk of injury is linked primarily to two factors: The height of the equipment (the higher it is, the more dangerous it is) The shock-absorbency of the material under and around the equipmentMake sure your child uses age-appropriate equipment and that there is enough shock-absorbing material (e.g., 15 to 30 cm of wood chips or sand). Play equipment should not be used in winter because shock-absorbing materials are likely to be frozen. Deaths are rare, and are usually the result of a child's head, neck, or clothing (e.g., cords or scarves) getting stuck in openings in play equipment. For this reason, when your child uses play equipment, make sure she is not wearing any clothing with cords, have her wear a neck warmer instead of a scarf, and remove her bike helmet, if she is wearing one. Trampolines Because so many trampoline injuries are reported, Health Canada recommends that children under 6 not be allowed to play on trampolines, even with supervision. 692Health Keeping baby safePreventing drowning A child can drown in a matter of seconds, even in a small amount of water like in a bathtub. That is why children should never be left in a bathtub, pool, or natural body of water without adult supervision. This applies to inflatable pools and wading pools as well. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is effective on children 90% of the time, so it's a good idea for parents to learn CPR in case they ever need to use it. Bathtub Children can drown in a bathtub if they slip or lose their balance. Bath seats and infant inner tubes cannot prevent this kind of accident. In fact, they can even increase the risk of drowning by leading parents to believe that they can leave their child alone in the bathtub for a few moments, which is not recommended. To learn more about bathing your infant and safety during bath time, see Bathing your baby on page 598 . Pools Swimming pool drownings and near-drownings occur most often when no one is actually swimming and a child accidentally falls in the water. Oftentimes this type of accident happens when a child living at the home or in the neighbourhood is able to gain access to the pool when no adults are present. Health 693 Keeping baby safeThat is why it is important to put a fence or gate around the pool so children can't get in from the patio, deck, house, or yard. Children must not be able to open or climb over the fence or gate, which must be at least 1.2 m (about 4 ft.) tall. The gate or fence door must open from the inside (the pool side). The door must have a safety latch and spring hinges that close the door automatically. To find out how to secure all types of pools (above ground, inground, and inflatable), contact your city or town. The Lifesaving Society offers free safety advice and courtesy inspections of residential pools. Call 1-800-265-3093 or 514-252 -3100 or visit their website, sauvetage.qc.ca/en . France Lalibert\u00e9 Your child must be supervised at all times around lakes and rivers because he could wander off in the blink of an eye.694Health Keeping baby safeYou can also learn how to respond in case of emergency by taking the Lifesaving Society's Prevent Drowning at Home course. Water gardens and features Since children can drown in as little as 2.5 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in.) of water, caution should also be exercised around shallow water, like water gardens and other landscaping water features. Natural bodies of water Heightened supervision is a must around lakes and rivers as well. When you go out on the water, always wear a life jacket. Make sure children and the other people with you wear one, too. Fasten life jackets properly. If the boat capsizes, life jackets can save the lives of everyone onboard. Preventing suffocation and choking Small objects and cords Young children tend to put everything they touch in their mouth. Since small objects can be swallowed easily and cause choking, it is best to keep them out of your child's reach. To help parents determine if an object is dangerous, the Canadian Paediatric Society uses the image of an empty toilet paper roll. If an object can fit in a toilet paper roll, a child could choke on it and it should not be left within a child's reach. Some types of food can also become lodged in your child's throat or block her airways. The rules of thumb in the Choking risk: Be extra careful until age 4 section on page 530 will help you steer clear of foods that pose a choking hazard. Health 695 Keeping baby safeYour child can also suffocate on objects that risk covering her mouth and nose (like a plastic bag), preventing her from breathing. It is a good idea to put a knot in used plastic bags before putting them away or throwing them in a recycling bin (if they can be recycled) or a garbage can out of children's reach. Caution must also be exercised with hanging cords and toys, like mobiles. Cords on clothing, curtains, and toys should be no longer than 20 cm. Latex balloons are dangerous for young children because they can choke on them. Make sure balloons (both inflated and uninflated) and pieces of popped balloon are always kept out of children's reach. Pascale Turcotte Young children often choke on small everyday objects and food.696Health Keeping baby safePreventing burns Electrical outlets and wires To keep your baby from getting an electrical shock (e.g., by putting something in an electrical outlet), ensure all outlets are secured with a snug-fitting outlet cover. The cords on electrical appliances (irons, kettles, etc.) can be dangerous if left hanging. When you are ironing, it is best to put your child somewhere safe, like in his playpen. Don't leave extension cords out. They can cause electrical burns if children put them in their mouth. Fire It is essential that you install a smoke detector on every floor and replace the battery periodically, for example when you change your clocks in the fall and spring. Keep matches and other smoking accessories out of the reach of children. Hot liquids Children have thinner skin than adults, so they can be burned more easily by a hot liquid. Some accidents can easily be avoided. For example, don't eat soup or hot beverages when you are holding your baby or leave a hot liquid unattended. Also beware of steam and hot electrical appliances.Health 697 Keeping baby safeHot water Qu\u00e9bec's Building Code requires that home water heater thermostats be set so that the water in the tank is no cooler than 60\u00b0C (140\u00b0F). This reduces the risk of water contamination by bacteria. At that temperature, however, water can cause second- and even third-degree burns in children within a second. Burns caused by hot tap water occur most often at bath time. To prevent the risk of burns, always check the water temperature with your elbow or wrist before putting your child in the tub. Water should be warm, i.e., body temperature. Never leave your child in a bathtub without adult supervision (children love playing with faucets). R\u00e9my Brunelle Ensure all outlets are secured with a snug-fitting outlet cover. That way, your baby will be safe from electrical shock.698Health Keeping baby safeYou should ideally have a device installed on the faucet you use to bathe your child (e.g., bathtub or bathroom sink faucet) to keep the water temperature at or below 49\u00b0C (120\u00b0F). This device can be installed on the pipe or near the faucet. You can also purchase faucets with this device built in.Preventing dog bites Never leave a child alone with a dog, even if the animal knows the child and does not seem dangerous. Remember that a dog that is gentle with your child may show aggression toward other children. Take signs of aggression seriously. If the dog bares its teeth, growls, or pretends to bite, see your veterinarian or a dog trainer. When you are at someone else's home, be especially vigilant if the household dog does not know your child. Because they are small and unpredictable, children are susceptible to dog bites even from your own dog or the neighbour's dog. Children are unable to recognize the signs of aggression.Health 699 Keeping baby safeliving in a smoke-free environment Asthma, earaches, bronchitis, pneumonia, and upper respiratory tract infections are more common in children exposed to tobacco smoke. Exposure to tobacco smoke also increases the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), regardless of the number of cigarettes smoked in the child's presence. Children are more vulnerable than adults because their organs are still developing.Smoking outdoors Smoking in the home poses a threat to the health of your loved ones. The dangerous products in smoke spread throughout the air and stay there for months, even if you open the windows, turn on the range hood, or smoke in a designated room. Even a high power ventilation system like the ones you sometimes see in public places cannot eliminate all cigarette smoke! That is why you should not smoke in the home, even when your children are not there. For your child's health, do not smoke in your home or car. Cigarettes, cigars, and pipes emit smoke that is very dangerous, especially to children.700Health Keeping baby safePreventing poisoning Every year, thousands of children between the ages of 1 and 5 are poisoned in Qu\u00e9bec by ingesting a toxic product, getting a toxic product in their eyes or on their skin, or inhaling toxic vapours. These products are everywhere. You have them in your kitchen cabinets, bathroom, bedroom, garage, and even your purse. Many household products and plants can be toxic to children, like vitamins, medications, cleaning products, fuel, houseplants, lawn mushrooms, and pesticides, as well as personal hygiene, car maintenance, and renovation products.Qu\u00e9bec Poison Control Centre is a phone emergency service available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Store these products in cabinets and drawers with safety latches or in places children cannot get into. Keep these products in their original containers. Never transfer hazardous products to food containers (e.g., gas in a water bottle).Other simple precautions you can take to reduce the risk of poisoning in children: Keep children away from ashtrays and glasses containing alcoholic beverages. To prevent drug overdose, carefully read the instructions before you give your child any medicine and measure out the exact dose. See your pharmacist if you need help. When purchasing medication or hazardous products, choose childproof containers (although they aren't 100% effective). Never leave medication on the changing table or near the crib. When you are at someone else's home, give the house a once over to make sure your child will be safe. 702Health Keeping baby safePlants Many indoor and outdoor plants have toxic leaves and fruits that can cause conditions such as skin irritation, swelling, trouble swallowing, dry mouth, diarrhea, vomiting, and hallucinations. To prevent exposure to toxic plants, it's worth checking to see if your indoor and outdoor plants are toxic. As soon as your child can crawl or walk, keep these plants out of her reach. Keep plants in their original container so you can easily identify them later. If you don't know the name of your plants, ask at a garden centre or florist. It may be useful to bring along some photos so they can help identify them. Lawn mushrooms Long considered harmless, lawn mushrooms are now an increasingly common cause of poisoning. Lawn mushrooms can cause serious damage to a child's liver and digestive system. To prevent poisoning caused by lawn mushrooms, they should be picked or destroyed before children can find them. Since they grow quickly, be vigilant and keep a watchful eye out for them. Health 703 Keeping baby safeProtecting your baby from the sun Little ones should not be exposed to the sun without protection because their skin is very thin and burns easily. This means you'll need to protect your child from the sun's rays, which can cause sunburn, dry skin, and allergic reactions. Even children with dark skin must be protected from the sun. It is important to keep children out of direct sunlight between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. This is especially important around noon when the sun is most intense. Under 6 months - It is best to keep your baby in the shade and to protect him with clothing and a hat. Skin is very delicate at this age and applying sunscreen could cause allergic reactions. 6 months and up - Whenever your baby is outdoors, dress him in a hat and clothing that covers his arms and legs. About 30 minutes before going out, apply sunscreen to exposed body parts. Reapply every two hours and after swimming. Dominique Belley It is always good to cover your child as much as possible (lightweight clothing and hat) and to keep him in the shade to protect him from the sun's rays.704Health Keeping baby safeUp to 85% of UV (ultraviolet) rays can pass through clouds, so sunscreen is always a must even when it's cloudy. Choose a sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF 30). Your pharmacist can help you find an appropriate one. Eyes and the sun The sun's UV rays are dangerous to the eyes and can be reflected by sand, water, and snow. Pupils close naturally, reducing the intensity of the rays entering the eyes. However, the best way to protect your child's eyes is to put a large brimmed hat or cap on his head. Never seat your child in facing the sun. Shade is best.If you decide to put sunglasses on your child, make sure they protect against UV rays before you buy them. Look for the words \"100% UV protection\" or \"UV 400.\" Protecting your baby from insect bites To protect children under age 2 from insect bites, you can Put a mosquito net over your child's stroller Dress your child in light or khaki coloured lightweight clothing made of a closely knit fabric that is closed at the neck, wrists, ankles, and waist Put a hat or cap on her head and cover the back of her neck if necessary Keep your child indoors when mosquitoes are most active (sunrise and sunset)Health 705 Keeping baby safeInsect repellent must be used with caution and only if there is a high risk of insect bite complications. For instance, you may decide to use it if your child is allergic to bites or there is a chance she could contract a mosquito -born e disease while travelling abroad. Under 6 months - Do not use any insect repellent. 6 months to 2 years - Icaridin-, DEET-, and soybean oil-based products protect against mosquito bites. Icaridin and DEET also offer protection against ticks. Do not use products containing more than 20% icaridin, 10% DEET, or 2% soybean oil. Apply a small amount once daily to body parts exposed to the air. Do not apply to the face or hands. The product may be applied to your child's hat or cap, depending on the fabric. When protection is no longer needed, wash all skin that was in contact with insect repellent with soap and water.Good to know ... Avoid combination insect repellent/sunscreen products because sunscreen should be applied more generously and more often than insect repellent. Start with sunscreen, wait 30 minutes to let it absorb, then apply the insect repellent to limit its absorption into your skin. Citronella and lavender oil-based repellents as well as citronella-scented eucalyptus products are not recommended for children under 2 because they are not effective for very long.

You will ease into your new role and learn to take care of your baby day by day as you spend more time with her. At first, your daily routine may feel like it's been turned upside down. Schedules are all over the place, the house is a mess, you're trying to get your bearings as a couple, and nothing is the same as before. It's normal\u2014most new parents go through this phase. The adjustment period may last a few months for some, or a few years for others. Talking with other dads If you have the chance, take time to chat with other dads. They've been there. Hearing about their experiences can do you good and help get you through the tougher moments. Talking to someone other than your partner can also help you better understand what you're going through. Some fathers may experience a period of depression after the birth of a baby (see Depression , page 262) . If this happens to you, don't hesitate to seek help right away.Fathers are more and more involved in their children's lives. They want to play a full and active role. For many, fatherhood can be a source of accomplishment and pride. Becoming a father Becoming a father means learning a new role, one that begins during pregnancy and lasts a lifetime. It is a major change that brings great joys\u2014and great challenges! Your experience of becoming a father may vary depending on your situation (see Emotional changes , page 50) . Preparation for the baby's arrival can also vary from person to person, even within the couple. Talking to your partner about your respective expectations and concerns can help your couple adjust to these new realities. 732Family Being a fatherImportance of the father -child relationship Fathers sometimes underestimate their role. Loving, actively involved fathers contribute to their children's well-being and development, strengthening their self-esteem. For exemple this could be done by helping them discover the world through games and books. The presence of a caring father helps his child\u2014boy or girl\u2014to be more confident and to reach his or her full potential. By taking an active role from the moment your child is born, you help create a bond that lasts for the years to come. Developing your relationship with your baby Here are some things you can do to build your relationship with your baby: Take care for your baby, change her diapers, give her a bath, rock her, and put her to sleep Play and do activities with her Show her your affection Talk to other parents about your child, share baby photos with friends, and tell them how proud you are!Family 733 Being a fatherPlaying an active role in organizing family life also strengthens your relationship with your child.

For many dads, the birth of a child is an unforgettable experience. Holding and talking to your baby for the first time makes fatherhood very real all of a sudden. This is also the moment when your couple becomes a family, or your family grows. The father plays an important role during labour and delivery by accompanying and supporting his partner as she gives birth. There are different ways for him to provide support (see Having someone with you during childbirth, page 210) . He can also act as the contact person, keeping family and friends informed. The father needs to pay attention to his own needs and the emotions the birth can trigger.Family 735 Being a fatherAfter the birth Spending time with your newborn allows you to quickly establish a relationship, one that can help you build the attachment bond that's necessary for your child's development. For this to happen, your baby needs to get to know you, and you need to get to know your baby. Find time to be together just the two of you. You can enjoy skin-to-skin contact (see Skin -to-skin contact , page 241) , take her for a walk in the baby carrier or stroller, or give her her bath, for example. Moments like these allow you to develop your own special father-child relationship and gain confidence in your abilities.

You can get involved by teaming up with your partner in a variety of ways. Breastfeeding requires a lot of time and energy from the mother. It can be very rewarding, but also very demanding. If your partner is nursing, you may sometimes feel left out and not very useful. However, there are a number of ways you can help share in the responsibilities around breastfeeding, for example: Bring baby to mom to breastfeed Burp her after she has fed Change her diaper Hold her after she has fed Rock her to calm her or help her to sleep (see Skin -to-skin contact , page 241) . See also The role of the partner , page 180 .If your baby is bottle-fed, these are all equally useful ways of contributing to her care and feeding. You can also get involved when it's time to introduce solid foods. Sharing in your baby's discovery of new foods can be another special moment you enjoy together.Family 737 Being a fatherWorking as a team with your partner One of the challenges of fatherhood is working together with another parent on a daily basis (see Parenting together , page 744) . Exploring this new reality together, supporting each other through the difficult moments, and sharing in the joys and sorrows that come with the birth of a child isn't always easy. Try to be open, present, and attentive to your partner. This can help you adapt to the changes in your relationship and work through this period of transition together. It's also important to try to find time for intimacy. This is often easier said than done in the weeks and months after the arrival of a baby. Give yourselves time and you'll find ways to adjust your private life and your sexuality to your new reality (see Sexuality after birth, page 263) . If people offer to help, accept. You can also ask them to give you a hand. If possible, delegate household chores and some of your meal preparation to family and friends.

If this happens to you, don't hesitate to seek help right away.Becoming a mother The birth of a child is an event like no other. Holding your baby in your arms for the first time can be a deeply moving experience. Becoming a mother can bring great joy, but also new feelings. It's an experience that comes with many questions and new responsibilities. For some, all these changes can be unsettling. Every mother experiences maternity in her own way, depending on her situation. You will gradually learn to be a mother as you gain experience with your baby. You too will grow and change as a parent. For some people, this process may reveal new facets of themselves. You will discover your strengths and find your own way of doing things. The cuddles, smiles, and special moments you share with your baby can help you through the tired times and tough days.740Family Being a motherTaking care of yourself Meeting your baby's needs during the first month's and years of his life is very demanding. But don't neglect your own needs: it's important to eat well, get enough rest, and have fun. You'll find it easier to care for your baby if your own basic needs are met. Put aside tasks that can wait until another day and ask for the help you need. Make sure your needs and expectations are clear.The role of mothers has changed since women entered the workplace in large numbers. Reconciling your new role as a mother with your work, friends, life as a couple, and other aspirations can take a few years. For most mothers, it takes about two years to strike a balance. Give yourself time to grow into your new role. If you are solo parenting, it's also very important to take care of yourself. Don't hesitate to ask your family and friends for help.Family 741 Being a motherTrusting yourself Many new mothers have doubts about their ability to care for their new baby. Are you afraid of being clumsy when giving baby his bath, or not understanding why he cries, or panicking when he comes down with his first fever? Don't worry. Most parents go through the same thing. Your confidence will grow with each passing week as it gets easier for you to understand your child's needs. It will also get easier to plan your baby's routine and organize your time.Don't set the bar too high and ask for advice if you need it.As can be the case during pregnancy and childbirth, you may need professional support. If you feel overwhelmed and unable to manage your everyday activities, seek help from a professional, contact your CLSC or a perinatal resource centre in your area. Despite your doubts, you'll get to know your child better with each passing day. You'll also discover your own strengths and develop your own way of caring for your baby.742Family Being a mother Family 743 Being a mother Maxim RousseauFAMIly 744 Parenting together Caring for your relationship 746 You don't need to be perfect! 747 Cynthia LadouceurFamily 745 Parenting togetherThe birth of a child can bring new meaning to a couple's life. In addition to your relationship as partners, you now have a new relationship as parents: this is what's known as co-parenting. As parents, you share the responsibility for caring for your child and guiding her through the different stages of her growth and development. Together, you will also decide how you go about providing your child with a safe and caring environment. Parents have complementary strengths and preferences. That's why it's good to work as a team! Parenting together isn't just about sharing the duties and chores. It's about recognizing your respective strengths and the contributions you each make to your child's life. Each of you can meet your child's needs and be involved in your own way. And each of you can provide the same care to your baby, but not necessarily in the same way. As parents, each of you needs to step into your role and feel respected and valued in the way you care for and educate your child. This helps strengthen your commitment to your child and to your role as a parent. Talk to your partner about the values and attitudes you consider important in your children's education. Look for common ground when you disagree. Listening to and respecting each other's opinions can help strengthen your relationship as parents, but also as a couple. To be a good team, it's important to recognize each other's needs and strengths.746Family Parenting togetherChildren need love and support, but they also need rules and boundaries. As parents, you provide love and affection, but you also act as educators who set rules. Together, you will learn how to balance these different roles. Keep in mind that children feel safe and secure when parents apply consistent rules. caring for your relationship The arrival of a new baby, with all the attention a newborn needs, means there is less room for your activities as a couple. At times, you may feel like your childcare responsibilities leave no time or space for the two of you. Don't hesitate to go out together or spend a day just the two of you from time to time. Keep on sharing activities and making plans. Have fun together!Try to make room for couple time and intimacy, even if it's not always easy in the months after your baby arrives. Communicating to understand each other better Communication is a good way to take care of your relationship. Pregnancy and the period that follows bring major changes in a couple's life, and both parents need to adapt. It's important to talk about your emotions, concerns, and joys during this period in order to maintain a close bond with your partner. If you face an obstacle or conflict, don't wait to talk about it. Take time to explain your different perspectives and find solutions together. Good communication habits can help you develop a new approach, one where both parents feel valued and respected.Taking care of yourself and your relationship is also beneficial for your child.Family 747 Parenting togetherYou don't need to be perfect! Your role as parents will change over the course of the passing days and the different stages of your child's life. Being a parent is all about learning, making mistakes, and trying again. Don't get discouraged. It's normal to have doubts and to feel awkward and insecure at times. What's more, being a good model for your child also means acknowledging your missteps and mistakes. \"Am I too strict?\" \"Am I stimulating my child enough?\" Parents are always asking themselves questions like these, but there's no \"right\" answer that fits every situation and every child.Many parents feel pressure from family and friends, or the things they see in the media. Even total strangers will sometimes offer parenting advice. Talking with other parents If you have the opportunity, take time to chat with other parents about their experiences. Hearing their stories can do you good and help get you through those tougher moments. Sharing your experiences with someone\u2014without comparing yourself to them\u2014can also help you deal with built-up stress and better understand what you're going through. Most parents like talking about their kids. Feel free to do the same!Every parent, like every child, is different. There's no magic recipe for raising a child.

If you have a blended family, you've already experienced change first hand. The birth of a new child is an opportunity to reconsider everyone's place. There's no right or wrong way of doing things. It's up to you to find out what works for each member of the family. No matter what shape your family takes, adjustments are sometimes necessary for all family members to find their place. Martine Lefebvre To form a strong team, it's important to understand each other's needs. 750Family Growing as a familyreaction of older children A child of any age can be worried about and jealous of the arrival of a new baby in the family. This is a normal reaction. It's important to prepare older children before the birth. Even so, older children may still behave differently for a few weeks. They need time to get used to their new role and to understand that they still have a big place in your heart. M\u00e9lanie Vianna Make sure that friends and relatives show as much interest in the older child as the new baby. A little special attention will make her feel better.Family 751 Growing as a familyYour older child may fall back into earlier behaviour (e.g., bedwetting, thumb-sucking, stuttering, or asking for the breast). Don't blame her\u2014these are normal reactions. Keep showing her tenderness. She'll quickly become attached to the baby. If you give her little chores to do, she'll feel like a \"big\" girl. Tell her what you're doing with the baby and remind her that you did the same for her when she was a little baby. If she wants, sing to her, rock her, and tell her you love her as much as ever. Grandparents Becoming a grandparent is a unique new opportunity to relive a child's first moments. It's also an occasion to witness firsthand the birth of a family. The role played by Grandma and Grandpa in this new family will depend on a host of factors: distance, work, the relationship with the new parents, and the grandparents' desire to be involved. Pregnancy is a good time to talk about the grandparents' new role. Do you want them to be present during the baby's first days? How will they be involved in his education? How can they best help the new parents? 752Family Growing as a familyThe first few weeks will be easier for the new parents if someone else is helping them look after household chores. Home-cooked meals, for example, are a wonderful, heartfelt gift new parents are sure to appreciate. It takes time to build a relationship with a grandchild. Your close and loving attachment, sense of pride, and protective instinct are the foundation for a lifelong bond. Julie Poissant Grandparents may do things differently, and practices have changed a lot since their day This guidebook From Tiny Tot to Toddler can be a very handy tool for sharing the latest recommendations with your child's grandparents. Family 753 Growing as a familyTwins If you give birth to twins, your life during the first few months will revolve around feedings, diapers, baths, and naps. You'll have the same routine as all new parents\u2014times two! You'll also be doubly amazed at how your babies develop from day to day. Even identical twins will probably have different schedules. To make things easier, keep a notebook of each baby's schedule. This will also be helpful to those who come to give you a hand. If friends are looking for gift ideas, why not ask for diapers, home-cooked meals... or a few hours off! You'll very likely need a hand looking after the babies and doing household chores. Seek help from your family, friends, or CLSC. Sophie Cliche Your twins may look alike, but they are two very distinct people. As parents you can encourage each child's own unique character. With time you'll discover what sets them apart. 754Family Growing as a familyEven if you're the very busy parents of twins or triplets, make sure to set aside time for yourself and your significant other. Remember, you're more than just parents! If the weather is good, get out of the house with your babies. This will break the routine and give you the chance to chat with other people. Plus, people are sure to express their admiration at the sight of your twins, making you feel proud and rewarded.

In some situations, it's the parents who notice their baby is different. Regardless of when you learn of a chronic illness, disability, or other persistent problem in your child's life, it can be deeply upsetting. After all, don't all parents-to-be wish first and foremost for a healthy baby? Family 755 Growing as a familyThe need to know Sometimes it's hard to make a definite diagnosis. It can feel like these difficult times of worrying and waiting will never end. Receiving a diagnosis often makes it easier to know the best way to act, but this is not always the case. Your intuition and knowledge of your baby are valuable assets. There are also many advantages to developing a good relationship with all the health professionals dedicated to your baby's well-being. Medicine has come a long way in recent years. It is now sometimes possible to identify the cause of a baby's health problem or deformity. It may be a genetic or metabolic illness, a birth defect , a neurological disorder, or a syndrome. Regardless of whether medicine can help identify the cause of your child's health problem, avoid falling into the trap of needing to blame someone or something. 756Family Growing as a familyAvailable help A baby with health or developmental problems often requires more care and has greater needs. It will take courage and a lot of love on your part. But don't forget that parents also have needs as they learn to adapt. There are support groups to help you come to grips with the situation and your baby's health. Some services may also help you care for your baby. Remember that you just gave birth and still need to rest, despite the emotional strain, errands, appointments, medical investigation, and hospitalizations. Karen Baldwin Forming a bond with your baby is as important for you as parents as it is for him.Family 757 Growing as a familyObtaining a clear diagnosis for your baby is an important step. As soon as you receive a diagnosis, you can put your child on the waiting lists at rehabilitation centres that can help her. Unfortunately, these waiting lists are sometimes long. Various associations provide information and, in some cases, support for families faced with specific health problems. Don't hesitate to ask questions of the health professionals and parents you meet. Services differ from one region to the next. You'll find the resources that suit you best by exploring what's available. The website laccompagnateur.org provides a wealth of practical information that can guide you in your search for information about your \"different\" child. Financial support is available. For information on the Supplement for Handicapped Children provided by the Retraite Qu\u00e9bec, go to page 793 . To learn more about the Child Disability Benefit (CDB), visit canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/child-disability-benefit.html .Free time with your child When you bring a \"different,\" ill, or disabled child into the world, life becomes very action-oriented. You need to take care of him, stimulate him, give him medication, feed him, and so on. All these tasks mean you lack the time and energy to simply be with your baby. \"Being\" with your baby who is different can simply mean spending time massaging him, stroking him, watching him sleep, just looking at him without worrying about his physical care or medication , sharing your sorrow with him, and expressing your love. Forming a bond with your baby is as important for you as parents as it is for him. This contact without any obligation to \"perform an action\" will help you come to grips with and adapt to the situation. 758Family Growing as a familyTaking Baby for a walk Babies need fresh air and light, and they need to get out. A healthy baby can go outside every day, even in winter, as long as the temperature is not too cold (down to about -12\u00b0C) and it's not too windy. She'll be stimulated and distracted, and get plenty of oxygen. Your baby can't tell you if she's cold, so it's very important to keep her extremities\u2014head, hands, and feet, which get cold first\u2014well covered. The first outings should be relatively short: about 20 to 30 minutes. They can gradually get longer, provided your baby is comfortable. Since infants often experience discomfort when exposed to the wind, be sure to use the carriage or stroller hood for protection. When the temperature drops below freezing, do not stay outside too long as your baby runs the risk of frostbite, especially if she is not moving around. Babies don't like hot summer weather and must be kept out of the sun (see Protecting your baby from the sun, page 703) . If it's very hot out (25\u00b0C or more), dress her in only a short, lightweight garment and diaper. Your baby can sleep in her room with the window open. If the temperature is milder, around 21\u00b0C for example, she may enjoy sleeping outside in the carriage with a mosquito net, out of the wind and sun. The carriage needs to be long enough for the baby to stretch out. Babies must always be buckled in and kept under a watchful eye. Baby carriers Babies like to be snuggled up next to their father or mother, even when taking a walk. Baby carriers (front pouches, backpacks, or slings) are convenient, and your body heat and walking motion may well help rock your little one to sleep. However, certain precautions must be taken to avoid injury: Read the manufacturer's instructions to ensure the baby carrier is right for your size and for your baby's age and weight. Family 759 Growing as a family Check that seams, straps, and fasteners are secure. Adjust the straps to keep her head upright and her shoulders and back straight. Make sure that her breathing is not constricted by clothing, a blanket, or the carrier's fasteners. Also make sure her chin is not resting against her chest and her face is not flat against you. Dress your baby properly for winter, but make sure her clothes are not so tight that they cut off circulation. Hold your baby when you bend over. Take extra care when going up and down stairs. Don't use a baby carrier during activities where you could fall, for example, biking or walking on an icy sidewalk. Do not use a baby carrier when cooking, to avoid potential burns. Do not lie down or nap with your child while your infant is in the baby carrier. Front carriers are fun for babies and practical for parents. Pquan Nguyen760Family Growing as a familyOn your bicycle Your baby is ready to ride in a bike seat or trailer once she is At least one year old Able to sit up on her own while wearing a bike helmet By this age her neck muscles are strong enough to support her head and the bike helmet in the event of an accident, and her head is big enough so that the helmet will fit her properly. Make sure your child is seated properly in the bike seat or trailer with the straps adjusted correctly. She should be sitting upright, with her shoulders and head well supported. The bike seat should be equipped with a headrest and leg protectors for maximum safety. Cindy Eng Your child should always wear a helmet, whether she is riding in a bike seat or a trailer. Family 761 Growing as a familyCheck the seat's maximum weight capacity and make sure it is compatible with your bike. If you use a bike trailer, install the safety flag on the back to make it more visible. Be sure to read the recommended safety precautions in the user guide that comes with the bike seat or trailer. Never leave your child in the seat when you're not on the bicycle as it could tip over and injure her. With the extra weight behind you it takes longer for the bike to stop when you brake, so take it easy the first few times out until you get used to the feeling. In the stroller or carriage There are many styles of strollers and baby carriages to choose from. Models that convert from carriage to bed to stroller are practical year-round. Those with reclinable seats are an excellent way to get around. Umbrella strollers are handy but light, and can tip over. Always buckle up the safety harness and keep a close eye on your baby. While it's convenient to hang a few shopping bags from the stroller or carriage handles, be careful not to overload it, which can cause it to tip over. 762Family Growing as a familyFamily activities Most children love being outdoors. Municipalities often offer enjoyable activities at low cost. In summer, many organize free outdoor concerts. Contact your municipal recreation department to find out what's available in your area. Your energy will return once you've adapted to life with your new baby. Many parents then get the urge to get out and do things as a family. This is a good idea! Depending on your energy level, there's no reason you can't continue your usual family activities with the baby. Even very brief outings are beneficial for the whole family. They are a good way to break the sense of isolation you may feel. Try a few short outings as soon as you feel up to it. Take your child outside in a baby carrier or in a stroller in summer or a sled in winter. In summertime, picnics in the park can be a lot of fun. If the weather's bad, seek out indoor activities where you can meet other people. Cindy Eng Ask your friends who have young children about their favourite family activities. Get out and have fun! Family 763 Growing as a familyThere are all kinds of outings you can enjoy with your baby, such as family swim time at the pool, storytelling afternoons at the library, and children's shows. Many libraries offer the free welcome kit \" Une naissance, un livre .\" childcare and babysitting Finding childcare is a key concern for parents wishing to return to work after taking parental leave. For full details on this topic see Childcare services in Qu\u00e9bec on page 784 . If you want to go out alone with your partner, you'll need to entrust your baby to someone else. Choose someone you know or who has been recommended by other parents.If you opt for a teenager, pick one who has experience and has taken a babysitting course. Have the babysitter come for a visit before you leave him or her alone with your child. Watch how your baby reacts to the sitter. Before going out, make sure you leave a phone number where you can be reached and the approximate time you'll be home.

When it comes to clothing, there's no need to buy lots of clothes of the same size because your baby will grow quickly. The size indicated on the tag can be deceiving: even if your baby is only 1 month old, a size 3-month garment may already be too tight. The choice of clothing is often based on the weather. In summer, a diaper and a light garment or undershirt are fine. Dress your baby more warmly if you have air conditioning. In winter, your baby will be very comfortable in pyjamas with feet. Your baby's toes shouldn't be curled up in pyjamas that are too short. Check whether your baby is too hot by touching the back of his neck: it shouldn't be damp. Preparing for the arrival of your baby requires a few necessities. But there's no need to spend a fortune!Family 767 Growing as a familycaring for clothes If your baby has sensitive skin, wash her clothing separately with mild, unscented soap. Rinse the clothes twice to get rid of any trace of soap. Poorly rinsed clothes are often the cause of skin irritations. It's best to wash new clothes before your baby wears them. Watch out for fabric softeners: they can irritate the skin of some newborns.First shoes Babies normally have flat feet until the age of about three. The arch takes shape as the muscles develop. Letting your baby go barefoot in the house and outside in the summer about half the time is excellent for his feet. There's no need for shoes before your baby takes his first steps.768Family Growing as a familyIt's best to take your baby to the store with you when buying him shoes. The shoes should fit properly at the heel and be about 1.25 cm ( 1/2 inc h) longer than your baby's feet. Have your baby stand up so that you can measure the space between his longest toe and the tip of the shoe. You can also measure the inside of the shoe with a measuring tape and compare this measurement with the length of your baby's foot when he's standing. Your baby's first shoes should have a semi-rigid sole. You should be able to bend the front of the sole with slight pressure. Shoes protect the feet and keep them warm. Ankle-high boots offer unnecessary support and are harder to take off. Socks should not squish the toes together. When your child is between the ages of 12 and 36 months, check his shoes regularly to make sure they still fit properly.

It may however be reduced if the recipient has contracted a debt with the Gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec. There is nothing you have to do to receive this financial assistance. After verifying that the mother is a resident of Qu\u00e9bec, the hospital where the children were born sends the required information to the Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 et des Services sociaux using the form provided for that purpose. This is done when you take the babies home. You will receive the financial assistance approximately two months later. In the event of a delay, check with the hospital to ensure that the information was duly sent to the Minist\u00e8re.Useful information 803 Becoming a parent After birthFor more information, contact Services Qu\u00e9bec. credit for childcare expenses Revenu Qu\u00e9bec A portion of your childcare expenses may be reimbursed through the tax credit for childcare expenses.

Becoming a parent After birthFiliation, rights and obligations of parents Filiation Minist\u00e8re de la Justice Filiation is the relationship that exists between children and their parents, whether the parents are of the same or the opposite sex. The relationship can be established by blood or assisted reproduction or by an adoption judgment. Once filiation has been established, it creates rights and obligations for both the child and the parents, regardless of the circumstances of the child's birth. Parents usually establish filiation when their child is born by completing and signing the Declaration of Birth form for the Directeur de l'\u00e9tat civil. Their names and that of their newborn must be entered on the declaration. It is important to complete the declaration carefully, providing all the information requested.All births that take place in Qu\u00e9bec must be declared to the Directeur de l'\u00e9tat civil within 30 days following the birth in order to be entered in the Qu\u00e9bec register of civil status. If you are married or in a civil union, only one parent needs to complete and sign the declaration in order to establish filiation of both parents to the child. The date of your marriage or civil union must be indicated. If you are not married or in a civil union, both parents must sign the declaration in order to establish your respective filiation with the child. For more information, see Entering your child's birth in the Qu\u00e9bec register of civil status , page 796 .Useful information 805 Becoming a parent After birthRights and obligations of parents Minist\u00e8re de la Justice Regardless of whether you are married, in a civil or de facto union or are separated, you have the rights and duties related to the custody, supervision, education, health and safety of your children.

In addition, you are the legal tutors to your minor children (under 18 years of age) and, as such, you must represent them in the exercise of their civil rights and administer their patrimony, including property. For more information on your rights and obligations as parents, contact the Minist\u00e8re de la Justice.

If both parents die or are declared incapable, the child must be entrusted to a dative tutor who will manage the minor's property, in particular. It is therefore recommended that you appoint a dative tutor for any minor children in advance, by means of a will, a protection mandate or a declaration of dative tutorship. The Declaration of Dative Tutorship form can be downloaded from the website of the Curateur public du Qu\u00e9bec. If the father or mother of a minor child is unable to fully carry out his or her responsibilities as legal tutor, he or she may designate a tutor to whom to delegate or assign their responsibilities. This person, known as a suppletive tutor, must be a member of the child's extended family.806Useful information Becoming a parent After birthMinor children with a patrimony Curateur public du Qu\u00e9bec If you have children under the age of 18 who have property and assets, you are responsible, as the children's legal tutors, for the administration of this patrimony. You have an obligation to preserve the value of the patrimony (inheritance, life insurance, indemnities, annuities or any other tangible asset) so that it can be transferred to the children when they come of full age. If you are the parent or suppletive tutor of a child whose property exceeds $25,000, you must inform the Curateur public du Qu\u00e9bec. If both parents are deceased or incapable and you are a dative tutor, you must submit an administration report to the Curateur public, regardless of the value of the child's patrimony (property and assets). For details regarding the administration of a child's patrimony, contact the Curateur public du Qu\u00e9bec.
