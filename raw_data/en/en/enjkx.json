The genome sequence of a virus can reveal mutations that make it unique. Mutations are changes in a genome sequence (usually one-letter changes) and occur naturally over time. Collecting the genome sequences of virus specimens can reveal information about the relatedness of viruses and the similarities shared among groups of viruses. Groups of same-species viruses that share a set of genome mutations are referred to as a lineage. Scientists compare viral genomes to better understand virus transmission, how viruses can spread from person to person. Sequencing also allows Public Health Ocials to monitor viruses involved in outbreaks, characterize outbreaks, detect clusters of cases, and monitor new lineages. Novel mutations can emerge with new lineages and scientists refer to these new lineages as emerging variants. Some of these variants are classied by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as variants of concern and others as variants being monitored, because of their attributes, which, for example, can be increased transmissibility, decreased neutralization by antibodies generated during previous infection or vaccination, or increased severity of disease. The CDC has extensive information about SARS-CoV-2 variant classication (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/variant-surveillance/variant-in fo.html), which is updated as new evidence becomes available. Sequencing can only be performed on samples that contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA, which means only samples used for molecular tests (such as PCR) can be included. Therefore, this report is limited to conrmed PCR-positives only. The genomes that are sequenced and compared are those of the virus, not humans. Sequencing can be performed on stored specimens at any time. Therefore, the dataset used for this report is dynamic and batches of stored specimens that are newly sequenced will be added to the dataset as sequencing occurs. Because of this, trends based on historical data can change over time. The State of Hawaii has conducted sequencing on approximately 8% of positive specimens since testing began, which ranks among the best in the nation according to the CDC (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data- tracker/#published-sars-cov-2-sequences). In February 2021, State Laboratories Division, Hawaii Department of Health increased sequencing eorts done on positive samples to improve the State's ability to detect new variants of concern and variants being monitored early. Since then, approximately 5-30% of samples PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 have been sequenced during any 2-week period (see below for details). 3Acknowledgements This report integrates genomes sequenced since Jan 1, 2021 by: Institution Program/partner Count Percent Laboratory Preparedness and Response Branch, State Laboratories Division5104 79.242% Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National SARS-CoV-2 Strain Surveillance (NS3)243 3.773% Quest Diagnostics Incorporated366 5.682% Laboratory of 307 4.766% Total 6441100.000% Table Notes: The samples sequenced by the CDC in the NS3 program are collected, quality controlled, and shipped to the CDC by the Laboratory Preparedness and Response Branch (LPRB), State Laboratories Division, Hawaii Department of Health County distribution of genomes sequenced by State Laboratories Division since Jan 1st, 2021 Honolulu County Maui County Hawaii County Kauai County unknown Total 3007 692 883 241 281 5104 Table Notes: County information is currently unavailable for a number of samples that are sequenced by the CDC and its commercial partners, as well as Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC). 4Short summary LaboratoryPreparednessandResponseBranch(LPRB),StateLaboratoriesDivision, HawaiiDepartment of Health has sequenced an additional 469 viral genomes since the last variant report was generated (11/23/2021). CDC and its commercial partners have sequenced an additional 74 viral genomes from Hawaii since the last variant report was generated (11/23/2021). Tripler Army Medical center has sequenced an additional 17 viral genomes from Hawaii since the last variant report was generated (11/23/2021). The vast majority of the genomes sequenced (>94%) since the last report belong to the Delta variant. Delta (B.1.617.2 and AY.* sub-lineages) remains the dominant variant globally and sub-lineages of Delta continue to emerge and be classied, including those previously designated as B.1.617.2. Therefore, the distribution of B.1.617.2 may have changed since the previous report due to reclassication to an AY.* sub-lineage. Furthermore, for simplicity, only AY.* sub-lineages with more than 10 genomes sequenced will be outlined in the Tables on the following pages. Otherwise they will be included as \"Other AY.*\" under lineage. 5Signicance of variants of concern and variants being monitored It is important to note that evidence to date shows that vaccination leads to milder cases, not requiring hospitalization, for all variants of concern and variants being monitored that are described here, even if the ecacy of antibodies is diminished against some of these variants compared to the original version of the virus. Also,noneof these variants are classied as a \"variant of high consequence\" , according to CDC variant categories (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/variant-info.html#Consequence), which is a category that would imply a variant has the ability to evade diagnosis, signicantly reduce the vaccines eectiveness and protection against severe disease, signicantly reduce susceptibility to treatments, or lead to more severe disease and increased hospitalizations. Variants of concern (VOC) Delta variant (B.1.617.2 and AY.* sub-lineages) B.1.617.2 was rst identied in India and the World Health Organization (WHO) labeled it \"Delta\" on May 31, 2021. This variant contains the L452R mutation in the spike protein, which has been shown to escape neutralization by monoclonal antibodies and some convalescent sera, as well as a few additional spike mutations predicted to have functional consequences (e.g. T478K). The Delta variant is highly contagious, more than 2x as contagious as previous variants. The Delta variant is also known as variant 21A, 21I, and 21J. For more information about Delta, (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/delta-variant.html). Omicron variant (B.1.1.529 and BA.* sublineages) B.1.1.529 was reported to the WHO on November 24, 2021 and rst detected in specimens collected on November 11, 2021 in Botswana and on November 14, 2021 in South Africa. The WHO named the B.1.1.529 \"Omicron\" and classied it as a VOC on November 26, 2021. The United States designated Omicron as a VOC on November 30, 2021 and reported its rst case on December 1, 2021. Omicron contains more changes in the spike protein than have been observed in other variants, including at least 30 amino acid substitutions (15 of these are in the receptor binding domain), three small deletions, and one small insertion. Several of these mutations, including N501Y and E484K, have been associated with increased transmission and decreased neutralizing activity of convalescent sera for other variants. However, the level of Omicron transmissibility, the severity of illness it causes, or how eective vaccines and therapeutics are against it are still unclear. The Omicron variant is also known as variant 21K. For more information about Omicron, go to (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/omicron-variant.html). Variants monitored (VBM) and Q.* sub-lineages) B.1.1.7 was rst identied in the United Kingdom and the WHO labeled it \"Alpha\" on May 31, 2021. This variant contains the N501Y mutation and a short deletion in the spike protein. This variant is concerning because it has been shown to be signicantly more transmissible (~50%) than the original SARS-CoV-2 lineages and reports from the United Kingdom suggest that B.1.1.7 cases are more likely to require hospitalization. B.1.1.7 does not appear to evade vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody responses. The Alpha variant is also known as variant 20I. 6Gamma variant (P.1 and P.1.* sub-lineages) P.1 was rst identied in Brazil and the WHO labeled it \"Gamma\" on May 31, 2021. This variant also contains the N501Y mutation, like B.1.1.7, but not the deletion in the spike protein. Preliminary studies suggest that antibodies from previous infection or from vaccination may be less eective at preventing infection against this variant. The Gamma variant is also known as variant 20J. Beta variant (B.1.351 and B.1.351.* sub-lineages) B.1.351 was rst identied in South Africa and the WHO labeled it \"Beta\" on May 31, 2021. This variant is highly infectious and can quickly spread from person to person. Preliminary studies suggest that antibodies from previous infection or from vaccination may be less eective at preventing infection against this variant due to presence of the E484K mutation in the spike protein. The Beta variant is also known as variant 20H. Mu variant (B.1.621 and B.1.621.1) Lineage B.1.621 was rst identied in Columbia in January 2021 and it has a couple of mutations in common with the Beta (B.1.351) and Gamma (P.1) variants, which have been associated with high transmissibility (N501Y) and a level of decreased vaccine eciency (E484K). The MU variant is also known as variant 21H. Iota variant (B.1.526) B.1.526 was rst identied in New York and is classied by CDC as a VBM because of indications that it has increased transmissibility. The WHO labeled it \"Iota\" on May 31, 2021. Some of the samples (but not all) of this variant contain the E484K mutation. The Iota variant is also known as variant 21F. Epsilon variant (B.1.429 and B.1.427) The closely related lineages, B.1.429 and B.1.427, were rst identied in California and designated initially as CA VUI1. The WHO labeled them \"Epsilon\" on May 31, 2021. They can quickly spread from person-to- person, with an estimated ~20% higher eciency than the original virus. The CDC has deescalated Epsilon from a VOC to VBM on June 29, 2021, due to the signicant decrease in the proportion of B.1.429/B.1.427 lineage viruses circulating nationally, as well as the available data indicating that vaccines and treatments are eective against this variant. CDC removed B.1.429 and B.1.427 from the VBM list in July 2021 due to declining prevalence. The Epsilon variant is also known as variant 21C. the total number of variants by lineage detected in the State of Hawaii in each 2-week interval ending on the date shown (date represents when the specimen was collected from a patient). Variants of concern shown are Delta (lineages B.1.617.2 + AY.*) and Omicron (BA.1). Variants being monitored shown are Alpha (lineages B.1.1.7 + Q.*), Beta (lineage B.1.351), Gamma (lineages P.1 + P.1.*), and Iota (lineage B.1.526). The gray bar graph (top) shows the percentage of PCR-test positive samples from each 2-week time interval that were sequenced. SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing may not be a random sample of all cases. This graph does not estimate prevalence in the population. Sequencing can be performed on stored patient specimens at any time, so these numbers may change as additional specimens are sequenced. 8Estimate of proportion of variants circulating in viruses sequencedVariant Other Alpha Delta Gamma Beta Iota Epsilon Mu Omicron Figure Notes: The graph shows biweekly percentage estimates of SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in the State of Hawaii, grouped in two-week intervals (based on the date of sample collection). Not all positive SARS-CoV-2 specimens are sequenced and sequenced specimens are not a random selection of all COVID-19 cases in Hawaii. This graph has been generated only counting samples that were selected randomly for the purpose of surveillance, to avoid over-representing the samples that were selected for investigations of clusters. The last 2-week interval numbers will most likely change, as a number of samples that are currently being processed will be added. Sequencing of certain specimens can be delayed for technical reasons. Therefore, the dataset used for this report is dynamic and specimens that are newly sequenced will be added to the dataset as sequencing occurs. Because of this, trends based on historical data can change over time. For the last 2-week period (2021-11-21 to 2021-12-04) in the State of Hawaii, an estimated 98% of the circulating variants were Delta and 2% were Omicron. 9Variants of concern in the State of Hawaii Variant Lineage Area of emergence Cumulative cases detectedEarliest specimen collection dateMost recent specimen collection date Delta 4158 AY.103 United States 897 21 May 2021 01 Dec United States 81007 Jun 2021 01 Dec 2021 AY.25 United States 535 21 Jun 2021 29 Nov 2021 AY.3 United States 38228 Jun 2021 01 Dec 2021 AY.54 United States 320 28 May 2021 21 Nov B.1.617.2 India 17804 Jun 2021 24 Nov 2021 30 2021 11 Oct United States/Mexico11207 Jun 2021 2021 97 Jul 02 Dec AY.117 United States 9015 Jul 2021 09 Nov 72 2021 Africa/Botswana7109 Jul 2021 15 Nov 2021 AY.47 States 64 21 Jul 2021 29 Nov 2021 AY.118 United States 5008 Jul 2021 Oct 2021 States 46 Aug 29 Nov United States 3809 Jun 2021 16 Sep 2021 AY.14 United States 34 24 Jun 2021 17 Nov 2021 AY.46.4 United States 3321 Jun 2021 21 Nov 2021 AY.2 United States 31 01 Jun 2021 19 Aug AY.20 United States/Mexico2810 Jul Africa/Botswana2022 Jul 2021 01 Dec 2021 20 23 Jul 2021 26 Sep 2021 States 1902 Jul Oct Africa/Botswana1513 Jul 2021 24 2021 03 Nov 2021 04 Dec 2021 10Variants being monitored in the State of Hawaii Variant Lineage Area of emergence Cumulative cases detectedEarliest specimen collection dateMost recent specimen collection date Alpha 754 B.1.1.7 United Kingdom 703 21 Jan 2021 14 Aug 2021 Q.3 United States 4921 1916 Feb 2021 22 Sep 2021 Gamma 185 P.1.10 United States 8124 Apr 2021 14 Jul 2021 P.1 Brazil 52 24 2021 21 Jul 2021 Mar Jul Dec 2020 03 Jun B.1.427 California 59 07 Dec 2020 05 Jun 2021 Iota B.1.526 New York 12806 Feb 2021 Jul 2021 Mu B.1.621 Columbia 4303 Jun 2021 17 Sep 2021 B.1.621.1 United States 10 27 May 2021 11 Aug 2021 11Honolulu County the total number of variants detected in Honolulu County in each 2-week interval ending on the date shown (date represents when the specimen was collected from a patient).
