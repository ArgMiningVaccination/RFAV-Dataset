Contact her at erin.e.dahl@state.or.us with questions, comments or suggestions.From sharing his personal story of living with paranoid schizophrenia to training police officers how to interact with people with mental illness, Gary Sjolander spent his career advocating on behalf of patients. On May 12, Oregon State Hospital recognized Sjolander's contributions to both the hospital and to Oregon's behavioral health system by renaming the Empowerment Center after him. Created on the Salem campus 10 years ago with Sjolander's help, the center gives patients a place to attend support group meetings and enjoy the companionship of others while outside the hospital's walls. The dedication ceremony took place on the Empowerment Center lawn and featured several speakers - each of whom expressed their gratitude for Sjolander's (continued on page 4) Gary Sjolander (far left) unveils the sign for the newly dedicated Sjolander Empowerment Center during a community celebration on May 12.Volume 12, Issue 1 June 2016 Dear OSH Team: We're back! After a long hiatus, I'm pleased to release the latest edition of the OSH staff newsletter, the Recovery Times. Edited by the newly reformed Internal Communications Office, the Recovery Times is a tool for sharing information about important topics and celebrating our achievements. Most importantly, the newsletter is a forum for staff to submit their own articles about the important work we do every day. Going forward, we hope to resume our monthly publication schedule. If you are interested in submitting an article or have a story idea, please contact Internal Communications Specialist Erin E. Dahl. Now to the news - Many of you have heard by now that I am retiring at the end of the year. After 43 years in the mental health field, it is time to pass the baton. I look forward to traveling and spending more time with family, especially my three grandchildren. Some people have expressed concern that the hospital will lose momentum without me at the helm. To them, I say that the hospital is well positioned on the path of continuous improvement as we strive to be recognized as the best state psychiatric hospital in the country. In the past six years, we have become a hospital that solves the problems we face. We have worked hard to establish the necessary infrastructure, such as Lean and the Performance System, to stay on track as we transition to new leadership. I like to use the metaphor of the legendary Leonard Bernstein. Most people know that Bernstein was a famous composer and orchestra conductor. However, if you ask them what instrument he played, you'll often get a blank stare. This is because, as a conductor, it didn't matter what instrument he played. What matters was that he was brilliant at getting a large group of people to play the same notes at the same tempo to create beautiful music. So, just like a good conductor, a good hospital administrator brings the right people together at the right time to achieve success. We have made significant improvements 2 Greg Roberts (continued on page 3)Message from the SuperintendentVolume 12, Issue 1 June 2016 during the past six years, but that was not my doing. That was the work of the amazing team we have here at Oregon State Hospital. All I did was stand in the front of the room and wave my arms around a bit. Oregon Health Authority Human Resources is leading the search for my replacement. My hope is that I will have several months to help train my successor before I leave in December. I will share more information with you as it becomes available. I am so proud of all we have accomplished together, and whoever is hired to replace me will be fortunate to lead such an incredible team.3 Sincerely, Greg Roberts SuperintendentDonations Center provides supplies for patients and group activities Need some yarn? Some CDs? How about a puzzle? The OSH Donations Center is here to help. Volunteer Services operates the Donations Center, located in Cottage R20 (behind Cottage R08 on Bates Drive) on the Salem campus. All of the items were donated to Oregon State Hospital, and any staff member can check out the inventory to use for patient care and treatment. The center is open Tuesdays by appointment and Fridays from 9 a.m. to noon for drop ins. Many items are available for treatment groups and other patient activities, such as arts and craft supplies, games, puzzles, bingo prizes, sports and fitness equipment, party decorations and more. The Donations Center also keeps stock of things that meet individual patient needs and interests, including clothing, shoes, lap blankets, reading materials, calendars, games and writing journals - just to name a few. Volunteer Services ensures the safety, quality and appropriateness of all items before making them available in the Donations Center. Volunteer Services tries to keep all of the items listed above on hand; however, the inventory is constantly changing. For more information, contact Volunteer Services Director Jeff Jessel at 503-947-2884 or jeffrey.m.jessel@state.or.us. Close parking is available. Volume 12, Issue 1 June 2016 commitment to the peer recovery movement. More than 100 staff, patients and community members attended the event. \"The Sjolander Empowerment Center is Gary's legacy,\" Superintendent Greg Roberts said. \"He inspires us all to focus on person-centered, recovery-oriented care and treatment.\" During his 27-year career at the hospital, Sjolander worked as its first peer recovery specialist. He also helped the hospital develop a Peer Recovery Services Department, whose staff serve patients by sharing their skills, talents and lived experiences with mental illness. Bridges Program Director Nancy Frantz-Geddes said Sjolander has made a lasting impression on the hundreds of nurses he taught. Through him, they learned about the trauma patients experience when they're held against their will, the problematic side effects of psychotropic medications, and the communication difficulties patients face while they battle internal voices. Sjolander can relate to each of these experiences. Diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia at the age of 22, he is also a former Oregon State Hospital patient. \"With Gary, I listened and I learned,\" Frantz- Geddes said. \"He was always about boundless service and selfless leadership. He made me a better person and a better clinician.\"Sara Westbook, commander of the Portland Police Bureau's East Precinct, described Sjolander as courageous, inspirational and committed to helping others. Because of him, she said countless police officers learned how to positively interact with community members who are mentally ill. \"He changes lives. He changed my life,\" she said. \"He is a role model.\" A husband, father and grandfather, Sjolander said he was just doing his job. More than anything, he wants patients to know there are people like him who look out for their best interests. \"I want to thank all the people who have helped me get to where I am,\" he said. \"This has been an incredible journey.\"4 OSH renames Empowerment Center after Peer Recovery Specialist Gary Sjolander Continued from page 1 Gary Sjolander (right) and Clark Jennings from Butterfly 2 take a moment to reconnect during the Sjolander Empowerment Center dedication ceremony. Volume 12, Issue 1 June 2016 5 By Jeremy Fleener, CPS coachCollaborative Problem Solving makes a difference Almost two years ago, Oregon State Hospital launched Collaborative Problem Solving (CPS), an evidence-based approach for building skills and creating cooperative relationships between staff and patients. CPS gives staff skills to better work with patients and help avoid situations when they have to go \"hands-on.\" So far, more than 800 staff have completed CPS training, and we have hired 16 CPS coaches to partner with staff on the eight pilot units - six in Salem and two in Junction City. Staff and CPS coaches work together to help patients build skills to stay safe and transition out of the hospital. By using a proactive approach to prevent and address challenging behaviors, we hope to reduce the use of coercive interventions and occurrence of injuries for both patients and staff. The preliminary data are already showing significant reductions in aggressive events and the use of seclusion and restraint, and the hospital is currently exploring options to expand CPS hospital wide. In the following article, CPS coach Jeremy Fleener recounts one of the many examples of how CPS is making a huge difference in the lives of our patients. When patients get loud and agitated, staff try to put out the fire immediately to keep people safe. This is what they have been trained to do. In a Harbors unit, there is a large man who hits walls and windows when he's upset. He doesn't do this maliciously. His diagnoses and lagging skills prevent him from responding to his frustrations in an appropriate way. When people go hands on with this guy, it never ends well. Last year, he had been restrained 19 times and put in seclusion 11 times. He had also injured several staff members. My job as a CPS coach is to help staff identify predictable patterns with patients, and with this one, we discovered he typically retreats to his room after punching the walls. Staff would immediately follow him to discuss the problem, and he'd lash out all over again. Together, we decided to try a different approach. Instead of talking to him after an outburst, we planned to give him his space and talk with him later. Not everyone thought this was a good idea, but we all agreed to give it a try. The next time the patient acted out, he went to his room like usual. Staff were waiting nearby, bracing to act. But he stayed in his room and took a nap. Through repetition, we learned to leave the guy alone when he goes to his room, and everyone is the better for it. Since April of last year, this patient's rate of seclusions dropped by 27 percent, and total restraints dropped by half. The proof is in the pudding. Collaborative Problem Solving works.CPS Coach Jeremy Fleener Volume 12, Issue 1 June 2016 Since the Junction City campus opened last year, patients and staff have admired the new building for its light-filled rooms, innovative artwork and colorful walls. Now, thanks to the 2016 Heal Merit Award for health care, the building's interior design is receiving worldwide acclaim. \"This makes me proud,\" said Lindsey Sande, deputy chief nursing officer for the Junction City campus. \"It validates that mental illness is just as important as medical illness, and that our patients have the same rights to be in a beautiful place while they recover.\" A renowned industry award, the Heal Merit competition evaluated entries based on originality, finishes and furnishings. Of the 95 submissions, the International Interior Design Association chose 18 winners representing numerous categories. Jodie Jones, former administrator for the Oregon State Hospital Replacement Project, said a lot of thought went into making the campus both beautiful and functional. That's why she and her team took care in choosing the colors, textures and layout for the 219,000-square-foot campus. \"Many of our patients call this place home for a long time, so we wanted to create a warm and therapeutic environment for them,\" she said. The design of the campus includes two internal courtyards that provide natural daylight and outdoor views from within the facility. Walls were painted with colors found in nature, with 6 Junction City campus wins interior design award Volume 12, Issue 1 June 2016 7 sea blue and grassy green on the unit floors and a deep, autumn red in the lobby. The lobby also features delicate wood-slat panels on the walls to provide visual warmth, subtle layers of privacy and noise control. Art plays a prominent role in the project's design, thanks in large part to Oregon's Percent for Art legislation. Per state law, when state buildings cost more than $100,000 to construct, 1 percent of the budget is set aside for original artwork. One of the Junction City showpieces is an etched-glass window wall in the hospital's entranceway. Poems, statements and memories from patients at the Salem campus were written on the \"Wall of Words\" to inspire and encourage visitors. Most of the other art installations are located within the secure perimeter - including \"Rain\" in the Prairie Quad and \"Cloud\" in the Valley Quad. Thomas Murphy of Forest 2 says he appreciates many aspects of the interior design, from the ample natural light to the giant activity room.Describing the space as unofficial and non-assuming, he says it's had a calming effect on him and other patients. \"We really see that they care,\" he said about how the staff helped with the design. \"They made it into a home.\" For Jones, the award is something for which the entire Junction City community can take ownership. They fought hard for the hospital's construction, and they recognized the value of housing patients in a beautiful and serene environment. \"This is a refuge,\" she said. \"By giving our patients an inviting space where they can relax and be comfortable, they can heal and start the next phase of their lives.\" Volume 12, Issue 1 June 2016 8 Six OSH employees learn new skills through Leadership Academy (From left to right) Corrie Gordon, Aaron Baer, Angie Moreno, Sera Miller, Anthony Cornell, Jeremy Fleener and Anna Dyer were honored as part of the Leadership Academy 2015-2016 graduating class on May 11. Six Oregon State Hospital Employees improved their leadership skills through the 2015-16 Leadership Academy. Sponsored by the Oregon Health Authority and the Oregon Department of Human Services, the academy enables state workers to engage in a series of trainings to improve their strategic thinking, team building and negotiation skills. The participants were honored at a graduation ceremony in the Department of Human Services building on May 11. Among the 37 class members, the six hospital employees are Aaron Baer, admissions director; Anna Dyer, licensed clinical social worker; Jeremy Fleener, Collaborative Problem Solving coach; Corrie Gordon, lead social worker for the Pathways/Bridges programs; Sera Miller, Lean leader with the Office of Performance Improvement; and Angie Moreno, interim Bridges treatment mall manager. The graduating class also honored their peers with several awards. Fleener was named \"Most Inspiring Leader,\" and Miller was named \"Most likely to be a future DSH/OHA director.\" All Leadership Academy members took part in projects geared to improve their workplaces. Through their \"Building Immunity to Traumatic Exposure (BITE)\" project, Fleener, Miller and Baer helped develop and test a workforce survey and create web-based training. Their goal was to promote workforce awareness and education about vicarious trauma, compassion fatigue and occupational burnout - conditions often experienced by health care workers who serve traumatized populations. The survey and web training will be made available to both OHA and DSH staff. Moreno, Dyer and Gordon helped develop a portfolio that allowed a guilty-except-for-insanity subpopulation of the hospital track its treatment accomplishments and goals. The portfolio, much like a college transcript, helps patients participate in their treatment plans and chart their progress as they prepare to reenter the community. If successful, the project could be scaled up to include other hospital populations. Volume 12, Issue 1 June 2016 The Employee Recognition Committee would like to congratulate the latest recipients of the Team Recognition Award. Beginning last spring, the committee stopped giving monthly awards in favor of recognizing one group who represent the following categories each year: Inspiring Hope, Promoting Safety, Supporting Recovery, Improving Quality and Innovating. The list is longer than usual, as the Recovery Times has been on hiatus since last summer. Additional updates are expected for the July issue of the newsletter. Promoting Safety Recipient: Swing Shift Environmental Services Team Nominating Manager: Dusty Charters, RN, director of Risk Management Team members: Fidel Romero (supervisor), Manuel Cervantes, Socorro Gutierrez, Lewis Byrd, Steve Long, Paul Millan, Charles Horton, Michael Shaffer, Tamie Combs, Patrick Nelson, Justin Knight, Joey Martin, Erich Stephenson and Erich Camin The cottages experienced a power outage a year ago in March. To prepare for the possible relocation of patients, the Environmental Services Team rushed to prepare Flowers 3 for occupation. By providing a clean and safe environment for patients during the potential emergency, the team demonstrated innovation and initiative. Supporting Recovery Recipient: Collaborative Problem Solving Team Nominating Managers: Nicole Mobley, Will Newbill and Derek WehrTeam members: Shelley Davidson, Randy Davis, Jeremy Fleener, Tim Hanson, Jeff Hodson, Katie Hurckes, Brant Johnson, Joel Pyle, Ryan Stafford, Herschel Underwood The Collaborative Problem Solving Team implemented the new treatment approach on four units throughout the hospital, working with staff to change how they interact with patients during difficult situations. As a result, communication and trust between the two groups began to improve. Adopting CPS shifted the units' culture to the point where the use of seclusion and restraints has significantly reduced.9 Collaborative Problem Solving Team (continued on page 10) Team recognition: April through December 2015 Volume 12, Issue 1 June 2016 10 Team recognition: April through December 2015 Continued from page 9 Improving Quality Recipient: Junction City Treatment Mall Planning Team Nominating Managers: Laurie Burke, associate chief of psychologyTeam members: Billy Hatch, Elizabeth Rife, Shaunia Scales, Nikki Fountain, Sharon Martin, Fawna Roberts, Kimberly Schlosser-Vixie, Jesse Whitson, Whitney Byrd, Lori Page-Kenworthy Through feedback from patients and staff, the team developed a faster, more efficient and more responsive way to conduct treatment mall planning. The team cut the planning process from 13.5 weeks to 7.5 weeks, and it established a system in which patients could help form treatment groups. The team also created consistency across all units by formalizing how patients engage with scheduling. The group's engagement, enthusiasm and reliability contributed to a new planning process much more focused on patients' needs. Innovating Recipient: JC Food and Nutrition Services/Treatment Mall Nominating Managers: Howard Davis-SalyerTeam members: Jason Gillium, Kelli Wilson, Angela Karnohan, Damion Alonso, Anita Snyder, Alicia Westfall, Wendy Compton, Erica Johnson, Kara Joers, Billy Hatch, Angela Poirier Team members developed three, separate offerings that demonstrate innovation. Through one program, patients worked with chefs to buy, prepare and serve fresh produce. They also learned job skills related to sanitation and safety, customer service and cash handling, and hands-on food production. Through two other occasions, team members organized family-dining events on Veterans Day and Thanksgiving to help patients improve their social and communication skills. Junction City Treatment Mall Planning Team Junction City Food & Nutrition Services Volume 12, Issue 1 June 2016 11 OSH is top fund raiser for NW NAMI Walk for fifth straight year For the fifth straight year, the Oregon State Hospital team was the top fund raiser for the NW NAMI Walk. The annual walk, which raises both money and awareness of mental illness, supports the Oregon chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), the country's largest grassroots mental health organization. The hospital's team raised more than $15,000 for the cause, with both patients and staff participating in the Portland-based event on May 15. Oregon Health Authority Director Lynne Saxton and her husband Ron also attended to show their support. This year, NAMI reported 1,872 participants, who raised more than $190,000. Proceeds go to NAMI Oregon's regional affiliates, which provide advocacy and education services for people with mental illness and their families. This includes NAMI Lane County, which has a satellite office at the hospital's Junction City campus. Proudly displaying their banner, the Oregon State Hospital team raised more than $15,000 for the annual NW NAMI Walk in Portland on May 15. Oregon Health Authority Director Lynne Saxton and her husband Ron were among the 4,000 people who showed their support at the NAMI Walk in Portland. (continued on page 12) Volume 12, Issue 1 June 2016 12 Oregon State Hospital and NAMI are strong partners in supporting both patients and their families. \"This was an opportunity to celebrate our cause and everything we've gone through together,\" said Chris Bouneff, NAMI executive director. \"In our world, we're used to fighting and advocating for what everyone deserves. But on this day, we're only fighting for awareness.\" Dr. Brian Little, chief of medicine, has organized the OSH team for the past five years. For him, the walk is an opportunity to educate people about the hospital's mission of providing hope, safety and recovery for the people it serves. \"We need to bring awareness of mental illness to the forefront,\" he said. \"That's really what this is all about.\" Josh Shaddon and Jesse Odam, both part of Bridges, the hospital's community-transition program, joined the walk to address the stigma surrounding mental illness. Too often, they said people don't seek help because they're afraid of what others may think. \"I didn't get the help I needed,\" Shaddon admitted. \"That's why it's important for me to help other people now. It means everything to me.\" According to NAMI, about one in five adults nationwide - or 43.8 million people - experience mental illness in any given year. Additionally, about one in 25 adults - or 10 million people - experience a serious mental illness that substantially interferes or limits one or more major life activities. Jerilyn Klingenberg, an art therapist who participated in the walk, isn't surprised by the statistics. Through fundraisers like this one, she said people coping with a mental illness can make their voices heard. \"They need to know that everything will be OK and that there are people they can talk to,\" she said. \"They need understanding.\" OSH is looking for a champion to take over for Dr. Little and lead next year's team. To learn more, contact Dr. Little at brian.little@state. or.us or 503-947-9954. For more information about NAMI and its Oregon affiliates, visit NAMI.org. Continued from page 11 Staff and patients were all smiles during the NW NAMI Walk last month, which helped educate community members about mental illnesses. OSH is top fund raiser for NW NAMI Walk for fifth straight yearVolume 12, Issue 1 June 2016 NUTRITION SERVICES DEPARTMENT By Cary Fardal, RDN, LD and Juliana Pearl-Beebe, RDN, LD The Nutrition Services Department consists of a small group of dedicated nutrition professionals, including a chief clinical dietitian, several clinical dietitians and a dietetic technician. Our role is to conduct clinical nutrition assessments, provide education services, assist with menu development, and give final approval of the nutritional content for our patient menus. We strongly believe in the connections between mind and body, and between mood and food. This is why we promote a holistic and comprehensive view of food's role in health, wellness and lifestyle. Through our efforts, we support the hospital's mission of providing hope, safety and recovery for the people we serve. HopeMembers of the Nutrition and Food Services team have invested their time and energy to provide our patients with healthy, evidenced-based diets they will enjoy. We also teach them about the connection between nutrition and wellness, giving them hope that they can better manage their eating habits after they're discharged back into the community. Safety & Recovery A healthy diet promotes recovery. In recent years, the parameters and requirements of our menu have changed in accordance with the OSH Diet Manual approved by the hospital's medical department. These changes have allowed the hospital to develop a menu that adheres to the diet manual and the nutritional needs of nearly 95% of our patients. These changes have significantly reduced the need for \"diet trays\" and other, more restrictive meal plans commonly used in the past. By helping our patients keep a balanced diet, we substantially lower their risk of developing chronic, preventable diseases. We also help them improve their mood balance and physical wellness, which is key to effective mental health recovery. Nutrition Services is here to help. If you know a patient who has a nutrition risk, or if you have questions about the menu, please contact us at Dietitians@dhsoha.state.or.us. If you need to speak to a dietitian about an immediate nutrition concern, call the On-Duty Dietitian Phone at 503-602-7141 between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. daily. SUPPORTING HOPE, SAFETY, AND RECOVERY13 Members of the Nutrition Services Department. Volume 12, Issue 1 June 2016 14 Junction City patients create new Valley Quad sensory garden For the first time in a long time, Tammy Dillard feels empowered. People want to hear her ideas, and they care about what she has to say. That's why she knows the new Valley Quad sensory garden will be a safe and comfortable place for both patients and visitors. \"This makes me feel so proud,\" said Dillard, a plant lover on Forest 2. \"I love gardening so much. It helps me thrive.\" Holly Kyniston of Mountain 1 eagerly selects some plants from the greenhouse to plant in the new sensory garden. Oregon State Hospital places third in national leadership excellence award Oregon State Hospital's (OSH) nurse leadership program won third place in the 2016 Leadership Excellence Awards' category for Best Innovation in Deployment of Leadership Programs. The hospital's program, called Leadership Encouragement and Development (LEAD!), was designed to identify new leaders within the Nursing Department and help managers develop the skills they need to become great leaders. Oregon State Hospital competed against 300 other organizations from around the world, including some Fortune 500 companies.Winners in the Best Innovation in Deployment of Leadership Programs category were chosen based on survey responses from each program's participants and the rating they gave in each survey category. LEAD! scored a 4.7 out of a possible 5 points. LEAD! participants included 42 nurse managers, supervisors and directors. In 2015, they met once a month for leadership workshops on concepts such as coaching, giving and receiving feedback, and building successful relationships with different personality types. Participants also completed a final project that contributed to the hospital's continuous improvement efforts. Superintendent Greg Roberts and Angela Nielsen, supervising RN, at the LEAD! graduation ceremony. Volume 12, Issue 1 June 2016 15 Dozens of patients like Dillard played key roles in planning and designing the new sensory garden on the Junction City campus, which is scheduled to open in late June. Featuring scented plants, picnic tables, sunshade shelters and benches, the space is expected to promote well-being and recovery. \"It's exhilarating to watch our clients inspired by free choice and creative expression,\" said Deirdre Jackson, an institutional teacher who helped organize the project. \"They're working hard to make this into a place of serenity and peacefulness.\" Through a sensory garden class, staff and patients began brainstorming ways to improve the outdoor area near the Valley Caf\u00e9 last winter. They learned how different plants can stimulate the senses, and they sketched ways to transform the flat, sun-scorched plot into a lush oasis. Some of those ideas began to take effect in April. Soon, the sensory garden will include mounded areas of flowers, strawberries and herbs. Kitchen staff will use some of the plantings to brew tea and flavor meals, and plans are in the works to install a path with paver stones and a therapeutic water feature. For Justin Pina of Forest 2, the Valley Quad improvements couldn't have come soon enough. Not only do they help him connect with nature, they evoke feelings of happiness and calm. \"Before, the Valley Quad had no shade. There was nothing good to look at, and it felt dull,\" he said. \"But now, it feels more inviting, and that makes living at the hospital much easier.\" Sean Kelley agrees. A resident on Mountain 2, he convinced staff to include berry bushes in the garden. For him, the renovated space reminds him of the beauty waiting for him outside the hospital's walls. \"It definitely brings me to a brighter side of life while I'm out there,\" he said. \"Seeing nature makes me feel closer to home.\" Keith Wilson of Forest 2 enjoys designing the new sensory garden, which is scheduled to open later this month. Planting is underway for the new sensory garden on the Junction City campus, which will include mounded areas of flowers, strawberries and herbs.

OSH sets record at state employee food drive Through more than 40 activities and events, Oregon State Hospital employees set a fundraising record during the Governor's State Employees Food Drive in February. Together, the Junction City and Salem campuses raised $25,124, which provided local food banks with 100,500 pounds of food. Employees also collected more than 1,000 pounds of nonperishable foods from on-site collection barrels. \"This campaign is all about caring and giving, and OSH staff band together to make it happen,\" said Jeff Jessel, director of Volunteer Services. \"It's awesome that so many people took their personal time and money to prepare food, gifts, baked goods, crafted items and much more for the campaign.\" Through the annual event, Oregon State Hospital has generated more than $174,000 and 800,000 pounds of food for local food banks during the past 11 years.
