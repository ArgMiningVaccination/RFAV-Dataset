The good news is that a heavy metal detox can remove these contaminants from your body and minimize their impact on your health. Chelation, a controversial heavy metal detox procedure in which metals are purged from the body, usually by way of an intravenous administration of certain drugs, has been touted as a miracle cure for many ailments. Its effectiveness as a treatment, however, has come under much scrutiny. It may be harmful, so it's a good idea to talk with your doctor if you're considering it. In the meantime, there are some less extreme steps you can take to reduce the amount of these heavy metals in your body. Fish, especially ones that live for a long time, absorb mercury from the water. Larger fish, such as tuna and swordfish, tend to have higher levels of mercury.

He or she can guide you to more specific heavy metal detox treatments, if warranted. The herb [cilantro](http://blog.gaiam.com/cilantro-lime-chicken-with-mango/), also known as coriander, has been found to be a natural chelating agent \u2014 and one that doesn't have to be administered intravenously. \"Cilantro chelation\" typically calls for a small amount of fresh cilantro, which can be made into a pesto sauce and eaten over pasta or toast, consumed each day for a few weeks. But you may want to discuss it with your doctor first, especially if you take medications or have a health condition. There are more dietary steps you can take to rid yourself not only of heavy metals but other toxins, as well.
