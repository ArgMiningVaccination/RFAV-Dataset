It arises as a need of the heart, of the life of feeling; and it can be justified only inasmuch as it can satisfy this inner need. He alone can acknowledge Anthroposophy who finds in it what he himself in his own inner life feels impelled to seek. Hence only they can be anthroposophists who feel certain questions on the nature of man and the universe as an elemental need of life, just as one feels hunger and thirst.\" -Rudolf Steiner, Anthroposophical Leading Thoughts \"When Rudolf Steiner founded Anthroposophy (a wisdom of the human being) in the early part of [the 20th] century, his intention was not to create a new sect or cult - of which we have hundreds today, some highly dangerous - but to initiate a new striving for spiritual truth which, with its detailed methodology and empirical, experiential basis (as opposed to simple faith or belief) was in the tradition of the scientific thinking of his time. In this sense he described Anthroposophy as a science of the spirit. And thus he strove - in the face of the profound materialism of the time - to communicate his knowledge of the spirit not through a vague mysticism, but in a form that could be understood with clear human thought.\" -Sevak Gulbekian, At the Grave of Civilization?
