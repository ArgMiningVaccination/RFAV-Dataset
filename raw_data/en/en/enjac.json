Read and 4%-8% of women of reproductive age and is a common cause of estrogen receptor modulator that induces ovarian stimulation, and has traditionally been the first-line therapy for infertility in this patient population. More recently, other treatments such as metformin and aromatase inhibitors have been evaluated, but these agents have not consistently been shown to be superior to clomiphene for fertility outcomes. A new randomized trial compared the safety and efficacy of the aromatase inhibitor letrozole to clomiphene for treatment of infertility in 750 women aged 18-40 years with PCOS. Included women had 1 patent fallopian tube and normal uterine cavity, a male partner with a sperm concentration 14 million sperm/mL, and mutual agreement with their partner to have regular intercourse during the study period. Women received either letrozole 2.5 mg/day orally vs. clomiphene citrate 50 mg/day orally on cycle day 3 for 5 days and for up to 5 menstrual cycles. The live birth rate was 27.5% for women receiving letrozole vs. 19.1% for those receiving clomiphene (p = 0.007, NNT 12), with no significant differences between groups in the rates of congenital anomalies in live births, pregnancy loss, or twin pregnancy. Compared to clomiphene, letrozole was associated with a significantly decreased frequency of hot flushes, but significantly increased frequency of fatigue and dizziness. Previously unpublished data from this trial are contained within a recent Cochrane review of 26 randomized trials evaluating letrozole in women with anovulatory PCOS. This review found that letrozole was associated with increased live birth and pregnancy rates compared to clomiphene citrate, with the improvement in live birth rate primarily being driven by this new trial ( [Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2014 Feb 24;(2):CD010287](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001guxJCbCdcGhuGW5fIeBm3wDSoG39MWOdnWvl26QwW68Akud6dLSjmYlFsNNiYfvOJxlN9JoF4VBbQEGJs_Wrd9TCj5F6RildcFNzGsWljJidUtf7LoJZf7J-ESa6fQGAopxS53krtVbkrucUUHLfrUIShYTQwUV4A9XLAjPNmA-zB7EiygGGGx88_lN04RvlmKplug4zCkU=&c=kBQi1bVINYgUMbxnw2jFci8Cm3Lk0GdhwGZjbBsWMordR39GPvSxDA==&ch=9cmVgU-ZqiGjVMLUXJf86zDZfclh73xRaqbLdwLnezesD77CJ0JW3Q==)). In addition, the data from this trial have been incorporated into a new guideline by the Endocrine Society, which reviewed an earlier conference abstract of these data.

There has been conflicting evidence for the benefit of antibiotic prophylaxis in reducing recurrent symptomatic UTIs in this patient population. A previous systematic review demonstrated lower rates of recurrent symptomatic UTI in favor of antibiotic prophylaxis, but these results were not statistically significant ( [Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2011 Jun 15;(6):CD001532](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=0013Ip-jGA7U6J9H0DACQuH4tWh41ZDVgKyLaAEmk9yvK_zoNKzS3iTYUmRqIBXjXh5xMdA9Mzx1bG4dEETDAVyqRFdLzNexQpeDISgSJKhYY3qqsHdauKQkpK6sgF-AJxaTqpuc5yaKSaRyHX9sD6YPGHbSU69rDyWheX31NyAG259q0P27s9ja2mhctm3OovQYno_g2hvcBc=&c=DohOk1WrF_htOK65FRgRAyoW47_D0xDElLjSiCsdZfS4954FrZ-gFQ==&ch=KjgG19joN-nDS5sPTfi1Mu_K98yx7QoA2EKox_FQP9kr6IdruZ_UTA==)). In addition, a separate meta-analysis found benefit for antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with high-grade VUR, although these results also did not reach statistical significance ( [Pediatrics 2011 Sep;128(3):595](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=0013Ip-jGA7U6J9H0DACQuH4tWh41ZDVgKyLaAEmk9yvK_zoNKzS3iTYUmRqIBXjXh5I0Q8Sfnfu0dqyiQPRhYDD0Q4vXBMFUgMJOZHLwJN_Pxd-m-aJJHhOrBrsOFiwTiD3APob1K1R401-vRZuO0w2NvDRXveRenBHLp-mte035VvnngxpiYXmIcER-JVdMfoFW3XDpp5JuM=&c=DohOk1WrF_htOK65FRgRAyoW47_D0xDElLjSiCsdZfS4954FrZ-gFQ==&ch=KjgG19joN-nDS5sPTfi1Mu_K98yx7QoA2EKox_FQP9kr6IdruZ_UTA==)). The largest trial included in the systematic review and meta-analysis was a high-quality randomized trial aimed at preventing recurrent urinary tract infections (also including some children without VUR). This trial did show a reduction in recurrent symptomatic UTI at 1 year in patients receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, but the results were not statistically significant in the subgroup of children with VUR ( [N Engl J Med 2009 Oct 29;361(18):1748](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=0013Ip-jGA7U6J9H0DACQuH4tWh41ZDVgKyLaAEmk9yvK_zoNKzS3iTYUmRqIBXjXh5RNEf0XbhrK-HXQFpcZs8hQaF08nfzKB4Rd1PGJqesaz6td1MIz2xNjTGSntwJGv475fxyYFVrdYoxqWoveviu8fGwFNPygQBXrHkyGLMKUEua4LglJm1snAtRAGEh5dXNA8ioen296E=&c=DohOk1WrF_htOK65FRgRAyoW47_D0xDElLjSiCsdZfS4954FrZ-gFQ==&ch=KjgG19joN-nDS5sPTfi1Mu_K98yx7QoA2EKox_FQP9kr6IdruZ_UTA==)). To help resolve this uncertainty, a recent randomized trial evaluated antibiotic prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in 607 children aged 2-72 months with I-IV Children randomized to trimethoprim 3 mg/kg/day plus sulfamethoxazole 15 mg/kg/day orally vs. placebo and followed for 2 years. VUR was identified using voiding cystourethrogram, and 46.5% had grade III-IV VUR. All children had 1-2 previous urinary tract infections with fever 38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F), or UTI symptoms within 24 hours before or after urine collection. Follow-up data were available for 509 children (84%) at 1 year and 520 children (86%) at 2 years. Renal scarring was assessed with dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years. At baseline, resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in index UTI was present in 20% of the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs. 22% of the placebo group. Treatment failure was defined as any of 2 febrile UTIs, 1 febrile UTI plus 3 symptomatic UTIs, 4 symptomatic UTIs, or new or worsening renal scarring at 1 year. The rate of recurrence of febrile or symptomatic UTI at 2 years was 12.9% with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole vs. 23.6% with placebo (p < 0.001, NNT 10). Treatment failure occurred in 5% with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole vs. 9.6% with placebo (p = 0.04, NNT 22). The proportion of patients with both a recurrent febrile or symptomatic UTI and resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was 9% in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs. 5% in the placebo group. The rate of renal scarring was 11.9% with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole vs. 10.2% with placebo (not significant). This new trial is the first to clearly show a reduction in the recurrence of febrile or symptomatic UTI in children with VUR receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to placebo. However, the trial also showed numerically higher rates of resistance to the antibiotic at 1-2 years, and the long-term effects of this need to be considered. Several previous trials have failed to show statistically significant benefit for antibiotic prophylaxis in reducing recurrent febrile or symptomatic UTI in children with VUR, but these most recent data may tilt the balance in favor of prophylaxis in this patient population.

A new evidence-based clinical practice guideline by the American College of Physicians (ACP) found that the harms outweigh the potential benefits, and recommends strongly against screening pelvic examinations in asymptomatic nonpregnant adult women. The guideline included a systematic review of English-language studies published from 1946 to 2014 to determine the best current evidence for the diagnostic accuracy, benefits, and harms of the screening pelvic examination for detection of cancer, pelvic inflammatory disease, or other benign gynecologic conditions. For cancer detection, across 3 cohort studies with 5,633 asymptomatic women, only 4 cases of ovarian cancer were detected by pelvic examination. And in a randomized trial evaluating screening for ovarian cancer with transvaginal ultrasonography and CA-125 in 78,000 women, the bimanual pelvic examination was dropped after 5 years because no cancer was detected solely by this examination. The ACP is clear in distinguishing the pelvic exam from cervical cancer screening using visual inspection and swabs for cervical cytology, and cervical cancer screening can be completed without a bimanual pelvic examination. No studies were identified that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy or benefits of pelvic examination for asymptomatic pelvic inflammatory disease, benign conditions, or gynecologic cancer other than cervical or ovarian cancer. Harms identified for the pelvic examination included pain or discomfort reported by 11%-60% in 8 studies with 4,576 women, and fear, embarrassment, or anxiety reported in 10%-80% in 7 studies with 10,702 women. Women experiencing pain or discomfort during their examination were less likely to have a return visit than those not experiencing pain or discomfort in 5 of 5 studies reporting this outcome. Many aspects of routine care are based on established practice, and have not been subject to rigorous assessment or review. For cancer in particular, there has been a focus in mainstream health messaging that early detection is vital, and many people may not understand that screening carries potential harms that must be weighed against the proposed benefits and may not understand that some of our standard approaches can have little or no efficacy for providing early detection that leads to clinical benefit. This is the first evidence-based guideline evaluating screening pelvic examination in this patient population, and the recommendation against this practice will have an important impact on annual wellness visits for a very large number of women.

Patients with persistent burdensome pain may have endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to identify another pathology or to assess potential sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, and some of these patients may also have subsequent sphincterotomy, though this procedure has not been shown to be beneficial in the absence of abnormal imaging or lab findings. A recent randomized trial compared sphincterotomy to sham surgery in 214 adults (92% women) with unexplained abdominal pain after cholecystectomy. The trial included patients with unexplained abdominal pain for > 3 months after cholecystectomy and no prior sphincter intervention. All patients had ERCP prior to randomization. Patients were randomized to sphincterotomy (141 patients) vs. sham surgery (73 patients) and followed for 1 year. A total of 99 patients with elevated pancreatic sphincter pressure in sphincterotomy group were further randomized (single) sphincterotomy vs. biliary and pancreatic (dual) sphincterotomy. Treatment success was defined as < 6 days of disability due to pain without narcotic use or further sphincter intervention for 3 months. The rate of treatment success at 1 year was 23% with sphincterotomy vs. 37% with sham (p = 0.01). There were no significant differences between sphincterotomy and sham groups in need for repeat ERCP intervention (37% vs. 25%) or rate of pancreatitis (11% vs.15%). In addition, there were no significant differences in treatment success comparing single vs. dual sphincterotomy in the subgroup of patients with elevated pancreatic sphincter pressure. The management of unexplained postcholecystectomy pain can be frustrating for both the patient and their physicians, and data supporting current diagnostic options or treatment approaches are limited. The findings of this trial show that sphincterotomy does not reduce pain-related disability in patients with unexplained abdominal pain after cholecystectomy. About 12% of patients overall had pancreatitis following ERCP, consistent with previous data suggesting increased risk of both pancreatitis and perforation with this procedure ( [N Engl J Med 1996 Sep 26;335(13):909](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=0016hoLjERf_8sBk5kD-pW2fXQ7tdOIMaavrBnwGl9l79pggTperNg5nt4_B1VMUtqxc6SCZU9ZS88fegZHT7_BDylhxLDakuiZhQUxy6wVhY3Vkqx4OGp46h9c_5qbFbDdu5kTIpWWmrUQou7RrtnYRGKDtIGWIl_dbD-zGHuEahCoenI5GNtdFJTEMUwrAK_Oqua6MpAk8Tw=&c=CtU6tzDfVVO4trGrP0oK-sEglsx55v52pzXuaJLf43ihafrE7BdzLA==&ch=m62MVGomJ_Gt8j9Z7SIr-URjvZBxS3FUlcEGtrXwCmLiy7repP3fEw==) [full-text](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=0016hoLjERf_8sBk5kD-pW2fXQ7tdOIMaavrBnwGl9l79pggTperNg5nt4_B1VMUtqxUbQgDOkX_Gkm3CENvcDOknrKnXbG37S14IRHOTeqjpuwf1RRRO5DgZqUYoRtaOGpLtSGHzFF4V0YJIA5e8jGSje6yhAI8ng40Fx4cGqq9pzne9E06CavqBKKKUoAneVJjhzz07zocF5ddSPok3Hn_jLx3MJRmuWa&c=CtU6tzDfVVO4trGrP0oK-sEglsx55v52pzXuaJLf43ihafrE7BdzLA==&ch=m62MVGomJ_Gt8j9Z7SIr-URjvZBxS3FUlcEGtrXwCmLiy7repP3fEw==)).

A recent population-based study in the United States estimated that there were 496 clinically diagnosed skin or soft tissue infections per 10,000 person-years, which translates to more than 15 million new cases annually in the U.S. ( [BMC Infect Dis 2013 May 30;13(1):252](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001UhTFziNiKPPMMPLV2UoIX0AMjt47VoNqWkQBMkuHPGYC1GVX1-_IDaSp2guwpxG4HLJKohZggArvXReqWrLo1sW-KF-fKRMpXKWHB1e9GOnO0kpwmLrKyVWNxf1tLbl_tZ1OCNiMxK9aeUWIaKCQMVFUsYqLweCx-ApYkAq9WwiJod8HWFRg48X6MJU45mumXNo465Z1s-c=&c=jw0xWm17LuOp4LpYeDxdlxZxuhgpEbAYxR9K94eGXo7eJ72f5Jl-oQ==&ch=M_kLq4K2eIUl4j175mecGHBx5C9kQJjUBJOw0LH5n2nISyWKQxF6Ag==) [full-text](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001UhTFziNiKPPMMPLV2UoIX0AMjt47VoNqWkQBMkuHPGYC1GVX1-_IDaSp2guwpxG4gKXlYrJGT4krQRxSmJrN2PaVAXuuhU8mdUxBINTvxNUDp-7CwwJdxmhtzcJLaIPcu3M1gEb4BDSmkch-Ub8boDRPVGO2lJ4vrh4h2rGeMOxhW8PIizuP5OV6cTzBj5SMtG0CIN4tIww=&c=jw0xWm17LuOp4LpYeDxdlxZxuhgpEbAYxR9K94eGXo7eJ72f5Jl-oQ==&ch=M_kLq4K2eIUl4j175mecGHBx5C9kQJjUBJOw0LH5n2nISyWKQxF6Ag==)). Staphylococcus aureus is an important causative agent of these infections, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, or MRSA, can be particularly difficult to treat. When MRSA is suspected among hospitalized patients with complicated skin and skin tissue infections, such as purulent cellulitis, the glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin is a treatment [Clin Infect Dis 2011 Feb;52(3):e18](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001UhTFziNiKPPMMPLV2UoIX0AMjt47VoNqWkQBMkuHPGYC1GVX1-_IDaSp2guwpxG4GW_nA7hrsBbXAm-ZGoFkai9Tkm0nyZYY_Y0ottKxT20Wc26z3bxlUPIn1Ef1tkQmQdugo9Ablaub-bXdC7lr2DgR34UZjf6GMhNT8g3b33gSs1fEOF6bM5qjwH6VfImwRgoU0JD9_JQ=&c=jw0xWm17LuOp4LpYeDxdlxZxuhgpEbAYxR9K94eGXo7eJ72f5Jl-oQ==&ch=M_kLq4K2eIUl4j175mecGHBx5C9kQJjUBJOw0LH5n2nISyWKQxF6Ag==) [full-text](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001UhTFziNiKPPMMPLV2UoIX0AMjt47VoNqWkQBMkuHPGYC1GVX1-_IDaSp2guwpxG442EuCCIhuBe8VNFIy2RJtc46n5pp5JBTDb8QzmjIWTmngAkKaGPGBQ46ZysxhM7XujEgVKIfJHgpNQd_dhnbbtEb3AtuocZeq6dUEkxO9bBXp9uHiHzOCi95efHNndsnLpz5d1p_cp3ZRrkKJ4dvIA==&c=jw0xWm17LuOp4LpYeDxdlxZxuhgpEbAYxR9K94eGXo7eJ72f5Jl-oQ==&ch=M_kLq4K2eIUl4j175mecGHBx5C9kQJjUBJOw0LH5n2nISyWKQxF6Ag==)). Lipoglycopeptide dalbavancin (an analog of teicoplanin) and oritavancin (an analog of vancomycin) share a similar mechanism to their glycopeptide counterparts, but have important differences in pharmacologic properties. Two recent studies, one evaluating dalbavancin and the other evaluating oritavancin, assessed whether these analogs were noninferior to vancomycin in patients with acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections. Dalbavancin was evaluated in a pooled analysis of 2 randomized noninferiority trials with a total of 1,312 adults (mean age 50 years) with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. Patients were randomized to dalbavancin 1 g IV on day 1 and 500 mg on day 8 vs. vancomycin 1 g or 15 mg/kg IV twice daily for 3 days and followed to 70 days. Patients in the vancomycin group had the option to switch to linezolid 600 mg orally twice daily to complete 10-14 days therapy. 54% of patients had cellulitis, 25% had major abscess, and 21% had a wound or surgical site infection. All patients had lesions with 75 cm2 of erythema plus systemic and symptomatic signs of infection. In patients with a pathogen isolated at baseline, 24% had MRSA and 53% had methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA). A total of 45 patients (3.4%) had Gram-positive bacteremia, including 20 patients with S. aureus bacteremia. The primary outcome was early clinical response, which was defined as cessation of spread of infection-related erythema plus absence of fever at 48-72 hours. The noninferiority criterion was defined as a lower limit of 95% CI ? 10% for differences between groups in early clinical response. A total of 85% of patients were included in the per-protocol analysis, and 92% were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. Early clinical response was observed in 79.7% with dalbavancin vs. 79.8% with vancomycin-linezolid in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (noninferiority met). The overall clinical response rate at the end of treatment was 90.7% with dalbavancin vs. 92.1% with vancomycin-linezolid in the per-protocol analysis (not significant), with consistent results in the intention-to-treat analysis. Oritavancin was evaluated in a randomized noninferiority trial of 968 adults (mean age 45 years) with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. Patients were randomized to a single dose of oritavancin 1,200 mg IV vs. vancomycin 1 g or 15 mg/kg IV twice daily for 7-10 days with serum trough monitoring, and followed to 60 days. 50% of patients had cellulitis, 30% had abscess, and 20% had wound infection. MRSA was isolated in 21% of patients, and MSSA was isolated in 23%. All patients had lesions surrounded by erythema, edema, or induration ? 75 cm2 plus signs and symptoms of systemic inflammation. The primary outcome was a composite of cessation of spreading or decrease in lesion size, absence of fever, and lack of need for rescue antibiotic at 48-72 hours. The noninferiority criterion was defined as a lower limit of 95% CI 10% for differences between groups in the primary outcome. A total of 791 patients (82%) were clinically evaluable, and 954 patients (98.5%) were included in a modified intention-to-treat analysis. The primary outcome occurred in 82.3% with oritavancin vs. 78.9% with vancomycin (noninferiority met). An investigator-assessed clinical cure occurred in 79.6% with oritavancin vs. 80% with vancomycin (not significant). A decrease in lesion area of at least 20% at 48-72 hours was observed in 86.9% with oritavancin vs. 82.9% with vancomycin (not significant). There were no significant differences in the primary outcome in subgroup analyses separately evaluating patients with MRSA or MSSA. The findings from these randomized trials demonstrate that dalbavancin and oritavancin have comparable clinical response rates compared to vancomycin in the management of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections. Dalbavancin has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of adults with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections caused by certain susceptible bacteria, including MRSA and MSSA ( [FDA Press Release 2014 May 23)](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001UhTFziNiKPPMMPLV2UoIX0AMjt47VoNqWkQBMkuHPGYC1GVX1-_IDaSp2guwpxG4QC2xis4e43f8ZA6pf-aFJDcgo935o1IGBfz4sIJmuCX_UD-hM2ulddXbL0cGJQNbN8Ny7xTxzR1XjeOCR50w9Vx_E_tQAjAx1NxDv-ITdW9e5MWNiwONCwaL-qxDuAQ9SO6_UGQg2r7ktn3wkKN-IXxtr9BlZdBUfZfIUFGl32SKAFfeycJmTw==&c=jw0xWm17LuOp4LpYeDxdlxZxuhgpEbAYxR9K94eGXo7eJ72f5Jl-oQ==&ch=M_kLq4K2eIUl4j175mecGHBx5C9kQJjUBJOw0LH5n2nISyWKQxF6Ag==). Cost information was not reported for either agent, and pricing information does not yet appear to be available. In these trials, dalbavancin was administered once weekly and oritavancin was administered as a single dose, whereas vancomycin was administered every 12 hours. The less frequent administration required for dalbavancin and oritavancin, and the lack of need to monitor serum levels, may make it possible to treat some of these infections on an outpatient basis when they might otherwise have been treated in-hospital. This could dramatically reduce both the costs and risks of hospitalization. However, the longer duration of action may prove to be a safety concern as well, since any toxic effects may continue for weeks until the agents have been cleared. It is also important to keep in mind that these trials were designed to compare these lipoglycopeptide agents to vancomycin, and do not represent a comparison to standard practice in some cases. For example, in patients with MSSA bacteremia, retrospective cohort studies have demonstrated that nafcillin and cefazolin are associated with reduced mortality compared to vancomycin ( [BMC Infect Dis 2011 Oct 19;11:279](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001UhTFziNiKPPMMPLV2UoIX0AMjt47VoNqWkQBMkuHPGYC1GVX1-_IDaSp2guwpxG4hLztqNEyH889bwHocMAVpX6kfVlvjXJV3EEZ7-hTzus7UZHadhE-porcrTyLGiNT7ZHuQykfsBOg4tPPLQho3k7w_MctAwOTkDbb9lN07ALGOfvxWCv9TMhA4B1szNRb3G0b93_752g=&c=jw0xWm17LuOp4LpYeDxdlxZxuhgpEbAYxR9K94eGXo7eJ72f5Jl-oQ==&ch=M_kLq4K2eIUl4j175mecGHBx5C9kQJjUBJOw0LH5n2nISyWKQxF6Ag==) [full-text](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001UhTFziNiKPPMMPLV2UoIX0AMjt47VoNqWkQBMkuHPGYC1GVX1-_IDaSp2guwpxG4ng7FeM85luhQp2mhPX009Gl5Z1eFD3XcqP0fQNGGHeNSMKlXbrbqzwIdLJkVuUR5N5EjDZamAvI_h2zbxKOU-9Iu6VPUt0j6r3TukqJ2yj-Qhmio3eme6L1npOFr8VWOWsixp1HsrMk=&c=jw0xWm17LuOp4LpYeDxdlxZxuhgpEbAYxR9K94eGXo7eJ72f5Jl-oQ==&ch=M_kLq4K2eIUl4j175mecGHBx5C9kQJjUBJOw0LH5n2nISyWKQxF6Ag==), 2008 Jan;52(1):192](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001UhTFziNiKPPMMPLV2UoIX0AMjt47VoNqWkQBMkuHPGYC1GVX1-_IDaSp2guwpxG4Mob0ban_Sf_vfwy6GPyHDcH0MS3ao_y22dKfwL3iQ69zEVEkfz1q2GLXZSxAh7Ld_mELAOnZnwW5yxQP7F08_5I27sXDYAsQQygp67hdNlvanMx0e7gg4Bw8e8FeYiQUPpMmc_oV1Og=&c=jw0xWm17LuOp4LpYeDxdlxZxuhgpEbAYxR9K94eGXo7eJ72f5Jl-oQ==&ch=M_kLq4K2eIUl4j175mecGHBx5C9kQJjUBJOw0LH5n2nISyWKQxF6Ag==) [full-tex](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001UhTFziNiKPPMMPLV2UoIX0AMjt47VoNqWkQBMkuHPGYC1GVX1-_IDaSp2guwpxG4aK5nyUr0uXHC0KfxxsU3nYEaPBUHOVT0V3yOP3L5c30UHe-nIvavSVBp6wHkhnBLlq42smSwW71gkX6W16GJJbAjFMaLccWPiRRaV3Sa_WJaK9gCCoXYddZmKeSkwkTlMR-FaHTRcZY=&c=jw0xWm17LuOp4LpYeDxdlxZxuhgpEbAYxR9K94eGXo7eJ72f5Jl-oQ==&ch=M_kLq4K2eIUl4j175mecGHBx5C9kQJjUBJOw0LH5n2nISyWKQxF6Ag==)t). For patients with bacteremia who are later shown to have MSSA, it's not clear how these agents compare to standard practice, and the longer half-life of these agents may make switching to optimal treatment more difficult. In addition, it's not clear that a full 14 days of therapy is warranted in all cases, and treatment with a long-acting agent might expose a patient to antibiotics for longer than needed. Longer duration of therapy may also augment the emergence of vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus.

The Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) guideline recommends referral to a physical therapist (OARSI Level IV) for patients with symptomatic hip osteoarthritis ( [Osteoarthritis Cartilage 2008 Feb;16(2):137](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001exm7P8smKW5sj9tMxvIJepwME7n89xVWvxfgThKbZq7VwyI71LUWQRCtRfK7HpHW5AZcw_5ij9frygUwPXAR0mpaziEYlYuRF3gnQ1kSgISM2FWXW5l71Ro7s2xbirB9sjH2cB_xppOGrTy6gRLVN_ISM2p02WjvshtdKP97NFSAdAPsuK6UCMiLzx0acYji90cOmvM0Tn0=&c=v5QkSaZL3fr--3zrtqm6IY3v2DmyhospYHuuoJbKZbcOuxmA_noP-A==&ch=ndW8m6mLkPEOX-LmjcGJ0LZWedGPKgdywmOFdUFfK8fEQUvDH9dW6A==)). These recommendations state that physical therapy can provide initial evaluation and instruction in appropriate exercises to reduce pain and improve functional capacity, and may also help by providing assistive devices (canes or walkers) when appropriate. However, clinical data supporting physical therapy for this patient population have been lacking. A recent randomized trial compared a multimodal physical therapy regimen to a sham therapy in 102 community-dwelling patients (mean age 64 years) with radiograph-confirmed symptomatic hip osteoarthritis. Patients were randomized to physical therapy vs. sham therapy for 10 sessions over 12 weeks and followed to 36 weeks. The physical therapy group received education and advice, manual therapy, and a walking stick if deemed appropriate, followed by 4-6 unsupervised home exercises performed 4 times weekly. The sham group received an inactive ultrasound plus inert gel followed by self-applied gel 3 times weekly during follow-up. At baseline, all patients had a hip pain score 40 mm (mean 58 mm) on a visual analog scale (range 0-100 mm, with higher scores indicating more severe pain). The mean hip physical function score at baseline was 32.4 points on Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index hip-specific physical function subscale (range 0-68 points, with higher scores indicating worse function). Minimal clinically important differences were defined as 18 mm for the pain score and 6 points for the physical function score. The primary outcome was based on assessments at 13 weeks and secondary outcomes were based on results at 36 weeks. The loss to follow-up was 6% at week 13 and 19% at week 36, but all patients were included in the efficacy analyses. Patients in the physical therapy group attended mean 9.6 of 10 treatment sessions and adherence to home exercise was mean 85% based on self-reported questionnaires. The mean overall hip pain score at 13 weeks was 40.1 mm with physical therapy vs. 35.2 mm with sham therapy. The 95% confidence interval for the between-group difference ranged from 3.9 mm in favor of physical therapy to 17.7 mm in favor of sham therapy. Similarly, the mean hip physical function score at 13 weeks was 27.5 points with physical therapy vs. 26.4 points with sham therapy. The 95% confidence interval for the between-group difference ranged from 3.8 points in favor of physical therapy to 6.5 points in favor of sham therapy. The frequency of mild adverse events, primarily increased hip pain or pain in other regions, by 13 weeks was 41% with physical therapy vs. 14% with sham therapy (p = 0.003, NNH 3). The results at 36 weeks also did not show significant differences between the 2 groups for either hip pain or hip physical function scores. The proportion of patients believing they were receiving active treatment was 62% in the physical therapy group vs. 25% in the sham group at week 36. The cost of the multimodal physical therapy intervention evaluated was not reported. Physical therapy for patients with symptomatic hip osteoarthritis often employs a multimodal approach, including education, manual therapy, and various exercises. Although some previous studies have evaluated some of the specific components involved, this is the first study to rigorously evaluate several aspects of physical therapy using a credible sham control, which potentially reduces the risk of bias in outcomes such as pain scores that are subjective in nature. Because of this, these data provide the best evidence to date for the effect of a broad set of physical therapy components, most importantly a combination of manual therapy and unsupervised home exercise, on hip pain or function. The findings suggest that physical therapy including manual therapy and unsupervised home exercise is of limited value for these patients, and may even harm patients by increasing the frequency of mild adverse events such as increased hip pain or pain in other regions. Although a higher proportion of patients in the physical therapy group were aware that they received active treatment at 36 weeks, this is unlikely to have made a substantial impact on either the pain or physical function outcomes. A recent update of a Cochrane review identified 10 randomized trials comparing land-based exercise (aquatic exercise is reviewed separately) vs. nonexercise active control or no treatment in 554 adults with hip osteoarthritis ( [Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2014 Apr 22;(4):CD007912](http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001exm7P8smKW5sj9tMxvIJepwME7n89xVWvxfgThKbZq7VwyI71LUWQYkEZYN1LFf9QnlPfezkubbaHCAuiv7TWDGTBZUbnpA7jFlhaSFhv4sYQclzGhHFrYoKfviLSwLUBOcX5IbuiZusEe0wKBpxJwyuTipnHCb6SUqXJhnzZWv04N1gKZ3tOWkNEbJaD8hOX8aYfvn7Kdw=&c=v5QkSaZL3fr--3zrtqm6IY3v2DmyhospYHuuoJbKZbcOuxmA_noP-A==&ch=ndW8m6mLkPEOX-LmjcGJ0LZWedGPKgdywmOFdUFfK8fEQUvDH9dW6A==)). The inclusion criteria allowed both supervised exercise as well as home exercise with minimal monitoring. In a meta-analysis of 9 trials, exercise was associated with a statistically significant but clinically unimportant improvement in pain. Similarly, a separate meta-analysis of 9 trials showed that exercise was associated with a statistically significant improvement in physical function, with a 95% confidence interval including both clinically important and unimportant differences. The term physical therapy is an umbrella term that may refer to many different interventions, and this makes it difficult to make general conclusions about its use in patients with symptomatic hip osteoarthritis. In particular, the use of unsupervised home exercise evaluated in this study may be a limitation, since therapists had limited ability to ensure that exercises were being done correctly. Furthermore, although adherence to home exercise was reported to be about 85% in patients receiving physical therapy, this was by necessity a self-reported estimate among unsupervised patients. Nonetheless, the evidence from this trial does not support physical therapy as an effective treatment in this clinical context.

Topical anesthetics such as tetracaine are known to be effective at reducing ocular pain, with rapid onset and short duration of action. However, the use of topical anesthetics at home after discharge from the acute care setting has been discouraged because of concerns about complications, including delayed healing of the abrasion, based on case reports, studies of tissue samples, and animal studies. A recent randomized trial compared the safety and efficacy of topical tetracaine to saline drops in 122 patients presenting to the emergency department with a corneal abrasion. All patients had an uncomplicated corneal abrasion and were randomized to topical tetracaine hydrochloride 1% vs. saline and followed for up to 1 month. The interventions were applied by patients at home every 30 minutes while awake as needed, for 24 hours total. All patients received acetaminophen (paracetamol) 1,000 mg orally every 4 hours for 4 doses and chloramphenicol 1% eye ointment. Patients recorded their pain scores every 30 minutes for the first 2 hours after leaving the emergency department, and then every 2 hours while awake for the next 48 hours. The safety of tetracaine was assessed by evaluating corneal healing by slit-lamp exam and fluorescein uptake at 48 hours from discharge, and by comparing persistent symptoms at 48 hours and 1 month. Patients were also asked to rate how well the intervention had worked on a 0-10 numeric rating scale (higher being more effective), after being contacted by telephone at 1 week and/or 1 month. There were no significant between-group differences in pain scores at any time point evaluated. Fluorescein uptake at 48 hours occurred in 24% with tetracaine vs. 21% with placebo (not significant). Similarly, persistent symptoms at 48 hours occurred in 17% with tetracaine vs. 18% with placebo (not significant. The self-reported effectiveness score among patients responding at 1 week was 7.7 with tetracaine vs. 3.9 with placebo (p < 0.0005) among 80 patients (66% of those randomized) with data available. Results for persistent symptoms and self-reported effectiveness were consistent at 1 month. In addition, no other complications attributed to topical anesthetic were reported. A total of 29 patients (24%) were excluded from the analyses for incorrect enrolment (5%) or for retained rust rings (19%). Patients with retained rust rings were excluded because their persistent symptoms were thought to be mainly attributed to the rust rings themselves and repeated attempts to remove them, rather than any effect of study medication. In this study, patients rated the overall effectiveness of topical tetracaine significantly higher than placebo when recalling their experience at 1 week or 1 month after presenting with a corneal abrasion. However, the pain scores recorded during the first 48 hours did not significantly favor tetracaine over saline. The reasons for this apparent discrepancy are not clear, but the large variation in pain scores and the fact that pain scores quickly decreased to nearly zero in both groups after 12 hours are likely contributing factors. Importantly, this study found that patients receiving tetracaine had no evidence of delayed corneal healing, persistent symptoms, or any other complications traditionally attributed to topical anesthetics. These findings highlight the fact that laboratory studies evaluating surrogate outcomes, while useful for elucidating pathophysiologic processes, have limited value in determining the efficacy of an intervention in a clinical setting. The use of chloramphenicol may limit the generalizability of these findings, since antibiotic use for corneal abrasion has limited supporting evidence and may not be routinely used in many practices. It's also possible that the ointment itself provided relief irrespective of the antibiotic, which may explain the steep drop in pain scores in both groups. Further studies are warranted, but in the meantime these results suggest that topical anesthetics used for 24 hours are safe and may be an option for selected patients presenting to the emergency department with a corneal abrasion.

A recent prospective cohort study evaluated a new CAM-Severity (CAM-S) score to predict adverse outcomes in hospitalized patients 70 years old without delirium on admission. The derivation cohort included 300 patients 70 years old from the Successful Aging After Elective Surgery (SAGES) study who were scheduled for major surgery and did not have delirium on hospital admission. The validation cohort included 919 similar hospitalized patients from the Project Recovery study. An additional 355 eligible patients were excluded from the validation cohort for unexplained reasons. The CAM-S short form score was derived using factors from CAM diagnostic assessment tool (total score 0-7 points): The CAM-S score was used to categorize patients into 4 different risk groups: none (0 points), low (1 point), moderate (2 points), and high (3-7 points). In the validation cohort, 90-day mortality was 7% among 598 patients with no risk factors, 15% among 91 patients in the low risk category, 16% among 128 patients in the moderate risk category, and 27% among 102 in the high risk category (p for trend < 0.001). Similarly, adjusted mean length of hospital stay was 6.5 days with no risk factors, 8.8 days for the low risk category, 11.1 days for the moderate risk category, and 12.7 days for the high risk category (p for trend < 0.001). Increased CAM-S short form scores were also associated with increased risk of new nursing home placement, functional decline, and cognitive decline (p for trend < 0.001 for each). The prediction of adverse patient outcomes with the CAM-S short form was also consistent with a 10-item long form of CAM-S (total score 0-19 points). Although the use of CAM and related diagnostic assessment tools have proved to be helpful for diagnosing delirium in high-risk populations, using the data from the screening assessment to predict adverse outcomes has not been previously described. The findings of this cohort study show that the CAM-S short form score can help predict important patient outcomes such as 90-day mortality and hospital duration, among others. There were some differences in patient characteristics between the derivation and validation cohorts in the study, which may be viewed as a limitation but may also indicate the generalizability of the findings to different patient populations. Altogether, this new tool provides useful information that may help predict adverse outcomes, guide treatment decisions, and potentially monitor response to treatment in some patient populations.

In addition, QT interval prolongation is considered a class effect of fluoroquinolone antibiotics, and quinolone-related torsades de pointes has A recent large retrospective cohort study of Veterans Affairs medical centers in the United States evaluated the risk of all-cause mortality and serious cardiac arrhythmia in persons receiving levofloxacin, azithromycin, or amoxicillin. A total of 1,757,689 treatments with levofloxacin, azithromycin, or amoxicillin to United States veterans (mean age 57 years, 89% male) between September 1999 and April 2012 were evaluated. Azithromycin was dispensed mostly for 5 days, whereas amoxicillin and levofloxacin were each dispensed mostly for 10 days. Compared to other antibiotics, azithromycin was more often prescribed for COPD, and levofloxacin was more often prescribed for genitourinary infection (no p values reported). Crude mortality and serious cardiac arrhythmia rates were assessed, with analyses adjusted for multiple clinical and demographic characteristics at baseline, including indication for antibiotic prescription. At 5 days, the adjusted mortality per million antibiotics dispensed was 384 with levofloxacin (p < 0.001 vs. amoxicillin), 228 with azithromycin (p < 0.003 vs. amoxicillin), and 154 with amoxicillin. At 10 days, the adjusted mortality per million antibiotics dispensed was 714 with levofloxacin (p < 0.001 vs. amoxicillin), 422 with (not significant vs. amoxicillin), and 324 with amoxicillin. Levofloxacin was also associated with an increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmia vs. amoxicillin at 5 days and 10 days, while azithromycin was associated with an increased risk of serious cardiac arrhythmia vs. amoxicillin at 5 days but not 10 days. These data show that in a U.S. population, predominantly older men, both levofloxacin and azithromycin were associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and serious cardiac arrhythmia during the typical dosing cycle for each drug (10 days for levofloxacin and 5 days for azithromycin). This conclusion is strengthened by the large sample size and the use of actual pharmacy dispensing data, rather than prescriptions. However, it is limited by its observational design, particularly due to imbalanced patient characteristics within the cohort. Although the study used a multivariable model to adjust for a wide variety of baseline characteristics, including antibiotic indication, these differences may still have biased the results. Nonetheless, these findings suggest that physicians should consider prescribing medications other than levofloxacin and azithromycin for older patients when multiple antibiotic choices are available, particularly for those with cardiac comorbidities.

UTI screening methods include urine dipstick and microscopy of centrifuged urine. Urine dipstick is a relatively simple procedure that can be performed in office settings with minimal training, whereas microscopic examination of urine requires more extensive training. A recent retrospective diagnostic cohort study evaluated both urine dipstick and microscopy for detection of UTI in 6,536 febrile infants aged 1-90 days. All infants had urine samples obtained by catheterization. The urine dipstick testing used colorimetric interpretation by a semiautomated urine chemistry analyzer. In addition to the comparison with microscopy, a combined analysis was performed, with a positive result defined as positive findings on either urine dipstick or microscopy. The reference standard was urine culture, with UTI defined as presence of > 50,000 colony-forming units/mL of any urinary pathogen. A total of 6,394 infants (98%) with unequivocal urine cultures were included in the analysis. The prevalence of UTI was about 12% by reference standard. For detection of UTI in the overall analysis, all tests had negative predictive value > 98%. The urine dipstick testing had sensitivity 90.8%, specificity 93.8%, positive predictive value (PPV) 66.8%, and negative predictive value 98.6%. specificity 99.2%. The addition of microscopy to urine dipstick was estimated to produce 8 false positive diagnoses of UTI for every diagnosis missed with urine dipstick alone. In 53 infants with subsequent UTI diagnosis after negative urine dipstick, no adverse outcomes were observed. Urine dipstick testing is a rapid and inexpensive test for detection of UTI that does not require specialized training. These new findings demonstrate that a negative result on urine dipstick testing may rule out UTI in infants < 90 days old. Although adding microscopy analysis to urine dipstick testing resulted in a higher negative predictive value, this must be weighed against an increased number of false positives with combined analysis, which can lead to additional use of healthcare resources and potentially increased antibiotic exposure. Taken together, these data support urine dipstick testing without microscopy for detection of UTI in febrile infants while waiting for urine culture results.
