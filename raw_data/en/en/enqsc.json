He described his reactions as beginning with a prickly sensation in the mouth and throat followed by a feeling of sickness and swelling of the throat and sinuses lasting up to four hours. Every year, about 100 people die from complications associated with allergic reactions to food, and peanuts and tree nuts are often the culprits. Now researchers at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine have taken the first small step toward preventing peanut allergy reactions in humans with an oral vaccination that seems to work on mice. Their findings appear in the current issue of the journal Nature Medicine. The researchers took the cloned gene for the peanut allergen, Arah2, combined its DNA with a chemical that aids the delivery of pharmaceutical agents to the intestines and fed it to mice. The vaccinated mice were protected from the symptoms of peanut allergen more efficiently than mice that were just given the DNA by itself or that were not given any DNA. ''We don't know the exact mechanism,'' said Krishnendu Roy (no relation to Jock), a graduate student at the biomedical engineering department at Johns Hopkins University and lead author of the study. The only proven treatment for people with the allergy has been educating them to avoid peanuts. But even the cautious sometimes accidentally ingest them. According to the report, 50 percent of peanut allergy patients who are treated annually ingested the peanuts by accident. ''Once I was at a restaurant and the pink ravioli with a white wine-based cream sauce I ordered had crushed peanuts in the sauce,'' said Robert Peters, 34, a sales executive from Hempstead, N.Y., who suffers from a severe peanut allergy. ''I got two ravenous bites into my mouth and then I felt the tingling.'' He said the tingling usually gives way to a swelling in the lower abdomen, and within an hour he passes out unless he gets to a hospital. Mr. Roy of Johns Hopkins is unsure about the possibilities of an oral vaccination for patients like Mr. Peters and Mr. Roy. ''The study looked at prevention rather than using this vaccination on someone who has already had the allergy. We still don't know if the vaccine will work in that way.'' "}
