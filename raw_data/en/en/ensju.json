Rather it belongs to the person who studies. Today every detail concerning the modern system of medicine is available on the internet. So there is nothing wrong about government conducting a short-term course to give this knowledge to [ayush](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ayush) practitioners. There are two reasons why this [bridge course](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/bridge-course) is necessary. Most people come to the ayush system for chronic disease management (like diabetes or blood pressure). They would be taking several allopathic medicines which can cause various side effects. If ayush practitioners are not exposed to that science, how will they know which medicine to stop and which dosage should be gradually reduced. The bridge course is proposed to follow five-and-a-half years of basic ayush course, during which students learn not only about their own system of medicine but also some portions of modern science like [anatomy](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/anatomy) , physiology, medicine, surgery and [pharmacology](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/pharmacology) . So the bridge course would train them on whatever is required in addition to this for handling emergencies. When BSc nursing and General Nursing and Midwifery (GNM) graduates are allowed to help with deliveries, polio vaccination, measles and rubella treatment without doctors' assistance, what stops trained ayush professionals from doing the same. This proposal came up because of the dearth of allopaths in rural areas as most doctors are not ready to settle in villages. To plug this gap and to strengthen rural healthcare, the bridge course is ideal. While private hospitals are exorbitant, ayush practitioners diagnose, treat and provide medicines for `100 at rural-level. Serious cases can always be referred to secondary, tertiary or super-speciality centres. Therefore the overall medical expenses will come down and proper service will reach all sections of society. India needs five lakh doctors and every year, 30,000 ayush graduates pass out from 450 colleges. There are 12 lakh registered Ayush practitioners at present, so the course will be a boon to society. It is unfair to compare two different systems of medicine. But here the government is willing to train doctors to improve health services. Modern system of medicine has evolved with equipment, inventions and contributions by physicists, chemists and biologists. On one hand, the cabinet has removed the bridge course as part of the National Medical Commission Bill. However, the National Commission for Indian System for Medicine Bill, 2019, introduced at Rajya Sabha is yet to come up for discussion. We hope it is cleared. "}
