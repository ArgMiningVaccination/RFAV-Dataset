Conversely, substa nce dependency can result in a person becoming homeless, perpetuating a vicious cycle of problematic substance use and home - lessness. Income and Wealth Distribution Lower income is asso - ciated with increased risk of problematic substance use, and conversely, adequate income is protective. Working conditions Stressful, dangerous, or unfulfill- ing working conditions add to risk of problematic sub - stance use. Social connectednes s and living in a healthy commun ity A community which supports citizen engagement and health and well being is also a community that experi - ences less problems associated with substances.69 Early childhood development and parental support A healthy pregnancy, a nurturing and adequately sup - ported and stimulated early childhood, and positive childhood experiences are important protective fac - tors against problematic substance use. Conversely, difficult and traumatic childhood experiences are risk factors for later problematic substance use.Mental or physical distress The need to alleviate dis - tress resulting from current or previous life experiences (e.g. childhood psychologi - cal and physical trauma, poor or no housing, lack of food) or seek relief from symptoms of medical con - ditions e.g. opiates and cannabis for pain relief. Peer influence For initiat - ing substance use. Desire/need To relax, in - crease alertness, concentra - tion, energy and stamina (e.g. amphetamines), alter experiences, perceptions of reality, experience pleas - ure, spirituality. Dependence Avoid uncomfortable withdrawal symp - toms or to maintain a desired state of mental and phys - ical functioning. SUPPLY is created by the relationship between price and the quantity of substances that producers and dis - tributors are willing to provide at that price.16 This re - sults in production through cultivation of plants or fungi (e.g. yeast, mushrooms); natural availability, harvesting, and processing into end products; or de novo manufacturing of synthetic substances from a range of raw materials (precursors). The final product can take many forms and concentrations which influ - ences the harm potential. AVAILABILITY of substances is determined by the mech - anisms that move products from producers to con - sumers and includes wholesaling, distribution, and retailing (either to take away or consume on-site). |45 ||Appendix | \"Drugs are richly functional scapegoats. They provide elites with fig leaves to place over the unsightly so - cially ills that are endemic to the social system over which they preside. And they provide the public with a restricted aperture of attribution in which only a chemical bogey man or the lone deviants who inge st it are seen as the cause of a cornucopia of complex problems.\" C. Reinarman 70 |46 |Substances are made more or less ACCESSI BLE to con - sumers through restrictions such as age of purchase requirements or prices. The difference between avail- ability and accessibility is that availability describes the probability of encountering substances (e.g. dis - tribution and density of retailers) whereas accessibil- ity describes how easy it is to acquire substances from a particular source (e.g. impeded by age restric - tions, identity checking, higher prices, behind counter versus over the counter access t o product, hours of operation). CONSUMPTION is the taking into the body of a substance by various means (eating, drinking, smoking, etc), and is differentiated from USE in that the latter concept brings to light the utilitarian aspect of why substances are consumed, such as using them as cognitive tools.71 SOCIAL NORMS such as acceptability of some sub - stances over others, acceptability of consuming sub - stances in certain patterns but not others, or stigmatization associated with some substances are important considerations as they can be more power - ful in influence use than regulations, and do not re - quire ongoing enforcement processes. These in turn are influenced by ma ny of the other factors in the model. The CONTEXT in which substances are taken can greatly influence the potential for harm. The experience with the supervised consumption site in Vancouver (\"In - site\") in which overdoses can be rapidly attended to prevent death is an excellent example.72 The pathways from consuming the substance to harms or benefits at the individual level are complex and are influenced by the particular substance, dose, quality, pattern of consumption, and mode of administration. These can lead to toxic effects, intoxication, and de - pendence. See Babor et al16 (pg 18-20) for a more de - tailed discussion.A minority of people who try substances will develop patterns of use that jeopardize their health or adversely affect their families, friends, and community. For ex - ample Anthony et al73 reported that the prevalence of lifetime dependence is around 9% among persons who ever used cannabis, 32% for tobacco, 23% for heroin, 17% for cocaine, 15% for alcohol, and 11% for stimulant use. Adequate HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES must be in place to treat and support those people and their families and communities in dealing with prob - lematic substance use. Adequate CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES are necessary to ensure that regulations are adhered to and enforced, and that transgressions of regulations are dealt with fairly and in proportion to the harms of the transgres - sions. The LAW , as manifested by statutes, regulations, and court judgements is an important determinant and is the main focus of this paper. Throughout history soci - eties have developed a spectrum of regulatory ap - proaches to manage substances, generally from least restrictive to most restrictive with a purported attempt to mitigate potential harms. Current approaches to managing substances include: Free market commercialization (e.g. tobacco, caf - feine and alcohol) with and without varying licens - ing regimes. Over and behind the counter access through phar - macies (e.g. codeine based pain and cough medica - tions). Prescription by a physician (e.g. sl eeping pills, methadone and pain medications). Prohibition, where it is a criminal offence to pos - sess and sell substances, except in some very lim - ited circumstances (e.g. cannabis, cocaine, LSD and heroin). Varying combinations of civil and criminal based regulation (see later discussion).|Appendix |Tobacco has long been a focus of local government reg - ulation, and in 2005 the City of Vancouv er adopted a report in which it was recommended that the city \"enact by-laws that restrict the display of tobacco products in retail outlets, limit the number of stores selling tobacco product s in Vancouver and refuse to issue new business licenses for outlets selling tobacco located within 150 metres of an elementa ry or second - ary school.\" 74 In 2001 the Royal College of Physicians in the United Kingdom conducted an extensive review of tobacco harm reduction and concluded: \"The regulation of nicotine pr oducts, whether medic - inal or tobacco based, thus needs radical reform to en - sure that the market forces of affordability, promotion and availability act in a strong and directly inverse re - lation to the hazard of the nicotine product, and that the marketing and use of nicotine products are care - fully monitored to maximise public health benefit.While it may be possible to achieve this reform and consistency by more rational application of existing regulatory frameworks, our conclusion is that the scale of the problem, and the difficulties of achieving suc - cessful reform, are such that the problem will be best addressed by the creation of a nicotine regulatory au - thority to take control of all aspects of regulation of all nicotine products.\" 75 Canada has been a world leader with regards to federal legislation about sponsorship restrictions, graphic packaging warnings and banning flavours; and provin - cial legislation setting minimum age and package size, banning displays and setting indoor restrictions/set buffer zones. |47 ||Appendix |Harms and Bene/f_its of Substance Prohibition A p p e n d i x 3 It is important to distin - guish direct harms from consuming substances (e.g. acute toxic or chronic ef - fects) from the indirect harms of policies that seek to manage substances (e.g. individual and societal costs of incarceration of indi - viduals, sharing needles). In particular it is being in - creasingly recognized that the policy of indiscriminate prohibition has failed to achieve its intended goals and results in many negative unintended consequences such as enriching organized crime, driving gang vio - lence, fuelling the spread of HIV and Hepatitis C, pro - moting overdose deaths, and furt her marginalizing many people with difficult health, p sychological, and social problems. This conclusion is not new and is shared by many oth - ers. In an open letter to Kofi Annan, 19 98 Secretary General to the UN, approximately 600 leading thinkers, researchers, politicians, le gal experts and others concluded \"The illegal drug industry ... has em - powered organized criminals, corrupted governments at all levels, eroded internal security, stimulated vio - lence, and distorted both economic markets and moral values. These are the consequences not of drug use per se, but of decades of failed and futile drug war policies ... We believe that the global war on drugs is now caus - ing more harm than drug abuse itself.\" 77 Similar concerns are shared by many o ther groups* and there is growing global awareness of the need to end indiscriminate drug prohibition and implement regulated approaches for all currently illegal drugs based on public health and human ri ghts principles.Most recently the XVIII In - ternational AIDS Confer - ence (AIDS 2010) held in Vienna, Austria produced the Vienna Declaration, an official statement seeking to improve community health and safety by calling for the incorporation of scientific evidence into illicit drug policies. The decla - ration in part stated \"The criminalisation of illicit drug users is fuelling the HIV epidemic and has resulted in overwhelmingly negative health and social conse - quences. A full policy reorientation is needed ... Bas - ing drug policies on scientific evidence will not eliminate drug use or the problems stemming from drug injecting. However, reorienting drug policies to - wards evidence-based approaches that respect, pro - tect and fulfil human rights has the potential to reduce harms deriving from current policies and would allow for the redirection of the vast financial resources to - wards where they are needed most: implementing and evaluating evidence-based prevention, regulatory, treatment and harm reduction interventions.\" (see viennadeclaration.com for full text of the Declaration) As of November 2011, the Vienna Declaration had re - ceived over 20,000 endorsements.3 In 2001, the federal auditor general of Canada esti - mated that the size of the Canadian illegal drug mar - ket was $7-$18 billion and $450-$750 billion globally.44 A report to the American Congress in 2008 estimated the size of the global illegal market at be - tween $100 billion and a trillion dollars.45 These funds are outside the control of governments, are supporting organized crime groups and are a strong incentive for new recruits. In British Columbia, a major source of |48 |When the only tool you own is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. *Among others examples include: Canadian Foundation for Drug Policy cfdp .ca , Drug Policy Alliance Network drugpolicy.org/homepage.cfm, Transform Drug Policy Foundation tdpf.or g.uk, King County Bar Association kcba.org/druglaw/index.aspx, International Drug Policy Consor tium idpc.net. revenue for local gangs is derived from cannabis, much of which is exported to the US. In 2000, this local mar - ket was estimated to be worth approximately C$7 bil- lion.46 In contrast, the province's forestry and fisheries industries together generated slightly less than $3 bil- lion that same year.47 Through a regulated market a portion of this money could be available to government through taxation. This could fund better control measures and provide improved support for problem atic substance use through prevention, treatment, and addressing the negative social determi - nants of health (e.g. lack of housing, poor access to nu - trition, unemployment). In the British Columbia con - text, since the vast m ajority of the province's illegal drug market is based in the cannabis trade this may present an opportunity to ex - plore alternative approaches to reducing drug supply to vulnerable groups (e.g. youth) while removing a key revenue stream for local gangs. In a paper written in 2010, Jeffery Miron concluded 78 that in the US legalizing drugs would save roughly $48.7 billion per year in government expenditure on en - forcement of prohibition. $33.1 billion of this savings would accrue to sta te and local governments, while $15.6 billion would accrue to the federal government. Approximately $13.7 billion of the savings would re - sult from legalization of cannabis, $22.3 billion from legalization of cocaine and heroin, and $12.8 billion from legalization of other drugs. The report also esti - mates that drug legalization would yield tax revenue of $34.3 billion annually; assuming legal drugs are taxed at rates comparable to those on alcohol and tobacco. Approximately $6.4 billion of this revenue would re - sult from legalization of cannabis, $23.9 billion from legalization of cocaine and heroin, and $4.0 billion from legalization of other drugs. The harmful effects of prohibition include : Promotion of sharing of needles and other drug use paraphernalia facilitating and accelerating the spread of HIV, hepatitis C, and many other infec - tions.39, 40 Injection drug use accounted for 17% of positive HIV test reports in 2008.79 Drug use is cur - rently the most important risk factor for HCV infec - tion, accounting for 72% of infections (63% intravenous drug use, 9% drug snorting).80 Prohibition creates an illegal market* that produces concentrated and contaminated products which are high risk to users, leading to overdose hospitaliza - tions and deaths. In Canada in 2002 there were 733 overdoses for males and 225 for females, totalling about 958 deaths. This constituted 56.5% of all 2002 illegal drug deaths in Canada.1 Contamination of illegal market produced drugs can result in serious ill- ness. For example con - tamination of cocaine with levamisole (an anti- worming agent) has been found to be associated with very low white blood cell counts.81 Recent contam - ination of heroin with anthrax in the UK has been noted.82 Fuelling the existence of an illegal market that pro - duces crime, violence, and corruption. Prohibition creates a massive and lucrative illicit market for drugs, one estimated to be worth as much as $320 billion US globally, and $7 billion Canadian in B.C.41 There are substantial rewards to be made from en - gaging in such a market, resulting in significant as - sociated violence because there are no legal means to deal with competition and settle disputes. This results in violent injuries and deaths of users, deal- ers, police and innocent bystanders. This has been particularly evident recently in Mexico where an es - timated 28,000 people have died since 2006 83 as a result of drug trade violence and enforcement activ - ities. Increased drug market violence. A recent system - atic review examining the impacts of drug law en - forcement interventions on drug market violence found that increasing drug law enforcement inten - sity resulted in increased rates of drug market vio - lence.41 Notably, nine of the 11 studies (82%) employing regression analyses of longitudinal data found a significant positive association between drug law enforcement increases and increased lev - els of violence. The authors concluded \" ... from an |49 ||Appendix | \"That which is prohibited cannot be easily regulated.\" Room et al 19 *HOC prefers to use the term \"illegal market\" rather than black market because of racial connotations of the latter term, and in recogniti on that prohibition has been particularly harmful in stigmatizing and resulting in discrimination of racial minorities.|50 |evidence-based public policy perspective and based on several decades of available data, the existing ev - idence strongly suggests that drug law enforcement contributes to gun violence and high homicide rates and that increasingly sophisticated methods of dis - rupting Canadian gangs involved in drug distribu - tion could unintentionally increase violence. In this context, and since drug prohibition has not achieved its stated goal of reducing drug supply, alternative models for drug control may need to be considered if drug-related violence is to be meaningfully re - duced.\" Damaged houses and community disruption from in-home grow and lab operations. The illegal market created by prohibition, paradox - ically makes illegal drugs widely available as there are no regulations and little control. Dealers never ask customers for age identification. The glamourization of the illegal market as a conse - quence of prohibition is engaging for youth. Schools play a role in the network of drug distribution, ex - posing students to criminal activity and enticing some into selling drugs to make \"easy\" money. Negative health and social consequences from ar - rests, criminal records and incarceration. Crimi - nalization leads to stigmatization, marginalization and discrimination of vulnerable people and visible minorities, aggravating underlying problems and making it more difficult for them to access health and social services. Marginalization is a determi - nant of health which results in significant harms to individuals and their families and increased costs to society. Criminalization leads to many encounters with the criminal justice system, including time spent in jail waiting for trial. Table 1 lists police-re - ported crime for substance re lated offences in 2008.84 The percentage of the violations that result in harms to the people arrested is not kno wn, but the large numbers for possession alone (nearly 70,000), especially for cannabis, give pause for concern. The detention of people who use drugs in such cen - ters is a common practice in numerous countries throughout Asia. Estimates of how many people are undergoing compulsory drug detention at any one time in China range from 300,000 to half a million. As many as 60,000 people are interned annually in drug detention centers in Vietnam. Thousands more are detained in centers in Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, Laos, Burma, Mexico and Russia.135 If prohibition is so harmful, one must ask if there are some benefits to this policy. An important value of prohibition identified by Babor et al16 is that it \"pre - vents large-scale corporate entities from promoting drug sales through modern marketing techniques\". Having a product categorized as \"legal\", without ade - quate information about potential harms, can also send messages that substances are safe, quality is as - sured, and that labelling is accurate, as was demon - strated in New Zealand with the experience of benzylpiperazine-containing party pills.85 Prohibit - ing a substance does send a message of social disap - proval of use, while a legal status can send an opposite message, but the value of using prohibition to send a message to dissuade use must be weighed against the harmful consequences of implementing prohibition, and the utility of other measures that are less harmful to individuals than criminalization. \"As it currently exists, the international cannabis prohibition regime by its nature and functioning imposes substantial personal and social harms.\" Room et al19 \"The implementation of prohibition is also coun - terproductive to the pursuit of fundamental human rights and freedoms.\" Barrett et al42 \"In Vancouver an estimated 70 percent of criminal activity is associated with illicit drugs ... With drugs as its primary source of revenue, organized crime has intimidated police officers, judges, juries and correctional officers. Such intimidation is a direct threat to Canada's philosophy of peace, order, and good government ...

The evidence is clear that prohibition has failed to achieve its intended goals, the loftiest of which is the United Nations General As - sembly Special Session (UNGASS) 1998 slogan of a \"A drug free world - we can do it!\".88 On a more pragmatic level prohibition is a failure, as it is unable, except very briefly, to reduce the availability or increase the price of drugs.41, 89 In the February 2010 Na - tional Drug Threat Assess - ment it was reported that \"Overall, the availability of illicit drugs in the United States is increasing. In fact, in 2009 the prevalence of four of the five major drugs - heroin, metham - phetamine, cannabis, and MDMA (3,4-methylene - dioxymethamphetamine) - was widespread and in - creasing in some areas.\" 90 Notably, from 1989-2004 cannabis lifetime use in Canada increased from 23% to 44% of the population, and past year use increased from 6.5% to 14.1%. For injectable drugs, lifetime use increased from 1.7 million in 1994 to a little more than 4.1 million in 2004, and past year use increased from 132,000 in 1994 to 269,000 in 2004.32 |Appendix | \"The problems created by drugs control policies have turned out to be much larger than those they intended to solve. The immense global harm caused by the prohibition of drugs to public health, sound economy, sustainable development and community safety is well documented but insufficiently un - derstood by policy makers, mass media, and consequently the general public\" European Coalition for Just and Effective Drug Policies 87 |53 |Growing Su pport for Change A p p e n d i x 4 There is clear indication that many countries are in - crementally moving away from indiscriminate drug prohibition and that there is increasing public support for this change. A 2010 poll by A ngus Reid found that a majority of Canadians (53%) support the legalization of cannabis, with people in British Columbia (61%), Alberta (59%) and Ontario (57%) holding the highest level of sup - port. In contrast, support for legalization of other drugs, such as ecstasy, crack cocaine, powder cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine or \"crystal meth\" was less than 10%.91 US statistics are similar, with a 2009 survey indicating 53% of Americans were in favour of cannabis legalization; and 68% believed the 'War on Drugs\" has been a failure.92 In a recent California ballot proposition 46% of voters were in favour of a measure that would allow individ - uals age 21 or older to possess and cultivate limited amounts of cannabis for personal use; and allow state and local governments to authorize, regulate, and tax commercial cannabis-related activities under certain conditions.93 In 2005 the City of Vancouver recommended \"That the Federal Government initiate a process of reviewing Canada's legislative, regulatory and policy frameworks governing illegal drugs with regard to their effective - ness in preventing and reducing harm from proble m - atic drug use and their effectiveness in enabling municipalities to better address the harm from the sale and use of these substances at the local level AND es - tablish a process with broad participation to cons ider regulatory alternatives to the current policy of prohi - bition for currently illegal drugs.\" 74 They also recommended \"That the Federal Govern - ment implement further legislative changes to create a legal regulatory framework for cannabis in order to en -able municipalities to develop comprehensive cannabis strategies that promote public health objec - tives, include appropriate regu latory controls for cannabis related products, and support the develop - ment of public education approaches to cannabis use and related harm based on best evidence.\" 74 This support is also reflected in the media as many newspaper editorial boards have now announced their position against prohibition and in favour of signifi - cant change: The Vancouver Sun stated that it was their editorial board's opinion that \" ... many countries recognize the folly of the war on drugs, and are, therefore, open to discussing legalization and regulation. Canada is particularly well suited to promoting such discus - sions\" 94 . The Sun recently featured an article titled \"It just makes sense to end the war on drugs\" and stated \"The shootings and the deaths of the last few weeks underscore the need to reform our drug laws\" 95 . The Province Newspaper editorial board took a sim - ilar stand, stating \"In our opinion legalization needs study\". They observed that historically the Province had opposed the legalization of drugs, but now be - lieved that \"it's time legalization was given due con - sideration by our governments \"96 . The Chilliwack Progress asked \"is it time for society to rethink its drug laws?\" and explored the benefits of ending prohibition.97 The Surrey Leader stated that we need \" ... a focused examination and debate on ending the massively ex - pensive and ineffective war on drugs - particularly marijuana. Prohibition is not working. It merely fuels the insanely profitable illicit drug trade and creates the bloody havoc being wrought on our streets.\"98 |54 |The Times Colonist in Victoria is repetitive in its ed - itorials against prohibition. They state \"It's time to begin legalizing and controlling distribution as part of an entirely new approach to reducing the damage done by guns.\" 99 and \"Enforcement is only part of the solution ... legalization of drugs to remove the gang's source of profits ... and other measures are all needed.\" 100 and \"Too much of our drug policy has been based on myth, ideology and wishful think - ing\" 101 . The National Post had a full page article with a head - line that simply stated \"Legalize Drugs. Put the gangs out of business\" and continued with \" ... we need to embark on drug legalization, which will starve the gangs of their principle oxygen supply.\" 102 All of these articles were preceded by Dan Gardner's Ottawa Citizen detailed and lengthy 13 part analysis of the failure of the drug war. This serie s was picked up by other newspapers across the country.103 This sig - nificant shift in local media reporting is reflected in many other countries around the globe.104-107 Physicians have also been advocating for change for many years. In a 2001 editorial in the Canadian Med - ical Association Journal discussing the harms of cannabis and its criminalization the editor twice stated that possession of small amounts of cannabis for per - sonal use should be decriminalized.108 The recent vig - orous and ongoing debate abo ut introducing mandatory minimum jail sentences for drug offences to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act is a good ex - ample of the ongoing concerns about prohibition.109 The Law Commission in New Zealand has recently conducted a comprehensive review 4of their Misuse of Drugs Act and have concluded that it needs a major overhaul to reflect more of a health rather than crim - inal perspective, including: A presumption against imprisonment whenever the circumstances indicate that a drug offence was com - mitted in a personal use context. The supply by drug users of small amounts of drugs with no significant element of commerciality (\"so - cial dealing\") is entirely different from commercial dealing A mandatory cautioning scheme for all personal possession and use offences that come to the atten - tion of the police, removing minor drug offenders from the criminal justice system and providing greater opportunities for those in need of treatment to access it. A full scale review of the current drug classification system which is used to determine restrictiveness of controls and severity of penalties, addressing exist - ing inconsistencies and focusing solely on assess - ing a drug's risk of harm, including social harm. In commenting on an article in the British Medical Journal by Stephen Rolles 23 that \"calls on us to envis - age an alternative to the hopelessly failed war on drugs\" the editor stated \"I agree, that we must regulate drug use, not criminalise it\". This sentiment was supported shortly after by one of the UK's leading doctors, Sir Ian Gilmore, former president o f the Royal College of Physicians who said that the government should con - sider decriminalising drugs because the blanket ban has failed to cut crime or improve health.110 |Appendix |In the US there are signs of changes in messaging, w ith the new Obama administration Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy (the \"drug czar\") Gil Kerlikowske, in commenting about the war on drugs: \"In the grand scheme, it has not been successful. Forty years later, the concern about drugs and drug prob - lems is, if anything, magnified, intensified.\" 113 The importance of moving soon to a public health ap - proach to alcohol has been recentl y identified by the World Health Organization.114 At the global level, an urgent call by the recently estab - lished Global Commission on Drug Policy, a group of world leaders including former country presidents and the former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan called for \"fundamental reforms in national and global drug control policies\" 5including: \"End the criminalization, marginalization and stigmatization of people who use drugs but who do no harm to others.Encourage experimentation by governments with models of legal regulation of drugs (especially cannabis) to undermine the power of organized crime and safeguard the health and security of their citizens. Ensure that a variety of treatment modalities are available - including not just methadone and buprenorphine treatment but also the heroin-as - sisted treatment programs that have proven suc - cessful in many European countries and Canada. Apply human rights and harm reduction principles and policies both to people who use drugs as well as those involved in the lower ends of illegal drug mar - kets such as farmers, couriers and petty sellers.\" 115 Peter McKnight agrees with Kleiman's point of view, stating \"We will not likely see a decrease in drug use, but we will see an increase in prison populations, which will place an additional bur - den on taxpayers. And worst of all, there's reason to be - lieve we will also see an in - crease in drug-related violence ... For as the litera - ture demonstrates, the war on drugs is a war on us.\" 112 |55 ||Appendix | U.S. works to re duce prison population as Canada boosts sentences Improved targeting of police resources is a theme explored in depth by Mark Kleiman, a professor of public policy at UCLA whose latest book, \"When Brute Force Fails: How to ha ve less crime and less punishm ent\" is being published later this month.

If people mostly get away with [crime] but occasionally get creamed, they're going to keep doing it.\" He advocates sharply targeting police activities while ramping back stiff U.S. prison sentences. \"Not only is certainty and swiftness [of conviction] more im - portant than severity, severity is the enemy of certainty and swiftness,\" said Kleiman. 111 Learning fro m the Experience with Alcohol and Tobacco A p p e n d i x 5 Public health oriented approaches to tobacco have been increasing, such as measures directed at the sale and use of tobacco products (e.g. elimination of \"power walls\", prohibiting advertising of tobacco in vendors, prohibiting smoking indoors and in cars with chil- dren). On April 29, 2010 Australia announced it will force tobacco companies to use plain packaging with no logos or colours on its products:116 \"Crack ing D own o n Cigarette Adv ertis ing In a world first, all cigarettes will be sold in plain pack - aging by 1 July 2012. This will remove one of the last remaining frontiers for cigarette advertising, and was a key recommendation of the National Preventative Health Taskforce. The legislation will restrict or prohibit: Tobacco industry logos Brand imagery Colours Promotional text other than brand and product names in a standard colour, position, font style and size. The Government will develop and test package design that will make cigarettes less appealing, particularly to young people. Graphic health warnings will be updated and ex - panded. Research shows that industry branding and packaging design reduce the effecti veness of graphic health warnings on tobacco products. The National Preventative Health Taskforce concluded that \"there can be no justification for allowing a ny form of promotion for this uniquely dangerous and addictive product which it is illegal to sell to children\", including packaging. The Government will also legislate to restrict Australian internet advertising of tobacco products, bringing the in - ternet into line with restrictions already in place in other media.\" 116 Regulation of the quality of tobacco, additives, and cul- tivation standards has been notable by its absence. The consequences of historically regulating tobacco from a commercial perspective are well documented. More than 45 years after the US Surgeon General pub - lished his landmark paper on smoking and health 117 the proportion of the population smoking has dropped from the 50-60% range in the 1960s to 18% in 2008 33, 117 which is laudable. However the total number of smok - ers in Canada and in BC has barely shrunk due to the population growth since 1965. Table 3 shows that since 1965 the number of smokers in BC has only dropped by about 37,000, and in fact there has been an increase in the number of female smokers. For Canada a simi - lar picture is evident, except that the number of female smokers has declined, albeit marginally, compared to male smokers. This is not to negate the very important gains made by decreasing the percentage of smokers, which really is a success. The main points are that the total burden from smoking related diseases is still very substantial because of the persistently large number of smokers and the quantities of tobacco being smoke, and there is much more that needs to be done to re - duce this burden. |56 |While reducing the percentage of smokers in the pop - ulation is important, the total numbers indicate a sub - stantial, unacceptable and preventable future burden of death and illness. The number of tobacco vendor s is substantial (5900 in BC in 2010 118 ) which certainly contributes to the ongoing availability of tobacco. In developing countries, which are least able to deal with the health impacts of tobacco, the trends are particu - larly worrisome: \"The burden of tobacco use is great - est in low- and middle-income countries, and wil l increase more rapidly in these countries in coming decades.\" 119 The commoditization of alcohol is another example. The failure to use a public health approach to alcohol results in substantial death, disease, disability and sig -nificant social problems.18 In fact, alcohol has been going through a period of deregulation, such that in BC the availability for alcohol rapidly increased from 786 retail liquor stores in 2002 to 1294 retail liquor stores in 2008.120 In this report the BC Provincial Health Of - ficer concluded \"Overall, alcohol is confirmed as a major source of health and social harms and costs, and it appears as though the concerns expressed in the 2002 PHO report about the effects of increased access leading to greater consumption have been confirmed. The evidence also suggests that the growth in con - sumption has translated into concomitant increases in some health and social harms, notably indicators of al- cohol-related road trauma and, to a lesser extent, hos - pitalizations attributable to alcohol use.\" |57 |Table 3, lleefftt: Total smokers in BC and Canada by year |Appendix | Current Smokers Aged 15+ 1965 2008 # Change % #%# since 1965 British Columbia Males 57.4 359,535 16.6 derive population estimates of smokers from: Statistics Canada, Ottawa.

In Drug Policy and the Public Good Babor et al16 have recently summarized the evidence about illegal drug policies. In addition, the UK based group Transform has pro - duced the book by Rolles et al After the War on Drugs: Blueprint for Regulation 17 , that provides a regulatory framework and models for different classes of sub - stances, and which has been helpful in developing the proposals in this paper. In the recently published book Cannabis Policy: Moving Beyond Stalemate Room et al19 summarize the world lit - erature on cannabis policy. This book proposes a Framework Convention on Cannabis Control based on the World Health Organization-sponsored United Nations Framework Convention on Tobacco Control . A number of countries have attempted to move away from indiscriminate prohibition in relation to pos - session and use. Room et al19 describes four categories of cannabis use control reforms: Depenalization prohibition with cautioning or diver - sion (France, Australia, Canada, Britain, a number of US states, and Brazil). Decriminalization prohibition with civil penalties, i.e. fines and administrative sanctions (Belgium, Italy, Czech Republic, Portugal, Denmark, Australia). De facto legalization i.e. prohibition with an expedi - ency principle - laws are not enfor ced at select stages (The Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Spain).De jure legalization i.e. explicit laws that permit use (Alaska, Colombia, Switzerland, India, Spain, US state and Canada medical cannabis laws). In Latin America some significant changes have oc - curred. The Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy co-chaired by the former presidents of Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia called for a paradigm shift in drug policies: \"Evaluate from a public health standpoint and on the basis of the most advanced med - ical science the convenience of decriminalizing the possession of cannabis for personal use.\" 121 In August 2009 Mexican legislation provided for referral for treatment for small amounts of possession for per - sonal use, rather than criminalization. In 2009 the Supreme Court of Argentina ruled it is unconstitu - tional to punish people for possessing cannabis for personal consumption.19 Similar reforms to address supply have been much more limited, and proposals rely on systems in which all cultivation, sale, and supply of cannabis would be controlled or regulated by the government, carrying out an active monopoly for cannabis production and distribution which resembles the systems by which al- cohol production and dissemination are handled.19 Historically, the Netherlands has been a leading coun - try in public health-based drug policy reform. Cannabis has been de facto legalized for over 30 years and is sold openly in \"coffee shops\" to adults (over the age of 18) with volume restrictions and no advertising for either consumption or take home use. Coffee shops do not sell alcohol and the only other substance sold is |58 |caffeine. The Netherlands' reductions in criminal penalties appear to have had little effect on cannabis use.19 However it has been suggested that some in - crease in use was associated with increased commer - cial access with a growth in numbers of coffee shops and visible promotion especially in counter culture media.19 The Dutch coffee shops appear to have sepa - rated the cannabis market from other illegal drug mar - kets (except that increasing age restriction may have diverted youth to illegal markets and the production of cannabis has not been addressed). The evidence for the success of the approach has been in the relatively low Dutch cannabis use rates (in 2005 lifetime use for people age 15-64 years was estimated at 23%, compared to the 2004 Canada estimate of 44%; the Dutch past-year use rate in 2005 was 5.4% compared to the 2004 Canada estimate of 14.1%) 122, 32 and low drug associated health and social problems.123 This is consistent with the global analysis of drug use patterns where it can be observed that consumption levels vary independently of severity of drug laws.48 Portugal has also made significant contributions to drug policy reform as in 2001 they were the first coun - try to completely decriminalize all drug use. The Por - tuguese realized that the problems associated with substances were significant and that \"the principal ob - stacles to effective government policies to manage th e problems were the treatment barriers and resource drain imposed by the criminalization regime\" 51 . The fears of opponents that this would result in increased health and social problems did not materialize. In fact the opposite has occurred; decriminalization does not appear to have had an adverse effect on drug usage rates, and \"drug related pathologies - such as sexually transmitted diseases and deaths due to drug usage have decreased dramatically\" 51 . For example HIV notifica - tion among drug users decli ned from 1400/year to 400/year between 2000 and 2006, whil e non-drug users saw hardly any effect - from 1250/year to 1150 per year. For the same period drug-related deaths de - clined from close to 400 to 290. Other reviewers came to similar conclusions i.e. that decriminalization in Portugal did not lead to major increases in drug use and that the evidence indicates reductions in prob - lematic use, drug related harms, and criminal justice overcrowding.8In a movement away from the criminal justice ap - proach, in 2009 the Czech government decriminalized personal possession of small amounts of heroin, co - caine, amphetamine, cannabis, ecstasy and psyche - delics.124 In 2005 New Zealand amended its Misuse of Drugs Act to allow for a new restricted substances regime to regulate access to psychoactive substances that pose a less than moderate risk of harm. Changes included a minimum purchase age of 18, prohibitions of free-of-charge dis - tribution and of advertisement of restricted substances in certain media. The government subsequently passed the Misuse of Drugs (Restricted Substance) Regulations 2008 which placed further controls on places from which restricted substances can be sold or supplied, the signage that must be displayed, and the advertising, labelling, packaging and storing of re - stricted substances.125, 126 Benzylpiperazine-contain - ing party pills (BZP) were included as restricted substances with the 2005 amendment. However in 2008 BZP, phenylpiperazine and related substances were classified as controlled drugs, making it illegal to manufacture, import, export, supply, purchase, pos - sess, and use these substances.85 Currently there are no restricted substances. In British Columbia a new Public Health Act has been developed which allows for defining a broad range of trades, businesses and other activities as \"regulated activities\" if they pose risks to health; and allows for regulating conditions, things, or activities as either health hazards or health impediments.127 Use of this Act to regulate substances and activities associated with them is possible but has not yet been explored. While evaluations of these reforms have been limited in quantity and quality and generaliz ing from one country to another is difficult, in general evaluations of reforms has found that changes in penalties do not affect cannabis use and that trends in cannabis use ap - pear to be independent of penalties. However reforms do reduce adverse consequences of prohibition be - cause costs to individuals are reduced by lesser penal- ties.19 However these beneficial effects have been noted to be undercut by net widening of police activity and discriminatory application of enforcement.19 |59 ||Appendix |Proposed Policy Goals and Objectives by Sector A p p e n d i x 7 Health Sector Goal: Minimize substance related morbidity and mor - tality.

With regards to regulatory strategies, the \"life cycle\" and business model that supplies the substance to the consumer needs con - sideration. Of particular importance will deciding whether substances are supplied using largely \"for profit\" business models, or largely \"public interest\" models as described earlier. The following provides some questions to be consid - ered for the regulation of each substance category. Th e answers to each question will need to be analyzed ac - cording to the policy framework principles, and with respect to how the answer options meet the policy goals and objectives. Public health based regulation would include the entire spectrum of psychoactive substance manageme nt (growth/production, wholesaling, marketing and dis - tribution, retailing, prescribing, information provi - sion, taxation, and consumption). The follow questions are organized based on the de - terminants of harms and benefits of substances model (Figure 3, pg 17).Availability Governance, Business Model, Wholesale, Distribution and Revenue Should any business model other than public interest wholesaling, marketing and distribution* be allowed? Should marketers be re - quired to support preven - tion and minimization of the harmful effects of their product? If so, how? To where do revenues to government from sales and taxation flow? Should taxation levels be set to ensure that revenue is commensurate with the cost of harms to society? Should taxation revenue be targeted to prevent and re - duce the harmful effects of problematic substance use? Should taxation revenue be used for general revenues? Retailing - Purchase to Take Away and On-site Consumption What are the licensing and training of staff/operators requirements? What limitations will be placed on hours of operation, distance from schools? \" ... there is no doubt that making a market legal greatly increases the mechanisms available to the state for regulating it. And those who hold a license or other permission from the state to operate in the legal market have a shared interest in putting the illegal actors out of business.\" Room et al 19 *E.g. Wholesaling, marketing, and distribution only through a dedicated agency that has pr imarily a health promot ion, protection, and harm minimisation charter. This would allow for control of the form and contents of, and information about, substances to minimise harms, manage the supply in ways that remove promotions, and provide incentives t o develop less harmful products.|62 |What combinations of substances will be allowed to be sold by a single retailer? What information must retailers provide as part of the sales about appropriate use, harms benefits, and re - sources for help if problems arise from use? Accessibility Age What is the legal age of sale/purchase? What is the minimum age for staff to work in retail outlets? Price, Taxation and Other Financial Controls How should prices be regulated to prevent pricing being used as a promotion of products, and as a method of influencing access and consumption? How should taxation be used as a public health meas - ure to affect price and there by patterns of use? Prescription Should some substances only be available by pre - scription? What regulations are needed to reduce diversion of prescribed drugs, while not adversely affecting appro - priate medical care? Demand Information and Educational Requirements What information and education should be required to be provided regarding substances? What labelling, warning, and other packaging is re - quired to protect public health? What information do marketers have to provide about appropriate use, harms, benefits, and r esources for help if problems arise from use. Should marketers bear a liability for withholding in - formation about harms, misleading consumers, or for the health and social costs of their substances? What educational programs should be required of school boards? Product Promotion Should any advertising, promotion, or sponsorship be permitted, and if so, under what conditions? If promotion is permitted in exceptional circum - stances for reasons of low harm potential (e.g. some caffeine products), what restrictions are required? Should retailers be allowed to engage in promotional activities? Supply -Growth, Production and Product Should individuals be allowed to grow, produce, or ac - quire the substance for their own personal use? What restrictions on growth/production should be im - posed to mitigate potential adverse impacts of such ac - tivities on family, neighbours, and community? Should individuals be permitted to sell or otherwise trade substances that they have grown, produced, or acquired? Should larger scale growth/production be allowed for selling or otherwise distributing substances? Should growers/producers be public sector or private sector owned and operated? What standards should exist for growers/producers? e.g. quality control, standards, risk minimization to consumer. Purchase, Consumption, and Use What age and other restrictions should be established to protect children and youth? What behaviours should be subject to penalties and criminal sanctions? E.g. impaired driving or impaired operation other machinery, exposure of others to smoke.|Appendix ||63 |Example Government Monopoly-type Business and Governance ModelA p p e n d i x 9 Articles 23, 26 and 28 of the 1961 UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the first of three international con - ventions which governs il- legal substances, requires that government monopo - lies be established if a country cultivates cannabis, coca or opium poppies to control the \"importing, export - ing, wholesale trading and maintaining stocks\" 128 (see Appendix 9). Public interest business models for all substances could be similar to government al cohol monopolies, which were originally established to control alcohol re - lated harms. This model could be overseen and imple - mented by an \"arms length\" provincial level body (hereafter called the \"Commission\"). However it would differ from exclusively for profit corporations in that it would have primarily a disease and injury pre - vention, health promotion, protection, and harm min - imization charter. The Commission would be charged with supply con - trol, demand reduction, and legislation implementa - tion. The mandate would be to act in the best interests of the public and to facilitate the provision of sub - stances to consumers in such a manner that minimize s the health and social consequences of consumption, while allowing for the realization of potential benefits, on a cost recovery basis to the province.Public service delivery or - ganizations at arm's length accountable to government through a minister already exist, such as the BC re - gional health authorities, BC Housing, BC Transit, Community Living BC, and the BC Legal Services So - ciety. The Commission would operate in an arm's length fashion from normal government operations to allow for stability and clarity of focus. It would also op - erate on a cost recovery \"non profit\" basis to ensure a health rather than profit generation focus, with costs to be recovered as discussed below. Many government ministries have a shared interest in effective regulation and control of substances. There - fore the Commission staff will report to a board com - posed of people appointed by the ministers responsible for health, public safety, local government, education, child and family development, income as - sistance, public safety, agriculture, environment and finance. It would be accountable to the minister re - sponsible for health in reflection of its primary man - date. It will be essential to avoid possible regulatory \"cap - ture\" of the system by industry (see Borland 55 ) by in - cluding requirements for all board members and ministers involved to provide disclosure statements regarding financial or other interests in substances. Those with such interests would not be allowed to par - ticipate as part of the governing system.\"A state monopoly or licensing regime gives the state strong tools to control the market.\" Room et al 19 |64 |The Commission would be advised by people who use, produce, distribute, and retail substances, local gov - ernments, experts in public health, mental health, ad - dictions, social services, public, youth and children, education, business, agriculture, spirituality, aborig - inal issues, environmental issues, criminal justice services, monitoring, inspection, administrative sanc - tions, enforcement, marketing and product promo - tion, and prosecution. To maintain control of supply the Commission would be the only wholesaling organization authorized to purchase substances from growers or import to the province. It will be the only source of product for dis - tribution to retailers. This model is similar to the BC Liquor Distribution Branch, which under the author - ity of the Liquor Distribution Act , has the sole right to purchase beverage alcohol, both in and out of British Columbia. The Liquor Distribution Branch is respon - sible for the importation, distribution and retailing of beverage alcohol in British Columbia.129 The Commission would be also be responsible for overseeing implementation of requirements on for - mulation and packaging of substances for retailers. The Commission may operate retail outlets itself, or it may distribute substances to licensed retailers. Government revenues from the sale and taxation will flow to the Commission which will use the funds to: Cover the costs of running the Commission; Pay for the wholesale and distribution costs; Pay for evaluation costs (process and impact moni - toring and best practice research); Invest in demand reduction, prevention, education and treatment programs including initiatives which target the social determinants of problematic sub - stance use; and Supplement general government revenues once the above costs are covered.|Appendix ||65 |United Nations Single Convention Articles A p p e n d i x 1 0 Article 4 General Obligations The parties shall take such legislative and administra - tive measures as may be necessary: a) To give effect to and carry out the provisions of this Convention within their own territories; b) To co-operate with other States in the execution of the provisions of this Convention; and c) Subject to the provisions of this Convention, to limit exclusively to medical and scientific purposes the pro - duction, manufacture, export, import, distribution of, trade in, use and possession of drugs.

This includes federal, aboriginal, provin - cial, territorial, and local governments. Local governments have a particularly important role as they are front and centre in addressing the chal- lenges posed to their communities by substances. Provincial and federal governments establish laws and policies that affect what happens in local communi - ties, but are often distant when unintended conse - quences appear. Local governments often have innovative ideas and solutions as they are close to the action, are aware of community needs and concerns and have the flexibility to take action on local situa - tions. For example, the City of Vancouver has produced a number of important documents and undertaken many actions regarding substances related issues (see vancouver.ca/fourpillars/ comm_dpp.ht m ). Cookie cut - ter, one size fits all solutions from higher levels of gov - ernment are sometimes more of a problem than a solution for local governments. The provincial government is primarily responsible for health, education, social services and the criminal justice system (except for federal correctional institu - tions and national policing). It could play a primary role in developing new public health oriented delivery and regulatory structures and processes for prohibited substances based on provincial experience in dealing with alcohol and tobacco. Intra-provincial government approaches will be essential because of the far reach - ing impact of substances on numerous government ministries. Aboriginal governments are rapidly evolving and play - ing an increasingly important role in the governance landscape in Canada. The impacts of substances on their populations have been disproportionate, their abilities to influence substances availability and pat - terns of use should not be underestimated, and the need to include them in all discussions about sub - stances regulation is essential. The federal role will continue to be important in pub - lic health promotion, monitoring, evaluation, inter - national reporting, governing imports and exports, aligning the criminal law with public health and human rights imperatives, and synthesizing provincial per - spectives to represent Canada on the international stage. Key will be putting into place federal processes that enable management of currently prohibited sub - stances by the provinces. For example an historical precedence was the change in the federal gambl ing control law which gave control of gambling to the provinces.56 A similar example in the US is state level management of medical cannabis (currently in 16 states* and the District of Columbia 62 ). One of the challenges of the current federal/pro vin - cial/local division of powers is that federal powers are particularly dominant when dealing with illegal sub - stances, whereas provincial and local governments are the primary agencies that deal with the costs of the consequences of the predominantly prohibitionist regime. From a jurisdictional point of view the problem is that while the provinces are responsible for most of the health care, social services, policing and pro vincial *Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, M ontana, New Jer sey, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington |68 |criminal justice service costs, it is the federal legisla - tion that is engendering many of these costs. For ex - ample, some of the health care co sts due to the emphasis on prohibition include costs due to hospi - talizations, outpatient treatment of drug use related in - fections (HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B and C, skin infections, heart valve infections), emergency care and hospital- izations due to overdoses, and treatment of violent in - juries due to drug related confrontations. To rebalance this it could be helpful to work out the provincial costs due to the prohibitionist approach; compare that to the costs, and the potential taxes and other revenues anticipated under a regulated reg ime, and propose that the federal government reimburse provinces for the difference that is due to the imple - mentation of federal prohibition laws. A parallel to this is the concept of recovering tobacco associated health care costs from the tobacco companies who are re - sponsible for causing the expenses. In summary, local, aboriginal, and provincial regula - tion and innovation should be supported and encour - aged. Federal regulation should be focussed on those issues for which federal regulation is necessary or clearly superior for the public interest. International agreements such as the international drug conventions, trade treaties, and human rights treaties are also relevant. These are guided by the United Nations, which was created in large part to sup - port human rights, with one of the four founding pur - poses being \"To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fun - damental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion;\" 130 . The UN focus on human rights provides the justifica - tion to the international community for moving to a public health based regulated market model of sub - stances control. International agreements which sup - port human rights should always be seen as pre-eminent over other treaties that govern sub - stances. For a detailed discussion of this issue see Bar - rett 42 . The UN Single Convention dealing with substances, in article 4 limits \"exclusively to medical and scientific purposes the production, manufacture, export, im - port, distribution of, trade in, use and possession of drugs\" 128 and thus has a dichotomous perspective - substances are either prohibited or may be made avail- able for medical and scientific purposes (see excerpt in Appendix 9). However, as stated in Barbor et al16 the reality is that substances are also used \"for staying awake and alert, improving physiological or physical performance, sleeping better, having better sex, and sensory enhancement. Restricting availability to the prescription regime means that these uses are either medicalized or illegitimized. The result has been a very broad medicalization of activities and conditions of daily life.\" The consequences have been increased pressure on governments to pay both for more and greater quantities of medications, as well to pay the en - forcement costs of the prohibition policy in addition to the costs of the medical system. |Appendix ||69 |Opposition to Change A p p e n d i x 1 2 Proposals for revision of substances policies towards the incorporation of public health oriented approaches have commonly resulted in significant opposition .While a healthy debate is clearly needed, there must be greater recognition of the role that special interests (e.g. alcohol and tobacco industry, law enforcement lobby groups, pharmaceutical companies, the media, organized crime etc) will likely play in potentially op - posing modernization in this area. This derives from the fact that many benefit from the existing approach and will support continued prohibition and commer - cialization of tobacco and alcohol. The police, judicial system workers, and the correctional system have seen much additional work, and many of their jobs were created as a result of the current approaches. Some have made the argument that, to some extent, the RCMP owe their existence to the fact that they have ad - vocated for the drug war.31 However, there are those within the enforcement sector (such as Law Enfo rce - ment Against Prohibition leap.cc ) who are starting to speak out on the benefits of a regulated approach. The international illegal drug industry will likely be powerful in its efforts to maintain the status quo, fight - ing to maintain profits, and there could be large re - sources behind these efforts. This corrupting influence will not necessarily be easy to detect except that the underlying strategy will be to maintain prohi - bition of production, manufacture, and distribution.As experience has shown, the legal substances indus - try is another barrier to a public health approach. The tobacco, alcohol, and phar - maceutical industries work very hard and invest large amounts of money in maxi - mizing profits even when the adverse effects of their products are clearly known.131, 132 They will also likely fear competition from the regulation and potential shift in use from their products to currently illegal sub - stances. In view of the substantial business interests in promo - tion, and the potential implications for promotion of other products that have negative health effects (i.e. unhealthy foods, dangerous products) opposition to the suggestion of prohibiting promotion is likely and in fact may be very challenging or take unexpected forms to protect business interests. The Quebec pro - hibition of advertising to children under age 13 is an example of the ability to take this action, which has been upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada to be a justifiable limitation on free speech rights.133 There will be those who predict that addictive drug use and harms will spiral out of control. Arguments will be used which will be similar to those that predicted an increase in social disorder and drug use before the opening of Vancouver's supervised injection site (In - Site). In retrospect it is clear that the actual effect of InSite was the opposite of the dire predictions.72 \"No doubt, among the many factors responsibl e for the disjunction between scientific fact and public policy are the overwhelming influences of money and lobbying.\" Battin et al 68 |70 |There will be fears with regards to increasing youth use. As pointed out earlier, the legal nature of ben - zylpiperazine-containing party pills (BZP) in New Zealand sent mixed messages to youth, in part because of the partial application of the full potential range of regulations.85 Parents will raise the concern that moving the legal sta - tus of substances from prohibited to regulated signals a change in messaging to youth. Some parents rely on the illegal nature of substances to support their admo - nitions. Maintaining a legal age for consumption will support parents in this regard, without having to re - sort to criminalizing personal behaviour that is not a threat to others. \"Sending the wrong message\" can be interpreted in two ways:19 From an instrumental perspective - that cannabis use will rise. The policy impact literature indicates this will not happen.19 From an expressive perspective - that it is the duty of government to identify appropriate behaviours. This is not subject to empiric test but subject to con - siderations of ethics and human rights and subject to balance test - does criminalization of a widely en - gaged in behaviour undercut the overall rule of law.19 When proposals are made to \"send a message\" by using the law it is important to determine the motivation of the proposal and evaluate it according to these tests, particularly because of the unintended consequences that may result. The reality is that illegal substances are readily available in schools and communities and youth are well aware of the dishonesty of the prohibi - tion message. Youth are also aware of the substantial numbers of adults who have used, and who continue to use substances. Regulating substances as described in this paper will not prevent youth use, but age restrictions on purchase and the tightly controlled nature of the outlets will limit that access and \"send the right message\" of honesty, care and concern. Removing the taboo and the attrac - tive nature of substances, and regulating products, ac - tually sends a mature and constructive message: \"that these are worrisome enough products to warrant very careful regulation\". This will assist in making sub - stances uninteresting to youth. As protection of the health of young people by includ - ing measures to delay onset of use of substances will be important, it is anticipated that minimum age of purchase and restrictions of sales to youth below a cer - tain age will be features of a new model. However, hav - ing prohibitions related to age will pose challenges due to the creating of an illegal market of sales to underage youth. Risks of this approach include bringing youth into contact with those who would exploit them, unsu - pervised consumption experiences, and potential con - sumption of adulterated substances. While it is expected that having a legal age of purchase and sale will reduce age of uptake and regu lar use, other measures will need to be in place to support par - ents and youth who choose to use substances to make the transition from being an \"underage\" non-user to being an age permitted purchaser. These could include intergenerational education, graduated licensing for vehicle operation with initial very strict limits on sub - stance use and driving, and allowance for underage consumption in supervised situations. Careful analysis is needed to determine the risks and benefits of setting an appropriate legal age of purchase. Factors to consider are the potential to increase harms by having the age of purchase too closely linked to the age of leaving home (hence reduced parental supervi - sion), and the potential to increase risk of dependency and poor school performance by setting too young an age of purchase. Protective factors in the model in this paper are the proposed limits on availability and ac - cess; and the lack of product promotion. This approach will substantially reduce the connection of youth with the current criminal underworld that supplies them and puts them at risk of becoming en - gaged or impacted by criminal activity. This will be very different from the current situation where youth ob - tain drugs from a criminal marketplace to use and sell to each other with no restrictions.|Appendix |To address pa rents' con - cerns it will be essential to ensure that children and youth receive honest, factual and objective information about substances and have opportunities to learn skills to assist them in avoiding problem substance use. Youth also need to have ad - equate support services availabl e if they do find they are developing problems associated with substances. Concerns about potential increases in population lev - els of consumption and a subsequent increase in ad - verse population health effects wi ll be raised. While the evidence is reassuring that with a comprehensive public health approach this will not happen, careful monitoring will provide policy makers and the public detailed information about the impact of changes in order to determine whether these concerns are being realized. Failure to adequately regulate is a risk and lax regula - tions on sellers, reliance on self-regulation, and al-lowing promotion by indus - try driven commercial in - terests are lessons learned from alcohol and tobacco that are likely to produce undesirable outcomes.19 Substance pricing needs to be competitive to illegal product and restrictions cannot be over zealous lest they re-create an ille gal market. The consequences of these changes are predicted to be far less than the consequences of continuing with the current criminal and commercial models of regulation of substances. One particular consequence that will need careful analysis is the anticipated effects of chang - ing the regulatory regime in Canada with respect to that which exists in the United States. Significant differ - ences in regimes may or may not have unintended con - sequences that will need to be anticipated and mitigation measures put in place to deal with them. |71 ||Appendix | \"A drug whose production is simple and widely available indicates the need for less restrictive regulatory mechanisms in order to challenge the economic real - ities of the illegal market.\" Mark Haden 134 Expected Bene/f_its of Public Health Oriented Regulation A p p e n d i x 1 3 With a comprehensive, evidence-informed approach to substances that includes regulatory reform based on public health and human rights principles it can be an - ticipated that harms associated with psychoactive sub - stances can be substantially reduced. Also there are many potential benefits from this model for individu - als, families, communities, and society. Such a system would bring international recognition of BC and Canada for innovation, creativity, compas - sion, and respect for human rights. In particular it is predicted that substance related morbidity and mor - tality will be reduced. It is predicted that from a health perspective there will be: Reduced risky use of substances i.e. injection, smoking during pregnancy. Reduced use of concentrated forms of substances. Delayed onset of substance use by youth. Improved performance of the health system by re - lieving it from dealing with large numbers of sub - stance related morbidity and mortality.Individual, family, and community self reliance should be improved, and discrimination, stigmatization, and marginalization related to substances should be re - duced. There will likely be: Increased engagement of marginalized citizens. Enhanced community stability. Educational attainment levels will likely be improved, including: Reduced involvement of youth in substance related activities. Reduced high school and post-secondary school problems related to substances. |72 |Public safety and public order will likely be improved. It is predicted there will be: Reduced threatening activities and public disorder. Reduced arrests and incarceration of people who are drug dependent. Reduced violent crimes due to intoxication. Reduced violence related to drug sales. Reduced organized criminal activity. Greater respect for the law and criminal justice per - sonnel. Reduced corruption of police and other officials. Reduced numbers of people with criminal records and incarcerations and attendant harms that ac - company these invasive interventions. Improved working conditions and lowered risk of occupational injury and death for police and prison workers. Enhanced performanc e of the criminal justice sys - tem by relieving it from dealing with large volumes of illegal substances related cases. Reduced personal risk to law enforcers when enter - ing grow ops, meth labs, etc.Agricultural activity could be enhanced, including: Increased agricultural production and revenues. Increased crop and product diversity. Increased agricultural work force. Environmental sustainability could be improved, through: Reduced herbicide use due to stopping herbicide applications as part of the \"war on plants\". Reduced fossil fuel use due to emphasis on local production. Reduced environmental damage from the toxic by- products of illegal labs. Increased conservation of forests from use of alter - nate crops such as hemp to produce fibre. Business activity will likely increase and scarce public resources will be used more wisely. There will be: Increased revenues to legitimate businesses. Reduced adverse effects on businesses due to fewer substance related criminal and public disorder ac - tivities. Increased tax revenues.
