St John's Wort Magical Uses and Purposes Traditionally St. John's Wort protects against thunderbolts, fire and evil spirits. It is a herb of Midsomer's Eve and is said to cure melancholy.

Healing with St John's Wort St John's Wort Physical Health Benefits St John's wort has a long tradition of use in European medicine. We believe the name goes back to John the Baptist since it blooms around the time of his feast in the Catholic Church calendar. It has been used for a variety of conditions, but the main one has been depression. HOWEVER, we must caution. This herb interferes with many modern medicines and we cannot recommend you use it in any way to treat any physical or emotional ailments by ingestion. The only use that appears safe is to use a topical cream for muscle ache.

St John's Wort for Chakra Healing St John's Wort is used to clear blockages from and balance the Solar Plexus Chakra The Solar Plexus is the energy distribution center, the first of the chakras of relationships. This chakra is located between the ribcage and navel. It controls the immune system and digestive systems. When in balance physically you have strength to fight infections, are free of allergic reactions, and are able to use the nutrients you ingest. When it is out of balance physically you will have low tolerance to infection, suffer from hormone disorders, or have low tolerance for many foods. Spiritually, when the solar plexus is in balance you are free to interpret the world through your own thoughts and emotions and not live in fear of violating the dictums of others. When the solar plexus is out of balance spiritually you will feel fear: fear of the displeasure of others, and disappointing others, or fear of subordinating your life and pleasures to the will of others. | | Notes from the Masters I've always heard of this herb but had no idea it was used for treating depression.
