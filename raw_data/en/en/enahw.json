These norms are applicable to all eligible beneficiaries opting for the vaccine, including those taking a precautionary dose each and adolescents in the 15-17 age bracket. The relaxation is significant given the sizeable number of patients recovering from flu-like symptoms at home. The majority of these people might not have taken a Covid test. \"The US Centers for Disease Control recommends Covid vaccination after recovery from flu-like illness.

Those who are close contacts without symptoms should also wait until they meet the criteria (seven-day quarantine) before getting vaccinated,\" Pujari said. This guidance also applies to people who contract Covid before getting their first, second or precautionary dose. \"People who have had known Covid exposure should not seek jab until their quarantine period of seven days has ended to avoid potentially exposing healthcare personnel and others during the vaccination visit,\" Pujari said. Maharashtra's Covid task force head Dr Sanjay Oak said, \"Those who know they are Covid positive should defer vaccination by three months.
