Photos by Karen Tapia Irvine, Calif. \u2014 In an event filled with anticipation and camaraderie, UCI Health leadership and the construction team gathered to witness the \"topping off\" of the final building at the new UCI Health \u2014 Irvine medical campus. This time-honored ceremony symbolizes the placement of the final structural beam and the completion of the building's framework. Last week, UCI Health co-workers were invited to [ inscribe their signatures ](/news/2023/07/beam-signing-ceremony)on this final beam. After dozens more construction workers added their names to the white-painted beam during Thursday's event, its journey culminated at 12:45 p.m., when it was hoisted atop the seven-story, 350,000-square-foot acute care hospital, an integral part of the new [UCI Health \u2014 Irvine](/irvine-medical-center) medical campus. UCI Health CEO Chad T. Lefteris took a moment during the ceremony to speak with more than 100 employees of Hensel Phelps, the company building the new hospital and emergency room. \"This is my favorite part,\" Lefteris told the throngs of workers and team leaders assembled for the celebration. Their efforts and dedication, he told them, will contribute to the health of future patients who will benefit from the world-class care delivered at the new medical center. \"On behalf of our 8,000 teammates and hundreds of thousands of patients, thank you so much for what you are doing and the great sense of pride you have shown.\" Watch the ceremony A potted plant, an American flag The first of two cranes then swung into action, lifting the iron girder from its signing perch \u2014 a potted plant balanced at one end, an American flag on the other \u2014 and placing it closer to the new hospital. A second crane took over, carrying the structural beam to the seventh-floor roof, where workers in hard hats and bright orange safety vests helped maneuver it into place, the plant still in place along with the flag waving in the breeze. The spiral evergreen plant honored a construction rite that originated centuries ago in Scandinavia to appease the spirits of felled trees by ensuring \"that no man-made structure was higher than one of its own,\" said Kasie Bowden, the Hensel Phelps project superintendent for the new hospital. It also served as a fitting symbol for what will be the nation's [ first all-electric hospital ](/news/2023/04/electric-carbon-neutral-hospital)and medical center, a sign of the UCI Health commitment to [minimize environmental impacts](/news/2023/05/practice-greenhealth-environmental-excellence-2023) while advancing the healthcare landscape. Improving health and well-being in OC The topping off ceremony not only marks the successful completion of the structural framework of the final building, it also brings UCI Health closer to its goal of significantly improving the health and well-being of all of the communities in Orange County. \"When we first started planning for the new cancer center in Irvine, we never even thought about building a new hospital,\" said UCI School of Medicine Dean [Dr. Michael J. Stamos](/find-a-doctor/s/michael-stamos), marveling at the iron-and-steel frame of the new hospital and the adjacent Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center and Ambulatory facility. \"This is going to be transformational,\" he predicted. \"It's going to set the standard for the rest of the country.\" About UCI Health \u2014 Irvine [UCI Health \u2014 Irvine](/irvine-medical-center), a new medical complex under construction at the north end of the UC Irvine campus, will bring unparalleled expertise and the finest evidence-based care that only an academic medical system can offer to the communities of coastal and south Orange County.
