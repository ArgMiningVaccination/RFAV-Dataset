In 2017, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) was the top pharmaceutical company and held about 24 percent of the global vaccine market by revenue. GSK is expected to maintain their position as the top company and even gain a small amount of the market until 2024. Pfizer is expected to account for some 16 percent of the global vaccine market by 2024, largely due to success with its pneumococcal vaccine, Prevnar 13. A vaccine often contains an agent that is made from a weakened form of a disease microbe, that is then used to stimulate the body's immune system to destroy and recognize the microorganism in case of later exposures.](#statisticContainer) Vaccinations market globally The vaccination market, while important to global health, is relatively smaller than other pharmaceuticals. The vaccination market is heavily regulated globally and depends heavily on the policies of donors and public purchasers. [The total global vaccination market](/statistics/943867/size-of-the-global-vaccine-market/)has been growing and expected to continue to grow. Current and projected estimates indicate that [North America holds the largest proportion](/statistics/270348/distribution-of-the-global-vaccine-market-by-region-in-2008/)of the market, followed by Europe. Vaccination spotlight: pneumococcal disease There are various vaccines for many kinds of diseases. In 2017, the [top vaccine product based on revenue](/statistics/314566/leading-global-vaccine-products-by-revenue/)was Prevnar 13 which is marketed by Pfizer and Daewoong. Prevnar is a vaccination for the prevention of invasive disease caused by certain streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes. [In the U.S., the vaccination coverage](/statistics/747365/vaccine-coverage-of-us-adults-age-65-or-older-for-select-diseases/)for pneumococcal disease among adults aged 65 and older is almost as high as the vaccination rate for influenza. Pneumonia, for example, is a serious health problem and represents one of [the top leading causes of death](/statistics/248619/leading-causes-of-death-in-the-us/)in the United States. "}
