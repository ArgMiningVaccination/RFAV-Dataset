Benefits: The benefits of Bi Gu have been proven by modern science. This group healing session will help us with the following: At this Energy Healing Transmission, Master Mu will also help us activate our Bi Gu ability to enhance our ability to survive disasters when no food is available. In addition, many people's extrasensory abilities and healing powers were activated after entering into a Bi Gu state. Bi Gu has also helped a lot of people with their spiritual awakening and transformation physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Many past students received comments like \"Wow, you look so much YOUNGER! What's your SECRET?\" Well, the SECRET will be yours soon. Sharing from Past Participants: I Lost All the Excess Weight without Effort after Remotely Taking Master Mu's Qi Gong Class for Nourishing the Spleen/Stomach/Pancreas System with Bi Gu Transmission from Nikki Vergara (Teacher), Metro Manila, the Philippines: When I took on a teaching job that I found incredibly stressful, I started gaining weight uncontrollably. I tried to manage my weight by exercising and going on diets but all my efforts were to no avail. It was when my aunt Angie enrolled me to Master Mu's Qi Gong Class for Nourishing the Spleen/Stomach/Pancreas System with Bi Gu Transmission when I started losing weight without even trying. I lost all the weight that I gained and have kept it off since. Even more, I eat what I want without gaining weight and feel much healthier now. Healer's Healer: Thank you for Master Mu's Powerful Healing for my Spleen/Stomach/Pancreas System from Vanessa Wright (Certified BodyTalk Practitioner), Sunnyvale, California: Dear Mary, I want to express my gratitude to you and Master Mu for the tremendous shifts in healing I've experienced since her class two weeks ago. Life stress had so impacted my stomach/pancreas/spleen system that I lost more than 20 pounds as well as my taste and appetite for food. After the Qi Gong class, I went home and felt a craving for a fresh green salad - every single bite tasted delicious! I also felt a positive shift in my body weight. Master Mu's class and transmission were beautiful blessings for which I am most grateful. I greatly appreciate Master Mu's continued transmission of healing energy with love. Her energy seems to be working on me as I sleep. Two nights ago, in my dreams, I met Hua Tuo, one of the attending Medical Deities who were helping us with healing of our Spleen/Stomach/Pancreas System during class. He appeared to me as a tall, slender being dressed in black. He gave me a healing by touch. It was brief but significant in that I remember it vividly and felt great peace afterwards. Last night, in a dream, I was given an acupuncture treatment by a lovely woman with lots of needles in my lower legs only, and later on I realized the lovely woman was Master Mu! I'm very much looking forward to seeing you and Master Mu again at our upcoming class soon! With much appreciation and love, Vanessa from Jasmin Shih, San Jose, California: My husband and I really enjoyed the class on Healing the Spleen/Stomach/Pancreas System with Bi Gu Transmission with Master Mu yesterday, and we really appreciated my friend Angie for telling us about Master Mu so we can learn from such a compassionate Master. I'm very excited to tell you that my 5-year-old daughter, Iris, really experienced Bi Gu transmission yesterday afternoon as a remote student. When I got home, she told me she'd been feeling so full that she didn't eat the lunch I prepared for her. And she even told me that \"someone\" had been feeding her lots of food yesterday afternoon, so that was why she didn't feel hungry. Just right before my kids went to bed this evening, I saw my 2-year-old son Hugo grabbing something from the air and putting it in his mouth, and when I asked him what he was eating, he just grabbed some from the air and fed me! I showed him the picture of Grandmaster of Chi SongZi (the attending deity of Bi Gu transmission) that I got from the class, and asked him if this was the person who gave him the food, he looked at it and said yes! It's amazing how they are just receiving it so naturally! I Feel Energized, Healthy, and More Compassionate Towards Animals Thanks to the Bi Gu Transmission from Angie Sachdeva, San Mateo, California: I used to be a meat eater, especially pork \u2014 loved anything cooked with pork. Last year when I watched Master Mu's DVD \"Qi Gong Energy Healing Transmission for Weight Loss & Detoxification with Master TianJia Mu\" on Bi Gu transmission, my love for eating meat gradually diminished. Sometimes I would eat chicken salad sandwiches, but later I was only able to eat half of the sandwich. When I was invited to friends' homes, I would only eat the vegetables in their meal. They would add more vegetables to my plate because I was unable to eat the meat portion of a meal without feeling sick. After the workshop with Master Mu on \"Healing the Spleen/Stomach/Pancreas System with Bi Gu Energy Healing Transmission to Help You Lose Excess Weight, Reverse Aging, and Increase Sustainability\" 2 weeks ago in August, I just couldn't eat meat any longer. The sight and smell of meat makes me feel sick. I am sensitive and aware of the pain the animals suffered when they were being slaughtered. Now, shopping for food is easy for me as I just go to the farmer's market. If I have to go to the grocery store, I just go straight to the produce section. Now my shopping and eating is simplified and I love it! Thank you Master Mu! I feel so energized and healthy. Angie My Hand Dermatitis Healed, My Husband Lost Weight, & My Daughter's Acne Cleared up from Jasmin Shih, San Jose, California My entire family has benefited so much from the class on \"Healing for the Lungs/Large Intestine System\", just like the last workshop on \"Healing for the Spleen/Stomach/Pancreas System with Bi Gu Transmission\". The hand dermatitis on my right index finger had been bothering me so much for the past few months because no matter what I did, nothing seemed to help heal it. I registered early for the class and started noticing that my dermatitis was starting to heal as I felt the energy being transmitted from Master Mu starting one week before the class. (Note that this makes great sense as a lot of students have received benefits corresponding to the theme of the class before the actual time of the class, while Master Mu spends weeks preparing for the class, clearing the energy blockages for all registered students and sending energy healing transmissions to them. Skin is part of the Lungs/Large Intestine System according to Chinese Medicine and the location happened to be on the Large Intestine Meridian Channel). If I had known that the class would make such an improvement, I would have taken a before and after picture to show everyone. My husband TK also benefited so much from the class. He has lost so much weight on his waist area, while participating in the class via live streaming this time as he was not able to physically attend. I'm waiting for the Guided Practice Audio for \"Qi Gong Practice for Healing the Lungs/Large Intestine System\" to be ready at the online store so I can play it when my kids go to bed. The acne problems on my daughter's arms and cheeks are so much better now. Hopefully playing the audio constantly will help her clear up her large intestine more. Thank you! Love and Light, Jasmin I Received Cosmic Energy from Watching Master Mu's DVD from Hector Campero, Mexico City, Mexico: I work as an energy healer and business consultant in Mexico. I had a wonderful experience watching Master TianJia Mu's DVD on Qi Gong Energy Healing Transmission for Weight Loss & Detoxification. During the Energy Healing Transmission event recorded in the DVD, my head went backwards automatically and I received much cosmic nourishment from the Universe... and I loved the celestial chanting Master Mu sang in the DVD. I also went to the PureBeautiful Healing website and read it all... I've been doing some Introductory practices at home that I learned from your website and really enjoyed them. Thank you. "}
