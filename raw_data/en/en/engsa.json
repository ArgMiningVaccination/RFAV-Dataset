Ayurveda advises simple home remedies and a pitta diet to prevent the condition. Frequent sun exposure, tight clothes and hot weather conditions can all trigger an itchy heat rash, which is not just aesthetically unpleasant but also extremely uncomfortable. Contemporary medication may provide a quick fix to the condition. But without a holistic approach, heat rashes are likely to become a recurrent problem. Read on to know the best natural remedies and diets that can help you get rid of heat rash once and for all. Our Ayurvedic Doctor Says \"Ayurveda categorizes Prickly heat/ triggered by Pitta. Pitta prakriti individuals sweat more and are more sensitive to triggers, and thus experience heat rashes frequently.\" Dr. Zeel Gandhi (Bachelor Of Ayurveda, Medicine & Surgery), Chief Ayurvedic Doctor, Vedix Highlights: What Is Heat Rash? Medically termed as miliaria [ [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537176/)], a heat rash or prickly heat is a frequently observed condition in both children and adults who experience excessive sweating or are exposed to hot and humid climates. It occurs when a blockage of sweat glands and ducts obstructs sweat secretion. This causes sweat to flow back into the dermis and the epidermis, leading to a red, itchy rash. Heat rash is classified into three types: 1. Miliaria Crystallina This type of heat rash commonly affects babies. It causes small vesicles under the surface of the skin that are filled with sweat. Heat rash on babies often occurs on the face, arms, legs and back. 2. Miliaria Rubra This occurs when eccrine sweat glands present in the deeper layers of the skin are blocked. It is characterized by a red, inflamed, itchy rash which is generally referred to as prickly heat. If these lesions get infected and accumulate pus, the condition is then termed as miliaria pustulosa. 3. Miliaria Profunda Also known as tropical anhidrosis [ [2](https://dermnetnz.org/topics/miliaria)], this type of heat rash occurs due to sweat leakage in the inner layers of your skin (dermis). This causes skin-toned, deep, hard bumps/ papules on the affected areas. According to Ayurveda, an aggravation of the pitta dosha can lead to heat rashes. Hence, the condition is referred to as 'Pittaja Masoorika'. People who have a pitta prakriti are more susceptible to heat rashes. What Does Heat Rash Look Like? A heat rash can have the appearance of small sweat-filled vesicles under the skin or red inflamed large bumps covering a considerable area of your skin. Heat rashes often affect the folds of your skin where sweat tends to accumulate such as the neck, under the breasts, scrotum etc. However, they can also occur on the arms, back, chest, thighs and other areas that are covered with tight-fitting clothes. What Causes Heat Rash? 1. Hyperhidrosis This is a condition that causes excessive sweating. Heat rash may accompany this condition if the excess sweat is unable to evaporate and gets trapped under the skin. 2. Hot Climate Hot, humid climates can cause frequent sweating, leading to a heat rash. 3. Excessive Physical Activity Strenuous physical activity can increase body heat. Your body tries to reduce this heat and maintain optimum body temperature through sweating. However, long periods of exercise may lead to a heat rash. 4. Tight Clothes Clothes made of hydrophobic materials like polyester or nylon trap sweat on your skin. Moreover, tightly fitted clothes cause friction which leads to excess dead cells, and blockage of skin pores and sweat glands. Such obstruction can cause a heat rash. 5. Prolonged Bed Rest Heat rash is often observed in bed-ridden patients. This is usually due to poor ventilation in the sleeping area and lack of frequent shift in the sleeping posture. Areas such as the back, upper arms and scrotum are commonly affected. 6. Undeveloped Sweat Glands The sweat glands of a newborn are still in the developing stage. Thus they are often vulnerable to internal damage with the rise in body temperature due to external or internal conditions like a fever. Ruptured sweat glands can cause perspiration to leak into the skin, leading to a heat rash (miliaria crystallina). 7. Oral Medicines Medications such Dextroamphetamine (used to treat ADHD) and certain thyroid medicines are known to increase body temperatures, which may cause a heat rash. 8. Pregnancy/ Menopause During pregnancy due to a fluctuation of hormones, your body heat increases. This can lead to a heat rash (prickly heat). Menopause also causes sudden spikes in body temperatures known as hot flashes, which may trigger hives and rashes. 9. Fever While a fever may rarely be the cause of a heat rash, it can aggravate an existing heat rash condition. Dr. Zeel Gandhi, Chief Ayurvedic Doctor at rashes triggered by Pitta.\" \"Pitta aggravating factors like heat, summer and food items can trigger a heat rash. Pitta prakriti individuals sweat more and are more sensitive to triggers, and thus experience heat rashes frequently. Spicy food and food that resemble the Drava (flowy) quality of pitta, like watermelons, musk melons, and ripe cucumbers can worsen the rash too,\" she adds.

How Do You Get Rid Of Heat Rashes? A. Home Remedies 1. Cold Compress Compressing with an ice pack 2 to 3 times a day can help reduce the prickling sensation associated with a heat rash. Cool showers also help bring down body heat and calm heat rash symptoms in the affected areas. 2. Boric Acid And Talcum Powder Application of boric acid powder mixed with talcum powder is an age-old treatment for inflamed heat rashes on adult skin. The antiseptic qualities of boric acid helps treat bacterial infections and [skin inflammations](https://vedix.com/blogs/articles/skin-inflammation-causes-treatment).

White Camphor Oil White camphor oil is often used to relieve pain, skin inflammation and skin irritations. Further, its mild antibacterial properties can prevent the prickly heat rash lesions from getting infected. Using it twice a day can aid the healing process. Pure camphor oil can be too strong for the skin, hence dilute it with a carrier oil such as coconut oil and apply on the affected areas. Wash off after 10 to 15 minutes. 6. Coconut Oil Traditional medicine advises the application of coconut oil on heat rashes for quick healing. It has amazing skin-soothing and antibacterial properties that help relieve heat rash symptoms. 7.

Cucumber juice is also known to improve skin complexion and can prevent the formation of marks on the skin, which are sometimes caused during the healing process of severe miliaria rubra. 8. Onion Juice Lauded for its skin brightening properties, onion juice is also an excellent remedy for heat rashes on the face and other parts of the body.

Witch Hazel Witch hazel is a common cure for various skin diseases. Owing to its astringent properties and ability to reduce skin inflammation, applying witch hazel on heat rashes can bring instant relief. However, witch hazel is better suited for adult skin and is best avoided in treating heat rash on babies. 11. Calamine Lotion Calamine lotion is a skin-soothing topical ointment commonly used in most households to treat bug bites, minor cuts and burns, pruritus and heat rashes. Calamine lotion consists of zinc carbonate and ferric oxide and [studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24014789/) show that it can be safely used on both children's skin as well as on adults. 12. Gram Flour Gram flour is a good remedy for mild heat rashes on the skin. It helps to drain out excess sweat from the sweat-filled blisters and also has an anti-inflammatory effect on the skin. Mix gram flour with a little water and apply the paste on the affected area. Leave it on for 10 minutes and wipe off with a damp towel. 13.

You can either add it to your bath and soak in it for 15 minutes before rinsing off or make a paste with water and apply on the affected areas.
