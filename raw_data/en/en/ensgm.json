While Ayurveda is fundamental to my approach, I also integrate many other techniques and systems of healing, including life coaching, nutrition, relationship counseling, yoga and meditation as an essential part of my practice. My approach is designed to create health, empower your mind-body system, and improve your overall journey through life. One session can completely reset your life and health, and ongoing care can ensure that you take your health and well-being to the next many levels. Imagine a climber scaling a mountain: as this person ascends, the terrain shifts, and different tools and methods are required. A single session is designed to meet the exact needs of your current situation, provide the overall tools needed to scale the mountain, and trim the excess weight of unbeneficial practices. With multiple sessions, we partner for a focused period of time, fine-tuning tools and methods each time the terrain shifts. By meeting the exact requirements of the physiology in each segment, you move into higher levels of health at a faster pace. While a single session is designed to reset your system and help you reach the next levels of health, multiple sessions are designed for a longer period of rapid acceleration and transformation. Whether the nature of your concerns is physical, mental, or spiritual, we work together to upgrade your health and well-being. AyurvedA: The vedic science of life Thousands of years old, Ayurveda is an ancient system of medicine that re-establishes your connection to the Natural World. It has been my joy and good fortune to study and practice this traditional science, which allows you to reform your relationship with your mind, heart, gut, and life path. If you've been attempting to \"solve the puzzle\" and reach the next level of health and well-being, you might be surprised at what this profound and highly intuitive science has to offer. Testimonials Sultan Salah has been helping me since 2021 and I have become far more balanced spiritually, emotionally and physically. The diet change has been most successful at alleviating my complaints and the herbs are wonderful at helping that balance I needed! I highly recommend a consult with him! -Tamara N. My consultation with Sultan was both intuitive and holistic. He was able to tune into my core Dosha and lay out the detailed steps needed to regain a balanced physiology. Sultan's approach was both gentle and calculated. He offered many recommendations I had never heard of or tried. I appreciated Sultan for his persistence in making sure I was experiencing less fatigue, greater vitality and a stronger alignment with my feminine body. Sultan's knowledge of Ayurveda, and more specifically, women's hormones is unmatched to any other consultant I've ever spoken with in the industry. Sultan integrates ancient wisdom with a modern approach to enlivening the female spirit. -Rachel L. Seems like every time I try to write out a testimonial for Sultan, I fall short of describing the profound impact his visits had and continue to have on me. Not just in terms of my physical healing but so far beyond that. \"Life-changing\", is the only term that comes close. And as someone who was pretty skeptical toward the process at first\u2014that should tell you something. What started as an appointment to address issues rooted in hormonal imbalance ended not only in the rapid healing of those issues but in a healing so deep that it addressed patterns and ailments that have followed me for as long as I can remember. Sultan's visits empowered me in ways that are hard to describe. His remarkable intuitive and astute nature is unlike anything I have encountered and made for an experience in which I felt completely understood, comforted, empowered and refreshed. Throughout our visits he has been consistently accessible and reliable\u2014which is not the experience you will have with most health workers. He is quick to respond and worked with me in getting my initial appointment as quickly as possible. The transformational process that took place under his guidance is hard to articulate\u2014improvements were made in every aspect of my life. The words will always fall short of the experience. I can only strongly recommend you experience it yourself. -Andrea P. with love and gratitude Always seek immediate medical care for serious or emergency health and medical conditions.
