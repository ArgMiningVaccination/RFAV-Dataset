COVID-19 vaccination is nothing short of a silver bullet in our fight against the nasty coronavirus. Even so, it can be quite likely that you may still get infected by the virus. Now, clinical guidelines from top medical boards globally attest that vaccination is not just effective in lessening down the risk of bad outcomes, but it also may give those who have been inoculated an 'edge' over others. From faster recovery timelines and fewer complication risk, experts also believe that vaccinated citizens may not always need to get tested.

Does not getting tested put you or others at risk? Here's an explainer on the new guidelines... [readmore](javascript://) 02/8What are the chances of contracting COVID-19 after getting vaccinated? The vaccines we have right now have been proven to be well-effective in minimizing COVID-19 risk factors, severity, hospitalization need and death rates. However, it isn't a complete solution and there are chances that one can still catch the infection.

The mutability of the new variants of the virus may also allow it to surpass some antibodies and infect us. Thus, while one may not completely avoid getting sick, it has been observed that vaccinated COVID+ people tend to have less serious outcomes or in some cases, may not showcase symptoms at all. The chances of getting COVID-19 after your shot also depends on the place you live (whether it's contagious) and the type of vaccine you get (whether it blocks the infection or symptomatic illness). [readmore](javascript://) 03/8Why is testing not needed? A person who is exposed to the virus is considered to be at risk of contracting the infection. However, with vaccination, the risk automatically comes down a notch, because the vaccine driven antibodies rush to evade out infectious germs at the time of the attack. Simply put, in comparison to a non-vaccinated individual, a vaccinated person has antibodies that shield him, and therefore, there's a slightly lesser risk of contracting the infection.

For the ones who show typical symptoms such as a fever or a persistent cough, diagnosis will be required. It should also be noted that the rule right now only applies to those who have been fully vaccinated (i.e., it has been more than 14 days since your second shot was injected). [readmore](javascript://) 06/8How will this move help? Timely testing is the key to fighting the infection. Countries like ours which were plagued with growing cases were also battling an acute demand of testing. Experts believe that by freeing up the need for vaccinated people to be tested, the pressure faced by diagnostic labs and healthcare resources will come down. Secondly, vaccinated people are less prone to serious outcomes, or rarely get severely sick. Even if they do get the infection, the symptoms could be milder. Therefore, the risk of passing down the infection may be on the lower side. [readmore](javascript://) 07/8Does it put others at risk? Since vaccines work to lower down the severity and symptomatic risk, scientists do believe that vaccines should also work in a similar manner to cut down transmission rates as well. It is also presumed that milder infections post-vaccination and an overall lower risk would also mean that there is a fairly low chance of spreading the infection or putting others at risk. The effect of the same can only be mapped once we have enough data on the real-world effects of vaccinations. [readmore](javascript://) 08/8What safety measures should you take upon exposure? Vaccine or no vaccine, it is still important to follow COVID appropriate behaviour and take the best measures to safeguard yourself, and the ones around you. Do remember that there are chances of getting sick with COVID-19 even after you get vaccinated, even if on the lower side. So, do not be complacent and follow all norms and protocols wisely for a healthy recovery.
