Today, as a Naturopathic Doctor I blend this ancient healing wisdom with modern scientific knowledge to help you attain optimal health in mind, body and spirit. Your Naturopathic Doctor's Training Like allopathic doctors (MDs), I have completed four years of postbaccalaureate education at Bastyr University in Seattle, before earning my license to practice as a Naturopathic Doctor. While MDs focus on medications and surgery, as a naturopath my clinical training focuses on preventing disease, promoting health and prescribing therapies designed to stimulate your body's natural healing processes. Naturopathic Philosophy Naturopathic philosophy stresses the individuality of each patient and the importance of treating the root cause of a condition, not just dealing with its symptoms. As a Naturopathic Doctor, I design individual plans of treatment by conducting extensive patient interviews, carefully reviewing personal and family medical history, performing a thorough physical examination, and ordering any indicated laboratory tests.
