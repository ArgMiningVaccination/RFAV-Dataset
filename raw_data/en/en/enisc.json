Botanical Medicine What is botanical medicine? Also known as herbal medicine or herbalism, botanical medicine involves the use of plants to treat disease and promote health. Animals and plants have evolved alongside each other for millennia, so it makes sense that our bodies respond readily to plant medicines. Like many of the naturopathic modalities, herbal medicine is a very old form of medicine used by cultures all around the world. Botanical medicines are used in both traditional herbal formulations and as phytomedicines, which are scientifically researched and formulated. A resurgence of scientific research is demonstrating that some plant substances are superior to synthetic drugs in clinical studies. Preventative Medicine A key element of naturopathic medicine is creating a level of health that prevents disease. Dr. Trojano offers many modalities that will assist her patients who desire this level of well-being [Clinical Nutrition and Dietary Counseling](https://www.summitholisticmedicine.com/clinical-nutrition/) Nutrition is a cornerstone of naturopathic healing. What we put into our mouths has a profound effect on our physical, emotional, and spiritual health. Hippocrates said, \"Let thy food be thy medicine and thy medicine be thy food.\" Naturopathic doctors and their patients take this advice to heart and address many physical complaints through dietary adjustments. Using knowledge of physiology and biochemistry, ND's educate their patients about the dietary influences on disease symptoms and progression. Detoxifying and Cleansing Another method of healing commonly employed by naturopathic doctors is detoxification of the body, also referred to as cleansing. The concepts of internal cleansing and detoxifying have been fundamental to naturopathic philosophy for over a century, and have been practiced in various forms since Roman times. As the number and quantity of poisonous compounds in our water, air and food supply have steadily increased, the problem of \"toxicity\" has become more widely recognized. A substantial and growing body of research now supports the significant impact on health of acute and chronic exposure to a variety of toxins in our daily environment. As we are continually exposed to these toxins, our body's detoxification system becomes overwhelmed and toxic substances accumulate. This accumulation of toxins can wreak havoc on the body's normal processes and is often expressed through the symptoms of disease. A cleansing program led by a knowledgeable naturopathic doctor may employ the use of vitamins, minerals, foods and herbs that aid the body in eliminating accumulated toxins. Cleansing aims to reduce or remove disease symptoms as well as promote overall health and wellness on many levels. The goals of detoxification might include increased energy, improved mental clarity, better immune function and digestion, and improved mood and sense of well-being. As with all naturopathic treatments, cleansing can be tailored to the individual's own specific health concerns and wellness goals. For more information on a cleansing program contact your naturopathic doctor. Can You Benefit from a Cleanse?

Dr. Trojano can provide testing and services to identify and mitigate those foods negatively affecting her patients. Homeopathy Dr. Trojano offers homeopathic treatments for a variety of ailments. Learn more about what homeopathic medicine is and why it is used. Homeopathy is a system of medicine based on the Law of Similars that was founded over 200 years ago by Samuel Hahnemann, MD (1755-1843). In Dr. Hahnemann's time, medical practices were used such as the application of toxic substances (mercury), the bleedingof very sick patients and needless and often harmful surgeries. Because of the use of mercury in the treatment of the ill, the doctors of that era came to be known as quacks, a short name for quicksilver (mercury). Dr. Hahnemann often spoke out against such harmful methods and in the course of his life, he came to formulate the theories that underlie the modern practice of homeopathic medicine. Hydrotherapy Water can be very healing. For those seeking active lifestyle recovery and/or injury and stress therapy, hydrotherapy offers many benefits.
