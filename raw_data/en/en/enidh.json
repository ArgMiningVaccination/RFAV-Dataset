Here's a quick answer to both of those questions, along with a link (pictured right) to explain how RNA vaccines work. Before receiving approval for emergency use, pharmaceutical companies (like Pfizer and Moderna) must provide evidence that their vaccines are safe. A team of experts from the FDA, CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and other agencies reviewed all available data on safety and efficacy before recommending them for use. Regarding availability, information from the State of Michigan (subject to change) advises that the COVID-19 vaccine is to be dispensed locally in the following phases: Phase 1A includes paid and unpaid persons serving in health care settings who have direct or indirect exposure to patients or infectious materials and are unable to work from home, as well as residents of long-term care facilities. Phase 1B includes workers in essential and critical industries, including workers with unique skill sets such as non-hospital or non-public health laboratories and mortuary services. (estimated start in Feb 2021) Phase 1C includes people at high risk for severe COVID-19 illness due to underlying medical conditions, and people 65 years and older. (estimated start in Mar 2021) Phase 2 is a mass vaccination campaign for all individuals 16 years and older. (estimated start in summer 2021) The timing of the start of vaccination in a phase is dependent on the supply of vaccine from the manufacturer, how vaccine is allocated from the federal level to Michigan, and the capacity to administer the vaccine to populations. We will continue to monitor [Michigan.gov/COVIDVaccine](https://michigan.gov/COVIDVaccine) for new information and post it as it becomes available. You alone make the decision about whether to get a COVID-19 vaccine. We are encouraging our patients to talk to their primary care doctor to help with that decision making process. "}
