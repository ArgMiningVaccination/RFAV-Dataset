It requires a doctor to provide proper documentation and is performed by a vaccine exemption appointment only. Vaccine exemptions are provided and considered for patients that fit the following medical and legal vaccine exemption requirements. Upon completion of a vaccine counseling session, this is to be advised on the patient's risks vs benefits of obtaining a vaccine. Please read the legal requirements to receive and understand your vaccine exemption. You will schedule your appointment to receive your vaccine exemption letter at your own risk, only if you qualify for the vaccine exemption. While the following conditions qualify patients for an Exemption Letter if that is their choice, they do not mean they should necessarily not have the vaccine, and the patient may benefit more from having the vaccine in certain medical conditions which will only be discussed at a medical consultation. Qualifying Medical Exemptions: Patients with conditions that have limited data on the safety and efficacy of vaccines can request an exemption. No vaccine exemption can be legally provided if the above criteria are not met. Employers may have differing policies on vaccine exemptions and may or may not accept the above conditions even when provided with a letter of exemption for health reasons or underlying medical reasons. Please do not schedule an appointment to receive a vaccine exemption if you do not have one of the above qualifying conditions. Vaccine exemptions are a complex medical-legal matter that can only be provided under reasonable circumstances. No vaccine exemptions will be provided outside of scheduled appointments. All patients requesting vaccine exemptions must undergo vaccine counseling to ensure they understand the risks vs benefits of remaining unvaccinated.
