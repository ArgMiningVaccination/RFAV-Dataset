Thirteen-year-old Gentry Groshell can't talk, but she has zest and the athletic energy of five kids her age combined. On summer days, she keeps busy walking the beach, going for tandem bike rides, touring her Jacksonville Beach neighborhood via golf cart, swimming in the family pool and more. The pixie-ish whirlwind challenges her family and other caregivers to continually provide her with engaging activities that channel her zip. She's happy when she's busy. When she's not, she acts out. She can't help it. She has autism. Autism is a neurological and biological disorder that affects learning, communication, socialization and behavior. Autistic children often can't understand social cues such as facial expressions, they often avoid eye contact and sometimes engage in repetitive movements such as rocking or twirling. Their difficulties can make every day a challenge for themselves and their families. But thanks to a Ponte Vedra Beach organization called HEAL, Healing Every Autistic Life, children and their families have support and opportunities to participate in fun, social and educational activities. They can go to surf camp, filmmaking camp, art classes, join a Beaches bowling league and more. This week and next, 50 kids are in film camp at the University of North Florida, learning movie making from Hollywood film director Joey Travolta, brother of actor John Travolta. Next week, others will attend surf camp in Jacksonville Beach. Thursday and Friday, HEAL will hold its third annual \"Valley of Dreams Gala and Golf Classic\" at the Tournament Players Club Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach to raise money for its camps, educational enhancement fund, financial aid project and other programs that have helped 500 children in the Jacksonville area. \"It's the neatest charity, and we try to be as active and involved as possible,\" said Gentry's mother, Amy Groshell, who plans to attend the gala Thursday with her husband, Howard. \"It's opening doors for Gentry that she wouldn't have had.\" Gentry, who doesn't talk but is bright, has severe autism symptoms. Individuals on the autism spectrum have symptoms that range from \"devastated to quirky,\" said pediatrician Julie Buckley of Ponte Vedra Beach, who co-founded HEAL with Leslie Weed, mother of an autistic daughter. The spectrum includes those with profound autism to pervasive development disorder to Asperger syndrome to learning disabilities to attention deficit disorder, Buckley said. \"That's one in six kids when you include everybody on the spectrum. There are thousands in this area.\" Groshell began noticing Gentry was different when she was a toddler. Like many kids with the disorder, Gentry appeared to be developing normally and could talk, until she was about 2. Then, day by day, she stopped speaking and her personality faded away \"like a boat going out to sea,\" Groshell said. \"She kept going out and out and out, and then she was gone.\" Groshell believes vaccines played a part in causing Gentry's condition because she has a weak immune system that couldn't handle them. Scientific studies have not proven that childhood vaccinations cause autism, but Weed, of Ponte Vedra Beach, also witnessed her daughter Lanier, 11, begin to regress at 18 months. She and her husband, Bobby, a well known golf course architect, watched their \"happy, normal child\" shut down a little bit every day. Light, noise and touch caused her to scream and arch her back. \"It was devastating to watch your child slip away,\" she said. \"It was like somebody stole her soul.\" When three Jacksonville doctors recommended institutionalizing Lanier for the sake of the Weeds' marriage and their other children, they refused. Instead, they flew around the country with Lanier, seeking answers, and gradually found treatments and therapies to help her. They discovered she had severe intestinal problems that caused extreme pain that she couldn't talk about, and that her body lacked important amino acids. Eventually, and ironically, they found Buckley, who specializes in autism, in their own town. Buckley's daughter, Dani Moore, 10, is also autistic, and the Weeds were relieved to find a Beaches-area pediatrician who understands their family's challenges. Lanier is non-verbal, but she can read, communicate through sign language and type some words on a computer. \"For years, we felt like we were alone out in the middle of the ocean, drifting,\" Weed said. \"Now that we've reached the other side, we can finally exhale. And we see a lot of other families treading water.\" Weed and Buckley founded HEAL four years ago to help those families. The PGA Tour adopted the charity in 2007, and through Valley of Dreams events in the past two years, HEAL has raised $800,000. About $540,000 has gone to the organization's activities and to help families. Some of the funds are being set aside to one day build \"the HEAL House,\" a facility that will offer camps, therapies and other programs under one roof. While experts aren't certain what causes autism spectrum disorders, they've discovered genetic links. The Groshell family benefits from many of HEAL's programs because daughter Gabrielle, 14, who has learning challenges, can also participate. The pretty, slim, sometimes socially shy teen was in the film camp last year, and is participating again this year. Tuesday, while learning techniques for shooting a restaurant commercial from acting teacher Dale Oprandy, she shared some of her ideas for some scenes, and beamed. \"She's made friends,\" Amy Groshell said. \"Which is nice.\" Meanwhile, Gentry, who's an excellent swimmer, is looking forward to surf camp. In her busy home, which includes 2-month-old brother Hollis, Gentry can understand what is said to her, has learned some sign language and expresses happiness with an impish grin. She practices standing up on a surfboard in her pool, and is ready for some waves. \"Surf camp is by far the highlight of her summer,\" Amy Groshell said. \"The water is therapy for her. It's amazing.\" Maggie FitzRoy can also be reached "}
