Welcome to Whole Health Acupuncture & Herbal Medicine What Patients Are Saying \"Graham, I had a really great day today and I wanted to share that with you! It feels very nice not to have a headache - it's like that day when it finally stop raining - it's twice as beautiful as a regular sunny day! Also, the anxiety is coming down and the pain is doing much better. I don't know if one can get sick of hearing it, but I have to say, thank you for what you do and how you help me, I really can't express to you how much I appreciate you and your acupuncture skills.\" Anonymous Victoria Deane MTCM, L.Ac. completed her Masters degree in Traditional Chinese Medicine at Five Branches University in Santa Cruz, California. She interned as an Acupuncturist at the National Hospital of Integrative Medicine in Hanoi, Vietnam. While there, she worked with various doctors in clinical rotations to treat both acute and chronic pain. Victoria believes in a holistic healthcare model. This method of healthcare means addressing the person as a whole and treating the root cause of illnesses, versus merely diagnosing and treating individual symptoms. Graham Haynes MAOM, L.Ac., is a licensed practitioner of Acupuncture and Chinese Herbal Medicine. He grew up in Yarmouth, and developed an early interest in medicine. After living in almost every corner of the country and exploring various areas of medicine, he discovered the profound benefits of acupuncture and herbal medicine. Dedicating himself to the study and practice of this powerful medicine, Graham has returned home to open Whole Health Acupuncture. Erin Marenghi manages the administrative work for the office, and on top of that, she is the mom of two awesome teenagers, a freelance book editor, and a yoga/fitness instructor. "}
