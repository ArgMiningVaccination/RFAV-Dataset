The parasha for the week when he died was Lech L'cha and the meditation was written with that in mind. While it was written for a spouse, the theme of journeying and moving forward makes it applicable for use for anyone who is grieving. I acknowledge those who teach me and inspire my writing and my spirituality with their gifts of wisdom and light: Rabbi Alan and [Rebbetzin](https://ritualwell.org/glossary/rebbetzin/)Lit. Wife of a rabbi (Yiddish) In many communities the rebbetzin has had a special and honored role, if strictly prescribed by gender. She often has with many expectations and duties attendant to her husband and the shul. Chaya Green, Rabbi Neal and Rebbetzin Carol Rose, Rabbi Lawrence Pinsker, and Ineke Shorten. Envision yourself walking in the desert. It is quiet and still and beautiful. You feel the wind blow around you. It is soft, gentle, refreshing. You look ahead into the distance. You hear a voice speak to you. It is the voice of [HaShem](https://ritualwell.org/glossary/hashem/)Lit. The Name, referring to the ineffable name of God; used as a substitute for any of the more sacred names of God when not speaking in prayer. Particularly used in conversation.. It says Lech l'cha [feminine: Lechi lach]. It tells you to journey forward into your future. It tells you not to be afraid as you leave that which is familiar, that which is comfortable, that which is limiting. You take a step forward, then another, then another. You hear the voice again. It whispers softly \"Lech l'cha/Lechi lach, go forward. Do not be afraid. Go forward to the land I have prepared for you. It is a land of abundance. It is a land that is more than physical. It is land of many dimensions - physical, mental, emotional, spiritual.\" It is an inner landscape as well as an outer landscape. It is where you connect with and become one with [HaShem](https://ritualwell.org/glossary/hashem/)Lit. The Name, referring to the ineffable name of God; used as a substitute for any of the more sacred names of God when not speaking in prayer. Particularly used in conversation.. It is where you can connect with the world that HaShem gifted to you and (name of deceased person). Your love birthed countless worlds in this landscape. These worlds will never die. They sparkle like the innumerable stars in the heavens. They are everywhere, all around you, within you. This is a love for all time. This love was created by HaShem at the moment of Creation. It always was and always will be. It is a love that cannot die. Do not be afraid to journey forward. You will not lose your love. Listen to the voice. Lech l'cha/Lechi lach. Go forward into your future. Go forward to where HaShem will take you. He gave you (name of deceased person) to take you to the stars. The journey has not ended. It is in another dimension. Journey into the desert. It is not a wasteland but a living, breathing entity, just as your love was a creation in and of itself - a living, breathing entity - that never dies. Lech l'cha/Lechi lach.
