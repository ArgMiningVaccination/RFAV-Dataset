We tested 31 of the most popular options to nail down the 12 best cuticle oils.", "sitename": "Byrdie", "date": "2020-04-27", "cleaned_text": "No matter if you're a salon appointment stan or a DIY-er through and through, cuticle oil is one product that takes any manicure to the next level. It does so much more than you might think, like supporting overall nail health, promoting nail growth, and even increasing the longevity of your manicure, whether it be gel, regular polish, or extensions. As Evelyn Lim, an editorial manicurist and Chief Educator at Paintbox, says, cuticle oil hydrates the nail and the surrounding skin, resulting in nails that are healthy and strong. \"When you use cuticle oil, you'll have fewer breaks, hangnails, and chips,\" she adds. Sporting bare nails? A quick swipe of cuticle oil instantly imparts a gorgeous sheen, making your hands and nails look better in seconds. Rocking polish? Applying cuticle oil regularly not only keeps cuticles hydrated but can also help nails stay hydrated as well, which is an essential step in preventing nail polish chips. So, to cover all bases, we tested a handful (31, to be exact) of the best cuticle oils at home over the course of two weeks to check for how each one felt when applied, how long it took for each to fully absorb, and whether or not each formula actually improved the health of our nails. With our curated list of the best cuticle oils below, you can get on your way to stronger, healthier nails. [L'Occitane Shea Nail And Cuticle Oil at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/LOccitane-Nourishing-Nail-Cuticle-Shea/dp/B0BL8F59PX/?tag=byrdie-onsite-backup-20) [JINsoon Oil Oil Cuticle Drops [Deborah A Miracle Pen at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B124G36R?tag=byrdie-onsite-backup-20) Best Overall L'Occitane Shea Nail And Cuticle Oil Rich yet lightweight Brush tip applicator Doesn't absorb instantly There's a good reason why this humble oil has legions of devoted fans. Simple and straightforward, it boasts a blend of shea butter and oils like almond, castor, and avocado oil to soften cuticles and deeply hydrate the skin around your nails. Despite containing several oils, it's actually not oily at all. In fact, it absorbs into the skin nicely and doesn't leave a greasy mess in its wake. The scent is also addicting, though the results it delivers are incentive enough to make you want to apply it daily. We're especially impressed with the brush tip applicator, which makes the entire process fuss-free and really enjoyable. Over time, we saw a noticeable difference in the look of our nails and the skin around them\u2014so much so that a nail tech complimented how much healthier and hydrated they look. Price at time of publish: $20 Active Ingredients: Shea butter, Almond oil, Castor oil | Dosage: As needed | Size: 0.25 oz. | Cruelty-Free: No Best Budget Sally Hansen Vitamin E Nail & Cuticle Oil Easy to control A little goes a long way The top can get greasy and hard to open There are few drugstore brands that have better cornered the nail market than Sally Hansen, and this cuticle oil is no exception. Specifically made for those ultra-dry, beat-up cuticles (you know the kind), this brush-on formula works wonders to repair, hydrate, and strengthen the skin around the nail. We found the product to be easy all around\u2014easy to apply, easy to incorporate into an existing routine, and easy on the wallet. Because of the brush tip applicator (similar to the L'Occitane option above), you're able to control how much of the product is used and where exactly you want to deposit it. And although it's an extra step to have to remember, it's not hard to add to your nightly routine; just a swipe on each nail bed, and you're good to go. Best of all, it's honestly shocking that this high-quality oil is just $11 and can be picked up almost anywhere. Something to keep in mind: The bottle is made with a slippery material, so if you get any oil on your hands or fingers, you may have a hard time opening and closing the cap. We recommend cleaning the top after every use so you don't run into this issue. Price at time of publish: $11 Active Ingredients: Safflower oil, Apricot kernel oil, Coconut oil | Dosage: Nightly | Size: 0.45 oz. | Cruelty-Free: No Best Splurge JINsoon Extract Cuticle Oil with Honeysuckle + Primrose Smells great Fast-absorbing Runny Jin Soon Choi knows a thing or two about nails. One of the most influential nail artists in the industry, she's been named the \"Nail Guru\" and has worked her magic on the nails of celebrities and runway models, and has even been featured in several magazine cover shoots. Drawing from her many years in the limelight and her experience owning four spas, she created a line of nail products, like this one, that is good for you and the planet. All that is to say that this oil is one hundred percent worth the splurge; let us explain why. First, it's kind of like skincare for your hands and feet. The oil is intended to be used pretty much anywhere on the body and imparts a really nice conditioning effect that heals dryness and restores soft, healthy skin. Second, the fragrance is incredible. As the name suggests, it smells like honeysuckle and primrose\u2014so we won't blame you if you want to douse your fingers and toes in it day and night. Spending upwards of $30 on a cuticle oil seems pretty crazy at first, but when you think about how much your cuticles will benefit from it and how fast it dries, it's worth it\u2014especially when salon manicures these days can sometimes cost triple that. Just keep in mind that it skews on the runny side, so you'll want to be extra intentional about how much you pick up in the dropper. Price at time of publish: $35 Active Ingredients: Jojoba seed oil, Almond oil, Evening primrose oil | Dosage: As needed | Size: 0.5 oz. | Cruelty-Free: Yes Best Dropper OPI ProSpa Nail & Cuticle Oil Replenishing Protects skin from further damage Could be more absorbent When we think of cuticle oils, we often think of tiny tinctures with droppers. While there are so many new alternatives, like roller balls and brush tips, sometimes you just can't mess with a classic. Each time you reach for this formula, which contains a number of rich oils like avocado, grapeseed, sunflower, and sesame seed, rest assured that your nails are in for a replenishing treatment. The results are almost immediate; nails and cuticles look shinier, smoother, and more hydrated after application. The only thing we wish we could change is the fact that it takes a while to absorb, and there's still some residue left behind. It's not a total dealbreaker for us, given that most oils will; however, it's something to keep in mind if you're not a fan of feeling greasy. Price at time of publish: $10 Active Ingredients: Avocado oil, Grapeseed oil, Sunflower oil, seed oil | Dosage: As needed | Size: 0.29 oz. | Cruelty-Free: No Best Roll-On Sundari Neem Hand and Cuticle Hand Treatment Oil Easy to maneuver and control Recyclable glass bottle Doubles as a treatment for dry elbows and ankles The bottle can get oily We're into all kinds of rollerballs; they make application of any type of formula super easy\u2014this cuticle oil included. Soothing ingredients like neem extract, Triphala, and amla extract star in this all-natural formula that softens even the roughest of skin, whether on cuticles, elbows, or even ankles. And the benefits don't stop there \u2014 neem extract is actually a building block [of collagen](https://www.byrdie.com/how-to-increase-collagen-5116878) and has antibacterial properties, so no wonder we experienced lots of growth during testing. Like the Sally Hansen product, it has a bottle that can get slippery when coated in oil. Try to open the packaging with clean, dry hands and wipe it down after you use it. Price at time of publish: $10 Active Ingredients: Neem extract, Size: 0.34 oz. | Cruelty-Free: Yes Best Serum Olive & June Cuticle Serum Duo Non-greasy Soft foam tip for controlled application Fragrance-free Hard to tell if it works at first Think of this as a souped-up version of basic cuticle oil. It has plenty of hydrating benefits (avocado, apricot, and jojoba, to name a few), but also has cactus flower extract, a reparative ingredient that's great for damaged skin. Bonus points for the soft foam tip that makes for easy, mess-free application. The only qualm we have with this one is that the manufacturer claims that you'll need to twist the bottom two or three times to deposit the formula, but we didn't notice any product coming out of the top until the 20th (which can be confusing and worrisome at first!) Price at time of publish: $30 Active Ingredients: Avocado oil, apricot oil | Dosage: As needed | Size: Comes in a set with 0.14 oz. for serum | Cruelty-Free: Yes Best Cream Dior Huile Abricot Daily Nutritive Serum Travel-friendly Intensely nourishing Requires repeated use to see results It doesn't get chicer than a Dior cuticle oil; we'll just leave it at that. The specially chosen blend of oils\u2014argan, camellia, and apricot\u2014promises to not only hydrate but also protect and strengthen nails and, let us tell you, it follows through. During testing, we noticed a huge improvement in the health of our nailbeds specifically, although it did take some time (and daily dedication) to see the dry bits turn more supple. Though it requires some patience, we really love the healthy, moisturized results that this formula offers. Price at time of publish: $36 Active Ingredients: Argan oil, Vitamin E, Apricot oil | Dosage: As needed | Size: 0.25 oz. | Cruelty-Free: No Best Moisturizing Cuccio Milk and Honey Revitalizing Cuticle Oil Big size Professional-grade Flimsy dropper As far as cuticle oils go, this is one of the biggest we've come across. At 2.5 ounces, it's bigger than most of the other options on this list, and the fact that it's only $8 makes it a total steal. Between the price and the special formula, it's no wonder it's used by professionals in spas and salons worldwide. This cuticle oil conditions and nourishes cuticles and the rest of the skin surrounding the nail bed, adding a soft touch to your manicure. Rich oils like safflower oil and cottonseed oil work in tandem with vitamin E, honey, and lactic acid to soothe, moisturize, refresh, and stimulate the skin. The result: Fingernails that look like they just left the salon. The only caveat we found during testing is that the dropper isn't designed very well. The bottle itself is great, but the dropper is a bit flimsy and doesn't offer a ton of flexibility when it comes to pulling oil out of the bottle. Price at time of publish: $8 Active Ingredients: Safflower oil, Cottonseed oil, Vitamin E | Dosage: As needed | Size: 2.5 oz. | Cruelty-Free: Yes Best Conditioning Orly Argan Oil Cuticle Drops Ingredients you can understand Incredibly hydrating Dropper can deposit too much product This popular nail care brand is known for its comprehensive line of products and tools that improve the overall appearance of nails and the skin around 'em. We're especially big fans of their Argan Oil Cuticle Drops. In just a few droplets of this rich oil, cuticles and nail beds are softer, more hydrated, and look way healthier than before. It's formulated with a bunch of ingredients you can actually understand, like [argan oil](https://www.byrdie.com/argan-oil-for-skin-5080152), [jojoba oil](https://www.byrdie.com/jojoba-oil-beauty-uses), and [vitamin E.](https://www.byrdie.com/vitamin-e-oil-for-nails-5087227) Best of all, it can be used anywhere on the body that needs a little extra TLC, like your knuckles, elbows, knees, or even the ends of super-dry hair. Price at time of publish: $10 Active Ingredients: Argan oil, Jojoba oil, Vitamin E | Dosage: As needed | Size: 0.6 oz. | Cruelty-Free: Yes Best On-the-Go Deborah Lippmann It's A Miracle Intense Therapy Cuticle Oil Pen Blend of 10 rich oils Travels well Perfume-like smell that isn't for everyone Celebrity manicurist Deborah Lippmann's eponymous line of lacquers and treatments for nails, hands, and feet is as good as it gets. Each of her products has been expertly formulated to leave nails better than they were before\u2014and this true-to-its-name miracle pen is no different. The convenient (and travel-friendly) cuticle oil pen calls upon a unique blend of 10 conditioning oils (like sesame seed, castor seed, sweet almond, and evening primrose oil) to deeply moisturize and soothe dry cuticles, nails, and hands. After two weeks of use, we found that it did a great job of hydrating nail beds and cuticles, helping to soothe flakiness and dry bits. As a result, nails feel stronger and more sturdy, while cuticles are softer and less rigid. We'd be remiss not to mention that it never once spilled or leaked in our bags or pockets, making it a great stow-and-go option for those who don't want to let their nail care go by the wayside when traveling. It is heavily fragranced, so if you're not big on strong perfumes, you may want to skip this one. Price at time of publish: $20 Active Ingredients: 10 Essential oils, Shea butter, Vitamin E | Dosage: As needed | Size: 1.2 oz. | Cruelty-Free: Yes Best Natural Tenoverten The Rose Oil Nourishing Cuticle Oil Nourishing and fast-acting Made with 100% natural ingredients A small amount of product Natural beauty lovers will appreciate this 100 percent natural cuticle oil from Tenoverten. With a number of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, this formula heals dry, cracked skin, working to treat redness and refine skin texture. The unique blend of jojoba, argan, pomegranate, sweet almond and hemp seed oils nourishes the skin, while the horsetail leaf extract strengthens [weak, brittle fingernails](https://www.byrdie.com/what-do-healthy-nails-look-like-7090983). It's purse-friendly and comes with a roller-ball tip that rolls the oil right into your cuticles for a targeted treatment sans a greasy mess. The one thing we wish we could change is the fact that it's pretty pricey for such a small size\u2014we'd love it if it came in a bigger size. Price at time of publish: $26 Active Ingredients: Jojoba oil, Argan oil, Horsetail leaf Dosage: As needed | Size: 0.27 oz.| Cruelty-Free: Yes Best for Sensitive Skin Candy X Paints Renew Delicate Cuticle Glow Super clean formula Soft brush tip applicator Contains oils derived from nuts If you have [sensitive skin](https://www.byrdie.com/what-is-sensitive-skin) and are sick of looking at peeling cuticles, check out this formula from Candy X Paints. It's handmade with organic ingredients intended to rehydrate dull, dry cuticles and bring them back to life while keeping sensitive skin top of mind. The super clean formula only has a few ingredients (like a carefully curated blend of maracuja, pumpkin, and sunflower oils plus olive-derived squalane) that actually work to boost and lock in hydration. After two weeks, we found it highly effective\u2014it left cuticles looking smoother, softer, and way healthier than before. You'll like this one if you have sensitive skin or prefer minimalist formulations. Something to note: While we love everything about this product, it does contain oils derived from nuts, so if you have a nut allergy, you may want to consult with a doctor before trying this out to avoid an allergic reaction. Price at time of publish: $16 Active Ingredients: Maracuja oil, Pumpkin oil, Sunflower oil, Squalane | Dosage: As needed | Size: Not listed | Cruelty-Free: Yes Final Verdict The cuticle oil you choose will come down to your applicator preference, but when it comes to best in show, we like the [L'Occitane Shea Nail And Cuticle Oil](https://www.sephora.com/product/shea-nail-cuticle-oil-P387512?skuId=1630292). Its unique brush-tip applicator makes painting the formula onto cuticles feel effortless and fuss-free. Plus, the formula itself softens cuticles and nourishes nails in a way that other options didn't. Another special mention goes to [Sally Hansen Vitamin E Nail & Cuticle Oil](https://www.amazon.com/Sally-Hansen-Vitamin-Cuticle-Fluid/dp/B000AADF20/?tag=byrdie-onsite-backup-20) for its one-of-a-kind formula that works hard to strengthen thin, bendable nails and leave cuticles hydrated and healthy. How We Tested Byrdie editors did extensive research on popular cuticle oils, taking expert recommendations and consumer reviews into account before choosing 31 to test out first-hand. Each tester considered each formula's consistency, overall efficacy (like whether or not it did what it said it would), whether or not it left behind a residue, and how nails looked after consistent use before deciding on a rating from one to five. Those with the highest scores made the list. Meet the Expert [Evelyn Lim](https://www.instagram.com/evelynlnails/) is an editorial manicurist. She serves as the Chief Educator at [Paintbox](https://paint-box.com/), a nail studio based on the Upper East Side in New York City, and the Nail Art Education Director at [MiniLuxe](https://www.instagram.com/miniluxe/). What to Look For in a Cuticle Oil Hydrating Ingredients Most cuticle oils are formulated from a base of oils (obviously), and that's a good thing when you're dealing with rough, dry cuticles or thin, [breaking nails](https://www.byrdie.com/how-to-prevent-your-nails-from-breaking-4693432). and like vitamin E\u2014they'll ensure your cuticles are moisturized and soft. We like the [JINsoon Cuticle Oil](https://www.revolve.com/jinsoon-cuticle-oil-in-honeysuckle-primrose/dp/JINS-WU18/?) formula, as it contains several nourishing oils. You can also look for strengthening and reparative formulas, such as the [OPI Nail and Cuticle Oil](https://www.amazon.com/OPI-ProSpa-Nail-Cuticle-0-29/dp/B0725XWF6R?tag=byrdie-onsite-backup-20), to help protect against future nail breakage, hangnails, and brittle cuticles. Packaging Since there are many different forms of cuticle oil available\u2014from serums in tubes to pots of cream and even convenient pen options\u2014you'll want to consider when and where you're going to be using cuticle oil. Do you want to stash it in your bag? A rollerball, like the one featured in the [SUNDARI Neem and Cuticle Hand Treatment Oil](https://www.amazon.com/SUNDARI-Rollerball-cuticles-Soothing-difference/dp/B00T5DQ214?tag=byrdie-onsite-backup-20), may be ideal for you. Want to keep it in your bathroom with your other nail products? A traditional dropper formula, like the [ORLY Argan Oil Cuticle Drops](https://www.amazon.com/Orly-Argan-Cuticle-Drops-Ounce/dp/B00DT34WKY?tag=byrdie-onsite-backup-20), can work itself nicely into your nail care routine. Extra Benefits Some of the items on this list work double as hydrating oils for the rest of your hands, like the [Deborah Lippmann It's A Miracle Pen](https://www.amazon.com/Deborah-Lippmann-Miracle-Intense-Travel-Friendly/dp/B0B124G36R?tag=byrdie-onsite-backup-20), or offer extra benefits like exfoliation, which can be useful for eliminating dead skin, AKA cuticles. - How often should you apply cuticle oil? You can use cuticle oil every day or as often as you feel you need to. The benefits include increased hydration for nails and the surrounding skin, so there's really no downside to frequent application. For best results, massage it into your skin for at least a minute. - Is cuticle oil better than hand cream? Cuticle oils tend to be more concentrated than your typical hand cream, making the former key for moisturizing small areas like your nails and cuticles. While you could use lotion in a pinch, you'll generally want to use cuticle oil because it tends to be richer, more hydrating, and better suited for softening cuticles. - How long should you leave cuticle oil on? You can apply it before bed and leave it on overnight to really let it soak into your nails and the surrounding skin. As a general rule, leave it on for at least an hour or two before washing your hands to allow the formula time to settle in.
