This Contract includes a Schedule of Benefits that explains the Maximum Benefits and Cost-Sharing requirements for Covered Services. This Contract may also include Riders. Riders change the benefits and Eligibility rules described in this Contract. You should keep this Contract, the Schedule of Benefits, any applicable Riders and the Summary of Benefits and Coverage with Your other important papers so that they are available for Your future reference. 1.2 Definitions Throughout this Contract, Health Alliance Plan of Michigan is referred to as \"We\", \"Us\", \"Our\" or \"HAP\". The words \"You\", \"Your\" or \"Yours\" refer to the Subscriber and any Dependents covered under this Contract. There are other words and phrases used in this Contract that have meanings unique to this Contract. These words and phrases are capitalized and generally defined in Section 11 of this Contract. Any words or phrases used in the Contract that are not defined in Section 11 will have the meaning defined by applicable state or federal laws. 1.3 HMO Coverage This Contract provides coverage through Health Alliance Plan of Michigan (HAP), a nonprofit corporation licensed by the State of Michigan as a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). This Contract describes Your health coverage under an HMO arrangement. It is important to read this Contract carefully before You need services. Because HAP is an HMO, many services cove red under this Contract must be provided, arranged or authorized in advance by Your Primary Care Physician (PCP). Your PCP is an Affiliated Provider that You choose who is primarily responsible for providing or arranging for health care services for You. In some cases, Your PCP will also need to have services authorized by Us. You may choose an Affiliated family practitioner, general practitioner, internist, or pediatrician as Your PCP. You may also choose to see any Affiliated obstetrician or gynecologist without a Referral from Your PCP. These providers, however, may be required to comply with certain procedures, including obtaining Prior Authorization for certain services, following a pre-approved treatment plan, and procedures for making Referrals. A Referral from Your PCP may be required to obtain Covered Services from any other type of Affiliated Specialist. HAP maintains a network of Affiliated Providers that is sufficient in numbers and types of providers to assure that all Covered Services will be accessible to You without unreasonable delay. Our directory of Affiliated Providers is updated on an ongoing basis and published on Our website, hap.org . If medically appropriate treatment for Your c ondition is not available from an Affiliated Provider, without unreasonable delay, Your PCP may ask for Prior Authorization to refer You to a Non-Affiliated Provider. If a referral to a Non-Affiliated Provider is approved by Us, the Covered Services will be paid as if those services had been provided by an Affiliated Provider. If Prior Authorization is not received before You seek Covered Services from a Non-Affiliated Provider, or if We determine the medically appropriate HAP-HMO-LG 1/2020 2 treatment for Your condition is availabl e from an Affiliated Provider, You will be responsible for the full cost of any treatment provided by the Non-Affiliated Provider. There are no benefits for services that are prov ided by Non-Affiliated Providers, except under the following circumstances: a. When you have a medical condition that requires Urgent Care and it is not possible to get that care from an Affiliated urgent care center. b. When treatment is needed for an Emergency Medical Condition as defined in this Contract. In these circumstances, Non-Affiliated Provi ders may require You to pay the difference between the Allowable Amount and the provider 's actual Charge for Covered Services. This is referred to as Balance Billing. Balance Billing amounts do not count toward the Out-of-Pocket Limits. Affiliated Providers agree to accept Our payment of the Allowable Amount for Covered Services as payment in full, other than applicable Cost-Sharing. Affiliated Providers may not Balance Bill You. This Contract contains Prior Authorization and Medical Management requirements that must be followed prior to scheduling certain medical treatments and Inpatient admissions. Failure to follow these requirements may result in non-payment of the benefits under this Contract. These requirements are discussed in Section 4 of this Contract. Because Your PCP is the key to receiving services under this Contract, make an appointment to see Your PCP soon. It is also important to read this Contract carefully before You need services. 1.4 Your Agreement and Consent This Contract is an agreement between HAP and persons who have enrolled as a Subscriber and/or Dependents. It contains important information about Your coverage. You should read this Contract carefully before You need services. By enrolling in and accepting this Contract, and/or by using Your Identification Card and receiving benefits under this Contract, You agree to abide by its terms. You recognize that We are responsible for arranging, paying or reimbursing for only those services that are Covered Services, subject to all exclusions and limitations described in this Contract and only for Covered Services provided while Your coverage under this Contract remains in effect. HAP-HMO-LG 1/2020 3 SECTION 2 - ELIGIBILITY 2.1 Subscriber and Dependent Eligibility Criteria a. General requirements: You are eligible for coverage as a Subscriber or Dependent under this Contract if You meet the following Eligibility requirements: 1. You must meet the Group's eligibility requirements and meet the Eligibility requirements in this Section 2. If there is a conflict between the requirements described in this Section 2 and the terms of Your Group's operating agreement with Us, the terms of the Group's operating agreement will control; and 2. You live or work in Our Service Area. b. Other requirements: 1. Enrollment must be sought in an enrollment period recognized by the Group and Us. 2. You must meet any additional Eligibility requirements described in any Rider or amendment attached to this Contract. 3. Subscribers and Dependents may be denied enrollment if they are identified by the Federal government as terrorists or others similarly ineligible for coverage on the basis of federal or state law. 2.2 Dependents The following persons are eligible for cover age under this Contract as the Subscriber's Dependents if they meet Our Eligibility requi rements and the eligibility requirements of the Subscriber's Group: a. The Subscriber's Spouse; b. The Subscriber's Children, by birth or legal adoption who are under the age of 26; c. The Children of the Subscriber's Spouse, by birth or legal adoption who are under the age of 26; d. A Subscriber's Child who is recognized under a Qualified Medical Child Support Order. A copy of the court order or divorce decree is required to enroll the Child; e. A Child to whom the Subscriber or t he Subscriber's Spouse is a legal guardian. A copy of the court appointment of the guardian is required to enroll the Child; and f. A Permanently Disabled Child of the Subscriber or the Subscriber's Spouse who meets all of the following requirements: 1. Is over the age of 26; 2. Is not married; 3. Was Permanently Disabled before reaching the age of 26; and 4. Relies on the Subscriber or Subscriber's Spouse for more than half of their support, as determined under Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. HAP-HMO-LG 1/2020 4 Proof of the Permanent Disability and financial dependence must be provided within 30 days of enrollment. 2.3 Eligibility When an Inpatient Eligibility will not be denied under this Contract based upon the fact that You were an Inpatient on Your first day of coverage. However, We reserve the right to claim that Our coverage is secondary to that of another carrier who is obligated to provide coverage during Your Inpatient stay. You should notify Us of Your Inpatient status within 48 hours after the day Your coverage begins under this Contract. 2.4 Coverage Periods for Dependents a. Coverage for the Subscriber's Spouse continues throughout the marriage. In the event of a divorce, coverage for the Subscriber's Spouse ends on the last day of the month in which the divorce occurs. b. Coverage for a Child who is Your Dependent ends on the last day of the Calendar Year in which the Child reaches the age of 26, unless otherwise indicated below or in an attached Rider. c. Coverage for a Child who is Your Dependent continues without regard to age if the Child is diagnosed as Permanently Disabled before the Child reaches the age of 26, and the Child relies on You for all or most of their support. A Permanently Disabled Dependent is eligible for continued coverage if all of the following apply: 1. The Dependent is the Child of the Subscriber or the Subscriber's Spouse; 2. The Dependent is not capable of engaging in self-sustaining employment because of a Permanent Disability. Certain diagnoses, including but not limited to attention deficit disorder or depressi on, by themselves, are not evidence of Permanent Disability. Learning disabilities, substance abuse, or the inability to \"hold a job\" alone is not evidence of Permanent Disability. Examples of diagnoses that may constitute a Permanent Disability include Down Syndrome and traumatic brain injury. 3. The Permanent Disability started and was diagnosed before age 26; and 4. The Dependent relies on the Subscriber or the Subscriber's Spouse for more than half of their support, as determined under Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. You must provide satisfactory proof to Us of Your Dependent's Permanent Disability and financial dependence no later than 30 days after the Dependent attains age 26. After the initial proof of Permanent Disability, You must give Us proof when We ask for it, from time to time, but not more often than once each year. Coverage for the Permanently Disabled Dependent will end if any of the following events occur: 1. The Dependent is no longer a dependent of You or Your Spouse as determined under Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended; 2. The Dependent's Permanent Disability ends; 3. We do not receive proof that the Dependent is Permanently Disabled within 30 days after requesting such information; HAP-HMO-LG 1/2020 5 4. The Dependent no longer meets Eligibility requirements for any reason other than reaching 26 years of age; or 5. The Dependent is married after reaching 26 years of age. If the Permanently Disabled Dependent is enrolled in Medicare, We must be notified of the Medicare coverage in order to coordinate benefits. d. Coverage for a Child under a Qualified Medical Child Support Order begins on the date of the court order, if We receive notice within 30 days of the court order. If We receive notice longer than 30 days after the court order is issued, coverage is effective on the date We receive the notice. If the Subscriber who is under the court order does not enroll the Child, the other parent or the State child support enforcement agency may enroll the Child. Coverage continues for as long as the court order is in effect or until the Child no longer meets Our Eligibility requirements, whichever is earlier. e. Coverage for a minor Child to whom the Subscriber or the Subscriber's Spouse is a legal guardian, continues as long as the court appointment is in effect or until the minor Child reaches the age of 18, whichever is earlier. 2.5 Effect of Medicare Eligibility If You are eligible for Medicare, You may be eligible for coverage under this Contract only if You are an active Employee, an eligible retiree or an eligible Dependent as defined by Your Group and Your Group purchases the Complementary Medicare Rider / Medicare Wrap Rider. If You are a Group retiree eligible for Medicare Part A You must enroll in Part A. If You are a Group retiree eligible for Medicare Part B You must enroll in Part B. Check with Your Group to find out if Your Group offers retiree health plan benefits. 2.6 Initial Enrollment and Open Enrollment Periods During the initial enrollment period, You and Your Dependents must enroll for coverage within 30 days of becoming eligible. You may also enroll during the annual Open Enrollment period specified by Your Group or Remitting Agent. If You do not enroll during one of these enrollment periods, You and/or Your Dependents will not be allowed to enroll until the next Open Enrollment Period, unless You experience a life event that entitles You to a Special Enrollment Period. 2.7 Special Enrollment Periods Outside of Your Group's Open Enrollment Period, You may encounter a qualifying life event that makes You and/or Your Dependents eligible for a Special Enrollment Period. This would not apply to Your Dependents if the Group does not offer coverage for Spouses or Dependents. We must receive notice of these events from Your Group or Remitting Agent within 30 days of the event in order to provide coverage and/or adjust Premiums. We will only cover new Dependents upon timely payment of any additional Premium due to Us. Qualifying life events include, but are not limited to the following: a. Loss of qualifying health coverage, such as COBRA coverage ending, job loss, reduction in the number of hours employed, divorce, death, aging off a parent's health plan. b. Change in household size, such as marriage, birth or adoption of a child, divorce, legal separation or death. HAP-HMO-LG 1/2020 6 c. Newly qualified employee. d. Other circumstances required under state or federal law. 2.8 Notifying Us of Important Changes You must notify Your Group and Us as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days after any of the following changes for either You or Your Dependent(s): a. A change in name, address or telephone number. b. Retirement or other changes in Your employment status. c. A change in Medicare eligibility or coverage such as entitlement to, enrollment in or disenrollment from Medicare Parts A and/or B. d. The addition of, or a change in, any other health coverage to which You or Your Dependent may be entitled. 2.9 Failure to Notify Us of Changes Failure to provide timely and complete notice of changes in Eligibility or other important changes as noted above may result in a lapse in coverage and a denial of Claims. We are not responsible for a lapse in coverage when You, Your Group or Remitting Agent do not notify Us of these changes. 2.10 Documentation for Coverage Upon request by Us, You must give Us information, including copies of documents, which help Us determine the Eligibility of You or Your Dependents for coverage under this Contract. HAP-HMO-LG 1/2020 7 SECTION 3\u2014SERVICES AND BENEFITS The services and benefits described in this Section are Covered Services only when provided in accordance with Our Benefit, Referral and Practice Policies by an Affiliated Provider, except in an Emergency, or as otherwise approved by Us or Our designee. We will pay benefits for Covered Services only if the services are provided while Your coverage under this Contract is in force. No benefits are payable for health care expenses incurred before the Effective Date or after Your coverage has terminated; even if the expenses were incurred as a result of an Injury or Illness which occurred, commenced or existed while Your coverage was in force. An expense for a service or supply is incurred on the date the service or supply is furnished. We assume no responsibility for the outcome of any Covered Services. We make no express or implied warranties concerning the outcome of any Covered Services. Coverage is limited to the most appropriate method and scope of treatment according to Our Benefit, Referral and Practice Policies, except in an Emergency. No Charges in excess of Allowable Amount s will be reimbursed for Covered Services. Covered Services are subject to Copayments, Co insurance, Deductibles, Out-of-Pocket Limits and any other Cost-Sharing amounts shown in t he Schedule of Benefits. You are responsible for paying these amounts. Covered Services may be limited by Maximum Benefits permissible under state and federal law. Maximum Benefits are described in the Schedule of Benefits, this Section of the Contract or in a Rider. Affiliated Providers agree to accept Our payment of the Allowable Amount for Covered Services as payment in full, other than applicable Cost-Sharing. Affiliated Providers may not Balance Bill You. Non-Affiliated Providers may require You to pay the difference between the Allowable Amount and the provider's actual Charge for Covered Services. This is referred to as Balance Billing. Balance Billing amounts do not count toward the Out-of-Pocket Limits. To avoid Balance Billing You should confirm that the person treating You is an Affiliated Provider before receiving any treatment or services. Only services that are Medically Necessary and se rvices listed as preventive services in section 3.4 are Covered Services in accordance with this Contract. Certain services require Prior Authorization from Us before they will be covered. See Section 4 for detailed information about Prior Authorization and Medical Management requirements.

Possession of an Identification Card does not mean You have a right to benefits under this Contract. You must immediately report theft or loss of Your Identification Card to Us. i.

You have a responsibility at the time of enrollment to select a single Physician Network or Medical Group and a single PCP for Your medical care. For selected Physician Networks or Medical Group, most Covered Services require a Referral from Your PCP, and most Referrals from Your PCP will be to Affiliated Providers within Your chosen Physician Network or Medical Group. You may choose any Affiliated family practitioner, general practitioner or internist as Your PCP. A pediatrician may be chosen as the PCP for a Dependent child. k.

HAP-HMO-LG 1/2020 48 SECTION 7 - COORDINATION OF BENEFITS, SUBROGATION AND REIMBURSEMENT 7.1 Duplicate Coverage You may be entitled to receive services similar to Covered Services from a Source other than this plan. State laws, Our contracts with Groups and government programs require Us to coordinate Your benefits as a way to reduce the cost of health care. We do not duplicate benefits available from any other Source. In no event will money be paid or credited to You as a result of Coordination of Benefits. If We pay for Covered Services that are covered by another Source, We will automatically be assigned Your right to seek reimbursement and all rights of subrogation against the other Source. 7.2 Your Obligation to Inform Us of Other Coverage You must immediately notify Us of any other Source of coverage and provide Us with information We request. Other coverage includes, but is not limited to, coverage under Medicare. Failure to do so may result in the delay of payment for Covered Services. Payment will be delayed until You provide Us with complete and accurate information about any other Source of coverage. 7.3 How We Coordinate Benefits a. We coordinate Your benefits under the State of Michigan Coordination of Benefits law, the federal Medicare secondary payer law and other applicable law. Unless otherwise required by law, the benefits for Covered Services under this Contract will be deemed secondary to benefits available from any other Source. b. When You are covered by another Source in addition to this plan, You must send all bills first to the primary plan. The primary plan must pay its full benefits as if You had no other coverage. If the primary plan denies the Claim or does not pay the full bill, You may then submit the balance to Us. If We and the other Source cannot agree on which plan is primary within 30 calendar days after both plans have received all of the information needed to pay the Claim, each plan will pay the Claim in equal shares and determine their relative liabiliti es following payment. Except as required by law, We will not pay more as the secondary plan than We would have paid as the primary plan. c. We pay for Covered Services only when You follow Our rules and procedures regarding Referrals and authorizations. You are responsible for ensuring that You receive services from Affiliated Providers, regardless of whether We are the primary or secondary payer. d. We do not pay any fees, Copayments, D eductibles, Coinsurance or other monetary requirements and obligations imposed by the primary plan or other payer. 7.4 Coordination with Medicare The following rules apply with respect to coordination with Medicare, except as required otherwise by applicable law: a. You are Age 65 or Over. If You are working full-time and are at least age 65 (or are the Spouse of the Subscriber who is working full-time and You are at least age 65): HAP-HMO-LG 1/2020 49 1. Medicare will be primary if the Employer who is providing this Contract has less than 20 Employees; and 2. This plan will be primary if the Employer who is providing this Contract has 20 or more Employees. The number or Employees an Employer has will be determined by looking at a typical business day during the previous Calendar Year. If You are covered by Medicare because of Your age and if Your coverage under this Contract is not due to Your (or Your Spouse's) current active employment, Medicare will be primary. For example, if Your Coverage is under COBRA or a retiree plan, Medicare will be primary. b. You are Disabled and Under Age 65. If You are disabled and Your coverage under this Contract is due to the current active employment status of You, Your Spouse or parent: 1. This plan will be primary, if this plan is a Large Group Health Plan; and 2. Medicare will be primary, if this plan is not a Large Group Health plan. A \"Large Group Health Plan\" is one that had at least 100 Employees on a typical business day during the previous Calendar Year. If You are covered by Medicare because of disability, and if Your coverage under this Contract is not due to the current active employment status of You, Your Spouse or parent, Medicare will be primary. For exam ple, if Your coverage is under COBRA or a retiree plan, Medicare will be primary. c. You are Eligible for Medicare ESRD Benefits. Except as provided below, if You are entitled to or eligible for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) Medicare benefits, this Contract will be primary for the first 30 months of eligibility for Medicare ESRD benefits plus any applicable waiting period for those benefits. After that time, Medicare will be primary. If You have primary coverage under Medicare by reason of age or disability and You later become eligible for Medicare ESRD coverage, Medicare will remain primary. d. Eligibility for Medicare Coordination with Medicare depends on a number of things. The size of Your Group, whether You are an active Employee or a retiree or whether You are covered under Your Spouse's group health plan can all affect coordination with Medicare. You should always check with Your Employer to make sure You understand all of Your options for Medicare and health plan coverage. If You are a retiree You must enroll in Medicare Parts A and B as soon as You are eligible for those programs. If You are an active Employee and Your Employer Group has less than twenty (20) Employees, You must enroll in Medicare Parts A and B as soon as You are eligible if You are age 65 or older. If You are an active Employee and Your Group has less than 100 Employees, You must enroll in Medicare Parts A and B as soon as You are eligible if Your Medicare eligibility is based on Your disability. We do not pay for services that can be paid by Medicare, for which You are eligible. We do not pay for these services even if You have not signed up to receive the benefits from Medicare. However, We will pay for services if the law requires Medicare to be secondary to Your coverage under this Contract. HAP-HMO-LG 1/2020 50 e. Statutory and Regulatory Changes. Despite any other provision of this Contract, if the law changes, permitting this plan to be secondary to Medicare in any circum stances not stated above, this plan will be secondary to Medicare as permitted by the new law. 7.5 Subrogation and Reimbursement a. We may try to recover the amounts paid for Covered Services to the extent that You have a right to recover those amounts from any other party. We are automatically assigned to all of Your rights to recover the amounts We paid for such Covered Services. We will not repay You for expenses , including attorney fees and costs, that You incur to recover these amounts from any other party. By accepting Our payment for Covered Services, You agree to the terms contained in this section of the Contract. You also agree to repay Us for all expenses paid for Covered Services within 30 days of obtaining a monetary recovery. b. If You file a claim for benefits or request payment against any person or Source related to any accident, Injury, or condition that We paid, or may pay in the future, You must provide written notice to Us. The notice must include a copy of any documents sent to the other person or Source. The notice must be given to Us within 10 days after You filed the claim. You must provide Us with complete and accurate information for Us to enforce Our rights of recovery. You cannot compromise or settle a claim that could prejudice Our recovery rights unless We agree in writing. We may stop or offset present or future payment for Covered Services if You do not give Us complete and accurate information and other assistance reasonably required by Us to enforce Our rights of recovery. c. If You receive or are entitled to receive payment from another person or Source that is legally responsible for the Injury or Illness or for payment of Your medical expenses, You are obligated to repay Us for all medical expenses We paid. If You receive or are entitled to receive payment under a settlement agreement which neither admits nor denies liability for the Injury or Illness, You are obligated to repay Us for all medical expenses We paid for Covered Services. d. You will hold any amounts received or re covered from another person or Source as Our trustee until Our rights under this Section have been satisfied or released in writing by Us. e. You do not have the right to engage legal counsel or to act on Our behalf without Our written agreement. f. If You engage legal counsel to pursue a claim against any person or Source, You must inform Your legal counsel of Our rights under this Section. g. You assign Us a first dollar lien (i.e., priority over other rights) against the proceeds of any recovery by You or on Your behalf. This lien applies whether the recovery is due to judgment or verdict in a civil action or as a result of arbitration, mediation, settlement, or other remedy. This lien w ill extend to any and all amounts recovered by You or on Your behalf even if the amounts recovered are for losses or damages other than the Covered Services We paid. This lien will also apply even if the amount recovered is less than, equal to, or greater than Your total losses or damages. h. If any recovery by You or on Your behal f includes amounts for future damages or loss, You agree to hold the recovery amount in trust, subject to a continuing lien in HAP-HMO-LG 1/2020 51 Our favor. You agree to promptly repay Us for all future Covered Services We pay that are related to the Illness or Injury that gave rise to the recovery. HAP-HMO-LG 1/2020 52 SECTION 8 - PREMIUM PAYMENT, RESCISSION AND CANCELLATION 8.1 Payment of Premium All Premiums are due and payable in advance.

HAP-HMO-LG 1/2020 55 SECTION 9 - CLAIMS PROCEDURES In this Claims Procedures section, when We talk about \"You\" We are also referring to Your Authorized Representative. See the Definitions section to understand who may be Your Authorized Representative. 9.1 Filing a Claim If You receive Covered Services from an Affiliated Provider, You should not have to file a Claim. Benefits are paid directly to Your Affiliated Provider. However, You should always check with Your Affiliated Provider to make sure that the Claim has been filed and that the services have been Prior Authorized. Some Non-Affiliated Providers may also file Claims for You. When You receive services from a Non-Affiliated Provider, You are responsible for ensuring that the Pre-Service Claim, Urgent Care Claim, or Concurrent Care Claim is filed correctly and that the services have been Prior Authorized, even if the Non-Affiliated Provider offers to file the Claim for You. However, You may need to file a Claim if You see a Non-Affiliated Provider. Or there may be other reasons You need to file a Claim. If You must file a Claim, follow these instructions. You must send Us Your Claim within 1 year after You receive services. We will not process any Claim if We receive it more than 1 year after You receive the services. The only exception is if You were legally incapacitated and can show proof that You were incapacitated. If You can provide this proof We will process the Claim. You may send Claims to Us at 2850 West Grand Boulevard, Detroit, MI, 48202. Write \"Attention Member Reimbursement\" on the envelope. Fill out the Direct Member Reimbursement form available on Our website. Log in at hap.org and click on Member Resources under Quick Links. You may also call Us and ask for the form. All claims must include a description of the services provided and the diagnosis or other information that establishes Medical Necessity. A Claim is considered filed when We receive it, even if We don't have all of the information We need to decide the Claim. If the Claim does not have all the information We need to make a benefit determination, We may ask You to give Us additional information. If You do not provide that information in the time periods We describe in any notices, We may deny the Claim, in whole or in part. 9.2 Notices Regardless of the type of Claim, You will re ceive a written or electronic notice of any Adverse Benefit Determination. Notice of Initial Benefit Determination Each time a Claim is submitted and You are responsible for a portion of the Claim payment, You will receive a written or electronic notice that explains how much was paid and whether the Claim was denied, in whole or in part. HAP-HMO-LG 1/2020 56 If Your Claim is denied We will send You a notice of Adverse Benefit Determination. The notice will do the following: a. Explain the reason for the denial. b. Tell You what part of the Contract is the reason for the denial. c. Describe any other information necessary to reverse the denial, or complete an incomplete Claim, and tell You when the information is necessary. d. Explain the Appeals procedures and any right You may have under certain laws. e. Tell You if We used internal guidelines, protocols or other information. If You ask, We will provide, free of charge, a copy of the rule, guideline, protocol or other information, as well as reasonable access to documents, records and other information on the Claim. f.

If the Claim was an Urgent Care Claim, We will describe the Expedited Appeal process. h. Give You sufficient information to identify the Claim. i. Any other information required by law. We will send You the notice within certain timeframes. The timing depends on the kind of Claim. Below are the different kinds of Claims and the timeframes. Urgent Care Claims For Urgent Care Claims We will notify You of the benefit determination, whether adverse or not, as soon as possible considering the urgency of Your medical situation but no later than 72 hours after receipt of the Claim. However, if necessary information is missing or You failed to follow Our procedures for filing Urgent Care Claims, We will tell You within 24 hours what information We need or what procedures You must follow. You will have at least 48 hours to respond to Us. We will decide the Claim within 48 hours of receiving the information or within 48 hours after Your time to respond has expired, whichever is earlier. We can notif y You orally of the benefit determination but We will send a written notification to You no later than 3 days after the oral notification. Pre-Service Claims For Pre-Service Claims We will notify You of the benefit determination, whether adverse or not, within a reasonable period of time, appropriate to the medical circumstances, but no later than 15 days after We receive Your request for a benefit determination. We may extend the time period up to an additional 15 days if, for reasons beyond Our control, We cannot make the decision with the first 15 days. We must notify You prior to the expiration of the first 15-day period. We will explain the reason for the delay and request any additional information. We will also tell You when We expect to make the decision. If We need more information We will give You at least 45 days to send it to Us. HAP-HMO-LG 1/2020 57 We will decide the Claim no later than 15 days after You supply the additional information or after the period of time allowed to supply it ends, whichever comes first. If We want more time, We need Your consent. We must give You written notice that Your Claim has been approved or denied before the end of the time allotted for the decision. If a service requires Prior Authorization to receive Covered Services but the service is provided before You receive Our approval, the Claim will be reviewed as a Post-Service Claim. Casual questions about Your benefits or the situations about when Your benefits may be covered are not considered Pre-Service Claims. Post Service Claims For Post Service Claims We will notify You of an Adverse Benefit Determination within a reasonable period of time, but no later than 30 days after receipt of the Claim. We may extend the time period up to an additional 15 days if, for reasons beyond Our control, We cannot make the decision within the first 30 days. We must notify You prior to the expiration of the first 30-day period that We need an additional 15 days. We will explain the reason for the delay and request any additional information. We will also tell You when We expect to make the decision. If We need more information We will give You at least 45 days to send it to Us. We will make Our decision no later than 15 days after the end of the 45 day period or after We receive Your information or after the period of time allowed to supply it ends, whichever comes first. Concurrent Care Claims (Claims for Ongoing Course of Treatment) Concurrent Care Claims may fall under the following categories, and different notice and Appeal time frames apply: a. We will notify You in sufficient time to Appeal if We are going to reduce or terminate an ongoing course of treatment. You will be able to Appeal and obtain a decision on the Appeal before the benefit is reduced or terminated. b. If You request an extension of ongoing treatm ent in an urgent circumstance, You will be notified as soon as possible given the medical needs, but no later than 24 hours after We receive Your Claim.
