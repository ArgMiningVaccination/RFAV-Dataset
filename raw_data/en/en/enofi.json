Posing as mothers the reporters were told by some of the homeopaths not to inform schools, or other parents if they chose not to give their children the jabs. One of the homeopaths who advised them to hide their decision is also an NHS GP. The revelations were on Friday [condemned by health officials](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/28/nhs-chiefs-attempt-blacklist-homeopathy-amid-anti-vax-fears/). [Health Secretary Matt Hancock](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/matthew-hancock/) said: \"Spreading disinformation in this way is completely outrageous. The science is beyond doubt: vaccines are safe. They are effective and they save lives and there is no alternative. Vaccines are a miracle of modern medicine and I condemn anyone who suggests otherwise. \"I pay tribute to the outstanding investigative work of the Telegraph in exposing the way that this misinformation has spread.\" [The head of the NHS Simon Stevens said:](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/01/harmful-side-effect-placebo-has-exposed-has-no-place-nhs/) \"Misinformation has real world consequences and not just for the boys and girls directly involved. \"Children needing cancer treatment who, for example, have suppressed immune systems rely on others having had vaccinations to protect them when they return to school.\" The majority of the homeopaths told undercover reporters that, if they were in their situation, they would not give their healthy young children the schedule of vaccinations recommended by the NHS. The Telegraph's investigation also found that practitioners across the country are telling patients that vaccines cause or trigger autism, even though the research that first alleged a link has been debunked by the scientific community. Some of the homeopaths also blamed immunisation programmes for other conditions prevalent among children such as eczema, asthma, OCD, Tourette's and a general loss of \"vitality\". One of the practitioners - Alan Freestone in Birmingham - told a journalist he believed to be pregnant: \"If I was in your position, I wouldn't vaccinate at all\". Another homeopath, [Lorraine Whitby in Essex, said she was not \"anti-vaccines\".](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/01/truthfully-better-boosting-immune-systems-not-giving-jabs/) But she added that the reporter would be \"better off\" boosting the immune systems of her healthy three-years-olds with homeopathic remedies instead of the jabs recommended by the NHS at that age. These include the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) booster. According to the NHS, people who get these diseases risk complications that could cause deafness or brain damage, or prove fatal. However, some of the homeopaths claimed that it is actually good for children to get measles, mumps and rubella, and that they are beneficial to child development. Dr Jayne Donegan, the homeopath who is also an NHS doctor, said \"children should get measles\", that girls would get rubella \"in an ideal world\" and you \"definitely want them to get mumps\". She did not tell the reporter whether she would vaccinate her children in the same position, or draw links to autism - but told how she felt \"guilty\" for having her own children vaccinated early on. She also advised the reporter that if she decided to do \"anything nonstandard with your children about their vaccination\" that it was \"best not to discuss it really with your friends because they'll start thinking that your child is going to infect all of their children\". Alan Freestone also warned the reporter that parents who do not vaccinate their children should not inform their schools. \"Just don't bloody tell them...just sort of pretend you did [vaccinate].\" September figures showed that vaccination rates are falling for MMR and all major illnesses, and that MMR vaccination rates are now at a five year low. At the same time, measles has had such a resurgence that the UK and three other countries have lost their measles-free status. Mr Stevens this week urged the medical watchdog to de-list the Society of Homeopaths from its official register of professional organisations, claiming that it gives a misleading and unacceptable \"veneer of credibility\" to homeopaths. The Society of Homeopaths, which represents around 1,000 homeopaths, says in its code that it is \"unethical\" for practitioners to advise against the use of jabs. On Friday it said that members are expected to uphold its code and any breaches including \"provision of patient advise against vaccinations may be treated as disciplinary matters\". Just one of the homeopaths visited by the Telegraph is a member of the Society of Homeopaths, which is one of a string of professional associations for the industry. Others are members of the Alliance of Registered Homeopaths. Every single one of the homeopaths consulted initially said that they could not tell parents whether to vaccinate their children. But all of those named here made their positions on vaccinations clear. Most of them told reporters that they would not accept boosters in the same position. Others - including Dr Donegan - argued that it was beneficial to children to contract measles and other childhood diseases. On Friday she branded this investigation as \"misconceived\", adding: \"I am a registered medical doctor also trained as a homeopath. \"No doctor can ethically deny that children suffer 'serious, life-changing adverse reactions' to vaccines. Every doctor is duty bound to advise the patient, or if a child, the child's parent and obtain fully informed consent. \"I believe parents are rarely told the risks and there is a serious problem of under-reporting "}
