For example, if someone is suffering from watery eyes due to allergies, they may benefit from a homeopathic remedy that contains small substances of onion, which produces the same effect. The remedies themselves contain tiny amounts of these kinds of substances, and are mixed in a water or alcohol solution. This mixing process is believed to transfer the healing power of the substance, which provides relief from symptoms when consumed. Homeopathy deals exclusively with homeopathic remedies, whereas naturopathy is a much broader practice that includes treatments like dietary advice, herbal medicine, hydrotherapy, physical therapy (like massage), and counselling techniques. Both therapies are a type of holistic medicine that aims to treat people's entire health, not just symptoms they are experiencing. Homeopathic remedies are used to create a number of conditions and medical issues. These include: A homeopath has access to a vast array of substances from the plant and animal kingdoms, as well as minerals found in the earth. These are some of the more commonly used substances by homeopaths: The easiest way to find a skilled homeopath is through our practitioner directory, but if you'd like to look elsewhere, you'll need to consider their qualifications and their knowledge of the latest development in homeopathy (things constantly change).

But this varies depending on the issue that is being treated, and how severe it is. For example, chronic conditions can take much longer to produce effects, whereas smaller issues may be resolved faster. Homeopathy and conventional medicine are entirely different fields, so you definitely take the two together. In fact, as a complementary practice, homeopathy is intended to complement conventional medicine. Just be sure to tell your homeopath about any medications you're currently taking\u2014they'll know if there's any risks or conflicts for the homoeopathic remedies they recommend. "}
