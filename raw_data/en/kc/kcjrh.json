The purpose is to clarify the application process and highlight NCI -specific requirements. This document is not intended to replace the full and detailed application information in the Program Announcement: Research Supplements to Promot e Diversity in Health -Related Research, PA-21-0 71 Investigators are encouraged to contact the NCI Supplement Program Director prior to submission. NCI Diversity Supplements Application Receipt Dates are October 1 - December 1 and February 1 - March 31 . 1. ELIGIBILITY 1.1 Candidate NCI Diversity Supplements support the research training of students, post -baccalaureate and post-Masters individuals, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty investigators. Supplemental awards under this announcement are limited to citizens or non-citizen nationals of the United States or to individuals who have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States (i.e., in possession of a Permanent Resident Card, Form I -551). This program may not be used to provide technical support to NIH-supported investigators . Each candidate may receive one diversity supplement per career level . NCI particularly encourages applications from individuals from groups identified in NIH's Notice of Interest in Diversity ( NOT -OD-20-031 ) as underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences, including : Individuals from racial and ethnic groups that have been shown by the National Science Foundation to be underrepresented in health-related sciences on a national basis ( see data and the report Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering ). The following racial and ethnic groups have been shown to be underrepresented in biomedical research: Blacks or African Americans, Hispanics or Latinos, American Indians or Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders. For more information on racial and ethnic categories and definitions, see NOT -OD-15-089 . Individuals with disabilities who are defined as those with a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, as described in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended . See NSF data . Individuals from financially and/or educationally disadvantaged backgrounds, particularly before graduating from high school, while residing in the United States. Detailed eligibility criteria and diversity information may be found in the Program Announcement . High school and undergraduate student candidates are expected to demonstrate at least two years of commitment to the supplement program. Post-baccalaureate and post -Mast ers individuals as well as investigator candidates may apply for a maximum of two years support in a new supplement application. Graduate student and postdoctoral fellow candidates who are receiving support from an agency of the Public Health Service (PHS) at the time of submission are not eligible. 2 Because this program is not intended to provide an alternative or additional means of supporting individuals who receive support from PHS funding mechanisms, graduate students and individuals in postdoctoral training who are supported by an institutional Kirschstein-NRSA may not be transferred to supplemental support prior to the completion of their appointed period of training. In addition, individuals may not be transferred to a supplement to increase the availability of funds to the parent grant for other uses. Eligible graduate student and postdoctoral fellow candidates may be suppor ted by the parent grant for short periods after submission of supplement application, at the recipient's risk, pending NCI decision on the supplement application. See the Program Announcement f or details. Investigators should contact the NCI Supplement Program Director to verify eligibility. 1.2 Parent grant At the time of the supplement application, the parent grant must have at least two years of NCI support remaining. The eligible grant types are listed in the Program Announcement , with the following exceptions: NCI does not accept P30 as parent grants for Diversity Supplements. In addition, the following limitations apply: An R01 or R01-equivalent grant is allowed to support a maximum of two Diversity Supplement candidates. An R21 or R21-equivalent grant is allowed to support a maximum of one Diversity Supplement candidate whose career level is graduate student or more junior. 1.3 Research project Proposed supplement project must be relevant to (contributes to, expands or extends) the parent grant project, and the relevance needs to be explicitly explained in the application. If the parent grant has multiple research projects, the supplement project must not only be within the general scope of the parent grant, but also be relevan t to a specific project listed within the parent grant. Clinical Trials: This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is designed specifically for applicants proposing research that does not involve leading an independent clinical trial, a clinical trial feasibility study, or an ancillary study to a clinical trial. Applicants to this FOA are permitted to propose research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co -mentor. 2. SALARY AND BUDGET Please note: if awarded, the budget period for the supplement will sync with the budget period of the parent grant during the first 12 months . For example, as shown in Table 1, if the parent grant budget period ends on June 30 of each year, and the supplement is awarded starting March 1, then the first budget period of the supplement will be only 4 months, March 1 - June 30 of the same year, and the second budget period will be a full 12 months, July 1 - June 30 (of the next year). In addition, please note that any one budget period must be 12 months or less. Please configure your budget request accordingly. Table 1.

All supplement applications must be submitted electronically. It is suggested that the NCI Supplement Prog ram D irector be notified once the application is submitted. 6 5. REVIEW AND AWARD Supplement applications are reviewed internally at NCI based on scientific merit and training potential. For applications submitted in the October 1 - December 1 period, funding recommendations are anticipated in March; for applications submitted in the February 1 - March 3 1 period, funding recommendations are anticipated in June. 6. POST AWARD PROCEDURES 6.1. Supplement progress reports 6.1.1. Annual supplement progress reports Annual supplement progress reports are due at least once per 12 months. Once awarded, supplements will align with the parent grant's budget periods. Annual supplement progress reports must be submitted each year at the time of submission of the parent grant progress report through RPPR. To facilitate progress report generation and program analysis, investigators are strongly encouraged to generate progress reports via CareerTrac. The generated .pdf file of the progress report should be attached to section G.1 of the parent grant RPPR . If the submission of the supplement progress report is late, it should be submitted to the NCI supplement program director with institution approval. 6.1.2. Final supplement progress reports Final supplement progress reports are due within 120 days of the completion of the supplement. PIs are strongly encouraged to generate the final supplement progress report through CareerTrac in the same fashion as the annual progress reports. They should be attached to section G.1 of the parent grant RPPR. If late, they may be sent to the NCI supplement program director with institution approval . 6.1.3. Additional progress reports In addition to a nnual supplement progress reports, NCI may request interim progress reports during a budget period in order to help ensure candidates' progress along their chosen trajectory. 6.2. Early Termination of Supplement Awards The PI is strongly encouraged to notify NCI as soon as possible about a supplement award termination. The termination must be reported in the next RPPR of the parent grant, and a final supplement progress report as described in 6.1.2 must be submitted at that time . Unobligated funds at the time of termination will be returned to NCI. Additionally, diversity supplements cannot be transferred from one candidate to another. 6.3. Changes in Supplement Awards A Diversity Supplements is specific to the parent grant and the candidate. If either changes, the supplement must be terminated. In the event that the parent grant PI or candidate changes institutions, the PI and the candidate should contact the NCI Supplement Program Director to discuss options. 7. EXTENSIONS 7.1. Cost extension s For a candidate who has not completed the originally proposed research training at the completion of the supplement award, a cost extension to the supplement may be requested. Cost extension requests may be made only under extenuating circumstances, provided that adequate time remains on the parent grant. An 7 application for a cost extension is permissible when the parent grant is on a no -cost extension. If approved, cost extensions are awarded for a maximum of one year. Support for a cost extension is not guaranteed. NCI Supplement Program Director must be informed of the intent to apply for a cost extension at least six months prior to the end of the supplement award. Cost extension requests must be submitted during the two application receipt periods for new supplement applications. A cost extension application must include the following: Cover letter signed by PI, including time period and reason for extension; Face page (PHS 398), with all the required signatures; Updated budget and budget justification forms; Annual supplement progress report of the candidate during the preceding funding period, including both research and career develo pment, as described in 6.1.1 ; Updated mentoring and career development plan, including updated timeline for research progress and career development, if applicable. Collect all material into one PDF file and submit the file as one single attachment by email from the institution program or business office to the NCI Supplement Program Director . Use the subject line \"NCI Diversity Supplement Cost Extension Application PDF\", and include the PI's contact information in the body of the email. Important considerations for the funding decision of a cost extension application include how much progress the candidate has made and how the extension may help further the candidate's career progress, both of which may be reflected by publications, gran t submissions or education progress . In the case where the parent grant is submitting a Renewal (Type 2) application, funds for continuation of support of the supplemental award will depend on the successful renewal of the parent grant and will be handle d as follows: Funds for the continuation of support for students must be requested as a new diversity supplement. The request must be submitted promptly in anticipation of a renewal award to avoid an interruption of support. Additional time may be conside red for individuals with disabilities, but must be well justified. Funds for continued support for a postdoctoral researcher or an investigator must be requested by name in the parent grant application at the time of renewal and may not be requested as a research supplement. Postdoctoral researchers and investigators are expected to be fully integrated in the research laboratory when considered for continuation of support. 7.2. No-cost extensions No-cost extensions are allowed on NCI diversity supplements provided adequate time remains on the parent grant. The NIH Standard Terms of Award provide the recipient the authority to extend the final budget period of a previously approved project period one time for a period of up to 12 months beyond the original expiration date in the Notice of Award. One -time no -cost extensions are requested via the eRA commons, as noted here. In the case of a no -cost extension, an annual supplement progress report as described in 6.1.1 is required on or before the original supplement award end date. Submit the progress report with institution approval to the NCI Supplement Program Director . 8 If a no -cost extension is associated with carryover funds, a request needs to be submitted to the NCI Supplement Program Director including the amount of carryover, the reason for the carryover, and plans for spending the carryover. 8.
