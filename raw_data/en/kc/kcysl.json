Practitioners of homeopathy, known as homeopaths, prescribe oral and topical treatments. Homeopathy traces its origin to the late 1700s. Historically, the ideology behind the practice was to prescribe small quantities of an illness-causing substance as a cure for the same illness. Today, homeopathic remedies may range from chamomile tea to essential oils. These treatments often include herbs and other plant substances. While homeopathic cures are generally not recognized by modern science, some patients believe them to be effective. Common conditions which people may seek homeopathic treatment for include Crohn's disease, sore throat, insomnia, allergies, rheumatoid arthritis, and dermatitis.
