In the resting phase of hair growth, hair stops growing, and after approximately 100 days in the resting phase, the hair starts falling. Stress and nutritional imbalance may also cause hair loss after childbirth. Inflammation of the thyroid gland or thyroiditis also affects hair growth. When does postpartum hair loss stop?
