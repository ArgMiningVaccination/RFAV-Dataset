Do you feel that you're simply rushed through the system and that your symptoms and complaints are not really heard, acknowledged or appreciated? Imagine medical office visits where you can actually sit down and talk with your physician without feeling rushed. Where you discuss how stress, diet, sleep problems, under nutrition or other factors may be affecting your various medical problems-and what you can do about it. Imagine taking the time to discuss the root causes of your medical conditions and not simply put band aids or pills on problems. Imagine how unhurried appointments, frequent phone visits, e-mails and more can save your valuable time while providing you the medically-guided information so otherwise impossible to secure. This is not a dream; this is exactly what we are offering and we do this without billing your health insurance. Most office visits, services, labs and procedures in the office are covered by an affordable monthly patient subscription fee.
