You may have heard that meditation is helpful for reducing anxiety, dealing with stress, enhancing deep recovery, improving sleep, and any number of other benefits. On this journey, you may have been or you might feel challenged by finding the meditation techniques that work authentically for you and your personality. There are so many styles, lineages, and approaches to this practice. The truth is that different practices and techniques work for different people. How do you find the technique that works for you? How do you fall in love with meditation? In this conversation, I'd like to introduce you to modern-day meditation teacher and trainer of teachers Lorin Roche, PhD and his wife and teaching partner, Camille Maurine. Lorin Roche has spent his life meditating as well as teaching people to meditate, and teaching people how to teach others to meditate. Lorin earned his doctorate from the University of California, Irvine in the 1960s. In his research, one of the things he studied was the language meditators use to describe their experiences. This allowed him to help people customize a way in to their experience and to finding meditation practices that are instinctive and enjoyable for them. The combination of this work of deep listening and of combining technique with observation gives him a unique perspective that comes through in his work with groups and individuals. This, along with his lifelong immersion in the subtleties of language and technique of the Vijnana Bhairava Tantra (an ancient text describing 112 meditation techniques), makes him one of the most accessible and ground-breaking teachers of our time Camille Maurine brings a uniquely feminine and embodied approach to meditation practice and teaching. She is a dancer, an artist, a poet, a performer, a person whose skills in facilitation draw people out of themselves and into community as well as into the bliss of their own experiences. Meditation is not just in our head. A successful meditation practice is done with our entire bodies. We embody meditation and Camille guides this. Camille is also the coauthor (with Lorin Roche) of Meditation Secrets for Women and Meditation 24/7, Camille's work with the Radiance Sutras, with the teaching of meditation, opens a portal to practice that allows meditation techniques to be effortless and accessible. Together they teach the [Radiance Sutras Meditation Teacher Training.](https://www.meditationtt.com) Even if you have never before thought about taking a [meditation teacher training](https://www.meditationtt.com), and have zero interest in teaching anyone else how to meditate, now may be the time to make this commitment to yourself to your personal growth, to your practice, and to your own inner peace. Guiding People through the Language of Meditation There are many times when I was profoundly struck by Lorin's mastery of the language of meditation. One example took place nearly 10 years ago. We were in a small Santa Monica yoga studio on a Monday evening. The class was a drop-in meditation techniques for beginners. Lorin began by leading the group through a practice exploring instinctive meditation. Then Lorin deftly guided each individual through a process during which he asked them to talk about how they meditated, the words they used to describe their inner experience, the thoughtfulness of their flow state. He reflected words and phrases back to them, and even mirrored their body language as they reflected. Through this process, he provided ways for people to find their instinctive meditation practices. He showed people how to meditate in ways that are authentic and accessible. Observing this and being part of this experience has changed the way that I think about meditation. It has changed the way I meditate. Practicing with Lorin has helped me understand exactly what meditation does, the rhythm and flow of meditation practice on the deepest most cellular level. And how meditation is an essential practice for recovery at all levels and layers of a person's being. The Radiance Sutras and the a yogic text, written in Sanskrit, from the 7th or 8th Century. It is framed as an epic conversation between Bhairavi and Bhairava, deities exploring the nature of meditation, the benefits of meditation, and how to meditate. This text allows for the understanding that there are many forms of meditation. It also describes how different types of meditation work for different people. Over decades, Lorin Roche and Camille Maurine have explored the language and feeling of these verses describing meditation. Their work is found in The Radiance Sutras, a the modern take on the ancient text of the Vijnana Bhairava Tantra for the world we live in today. The word \"Bhav\" in Sanskrit refers to the feeling state, a mood, or an expression of something. In this work, Lorin and Camille truly capture the \"bhav\" of playful and instinctive meditation for the modern meditator. If you want to understand the benefits of meditation in a way that actually allows you to practice, it is helpful to feel the joy and the playfulness of meditation. The Radiance Sutras and Meditation Poetry is one of the portals through which we can understand our experience of meditation. Over the years, I have seen the artistic creativity that Lorin and Camille bring to their interpretations of the Radiance Sutras. They have practiced this ecstatic form of spoken word poetry set to music accompanied by dance and movement with group participation at yoga studios, at retreat centers, in meditation teacher trainings, in yoga teacher trainings, at Esalen, at Kripalu, at Bhakti Fest, and in a number of other locations around the world. The Radiance Sutra Jam Sessions is the ecstatic practice of meditation in action. Over and over again, I have seen these jam sessions introduce people to the joyful practice of meditation. I remember one of the first times when I experienced this. A packed room. Musicians at the front of the space riffing on ecstasy. People taking turns standing up and choosing a stanza describing meditation. Spoken word repetition of evocative language that makes meditation real. Accessible. Fun. People lit up laughing and dancing. We often take meditation so seriously. Through the Radiance Sutras, meditation is joyful. Their way into the human psyche and the soul through this work is truly inspired. Transformation takes place when you practice. Meditation made easy and fun makes practice possible. I have also seen the implementation of the [Radiance Sutras](https://layoga.com/practice/meditation/meditating-with-the-radiance-sutras/) over time and the power of this text, this set of teachings, and how Lorin has used the [modern language of poetry to talk about meditation](https://layoga.com/practice/meditation/surprise-meditation-with-the-radiance-sutras/).

Dr Eden Goldman on Studying Meditation with Dr Lorin Roche Terra Gold: On Studying with Lorin Roche For over a decade at Loyola Marymount University, I brought Lorin Roche in to guide foundational level yoga teachers and yoga therapists skills for practicing and teaching meditation. It seemed to me that the best way to help practitioners understand the value of meditation, was to help them unlearn whatever they thought meditation was. Every year, Lorin would come in and remind the students that if they had learned a style of meditation that had given them the impression they couldn't do it, or if they felt inadequate at it, then it wasn't the right style for them...and it may have even been detrimental for them. I watched hundreds of students melt what was for some of them, years of shame and grief over feeling inept as meditators. With each person in the room, Lorin artfully guided personalized meditative experiences that were so natural people didn't even realize they had gone into meditation until they came out and felt the profound effects of where they had been. The experiences were poetic, profound. Each year the students' feedback was filled with people being uplifted by the experiences. Students were feeling more present, awake in their senses, embodied and vibrantly alive. Most of all, students left empowered and trusting their own unique ways into mediation. Beyond those events, I also shared experiences of learning from Lorin directly in his workshops at Esalen Institute, in his teacher training course for meditation teachers, and most favorite of all, over tea on his couch with him and his wife Camille, and sharing walks together. I've found that many of the metaphors Lorin uses for describing qualities of meditative states, stay with me, largely because they are such natural sensorial expressions, are practical, and they are truly experiential. He's a master of honoring the mundane as the sacred...recognizing a flower, a melody, a texture or color of fabric, a word, a fond memory and how each one can invoke full samadhi (awakening moment, to moment, to moment) NOW. Lorin Roche is a pioneer in the field of meditation, but most precious of all is how he consistently reminds me that growing as an elder can be elegant, wild, unique to each's own, and he reminds me that each and every moment of life is so worth experiencing FULLY. -Terra Gold, author, yoga therapist, east/west medicine practitioner, mother Become a Certified Meditation Teacher What You Learn in the Meditation Teacher Training This perspective on [meditation teacher training](https://www.meditationtt.com) is accessible for everyone.
