Thompson, who is still employed at the CDC under protection of the federal Whistleblower Protection Act, discloses a pattern of data manipulation, fraud, and corruption at the highest levels of the CDC, the federal agency in charge of protecting the health of Americans. Thompson states, Senior people just do completely unethical, vile things and no one holds them accountable.\" This book nullifies the government's claims that vaccines are safe and effective,\" and reveals that the government rigged research to cover up the link between vaccines and autism. Scientific truth and the health of American children have been compromised to protect the vaccine program and the pharmaceutical industry. The financial cost of the CDC's corruption is staggering. The human cost is incalculable. Vaccine Whistleblower provides context to the implications of Thompson's revelations and directs the reader to political action. "}
