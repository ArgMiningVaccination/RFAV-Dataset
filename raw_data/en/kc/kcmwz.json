Assessment of Stinging Insect of Drug Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) and the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology(ACAAI) have jointly accepted responsibility for establishing theAllergy Diagnostic Testing: An Updated Practice Parameter. This is acomplete and comprehensive document at the current time. The medicalenvironment is a changing environment and not all recommendationswill be appropriate for all patients. Because this document incorporatedthe efforts of many participants, no single individual, including thosewho served on the Joint Task Force, is authorized to provide an officialAAAAI or ACAAI interpretation of these practice parameters. Anyrequest for information about or an interpretation of these practiceparameters by the AAAAI or ACAAI should be directed to theExecutive Offices of the AAAAI, the ACAAI, and the Joint Council ofAllergy, Asthma and Immunology. These parameters are not designedfor use by pharmaceutical companies in drug promotion. Received for publication October 27, 2007; Accepted for publication November 16, 2007. VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S1PREFACE The major emphasis of this updated version of Practice Parameters for Allergy Diagnostic Testing is focused on howtechnological refinements and their validations during thepast decade are being incorporated into the diagnostic arma-mentarium of allergists/clinical immunologists and how theiroptimal use enables confirmation of human clinical sensitiv-ity. The term allergy in this Practice Parameter denotes major categories of human hypersensitivity. Pertinent clinical im-munologic techniques are oriented to this category of adap-tive immunity but not to infection, cancer, or transplantationimmunology. The impetus for Practice Parameters for Allergy Diagnos- tic Testing originally stemmed from a consensus conferencesponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and InfectiousDiseases and published as a supplement to the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology in September 1988. One of the major conclusions of that workshop was that periodicreassessment of diagnostic techniques should be mandatory,and in keeping with that recommendation, the 1995 PracticeParameters for Allergy Diagnostic Tests further reviewed andconsidered new developments up to that time. In the 13-yearinterval since that publication, there has been an exponentialprogression of basic and translational immunologic research,some of which produced novel and practical diagnostic pos-sibilities. Obviously, these advancements necessitated anoverhaul of the 1995 Allergy Diagnostic Parameter commen-surate with the extensive database currently available. Theultimate goals were to formulate recommendations based onevidence-based literature and to achieve balanced use ofclassic and new diagnostic methods. The working draft of the Parameter on Allergy Diagnostic Tests update was based on an outline jointly conceived byJames T. Li and I. Leonard Bernstein and realized by a workgroup (Robert Hamilton, Sheldon Spector, Ricardo Tan,David I. Bernstein, Scott Sicherer, David B. K. Golden, andDavid Khan) chaired by I. Leonard Bernstein. As with pre-vious parameters, the draft was based on a review of themedical literature using a variety of search engines, such asPubMed. Published clinical and basic studies were rated bycategories of evidence and used to establish the strength ofrecommendations (Table 1). The initial draft was then re-viewed by all members of the Joint Task Force and subse-quently by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma andImmunology (AAAAI), the American College of Allergy,Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI), and the Joint Council ofAllergy, Asthma and Immunology and a number of expertson in vivo and in vitro diagnostic immunology selected by thesupporting organizations. Comments were also solicited fromthe general membership of these societies via their Web sites.This document therefore represents an evidence-based,broadly accepted consensus opinion. The peer review processand general format of the Practice Parameter are consistentwith recommendations of the American College of MedicalQuality, which defines practice guidelines. As such, it isanticipated to serve as a reference source for current utility and validity of allergy diagnostic tests. The organization of Practice Parameters on Allergy Diag- nostic Tests is similar to previous Joint Task Force parame-ters except that a single algorithm with annotations was notappropriate to the mission of the parameter. The broad rangeof diagnostic techniques for varying purposes could not pos-sibly be stratified into a uniform paradigm encompassingdiverse clinical sensitivity disorders that require objectiveconfirmatory tests. An Executive Summary is followed by acollation of Summary Statements, which also precede refer-enced narrative discussions on each subject. The PracticeParameter is divided into 2 parts: part 1 is a detailed descrip-tion of diagnostic modalities currently available to allergists/clinical immunologists. It encompasses both IgE and cell-mediated in vivo (skin and patch) and in vitro tests for a widespectrum of inhalant, food, and contactant allergens. Organchallenge tests are discussed in greater detail in this revisedPractice Parameter because controlled challenges or super-vised exposure ultimately serve as the appropriate gold stan-dard for assessing whether clinical sensitivity is present.Consonant with their recent emergence as diagnostic ad-juncts, the section concerning current status of cytokines andchemokines has been expanded. A new section on \"OtherImmunologic Tests\" has been added in recognition that manyallergists/clinical immunologists have considerable interestsand expertise in a variety of laboratory immunologic tech-niques commonly used to corroborate the diagnosis of non-IgE, non-cell-mediated clinical immunologic diseases. Adiscussion about unproven techniques is relevant becausethese methods still have advocates who promote them topatients desperately seeking alternative approaches for theirparticular problems. Part 2 considers optimal utilization and integration of ev- idence-based diagnostic methods for various clinical situa-tions, which include inhalant, food, insect venom, drug andcontact sensitivities. Practice parameters of diagnosis andmanagement for each of these clinical entities have beenpreviously published with algorithms tailored to fit the spe-cific clinical situation. Many of the diagnostic recommenda-tions of part 2 were extracted or in some cases quotedverbatim from each of these published guidelines. The Joint Task Force acknowledges that rapid advance- ments in diagnostic technology could render specific past andcurrent recommendations obsolete at any time and that at-tempts to revise will have to be undertaken at appropriateintervals. Nevertheless, whatever the update interim periodmay be, the allergy/clinical immunology community shouldbe prepared to accept novel new diagnostic techniques, pro-vided that they are validated by scientifically accepted ap-proaches. The overall objectives of this Parameter on Allergy Diag- nostic Tests are tripartite: (1) to develop a reliable referenceresource for selecting appropriate diagnostic tests; (2) toprovide guidelines and support for the practicing physician onhow diagnostic tests should be used in an appropriate and S2 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYcost-effective manner; and (3) to improve the quality of care of patients by facilitating prompt and accurate diagnosis oftheir hypersensitivity disorders. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY There is a wide array of diagnostic modalities for human hypersensitivity diseases. Among these, skin tests for imme-diate hypersensitivity and delayed hypersensitivity are ofparamount importance. As immunologic diagnostic technol-ogy advances, in vitro tests for both IgE- and cell-mediatedimmunity have also assumed greater significance. In someinstances, lymphocyte functional assays may be applicablefor confirmation of humoral or cell-mediated immunity cy-totoxicity syndromes, as well as classic delayed hypersensi-tivity reactions. Specific cellular components of both immediate hypersen- sitivity- and cell-mediated immunity induced inflammationcan be identified by their unique transcription markers, pro-tein products, or cell surface differentiation markers. Anincrease in eosinophils and their products often occurs in bothimmediate- and late-phase responses of IgE-mediated reac-tions. The role of the basophil in such reactions can also beevaluated by basophil histamine release tests and, more re-cently, the basophil activation test. When tests for IgE-me-diated immunity are equivocal, organ challenge testing is themost direct way of ascertaining whether bona fide clinicalsensitivity exists. Mononuclear cells (monocytes, macrophages, and lympho- cytes) are essential constituents of adaptive immunity. Inparticular, their role in cell-mediated immunity has long beenrecognized. Lymphocyte subsets, their cytokines, and theirchemokines may be readily identified and measurable in bodyfluids and tissue sites. Several applications of this technologyhave become standard clinical tests (eg, CD4 /H11001cells in ac- immunodeficiency); IL-10, and factor and IL-16 are Antigen antibody com-plexes may be associated with increased C1q binding andcryoglobulins. Prick/puncture tests or intracutaneous tests are the pre- ferred techniques for IgE-mediated hypersensitivity. It is ad-visable to use prick/puncture devices, which are relativelynontraumatic and elicit reproducible results when placed onspecific areas of the body (ie, arms or back). Optimal resultsdepend on use of potent test extracts and proficiency of theskin tester (ie, demonstration of coefficient of variation/H1102130% at different periods). It is essential that objective wheal-and-flare responses be recorded in millimeters (diam-eter or area) because cutoff levels (in millimeters) may ob-viate the necessity for confirmatory respiratory and foodallergen challenge tests. This interpretation system also en- ables easier comparison among physicians. Intracutaneoustests are generally used for specific allergens (ie, Hymenop-tera venoms and penicillin), but they may also be applied ifprick/puncture test results are negative and there is a stronghistorical likelihood of clinical allergy to specific allergens.Some clinicians prefer intracutaneous tests without precedingprick/puncture tests, but when this alternative is elected,special care must be taken to ensure that intracutaneousallergen concentrations are nonirritant and correlative withend organ sensitivity. However, there are safety concernswhen intracutaneous tests are performed without precedingprick/puncture tests. A suggested way of determining appro-priate intracutaneous test concentrations is a serial end pointtitration regimen, one of which reported that intracutaneousdilutions between 1:12,500 and 1:312,000 (wt/vol) were non-irritant. Late-phase cutaneous responses, which thepersistent allergic inflammatory milieu, may occur aftereither prick/puncture or intracutaneous tests but are morelikely to do so after the latter. Preliminary data suggest thatdecrease of late-phase cutaneous response may occur aftersuccessful allergen immunotherapy. prototypic skin test for delayed hypersensitivity is the tuberculin skin test, which is evaluated by degree of indura-tion in millimeters 48 hours after application. Similar tests areno longer commercially available for pathogenic fungi (eg,Histoplasma capsulatum ). A positive tuberculin reading var- ies from 10 to 15 mm in induration, depending on the inci-dence of active tuberculosis within the indigenous populationof the patient. Decreased cell-mediated immunity response oranergy may be evaluated by delayed hypersensitivity antigens(ie, tetanus toxoid, Candida, and Trichophyton ) to which most members of a population have been exposed. Formerlythe validity of anergy testing was compared with the meannumber of positive reactions elicited by 4 to 5 delayed hy-persensitivity antigens in a large normal control population.Absence of reactivity to all or all except 1 was equated withcomplete or relative anergy, respectively. Currently, there areonly antigens for testing (tetanustoxoid, Candida, andTrichophyton ), and these have not been evaluated in a large population as described above. Therefore,interpretation of anergy using these 3 antigens is circumspect.Concurrent anergy and tuberculin skin testing is no longerrecommended in patients with human immunodeficiency vi-rus (HIV) suspected of having mycobacterial infections. Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is a special form of delayed hypersensitivity evaluated by epicutaneous or patchtests. More than 3,700 substances have been reported toinduce contactant sensitivity. Direct irritants may cause irri-tant contact which often from ACD. The irritancy threshold of eachtest agent must be predetermined to exclude the possibility ofICD. Patch testing should be considered for any dermatitis forwhich contactant exposure, either natural or secondary totopical agents, might be implicated. Most ACD can be de-tected by 65 substances recommended by the North American VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S3Contact Dermatitis Research Group. The only available Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared patch test kit is theT.R.U.E. test, which covers a range of approximately 25% to30% of the most common ACD contactant allergens. There-fore, customized patch testing is often necessitated. Patchtests are read at least twice (48 and 72 to 96 hours afterapplication) and occasionally 7 days later in the case of weakACD allergens. Such allergens can also be detected by arepeat open application test protocol. Atopy patch tests tofoods and drugs are being investigated as a complementaryaid in the diagnosis of food and drug allergies. These testshave not yet been validated by a sufficient number of con-trolled studies. Laboratory tests may also provide useful information to evaluate either immediate hypersensitivity or cell-mediatedimmune reactions. Currently, commercial availability consid-erations are such that specific IgE tests are used more fre-quently than is the case for functional in vitro cell-mediatedimmunity assays. Within the past decade, however, immuno-assays of certain cell-mediated immunity products (ie, cyto-kines or chemokines) may be demonstrating sufficient pre-dictability to be considered as surrogates of cell-mediatedimmunity. The discovery of IgE and availability of IgE myelomas enabled the production of large quantities of IgE. This per-mitted the production of highly specific anti-human IgE an-tibodies, which led to immunoassays capable of measuringboth total IgE and allergen specific IgE concentrations inserum and body fluids. A succession of modified assaysensued. Subsequent modifications are calibrated using heter-ologous interpolation against the World Health Organization(WHO) 75/502 international human serum IgE referencepreparation, thereby establishing a uniform system of specificIgE antibody in quantitative kilo international units (kIU) perliter (ie, 1 kIU /H110052.4 ng IgE). The method of total and specific IgE assays are discussed in detail, including theindications, advantages, and limitations of these assays. TheFDA guideline regulations now stipulate guidance regula-tions for all IgE methods, including semiautomatic, auto-matic, and multiplexed systems. According to these qualityassurance suggestions, allergen assay include itsspecific homologous reference serum (ragweed vs ragweedreference serum) as an additional internal control wheneversufficient quantities of specific reference sera can be ob-tained. It is anticipated that multiplexed arrays for assays ofIgE will soon be generally available. Secondary antibodydetector systems for these modified techniques includechemiluminescence and fluorescence. Allergen specificityand cross-allergenicity may be determined by an inhibitiontechnique. Although correlation of higher kIU levels of spe-cific IgE to clinical sensitivity for some allergens is equiva-lent to prick/puncture tests, skin prick/puncture tests gener-ally have better overall predictability and are the preferredinitial diagnostic approach. Interpretation of both skin and serum specific IgE tests is highly dependent on the constitutive allergenicity, potency,and stability of the allergen extract being used. For these reasons, sensitivity tends to be higher among pollens, certainfoods, dust mite, fungi, and certain epidermals compared withvenoms, drugs, and chemicals. Recommendations for aller-gen immunotherapy based solely on results of skin or specificIgE tests without appropriate clinical correlation are not ap-propriate. IgG and IgG subclasses can be measured using immuno- assays similar to those used for allergen specific IgE. Con-troversy exists regarding whether increases of IgG4 are validharbingers of either diagnosis or clinical efficacy after im-munotherapy. Specific IgG/IgG4 results do not correlate withoral food challenges and are not recommended for the diag-nosis of food allergy. Other less frequently used assays for IgE-mediated reac- tions include histamine release from basophils plasmatryptase secondary to mast cell degranulation. The latter testmay be useful in the detection of anaphylaxis and mastocy-tosis. Eosinophils and their generated products, such as eosino- philic cationic protein (ECP), are key cells in allergic inflam-mation, particularly late-phase responses. Increased numbersof these cells in nasal smears and induced sputum may beuseful indicators of the existence and extent of allergic in-flammation. In the case of sputum, they may also be indica-tive of asthma exacerbation or the presence of chronic eosin-ophilic bronchitis or esophagogastritis. The basophil activation test, as detected by the expression of CD63 and/or CD203C surface markers by flow cytometry,is being vigorously investigated for both diagnosis and serialmonitoring of therapeutic efficacy. This test has not yet beencleared in the United States by the FDA. Cell types that contribute to cell-mediated immunity reac- tions cell-mediated immunity quantify lymphocytefunction and reactions; and (4) regulation of im-mune responses. Techniques to measure each of these func-tions are discussed in the context of advantages and disad-vantages of each method. Several nonradioactive assays oflymphocyte proliferation and are of macrophage inhibition is notcommercially available, the cytokine responsible for this test,MIF, can be measured by immunoassay. Other cytokines orchemokines of and monocyte chemoattractant proteins(MCPs) 1, 2, and 3, can also be measured by ELISA immu-noassays. Evaluation of non-IgE and non-cell-mediated immunity clinical immunologic diseases may include laboratory screen-ing for (1) primary and acquired immunodeficiency, (2) im-mune-mediated gammopathies, (3) complement activationdisorders, and (4) a diverse spectrum of autoimmune andvasculitic diseases. Brief summaries of diagnostic techniques S4 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYavailable for these entities are discussed in part 1. Many of them have evolved to ELISA and Western and immunoblotassays, although indirect immunofluorescence tests are stillrequired for confirmation in certain autoimmune diseases.Tests of complement activation are especially important inpatients who present with signs of leukocytoclastic vasculit-ides. Specific organ challenge tests may facilitate or confirm clinical diagnosis under certain circumstances: (1) investiga-tion of potential \"new\" allergens, (2) confirmation of clinicaldiagnosis when the history is suggestive but skin and/or invitro test results are negative, (3) confirming food allergy, (4)monitoring of therapy, and (5) substantiating occupationalsensitivity. This section has been expanded substantially toinclude detailed descriptions of the indications and objectivetechniques for evaluating allergen-specific conjunctival, na-sal, and bronchial challenges. Protocols for food challengesare discussed in the part 2 section on \"Evaluation of FoodAllergy.\" Details of laboratory supervised and workplacechallenges for confirmation of occupational asthma (OA) arealso included. A new section, \"Inflammatory Biomarkers of Upper and Lower Airway Fluids,\" has been added because such tech-niques often provide confirmatory of pneumonitis). In addition,current diagnostic roles of 2 new noninvasive methods (ex- haled nitric oxide and exhaled breath condensate) are sum-marized. A brief review of unproven tests is included near the end of part 1. The unproven nature of these tests is supported by placebo-controlled studies in some instances. In other situa-tions, clinical samples submitted for diagnostic evaluationyielded completely false results. The section on allergens has been retained because it is one of the most reliable sources of plant, animal, and chemicals towhich North American patients are exposed. As cited previ-ously, the number of positive allergenic contactants exceeds3,700. A reliable reference source for such contact substancesmay be found in the patch test discussion of part 1. Theallergens section also reviews essential information aboutcross-allergenicity, which should aid the clinician in specificdecisions about skin tests and allergen immunotherapy. (Alsosee Allergom e - a database of allergenic molecules - http:// www.allergome.org.) Part 2 of this parameter provides evidence-based likelihood decisions on selecting confirmatory laboratory diagnostictests for inhalant, food, insect venom, drug, and contactantallergies. When the data are not sufficiently evidence basedfor such choices, alternative pathways are suggested. In eachof these clinical subsections, discussions about use of in vivovs in vitro tests are commensurate with Category I evidencecriteria. All clinical topics in part 2 provide a basis forintegrating historical features, physical signs, and diagnosticrecommendations of previously published Practice Parame-ters (Disease Management of Drug Hypersensitivity: A A Practice Parameter; and Contact Dermatitis:A Practice Parameter), with the current updated diagnostictechniques presented in part 1.

NR Not rated VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S5Summary Statement 5. Optimal results can be expected by choosing a single prick/puncture device and properly trainingskin technicians in its use. (C) Summary Statement 6. Although prick/puncture tests are generally age, sex, and race independent, certain age (chil-dren younger than 2 years and adults older than 65 years) andracial (African American children) factors may affect theirinterpretation. (C) Summary Statement 7. Skin test allergens used for prick/ puncture tests should be potent and stable. (B) Summary Statement 8. To ensure proper interpretation, positive (histamine) and negative (saline or 50% glycerinatedhuman serum albumin [HSA]-saline) should be performed atthe same time as allergen tests. (B) Summary Statement 9. The peak reactivity of prick/punc- ture tests is 15 to 20 minutes at which time both wheal anderythema diameters (or areas) should be recorded in millime-ters and compared with positive and negative controls. (B) Summary Statement 10. Qualitative scoring (0 to 4 /H11001; pos- itive or negative) is no longer used by many clinicians be-cause of interphysician variability in this method of scoringand interpretation. (B) Summary Statement 11. The diagnostic validity of prick/ puncture tests has been confirmed not only in patients ex-posed to allergens under natural conditions but also in pa-tients undergoing controlled organ challenge tests. (B) Summary Statement 12. Although prick/puncture testing often correlates with exposure history, there are significantexceptions to this observation. (B) Summary Statement 13. Many studies have verified the sensitivity and specificity of prick/puncture tests for bothinhalant and food allergens when correlated with nasal andoral challenge tests. (B) Summary Statement 14. Compared with clinical history alone, the diagnostic accuracy of prick/puncture tests showedmore limited capacity to predict clinical sensitivity for bothinhalant and food allergens. (C) Summary Statement 15. The reliability of prick/puncture tests depends on the skill of the tester, the test instrument,color of the skin, skin reactivity on the day of the test, age,and potency and stability of test reagents. (C) Summary Statement 16. False-positive prick/puncture test results may occur (1) to tree pollens in honey bee-sensitivepatients due to cross-reactive carbohydrate determinantspresent in honey bee venom and (2) in tree-sensitive patientsbeing tested to tree pollens no longer indigenous to the area.(C) Summary Statement 17. The rare occurrence of specific positive organ challenge test results in patients with bothnegative prick/puncture and intracutaneous test results sug-gests that alternative pathways, locally secreted IgE, IgE-independent, or nonimmune stimuli may activatemediator release in the end organ. (C) Summary Statement 18. Life-threatening generalized sys- temic reactions are rarely caused by prick/puncture tests. In arecent retrospective survey, 1 death was reported in a patient who received 90 food prick/puncture tests at one time. (C) Summary Statement 19. Intracutaneous tests will identify a larger number of patients with lower skin test sensitivity andare used when increased sensitivity is the main goal oftesting. (B) Summary Statement 20. Intracutaneous tests are useful for evaluation of anaphylaxis, particularly drug (ie, penicillin)andHymenoptera venom anaphylaxis. (A) Summary Statement 21. When compared with specific na- sal challenge, skin end point titration (SET) is equivalent toprick/puncture skin tests. (B) Summary Statement 22. Intracutaneous tests should be performed with small volumes (approximately 0.02 to 0.05mL) of allergens injected intracutaneously with a disposable0.5- or 1.0-mL syringe. (C) Summary Statement 23. As a general rule, the starting dose of an intracutaneous allergen test ranges from 100- to 1,000-fold more dilute than the allergen concentration used forprick/puncture tests. (C) Summary Statement 24. Intracutaneous tests are read 10 to 15 minutes after injection and both wheal and erythema (inmillimeters) should be recorded. (B) Summary Statement 25. The diagnostic sensitivity of intra- cutaneous tests is probably greater than prick/puncture testswhen testing for penicillin, insect venom, or certain drugclass (eg, insulin, heparin, muscle relaxants) hypersensitivity.(C) Summary Statement 26. The greater sensitivity of titrated intracutaneous tests, especially in the erythema component, isan advantage for determining biologic potency of allergenextracts units (BAU) as based on intra-cutaneous erythema assays in sensitive human volunteers. (B) Summary Statement 27. At dilutions between 10 /H110022and 10/H110023 (wt/vol), intracutaneous tests for most allergens exhibit poor efficiency in predicting organ challenge responses and cor-relating with the presence of detectable serum specific IgE.(C) Summary Statement 28. There are limited data about equiv- alency of sensitivity, specificity, and predictive indices be-tween intracutaneous and prick/puncture tests when com-pared with organ challenge tests. One study demonstratedthat more dilute intracutaneous concentrations were compa-rable to prick/puncture tests in predicting positive nasal chal-lenges. (C) Summary Statement 29. Similar comparative equivalency studies based on history and symptoms alone revealed thatintracutaneous tests were comparable to prick/puncture testsonly at intracutaneous titration end points between 10 /H110025and 10/H110026g/mL (wt/vol). (B) Summary Statement 30. Because clinical use of intracuta- neous tests is usually restricted to a single dose (ie, 1:1,000wt/vol), which may be irritant, predictive accuracy of thesetests at this concentration is often confounded by false-posi-tive results. (C) S6 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYSummary Statement 31. For most allergens, a fixed dilution (1:1,000 wt/vol) of intracutaneous tests has poor efficiency inpredicting organ challenge responses. (A) Summary Statement 32. Intracutaneous tests are occasion- ally negative in venom-sensitive patients who experiencelife-threatening reactions. (C) Summary Statement 33. Repetitive ( /H113502) intracutaneous penicillin testing may sensitize a small number of individualsto penicillin. (C) Summary Statement 34. Immediate systemic reactions are more common with intracutaneous tests; 6 fatalities werereported in a recent retrospective survey. (C) Summary Statement 35. Prescreening with prick/puncture tests is a practical way to avoid life-threatening reactions tointracutaneous tests. (C) Summary Statement 36. If prick/puncture prescreening is not used, preliminary intracutaneous serial threshold titra-tions should be considered, starting at high dilutions (eg, 10 /H110025 to 10/H110028g/mL [wt/vol]). This is of particular importance if exquisite sensitivity (eg, anaphylaxis to foods and drugs) issuspected. (D) Summary Statement 37. The late-phase cutaneous response is a continuation of either prick/puncture or intracutaneoustesting, generally the latter, and is characterized by erythema,induration or edema, and dysesthesia. (B) Summary Statement 38. The late-phase cutaneous response may occur after both immune and nonimmune activation.Many allergens have been implicated. (B) Summary Statement 39. The late-phase cutaneous response should be read between the 6th and 12th hours after the skintests are applied; measurements of mean diameter and/or areaof induration or edema should be recorded. (B) Summary Statement 40. Although the clinical relevance of late-phase cutaneous response is not as yet fully established,several randomized, controlled studies suggest that reductionin sizes of late-phase cutaneous response may parallel clinicalresponse to immunotherapy. (B) Summary Statement 41. The same principles that pertain to safety of skin tests apply to late-phase cutaneous responses.(C) Summary Statement 42. Preadministration of drugs, such as calcineurin inhibitors, misoprostol, prednisone, and azelas-tine, before application of skin tests partially or completelyinhibit the late-phase cutaneous response. (B) Summary Statement 43. The number of skin tests and the allergens selected for skin testing should be determined basedon the patient's age, history, environment and living condi-tions (eg, region of the country), occupation, and activities.Routine use of a large number of skin tests or routine annualtests without a definite clinical indication are clearly notjustified. (D) Summary Statement 44. Respiratory challenge tests are used when an objective gold standard for establishing clinicalsensitivity is indicated. (B) Summary Statement 45. Conjunctival challenge tests are usually conducted for suspected localized eye allergy but insome cases they may also be helpful in investigating nasal allergy. (B) Summary Statement 46. Conjunctival challenge tests are evaluated by symptoms of itching and objective indices,including tear volume, amount of mucus, and palpebral orbulbar erythema. (B) Summary Statement 47. Nasal challenges provide objective evidence of clinical sensitivity when the diagnosis is in ques-tion or in situations when it is desirable to evaluate efficacyof therapeutic management. (B) Summary Statement 48 . Nasal challenge responses are evaluated by subjective symptoms and objective measure-ments of nasal airway resistance, the number of sneezes, andthe measurement of inflammatory mediators in nasal (B) Summary Statement 49. Specific (allergic) bronchial chal- lenge provides a measure of lower airway clinical sensitivitywhen there is uncertainty or dispute. (B) Summary Statement 50. Guidelines for the performance of specific bronchial challenge include factors such as withhold-ing certain medications before the test, determining the initialallergen dose by preliminary skin or methacholine challengetesting, a beginning forced expiratory volume in 1 second(FEV 1) baseline of 70% or better, the amount or duration of exposure to allergen, measurement of FEV1at intervals after the exposure, careful observation for late-phase responses,comparison to a placebo-controlled challenge usually per-formed the day before the specific challenge, and, optionally,repetition of methacholine challenge 24 to 48 hours afterspecific challenge for evaluation of induced bronchial hyper-responsiveness. (B) Summary Statement 51. Occupational challenge testing requires special precautions with respect to the innate toxicityof the suspected allergen and special apparatuses used tomeasure and control the quantity of challenge substances,such as potentially irritating volatile agents and dust. (B) Summary Statement 52. A practical clinical method of assessing OA is prospective monitoring of the worker at andaway from work by serial peak expiratory flow rates (PEFRs)or FEV 1values if this can be arranged by mutual agreement of employee and employer. (B) Summary Statement 53. Many inflammatory correlates can be evaluated and studied serially in respiratory and otherbody fluids, such as nasal smears or lavage, induced sputum,or BAL. These may define specific phenotypes or in somecases predict severity. (B) Summary Statement 54. Exhaled nitric oxide is a noninva- sive measure of airway inflammation and is useful for mon-itoring objective responses to topically administered cortico-steroids. (B) Summary Statement 55. Although breath condensate anal- ysis is an evolving noninvasive method for evaluation ofasthma, results are still variable and further refinements arerequired before it can be accepted as a valid diagnosticmethod. (C) VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S7Summary Statement 56. Bronchoalveolar lavage obtained through flexible bronchoscopy is useful in phenotypingasthma. The finding of lymphocytic alveolitis may suggest adiagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. (B) Summary Statement 57. Cystic fibrosis may not only be confused with asthma but certain genetic variants may beassociated with increased asthma risks. (B) Summary Statement 58. Although major phenotypes of /H92511-antitrypsin deficiency do not occur in asthma, recent sur- veys demonstrated a high prevalence of asthma in young ZZhomozygous antitrypsin deficiency patients. (B) Summary Statement 59. Purified protein derivative (PPD) of tuberculin is the prototype antigen recall test and providesdirect evidence that hypersensitivity, as opposed to toxicity,is elicited by the antigens in Mycobacterium hominis or related mycobacterial species. (B) Summary Statement 60. The tuberculin skin test is elicited by the intracutaneous injection of 0.1 mL of standardizedPPD starting with the intermediate strength of 5 tuberculinunits. (C) Summary Statement 61. Recall antigen skin tests are used to evaluate cellular immunity in patients with infection (eg,life-threatening sepsis), cancer, pretransplantation screening,endstage debilitating diseases, and the effect of aging. (C) Summary Statement 62. Reduced or absent recall antigen tests are termed anergy, which develops frequently in certain diseases, such as hematogenous tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, andatopic the currently are injected intracutaneously in the same wayas the PPD test. (C) Summary Statement 64. The size of the delayed skin test reaction is measured 48 hours after antigen challenge, and thelargest diameter of the palpable firm area that outlines theinduration response should be measured to the nearest milli-meter. (C) Summary Statement 65. When a single intracutaneous an- tigen (other than PPD) is used to evaluate prior sensitizationto a potential pathogen, a reaction of 5 mm or greater maysuffice as the cutoff point for positive tests, but smallerreactions (2 to 4 mm) may be clinically important. (C) Summary Statement 66. The absence of delayed-type hy- persensitivity to all the test antigens would suggest an anergicstate. (C) Summary Statement 67. The most important use of de- layed-type hypersensitivity skin testing is epidemiologicscreening of susceptible populations exposed to bacterial andfungal pathogens. (C) Summary Statement 68. The widest application of recall antigen testing is the detection of anergy and as an in vivoclinical correlate of cell-mediated immunoincompetency. (C) Summary Statement 69. Although anergy testing was for- merly conducted frequently in HIV patients to determinewhether a concurrent negative tuberculin skin test result rulesout active tuberculosis, recent evidence mitigates against thisapproach. Recall antigen anergy in HIV patients has also been investigated as an indicator of staging, progression ofdisease, and response to therapy. (C) Summary Statement 70. Although the standardized PPD antigen has been used for many years as a predictor of activeor latent tuberculosis infection, confounders, such as suscep-tible populations, BCG vaccination, and cross-sensitizationwith other atypical mycobacterial species have all affectedthe diagnostic accuracy of the tuberculin skin test and, byextrapolation, other delayed-type hypersensitivity tests. (C) Summary Statement 71 . The gross appearance of a late- phase cutaneous response and delayed-type hypersensitivityreactions may not be completely distinguishable except thatthe latter are more characterized by prolonged induration. (B) Summary Statement 72. Although systemic corticosteroids will render delayed-type hypersensitivity skin test resultsuninterpretable, 28 days of treatment with high-dose inhaledfluticasone (220 /H9262g, 2 puffs twice a day) did not suppress delayed-type hypersensitivity to PPD in healthy volunteers.(B) Summary Statement 73. Neither anergy nor tuberculin test- ing obviates the need for microbiologic evaluation when thereis a suspicion of active tuberculosis or fungal infections. (F) Summary Statement 74. Several new in vitro assays (ie, interferon- /H9253and polymerase chain reaction) appear to be more reliable in predicting active tuberculosis in BCG-vac-cinated persons or when cross-sensitivity to atypical myco-bacteria may coexist. (C) Summary Statement 75. Immediate hypersensitivity reac- tions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported after tuber-culin skin tests. (D) Summary Statement 76. The number of skin tests for de- layed, cell-mediated hypersensitivity reactions is limited. (C) Summary Statement 77. First introduced by Jadassohn in 1896, the epicutaneous patch test has evolved as the defini-tive diagnostic technique for the diagnosis of allergic contactdermatitis (ACD). (A) Summary Statement 78. When clinical evaluations suggest that exposure to a specific contactant has occurred either in anoccupational or nonoccupational clinical setting, patch testingcan be used to confirm the diagnosis. (C) Summary Statement 79. From a public health perspective, patch testing is useful to identify potential health hazards ofunknown and newly introduced contact allergens for themedical community and industrial hygienists. (C) Summary Statement 80. The most common patch test tech- niques are the individual Finn Chamber and the T.R.U.E.TEST, an FDA-approved screening method for screeningcontactant allergens. The T.R.U.E. TEST is preloaded with23 common contactants and vehicle control that have beenpreviously incorporated into a dried-in-gel delivery system, which is coated onto a polyester backing to form a patchtemplate. (B) Summary Statement 81. If photocontact sensitivity is sus- pected, the appropriate allergens should be subjected to pho- S8 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYtopatch tests primarily in the UV-A range of 320 to 400 nm. (C) Summary Statement 82. Traditionally, patch tests remain in place for 48 hours. After the 48-hour patch test reading,additional readings at 3 to 4 days and in some cases 7 daysafter the original application of the patch yield the bestoverall reading reliability. (C) Summary Statement 83. A descriptive reading scale devel- oped by 2 major international ACD research groups is thecurrent standard for interpreting patch test results. (C) Summary Statement 84. Although patch tests are indicated in any patient with a chronic eczematous dermatitis if ACD issuspected, patch tests are especially important in identifyingboth ICD and ACD in the occupational setting. (C) Summary Statement 85. Other important exposures associ- ated with ACD include the use corticosteroids, plant-induced ACD, and dermatitis oc-curring after the use of cosmetics and personal hygieneproducts. (C) Summary Statement 86. Unprotected work and repetitive exposure to surfactants may predispose patients to occupa-tional dermatitis, including ICD and ACD. (C) Summary Statement 87. Certain contactant allergens in the T.R.U.E. TEST panel, such as nickel and some rubber chem-icals, have a high degree of relevant (approximately 75%)correlation with clinical sensitivity but others do not (eg,hydroxycitronellal, thimerosal). (B) Summary Statement 88. Patch tests are most effective when the patients are selected on the basis of a clear-cut clinicalsuspicion of contact allergy and they are tested with thechemicals relevant to the problem; these conditions satisfythe prerequisites of high pretest probability. (C) Summary Statement 89. Although the diagnostic accuracy of contactants cannot be compared with other in vivo or invitro tests, diagnostic concordance between patch test sensi-tivity and the outcomes of repeated open provocation testshas been demonstrated for some contactants. (B) Summary Statement 90. The chief limitation to traditional patch testing for the diagnosis of ACD is the lack of a suitablegold standard by which it can be evaluated in terms ofdiagnostic accuracy predictors and likelihood ratios. (C) Summary Statement 91. Other technical limitations of patch tests include the inclusion of relevant contact allergens,use of the proper vehicle, application to the proper skin area,proper reading and interpretation, and the ability to correlatethe tests with the patient's specific exposure. (A) Summary Statement 92. Other limiting factors concern reproducibility, lack of information about irritant thresholds,and minimal elicitation concentrations (MECs) for manycommon chemicals in the human environment. (C) Summary Statement 93. The inability to separate irritants from allergic responses is often encountered in the angry backsyndrome, which occurs in approximately 6% of cases and islikely to develop in patients with a longer duration of theprimary dermatitis. (C)Summary Statement 94. Negative patch test reactions may occur even when the tests are performed with the correctsensitizing materials because the test fails to duplicate theconditions under which the dermatitis developed (eg, abra-sions, frequent use of irritating soaps, washing the hands withsolvents). (C) Summary Statement 95. Systemic ACD after patch testing is rare, as is reactivation of patch test reactions after oralingestion of related allergens or even by inhalation of budes-onide in patients with sensitization to topical corticosteroids.(B) Summary Statement 96. It is possible to sensitize a patient who had not been previously sensitized to the allergen beingtested. This is particularly true of plant contactants, such aspoison ivy or oak and aniline dyes. (B) Summary Statement 97. Two major variants of traditional patch tests are available: the atopy patch test (ATP) andrepeated use test (RUT). (B) Summary Statement 98. Atopy patch tests have been eval- uated in patients with atopic dermatitis and eosinophilicesophagitis as an adjunct for the diagnosis of inhalant andfood allergy. (B) Summary Statement 99. Atopy patch tests for foods are prepared with dried or desiccated foods mixed into an aque-ous solution and placed in 12-mm Finn Chambers beforepositioning on the patient's back. (B) Summary Statement 100. Atopy patch tests for the diagno- sis of drug allergy are performed by incorporating liquid orpowdered drugs into petrolatum or aqueous solvents, whichare added to 12-mm Finn Chambers and placed on the back.(B) Summary Statement 101. Use tests have been developed for weak sensitizers (repeated open application test [ROAT]),substances with poor percutaneous absorption (strip patchtest), and several premarketing dose response provocationtests for determining the minimal sensitizing dose of potentialcontactants in human volunteers. (B) Summary Statement 102. In the strip patch test penetration of substances is enhanced by repeated adhesive tape strippingbefore application of the contactant patch to the stripped area.(B) Summary Statement 103. The ROAT is an exaggerated use test designed to determine a patient's biologic threshold orresponse to a suspected contactant, especially if this has notbeen achieved with prior open or closed patch testing. (B) Summary Statement 104. Although clinical relevance is still evolving with regard to the APT, several investigativegroups have reported that this test may be an adjunct indetection of specific allergens in atopic dermatitis and eosin-ophilic esophagitis. (B) Summary Statement 105. The role of the atopy patch in determining clinical allergy to food is indeterminate. (B) Summary Statement 106. The lack of standardization of APTs for diagnosis of both food and drug allergy is the chieflimitation. (C) VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S9Summary Statement 107. Although the purpose of APTs is to test for food and drug nonimmediate reactions, the possi-bility of anaphylaxis must be considered because there couldbe significant percutaneous absorption of proteins and/orsimple chemicals with high anaphylactogenic potential. (B) Summary Statement 108. The appropriate number of atopic patch tests is indeterminate because they are not routinelyperformed. (D) Summary Statement 109. Because ACD is frequently caused by unsuspected substances, up to 65 patch tests maybe required for diagnosis. (B) Summary Statement 110. Total serum IgE concentrations are reported in international units or nanograms per milliliter(1 IU/mL /H110052.44 ng/mL). (A) Summary Statement 111. Total IgE is cross-standardized with the WHO 75/502 human reference IgE serum verified byperiodic proficiency surveys. (B) Summary Statement 112. The clinical applications of total serum IgE are of modest value. High serum IgE concentra-tions occur in allergic bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis (ABPA), the therapeutic response of which is evaluated byserial IgE values. (B) Summary Statement 113. Total serum IgE is required for assessing the suitability of a patient for omalizumab therapyand determining the initial dose. (B) Summary Statement 114. As with total IgE, commercial specific IgE antibody assays are calibrated using heterolo-gous interpolation against the WHO 75/502 human IgE ref-erence serum, thereby enabling a uniform system of report-ing. (E) Summary Statement 115. In addition to WHO 75/502 cal- ibration, an earlier specific IgE classification system wasbased on internal positive calibration curves from a positivecontrol heterologous serum containing specific IgE antibod-ies, which in the original RAST was white birch specific.However, FDA clearance for modified specific IgE testsrequires use of homologous internal control allergic serawhenever this is possible to obtain. (E) Summary Statement 116. The precise sensitivity of these immunoassays compared with prick/puncture skin tests hasbeen reported to range from less than 50% to more than 90%,with the average being approximately 70% to 75% for moststudies; similar sensitivity ranges pertain when immunoas-says are compared with symptoms induced after natural orcontrolled organ challenge tests. (C) Summary Statement 117. As with skin tests, the interpre- tation of specific IgE results requires correlation with thehistory, physical examination, and, in some cases, symptomsdirectly observed after natural or laboratory exposure to al-lergens. This cannot be accomplished by commercial remotepractice laboratories, which base recommendations for im-munotherapy on a history form submitted by the patient andspecific IgE results. (B) Summary Statement 118. Because the constitutive allerge- nicity, potency, and stability are variable among commercialallergen extract reagents, sensitivity and the positive predic-tive value of both prick/puncture and specific IgE tests gen- erally tend to be higher among pollens, stable anaphylacto-genic foods, house dust mite, certain epidermals, and fungicompared with venoms, drugs, and chemicals. (C) Summary Statement 119. Proper interpretation of specific IgE test results needs to take into consideration variables suchas the binding affinity or avidity of allergens, solid-phasesystems, cross-reactive proteins and glycoepitopes, specificIgG antibodies the test system, and high total serum IgE(/H1102220,000 IU). (E) Summary Statement 120. A multiallergen (up to 15 aller- gens bound to a linear solid-phase system) test can screen foratopic status, following which allergen specific tests are re-quired for more definitive evaluation. (C) Summary Statement 121. Specific IgE immunoassays are not recommended as a definitive confirmatory test for severalspecific clinical conditions. They provide neither diagnosticnor prognostic information when measured in the cord bloodof newborn infants. They do not have sufficient sensitivity forfoolproof prediction of anaphylactic sensitivity to venoms orpenicillins. (B) Summary Statement 122. Specific IgE immunoassays may be preferable to skin testing under special clinical conditions,such as widespread skin disease, patients receiving skin testsuppressive therapy, uncooperative patients, or when the his-tory suggests an unusually greater risk of anaphylaxis fromskin testing. (B) Summary Statement 123. Determination of allergen speci- ficity by inhibition of specific IgE binding is a unique at-tribute of specific IgE testing. (E) Summary Statement 124. Automated systems using multi- plexed allergen assays are being rapidly developed. One ofthese is cleared by the FDA for the simultaneous measure-ment of 10 allergens. (E) Summary Statement 125. Allergen specific IgG may be measured by immunodiffusion or immunoabsorption. (E) Summary Statement 126. Immunodiffusion antibodies to cow's milk are associated with Heiner's disease, a non-IgEdisorder that presents in infants with pulmonary infiltrates.(B) Summary Statement 127. IgG and IgG subclass antibody tests for food allergy do not have clinical relevance, are notvalidated, lack sufficient quality control, and should not beperformed. (B) Summary Statement 128. Although a number of investiga- tors have reported modest increases of IgG4 during venomimmunotherapy, confirmation and validation of the predictivevalue of IgG4 for therapeutic efficacy of venom immunother-apy are not yet proven. (C) Summary Statement 129. The probability distribution of specific IgE for several anaphylactogenic foods (peanuts, egg white, cow's milk, and codfish) can define clinical sensitivityas verified by double-blind oral challenge tests; similar rela-tionships have been defined for several respiratory allergens.(A) S10 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYSummary Statement 130. Although allergens can be stan- dardized either by radioimmunodiffusion or on major allergenic epitopes, the FDA se-lected BAU instead because in vitro analytic techniqueswould have been variable from allergen to allergen and wouldhave caused great confusion. (C) Summary Statement 131. Histamine and leukotriene re- lease measurements from human basophils after incubationwith allergen are valuable research tools for in vitro investi-gations of allergy. (B) Summary Statement 132. The recent availability of several sensitive immunoassays for histamine and leukotriene C4 is asignificant technological advance for measuring these medi-ators in various biologic fluids or release from whole blood,isolated basophils, mast cells, or other cultured cells. (B) Summary Statement 133. Histamine and its N-methyl his- tamine metabolite may be measured in 24-hour urine samplesafter suspected anaphylactic episodes. (B) Summary Statement 134. Plasma tryptase, particularly the /H9252form, should be obtained within 4 hours after an anaphy- lactic episode. (B) Summary Statement 135. Combined /H9251and/H9252species of plasma tryptase are elevated in patients with systemic mas-tocytosis. (A) Summary Statement 136. Eosinophils in body fluids corre- late highly with the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, allergicasthma, and eosinophilic bronchitis. (B) Summary Statement 137. Elevated eosinophil derived sub- stances (ie, ECP) and chemoattractants (ie, eotaxin) in bodyfluids are indicators of allergic inflammatory disease. (B) Summary Statement 138. A basophil activation test mea- sured by expression of CD63 and CD203c and detected byflow cytometry is being evaluated for many IgE-mediateddisorders. (C) Summary Statement 139. Tests that quantify lymphocyte function measure the ability of lymphocytes to (1) proliferate,(2) produce inflammatory mediators and cytokines or chemo-kines, (3) mount cytotoxic responses, and (4) regulate im-mune responses. (B) Summary Statement 140. Lymphocyte proliferative re- sponses may be evaluated by either nonspecific mitogens (eg,phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, or pokeweed) or spe-cific soluble and cell-bound antigens. (B) Summary Statement 141. In vitro proliferative responses to some soluble antigens, but not mitogens, have been shown tocorrelate with in vivo delayed hypersensitivity. The role,however, of lymphocyte proliferation as vitro inthe pathogenesis of the delayed-type hypersensitivity tissuereaction is unclear. (B) Summary Statement 142. Cytokines (IL-1 through IL-33) and growth factors are glycoproteins produced by a variety of cells that are capable of altering activities of other cellsthrough interaction with specific surface receptors. (E) Summary Statement 143. Chemokines are small (8 to 10 kDa) proteins secreted by many immune and nonimmunecells with essential roles in inflammatory and immune reac- tions, including the late-phase cutaneous response. (E) Summary Statement 144. Cytokine and chemokine profiles play essential roles in allergic inflammation and are beingincreasingly evaluated as phenotypic markers and in thedifferential diagnosis of human hypersensitivity disorders.(B) Summary Statement 145. Other bioactive indices of cell- include cytotoxic assays, cultures ofmixed lymphocytes, and inhibition. (E) Summary Statement 146. Most cytokines and chemokines can be measured by commercial ELISA and ELISpot immu-noassays. (E) Summary Statement 147. Proinflammatory cytokines or chemokines, which are particularly associated with cell-me-diated protein 1 (MIP-1), and MCP 1, 2, and 3. (B) Summary Statement 148. Simple, cost-effective tests in- clude (1) an absolute lymphocyte count, (2) the absolutenumber of CD4 /H11001T cells, and (3) the CD4/H11001/CD8/H11001ratio. (B) Summary Statement 149. Investigation of non-IgE and non-cell-mediated clinical immunologic disorders may re-quire tests that indicate abnormal adaptive and innate immunereactions. (B) Summary Statement 150. Abnormal serum and urine pro- teins, including cryoglobulins, may be associated with severalabnormal immune syndromes. (B) Summary Statement 151. The inflammatory consequences induced by immune functions may be detected by nonspecifictests, such as a complete blood cell count with differential,sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and other acute-phasereactants. In some instances, functional assays of neutrophilsand macrophages may be necessary to pinpoint inflammatoryresponses. (B) Summary Statement 152. Evaluation of complement acti- vation with a decrease of C3 and C4 may indicate comple-ment deficiency, drug reactions, or the presence of immunecomplexes, which often are associated with increases in se-rum cryoglobulins and C1q binding. (B) Summary Statement 153. Autoantibody profiles offer im- portant diagnostic adjuncts in the diagnosis of collagen vas-cular diseases, vasculitides, and cytotoxicity disorders. (B) Summary Statement 154. Procedures for which there is no evidence of diagnostic validity include cytotoxic tests, prov-ocation-neutralization, electrodermal testing, applied kinesi-ology, iridology, hair analysis, or food specific IgG, IgG4,and IgG/IgG4 antibody tests. (B) Summary Statement 155. Although North American inhal- ant allergens are botanically and ecologically diverse, severalexpert committees consisting of members with botanic andmycologic expertise have compiled and selected 36 key al-lergens in North America, based on Thommen's postulates.(D) Summary Statement 156. For individual patients, the choice of test allergens is guided by the history and physical VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S11examination and the physician's knowledge, training, and experience. (B) Summary Statement 157. A well-designed skin test and laboratory ordering form should provide useful informationto the ordering physician, his/her staff, health care providers,and other physicians who may be consulted in the future. (B) Summary Statement 158. The best indicators in the selec- tion of appropriate pollens for clinical use are extensiveprevalence in the air and concurrent allergy symptoms duringannually recurrent seasons when such pollens are expected tobe present in the ambient air. (B) Summary Statement 159. The clinical significance of a single fungus test reagent may be difficult to ascertain be-cause of important confounders, such as sampling method,culture conditions, nonculturable species, allergenic differ-ences between spores, and hyphae and preferential ecologicniches. (A) Summary Statement 160. For clinical purposes, molds are often characterized as outdoor ( Alternaria andCladosporium species), indoor ( Alternaria, Aspergillus, andPenicillium species). (B) Summary Statement 161. Five Hymenoptera venom ex- tracts are available for evaluation of anaphylactic reactions tohoneybee, yellow jacket, yellow hornet, white faced hornet,andPolistes wasp. A whole-body extract is the only currently available diagnostic reagent for fire ant sting allergy. (A) Summary Statement 162. Major inhalant acarid and insect allergens include several species of house dust mite andcockroach. (A) Summary Statement 163. Animal clinical sensitivity is most often associated with domestic pets (cats, dogs, birds)and laboratory animals (rodents, rabbits). Specific testing isguided by history of appropriate animal exposure. (A) Summary Statement 164. Selection of food tests for IgE- mediated clinical sensitivity is usually tailored to the patient'stemporal history, which may be supplemented by a fooddiary. (A) Summary Statement 165. Although commercial skin tests for drugs, biologics, and chemicals are not available, special-ized medical centers prepare and use such tests under appro-priate clinical situations. The validity of such tests is ad-judged on a case by case basis. (C) Summary Statement 166. More than 300 low- and high- molecular-weight occupational allergens have been identi-fied. Test reagents for these agents are generally available inspecialized occupational allergy centers. (A) Summary Statement 167. A variety of plant or plant-de- rived proteins or glycoproteins may be associated with sys-temic allergic symptoms. (A) Summary Statement 168. Chemicals, plant resins, and lipid constituents are the chief causes of ACD, which requirespatch testing for confirmation. (A) Summary Statement 169. As previously emphasized, knowledge of specific patterns of cross-reactivity among tree,grass, and weed pollens is essential in preparing an efficientpanel of test reagents. (A)Summary Statement 170. Although cross-reactivity among related pollen families can usually be ascribed to specificepitopic determinants, more diffuse cross-reactivity due toplant profilins and cross-reactive carbohydrate determinantsmay also be present. (A) Summary Statement 171. Cross-reactivity data on fungi are extremely sparse. (C) Summary Statement 172. The skin prick/puncture test is superior to intracutaneous testing for predicting nasal allergicsymptoms triggered by exposure to pollen. (B) Summary Statement 173. A skin prick/puncture test is superior to intracutaneous testing for predicting allergic rhi-nitis and allergic asthma triggered by cat allergen exposure.(B) Summary Statement 174. The skin prick/puncture can be used to rule out allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma triggeredby cat allergen exposure. (B) Summary Statement 175. Knowledge of allergen cross- reactivity and local aerobiology is important in selectingappropriate allergens and in minimizing the number of aller-gens required for skin and specific IgE tests. (D) Summary Statement 176. In general, skin prick/puncture testing is more sensitive for identifying sensitization to in-halant allergens and confirming clinical allergy. However,specific IgE assays with defined quantifiable threshold levelscan also predict positive respiratory responses after allergenexposure. (B) Summary Statement 177. Demonstration of sensitization to an occupational agent by specific IgE and/or skin testingalone is insufficient to establish a diagnosis of OA. (B) Summary Statement 178. Skin prick testing with certain well-characterized occupational protein allergens possessesadequate sensitivity such that a negative skin test result(/H110213-mm wheal diameter) can be used to rule out clinical allergy. (B) Summary Statement 179. Test performance characteristics of specific IgE assays and skin testing for detection of chem-ical IgE-mediated sensitization must undergo validation andreproducibility in controlled studies using standardized anti-gens and assay protocols before these can be consideredreliable for routine evaluation of workers suspected of OA.(B) Summary Statement 180. In patients undergoing evaluation for suspected work-related natural rubber latex (NRL) al-lergy, a positive skin prick test result with a NRL extract (ifavailable) is preferred to demonstration of elevated specificIgE with an FDA-cleared assay due to higher sensitivity ofthe former. Current IgE-mediated allergy and asthma causedby NRL allergens is highly unlikely in the presence of anegative skin prick test result with a reliable crude NRLallergen extract. Elevated in vitro specific IgE levels can beused to confirm NRL allergy, but a negative result does notexclude NRL allergen sensitization. (B) Summary Statement 181. The primary tools available to evaluate patients' adverse reactions to foods include history(including diet records), physical examination, prick/puncture S12 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYskin tests, serum tests for food specific IgE antibodies, trial elimination diets, and oral food challenges. (B) Summary Statement 182. A detailed dietary history, at times augmented with written diet records, is necessary todetermine the likelihood that food is causing the disorder,identify the specific food, and determine the potential immu-nopathophysiology. (D) Summary Statement 183. With regard to evaluations for IgE antibody-associated food allergies, tests for food specificIgE antibody include percutaneous skin tests (prick/puncturetests) and serum assays. In general, these tests are highlysensitive (generally /H1102285%) but only modestly specific (ap- proximately 40% to 80%) and therefore are well suited foruse when suspicion of a particular food or foods is high. Theyare not effective for indiscriminate screening (eg, using pan-els of tests without consideration of likely causes) and there-fore generally should not be used for that purpose. (B) Summary Statement 184. Intracutaneous (intradermal) skin tests for foods are potentially dangerous, are overly sensitive,increase the chance of a false-positive test result, and are notrecommended. (D) Summary Statement 185. Based on studies in infants and children, increasingly higher concentrations of food specificIgE antibodies (reflected by increasingly larger percutaneousskin test size and/or higher concentrations of food specificserum IgE antibody) correlate with an increasing risk for aclinical reaction. (B) Summary Statement 186. A trial elimination diet may be helpful to determine if a disorder with frequent or chronicsymptoms is responsive to dietary manipulation. (D) Summary Statement 187. Graded oral food challenge is a useful means to diagnose an adverse reaction to food. (B) Summary Statement 188. A number of additional diagnos- tic tests are under investigation, including APTs and tests forIgE binding to specific epitopes. (B) Summary Statement 189. The rational selection, applica- tion, and interpretation of tests for food specific IgE antibod-ies require consideration of the epidemiology and underlyingimmunopathophysiology of the disorder under investigation,estimation of prior probability that a disorder or reaction isattributable to particular foods, and an understanding of thetest utility and limitations. (D) Summary Statement 190. Diagnostic skin and/or specific IgE tests are used to confirm clinical sensitivity to venoms ina patient with a history of a prior systemic reaction. (B) Summary Statement 191. Although diagnostic tests identify species specificity of venom sensitization, they do not reli-ably predict severity of the sting reaction. (B) Summary Statement 192. Standardized honeybee, Polistes, andVespula antigens are commercially available as skin test reagents. (A) Summary Statement 193. The skin test reagent available for evaluation of imported fire sting allergy is a nonstandardizedwhole-body extract. (C) Summary Statement 194. In the case of a history of ana- phylaxis to Hymenoptera venoms, intracutaneous skin testsare generally performed to 5 of the available venoms in a dose response protocol (up to 1 /H9262g/mL [wt/vol]) when pre- liminary prick/puncture test results are negative. (B) Summary Statement 195. The FDA-cleared specific IgE assays have comparable specificity but decreased sensitivitycompared with venom skin tests. (B) Summary Statement 196. Paradoxically, as many as 16% of insect-allergic patients with negative venom skin test resultshave positive results on currently available specific IgE invitro tests. (B) Summary Statement 197. A small percentage of patients (1%) with negative results to both skin and in vitro tests mayexperience anaphylaxis after a field sting. (B) Summary Statement 198. A skin test refractory period lasting up to 6 weeks after a venom sting has been demon-strated by recent data. (B) Summary Statement 199. Because of the predictive incon- sistencies of both skin and serum specific IgE tests, patientswith a convincing history of venom-induced systemic reac-tions should be evaluated by both methods. (D) Summary Statement 200. Cross-allergenicity among insect venoms is (1) extensive among vespid venoms, (2) consider-able between vespids and Polistes , (3) infrequent between bees and vespids, and (4) very limited between yellow jacketand imported fire ants. (B) Summary Statement 201. IfHymenoptera venom sensitiv- ity is suspected, initial prick/puncture tests followed by serialendpoint titration with intracutaneous tests may be required.(B) Summary Statement 202. Venom skin test may be repeated once or twice at 3- to 6-month intervals to confirm thediagnosis in a patient who initially had negative test results.(D) Summary Statement 203. When the diagnosis is highly suspected but not proved by skin and specific IgE tests,supervised live insect challenge sting may confirm clinicalsensitivity. Nevertheless, most patients with suspected venomallergy do not require live stings. (D) Summary Statement 204. Evaluation of drug-specific IgE antibodies induced by many high-molecular-weight and sev-eral low-molecular-weight agents is often highly useful forconfirming the diagnosis and prediction of future IgE-medi-ated reactions, such as anaphylaxis and urticaria.

Atopy patch tests, lymphocyte proliferation tests, and basophil activation tests are additionaldiagnostic tests for drug allergy. Further studies are requiredto confirm their clinical utility in the evaluation of drugallergic patients. (B) Summary Statement 210. Penicillin skin testing is the most reliable method for evaluating IgE-mediated penicillin al-lergy provided that the necessary reagents are available.When performed with both major and minor determinants,the negative predictive value of penicillin skin testing forimmediate reactions approaches 100%, whereas the positivepredictive value is between 40% and 100%. (B) Summary Statement 211. Skin testing with penicilloyl- polylysine and penicillin G appears to have adequate negativepredictive value in the evaluation of penicillin allergy. (C) Summary Statement 212. Penicillin skin test-negative pa- tients (as determined by testing with major and minor deter-minants) may receive penicillin, and depending on whichskin test reagents are used and the reaction history, the firstdose may need to be given via a test challenge with a lowerdose under observation. (D) Summary Statement 213. In the absence of validated skin test reagents, the approach to patients with a history ofpenicillin allergy is similar to that of other antibiotics forwhich no validated in vivo or in vitro diagnostic tests areavailable. Therapeutic options include (1) prescribing an al-ternative antibiotic, (2) performing a graded challenge, and(3) performing penicillin desensitization. (D) Summary Statement 214. In patients who have reacted to semisynthetic penicillins, consideration should be given toskin test the implicated antibiotic and penicillin determinants.(B) Summary Statement 215. There are no validated diagnostic tests of sufficient sensitivity for evaluation of IgE-mediatedallergy to antibiotics other than penicillin. (C) Summary Statement 216. Skin testing with nonirritating concentrations of other antibiotics is not standardized. Anegative skin test result does not rule out the possibility of animmediate-type allergy. A positive skin test result suggeststhe presence of drug-specific IgE antibodies, but the predic-tive value is unknown. (C) Summary Statement 217.

The initial approach to clinical diagnosis of CD is to distinguish between ACD and ICD. (C) Summary Statement 228. The inflammatory lesions of CD may result from either ACD or ICD mechanisms. Factors thataffect response to the contact agent include the agent itself,the patient, the type and degree of exposure, and the envi-ronment. (A) Summary Statement 229. Tissue reactions to contactants are attributable primarily to cellular immune mechanismsexcept for contact urticaria. (A) Summary Statement 230. Irritant contact dermatitis is usu- ally the result of nonimmunologic, direct tissue reaction andmust be clearly differentiated from ACD. (A) Summary Statement 231. The diagnosis of ACD is sus- pected from the clinical presentation of the rash, which thenmust be supported by a history of exposure to a putative agentand subsequently confirmed by patch testing whenever this ispossible. (C) Summary Statement 232. The skin site of the dermatitis is important in the diagnosis of ACD because the area of pre-dominant involvement and the regional distribution of thelesions often reflect the area of contact with the allergen. (A) Summary Statement 233. Epicutaneously applied patch tests are the standardized diagnostic procedures to confirm ACD. (A) Summary Statement 234. Patch tests are indicated in any patient with a chronic, pruritic, eczematous, or lichenifieddermatitis if underlying or secondary ACD is suspected.

These problems include both IgE and delayed hypersensitivity (ie, tuberculin-like andcontactant allergy) adaptive immune responses. Emphasis isplaced on reliability of reagents and devices. Quality assur-ance is also discussed in the context of reproducibility and theneed to minimize intertechnician and interlaboratory variabil-ity. IN DIAGNOSTIC OF IMMEDIATE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS Percutaneous and Intracutaneous In Vivo Diagnostic Skin Tests Summary Statement 1. First described in 1867 by Dr Charles Blackley, skin tests (prick/puncture and intracutaneous) haveevolved as reliable, cost-effective techniques for the diagno-sis of IgE-mediated diseases. (B) History and Background Although Blackley first documented the diagnostic potential of skin testing by placement of an allergen on abraded skin,the introduction of the cutaneous test for tuberculosis by vonPirquet became the chief impetus for subsequent allergy skintesting. 1,2The first of these was the scratch test made by rubbing the allergen into a small, blood-free scratched area ofthe forearm and introduced by Schloss for the diagnosis offood allergy in children. 2A few years later, Schick and Cooke independently introduced the intracutaneous test as a diag-nostic method. 2Although the scratch method was used ex- tensively in the past, it has fallen out of general use becauseof greater patient discomfort, poor reproducibility, and thepossibility of residual linear pigmented or depigmented ar-eas. 3As a way to avoid these problems, prick/puncture tests were introduced in the early 1950s. Sir Thomas Lewis hadfirst suggested the puncture technique as an alternative skintest. 4However, Squire first called attention to the quantitative aspects of the prick/puncture technique as a method of de-tecting sensitization to various proteins. 5He estimated that a small amount (3 /H1100310/H110026mL) of the test solution was intro- duced through the puncture site. Prick/puncture tests havebeen widely adapted throughout the world, although somepractitioners prefer exclusive use of intracutaneous tests. Prick/Puncture Tests Summary Statement 2. Prick/puncture tests are used to con- firm clinical sensitivity induced by aeroallergens, foods,some drugs, and a few chemicals. (B) Present application Prick/puncture tests are widely used for confirmation of clin- ical immediate hypersensitivity induced by a wide variety ofnaturally occurring allergens such as inhalants and foods.Under carefully defined circumstances, these tests are alsouseful in the diagnosis of drug and chemical hypersensitivity(platinum salts, anhydrides, polyisocyanates, sulfone-chloramide, and succinylcholine analogs) arefrequently used as reference standards for evaluating speci-ficity and sensitivity of specific in vitro tests for IgE, and they VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S15may also be used to determine bioequivalent potencies of allergenic extracts in European countries. Technique Summary Statement 3. A number of sharp instruments (hy- podermic needle, solid bore needle, lancet with or withoutbifurcated tip, and multiple-head devices) may be used forprick/puncture tests. (C) Summary Statement 4. Although a number of individual prick/puncture comparative studies have championed a par-ticular instrument, an objective comparison has not shown aclear-cut advantage for any single or multitest device. Fur-thermore, interdevice wheal size variability at both positiveand negative sites is highly significant. (C) Summary Statement 5. Optimal results can be expected by choosing a single prick/puncture device and properly trainingskin technicians in its use. (C) Summary Statement 6. Although prick/puncture tests are generally age, sex, and race independent, certain age (chil-dren younger than 2 years and adults older than 65 years) andracial (African American children) factors may affect theirinterpretation. (C) Summary Statement 7. Skin test allergens used for prick/ puncture tests should be potent and stable. (B) Summary Statement 8. To ensure proper interpretation, positive (histamine) and negative (saline or 50% glycerinatedHSA-saline) should be performed at the same time as aller-gen tests. (B) In performing the prick test, a sharp instrument (hypoder- mic needle, solid bore needle, blood lancet) is passed througha drop of extract or control solutions (histamine, saline) at a45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 angle to the skin. 6,7The skin is then gently lifted, creating a small break in the epidermis through which thesuspected allergen solution penetrates. Alternatively, the skindevice may be passed through the drop at a 90\u00b0 angle to theskin. This is called a puncture test. Devices used in thismanner generally are designed with a sharp point and ashoulder (0.9 or 1 mm) to prevent excess penetration into thedermis. Devices with multiple heads have also been devel-oped to apply several skin tests at the same time. 8Several of these devices may also be used for modified scratch tests byapplying a slight rotating twist after the puncture is made. Lancet instruments, either coated or submerged in a wellcontaining the allergen extract (Phazet, Prilotest), are notused in the United States. 6,7 In 1995, the Occupational Safety and Health Administra- tion (OSHA) called attention to the possible safety and healthrisks to bloodborne pathogens that may arise with the practiceof using a single device for multiple applications and wipingthe device between tests. 9OSHA opined that the technician could unintentionally be pricked with the device when wipingit between tests. This notice led many allergists to abandonthe use of solid-bore needles for percutaneous testing, result-ing in greater use of the newer devices, each of which isdiscarded after use. Numerous studies have compared the reliability and vari- ability of various devices. 10-29Analysis of the results of these combined studies plus several recent prick/puncture compar-ative studies does not reveal a clear-cut advantage for anysingle or multitest device because interstudy results are vari-able. This is partially due to the degree of trauma that thedevice may impart to the skin, thereby accounting for differ-ent sizes of positive reactions and even the possibility of producing a false-positive reaction at the site of the negativecontrol. Thus, prick/puncture devices require specific criteriafor what constitutes a positive reaction (Table 2). 27,30What is readily apparent from this table is the fact that wheal sizevariability between the studies is highly significant at bothpositive and negative test result sites. 27In addition, consid- erable care should be given to proper training of skin testtechnicians. To achieve quality assurance among technicians,consistency in skin test performance should be demonstratedby skin testing proficiency protocols. In Europe, a coefficientvariation of less than 20% after histamine control applicationshas been suggested, whereas a coefficient variation of lessthan 30% was used in a recent Childhood Asthma Manage-ment Study. 30Table 3 outlines a suggested proficiency testing protocol. Criteria (diameter or wheal area /H11006SD) for positive and negative test results should be preestablished with thedevice selected by each clinical test site. Under clinicalconditions, it is impossible to quantify the exact amount of Table 2.

However, a recent gamma camera-based method to measure microvolumes la-beled with radioisotopes attained a high degree of precisionand accuracy in measuring microvolumes. 31This degree of precision of allergen delivery might be useful for bioequiva-lency standard assays by prick/puncture methods. In the past decade, a number of prospective epidemiologic studies have relied heavily on the prick/puncture test forevaluating increase or decrease in atopy over time. 32,33Obvi- ously, as discussed herein, such studies require the use of asingle device with predetermination of the variability ofwheal-and-flare diameters elicited by allergen, histamine, andsaline, a proficient operator, and potent, stable test extracts.Several epidemiologic studies of this type have confirmedhighly repeatable results in the short term (ranging from 1week to 11 months). 34,35In addition, other studies reported repeatability during a 2- to 3-year period.36,37 Concurrent drugs may affect the validity of prick/puncture and intracutaneous tests. Antihistamines vary considerably intheir ability to suppress wheal-and-flare responses (Table 4).Furthermore, the studies that evaluated degree and durationof antihistamine suppression were not directly comparablebecause they used different pharmacodynamic models (eg,histamine vs allergen induced). The general principle to begleaned from various studies is that the use of first- andsecond-generation antihistamines should be discontinued 2 to3 days before skin tests with notable exceptions being ceti-rizine, hydroxyzine, clemastine, loratadine, and cyprohepta-dine (Table 4). 38-40The tricyclic antidepressant doxepin may also suppress the wheal-and-flare response for as long as 6days. 41Histamine2antagonists may cause mild suppression, and their use should be discontinued for 24 hours beforetesting.42,43Oral prostaglandin D2 inhibitors, (eg, indometh- acin) given several hours before testing may by 17%, whereas (30 mg of prednisone daily for1 week) do not suppress skin tests. 46There are dissenting opinions about the effect of long-term and relatively high-dose corticosteroids ( /H1102220 mg/d) on suppression of immediate skin test reactions. 47,48By contrast, repetitive and prolonged application of potent topical corticosteroids for greater than 3weeks may suppress immediate skin tests over areas wherethey have been applied. 49-51Skin tests should be avoided in these sites or corticosteroids should be avoided in such sitesfor 2 to 3 weeks before testing. This effect is attributed to acombination of a decrease in mast cell recruitment and anincrease of mast cell apoptosis. 49,50 Several physiologic factors may affect interpretation of skin test results. Suppression of endogenous cortisol mayaffect late-phase reactions (skin and pulmonary) without responses. 52,53Although both prick/ puncture and intracutaneous histamine tests were not for-merly considered to be affected by menstrual phase, a recentstudy demonstrated optimal reactions to allergens whenprick/puncture tests were performed at midcycle. 54Histamine wheals are significantly larger in darkly pigmented skin com-pared with light skin, thus emphasizing the importance of ahistamine control. 55A recent investigation of school aged children revealed that histamine skin reactivity differed mark-edly in 3 different countries (Italy more than Poland morethan Libya). 56Short-term UV-B radiation may reduce wheal- and-flare intensity by as much as 50%.57 Prick/puncture tests can be performed on the upper back or volar surface of the forearm.58Not only is the back more reactive than the forearm, but specific locations on the backand forearms vary in reactive intensity. 58Regardless of loca- tion, it is recommended that there should be sufficient space(eg, approximately 2 to 2.5 cm) between each applied aller-gen, and tests not be placed in areas 5 cm from the wrist or3 cm from the antecubital fossae. 21,35,59-60Skin tests should not be performed in skin sites with active dermatitis or severedermatographism. If they are performed in the presence ofmild dermatographism, the results should be interpreted withcaution. Prick/puncture tests may be performed in infants as young as 1 month. Although an early study reported that positivereactions tend to be smaller in infants and younger children(/H110212 years) than in adults, a recent investigation of prick/ puncture tests in infants revealed that they exhibit a highdegree of reliability. 61,62The prevalence of positive skin test results increases until the third decade, after which there is aslow decline, particularly after the age of 50 years. 63Never- theless, significant positive skin test results may still bedemonstrated in patients well older than 65 years. Severalinvestigations reported that African American children withor without asthma were more likely to exhibit positive prick/Table 3.

Before the recent availability of standardizedextracts, the composition of nonstandardized, commerciallyavailable extracts varied greatly between the manufacturers. 66 This situation is slowly improving with the introduction of bioequivalent extracts.67,68In Nordic countries, the wheal and flare of a positive control histamine test are used to assignbiologic equivalency to allergen materials. 69,70Bioequiva- lency by this system is defined as histamine equivalent prick(HEP) units. Although relatively few commercialized ex-tracts are yet designated in bioequivalent allergy units (eg,grass, cat), the trend toward universal bioequivalency is wellunder way, as evidenced by more recent attempts to standard-ize commercial food antigen extracts not only by wheal areabut also by objective organ challenges. 71,72 Stability and potency of allergenic test extracts are also important issues. Since it is known that allergen extractsdeteriorate with time, accelerated by dilution and highertemperatures, allergen test extracts are usually preservedwith 50% glycerin. 73,74If dilutions are required for skin test threshold testing, the diluent should be HSA (0.03%)-sa-line. 73All extracts should be stored under cold (4\u00b0C) to ensure stability.74In vivo biologic activity of genetically engineered recombinant allergens has been evaluated andcompared with specific allergens from which they were de-rived. 75,76In general, they appear to be highly specific and safe. However, the sensitivity of single recombinant allergensis usually lower than those obtained with natural allergenextracts. 75The precise role of recombinant allergens as in vivo diagnostic tools remains to be determined. Positive and negative controls should be performed with all tests. In the United States for many years the only availablepositive control was histamine phosphate (2.7 mg/mL equiv-alent to a 1.0-mg/mL histamine base). Wheal diameters withthis preparation range from 2 to 7 mm. 59Currently, a 10- mg/mL histamine dehydrochloride control is available, andthis is the preferred positive control for prick/puncture skintests. The negative control consists of 50% glycerinatedHSA-saline if concentrated extracts are used. Reading the test results Summary Statement 9. The peak reactivity of prick/puncture tests is 15 to 20 minutes at which time both wheal anderythema diameters (or areas) should be recorded in millime-ters and compared with positive and negative controls. (B) Summary Statement 10. Qualitative scoring (0 to 4 /H11001; pos- itive or negative) is no longer used by many clinicians be-cause of interphysician variability in this method of scoringand interpretation. (B) A standardized approach to reading the tests has not yet been achieved. For example, some clinicians advocate imme-diate blotting of the allergen after the prick/puncture test to reduce the risk of an adverse reaction, whereas others leavethe allergen in place for 20 minutes. 77No essential difference has been found between these techniques. Histamine controltests should be read 15 minutes after application at the peakof reactivity. 69The peak of allergen prick/puncture tests is usually 15 to 20 minutes after application. Although someinvestigators have advocated the primary importance of thewheal diameter, 70both erythema and wheal should be mea- sured and recorded in millimeters for appropriate compari-sons with positive (ie, histamine) and negative controls (ie,buffered diluent or 50% glycerinated extracts). Since traumamay affect wheal size (Table 2), an allergen response lessthan 3 mm generally should not be regarded as positive. 27,30,70 Devices that produce wheals that exceed 3 mm at negativecontrol sites should be avoided. 11Unfortunately, there is variability among physicians and investigators in recordingthe dimensions of flare, wheal, or both. The size of thereaction may be recorded as a mean wheal diameter, D /H11001d/2 (with D indicating the largest diameter of the wheal and dindicating the largest diameter orthogonal to D), planimetry(either direct or from a traced copy), minimal diameter of asignificant wheal /H113503 mm, comparison to an HEP test caused by 1 or 10 mg/mL of histamine dihydrochloride (defined as 1HEP with 10 mg/mL being the preferred reference standard),or a score related to a codeine phosphate control defined as awheal of 75% or greater of a control codeine phosphatesolution (25 mg/mL). 17,24,78Qualitative scoring (0 to 4 /H11001;0o r /H11001) is no longer used by many clinicians because of marked interphysician variability in scoring and interpretation of thismethod. 79 To summarize, a prick/puncture test with a response of at least 3-mm diameter (with equivalent erythema) more thandiluent control done at the same time is required as proof ofthe presence of cutaneous allergen specific IgE. There is arecent trend to develop more precise methods of measuringwheal area, such as handheld scanners with appropriate com-puter software, end point titration, and morphometry becausewheal size (area or diameter) has assumed greater diagnosticsignificance. 80-84Several investigators have determined that specific cutoff values (eg, /H113508 mm for peanut) obviate the need to confirm clinical sensitivity by organ challengetests. 85,86If similar pretest probabilities for clinical sensitivity can be developed for more allergens by defining precisecutoff prick/puncture measurement results, the clinical utilityof prick/puncture tests will be greatly enhanced. Clinical relevance Summary Statement 11. The diagnostic validity of prick/ puncture tests has been confirmed not only in patients ex-posed to allergens under natural conditions but also in pa-tients undergoing controlled organ challenge tests. (B) Summary Statement 12. Although prick/puncture testing often correlates with exposure history, there are significantexceptions to this observation. (B) VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S19The diagnostic value of prick/puncture tests has been de- termined chiefly by comparing the test to history of symp-toms associated with exposure. They have been used mostfrequently to evaluate individual cases and populations ofallergic patients. The diagnostic validity of prick/puncturetests has been confirmed as a correlate of clinical sensitivityin double-blind, randomized control studies under outdoor(parks) and indoor (controlled environmental exposure units)exposure conditions. 87The diagnostic accuracy in prick/punc- ture tests has also been confirmed in groups of clinicallyallergic patients undergoing specific nasal bronchoprovoca-tion challenge measured by nasal resistance or acoustic rhi-nometry under controlled laboratory conditions. 88-92Like- wise, in the case of foods, prick/puncture tests have beendemonstrated to correlate with clinical symptoms that occurafter either open or double-blind food challenges. 93-97How- ever, 1 of these studies revealed that this correlation did notnecessarily apply to all foods. 93When used as a diagnostic test for potential symptoms based on exposure and/or historyalone, the utility of prick/puncture tests is highly allergendependent, giving concordant results with certain allergens,such as cat dander, but not with others. 97-99Nevertheless, given their generally favorable diagnostic characteristics,other tests (intracutaneous, atopy patch, various specific IgEtests) are often compared with prick/puncture tests as a ref-erence. 100-108Interestingly, a recent prospective study re- ported that 60% of skin sensitive (wheal /H113504 mm) asymptom- atic subjects developed clinical allergy. These resultssuggested that a positive prick/puncture test result in anasymptomatic person may predict subsequent clinical aller-gy. 108 Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictiveindices Summary Statement 13. Many studies have verified the sen- sitivity and specificity of prick/puncture tests for both inhal-ant and food allergens when correlated with nasal and oralchallenge tests. (B) Summary Statement 14. Compared with clinical history alone, the diagnostic accuracy of prick/puncture tests showedmore limited capacity to predict clinical sensitivity for bothinhalant and food allergens. (C) It is generally accepted that prick/puncture tests are less sensitive than intracutaneous tests. This is partially explainedby the larger volumes of test solutions administered by theintracutaneous route. To compensate for this, positive prick/puncture tests require that the test extracts be 50 to 100 timesmore concentrated than intracutaneous test solutions. Thisrelative lack of sensitivity to prick/puncture tests can bepartially compensated for by avoidance of glycerinated ex-tracts or by adding small amounts of Tween 80 (0.0005%). 15 On the other hand, prick tests are more specific than intracu-taneous tests because the increased sensitivity at a fixedconcentration of the intracutaneous test (1 in 1,000 wt/vol)may be responsible for a small but reproducible number offalse-positive reactions, presumably because of an irritanteffect. Because of the uncertainty created by this relationship between prick/puncture and intracutaneous tests, comparativeinvestigations have been conducted to establish cutoff values,sensitivity, specificity and predictive indices of these testswith respect to inhalants and selected food allergens. Inter-pretation of these results varies, depending on whether thecomparative gold standard is clinical history or controlledprovocation challenges. With respect to inhalant allergens,several investigations have demonstrated that it is possible toestablish more scientific guidelines for interpreting the testsand what they predict. 90,91,97,109Using positive nasal provoca- tion challenges as a standard, the sensitivity of prick/puncturetests ranges from 85% to 87%, whereas the specificity ofthese tests is between 79% and 86%. 90,91A recent meta- analysis comparing prick/puncture tests to nasal challengerevealed positive likelihood ratios of 4.93, 16.17, 3.23, and4.06 for cat, tree pollen, grass pollen, and house dust allergen,respectively, whereas the corresponding negative likelihoodratios were 0.08, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.03. 109-113In a single mold investigation ( Alternaria sp) that compared skin testing to challenge tests, positive and negative likelihood ratios weresimilar for both prick/puncture and intracutaneous tests(prick: positive likelihood ratio of 11.75, negative likelihoodratio of 0.05; intracutaneous: positive likelihood ratio of 8.80,negative likelihood ratio of 0.05). 114(Refer to Evaluation of Inhalant Allergy, Part 2 for clinical significance.) A comparative study of allergic asthmatic patients under- going nonspecific methacholine challenge causing a 20% fallin 4 less (wt/vol) or 8 mg/mL or less (wt/vol) revealed that the sensitivity, specificity, and negativepredictive value of prick/puncture tests were 91%, 52%, and85%, respectively, with the cutoff value of provocation con-centration that caused a decrease in FEV 1of 20% or 4 mg/mL or less (wt/vol) increased the sensitivity and negative predic-tive value to 98.2% and 97.8%, respectively. This suggeststhat positive prick/puncture skin test results are more likely tobe associated with asthma of greater severity, as indexed bythe lower cutoff methacholine PC 20value of less than 4 mg/mL (wt/vol). A negative prick/puncture test result de-creased the probability of having asthma by 10- to 20-fold insubjects whose pretest probability was low to moderate. 109 The diagnostic accuracy of prick/puncture tests in food al-lergy has been compared with patients (mostly children) whohave positive open or double-blinded controlled positive re-actions to specific foods. 85,93-97,115-118In several of these stud- ies, it was possible to determine cutoff levels of skin prick/puncture tests wheal diameters that were 100% diagnostic forseveral for for egg; /H113508m m for peanuts). 94-99,115These specific food cutoff values also indicate the probability of more severe food allergy becausethe controlled oral food challenges to which these werecompared reproduced clinical anaphylactic events, whichcould be carefully monitored and treated. However, cutoffwheal sizes associated with high likelihood of allergy arevariable, depending on the age (older children and infants), S20 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYdevice, and reagents. Once cutoff values are ascertained and validated, both likelihood ratios and the area under the re-ceiver operating characteristic curve can be calculated withthe goal of eliminating the need for confirmation by provoc-ative challenges. 85,86,115 Sensitivity, specificity, and the predictive indices have also been compared with clinical history, both for inhalant andfood allergens. 97,98,119-122Several of these investigations used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves to determine optimal cutoff values and to evaluate the ability ofvarious allergens to predict symptom histories of hay feverand asthma. 120,121Analysis of these studies revealed no uni- fying principle about the accuracy of prick/puncture skin testsas predictors for hay fever and asthma. Thus, 1 study con-cluded that even the combination of history to commonallergens and physical examination is not diagnostic withrespect to skin prick/puncture and specific IgE tests. 98There are exceptions, one of which concluded that a skin prick/puncture wheal size of 3 mm or larger to cat elicited asensitivity of 0.9, a specificity of 0.9, and a diagnostic accu-racy of 0.9. 97The limited capacity of skin prick/puncture tests for predicting clinical symptoms was also tested by structuredinterviews with patients undergoing aeroallergen skin tests. 123 Patients were found to have limited ability to correctly predictpositive skin test results to aeroallergens based on their ownclinical symptom experiences. Limitations Summary Statement 15. The reliability of prick/puncture tests depends on the skill of the tester, the test instrument, color ofthe skin, skin reactivity on the day of the test, potency, andstability of test reagents. (C) Summary Statement 16. False-positive prick/puncture tests may occur (1) to tree pollens in honey bee-sensitive patientsdue to cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants present inhoney bee venom and (2) in tree-sensitive patients beingtested to tree pollens no longer indigenous to the area. (C) Summary Statement 17. The rare occurrence of specific positive organ challenge test results in patients with bothnegative prick/puncture and intracutaneous tests suggests thatalternative pathways, including IgE, IgE-independent, or nonimmune stimuli may activate mediatorrelease in the end organ. (C) The reliability and interpretation of the prick/puncture test is heavily dependent on the skill and interpretation of theindividual tester, the reliability of the test instrument, thecolor of the skin, the status of skin reactivity on the day of thetest, potency and stability of test extracts, especially theoptimum concentrations used for the test, and experimentaldifferences between duplicate prick tests. 13,19,30Appropriate proficiency test methods for evaluating accuracy, precision,and reproducibility of skin testing are encouraged in thetraining of personnel (Table 3). 30,124 If quality controls are not used, interpretation of the test results varies from one technician to another. The hazards ofblood contamination with the use of all instruments must begiven appropriate attention, and all technicians must be care- fully trained in appropriate barrier techniques, as well asavoidance of accidental needle punctures. Reliability ofprick/puncture tests requires that allergen extracts be potentand of known composition. Whenever possible, extracts withknown biologic potency should be used. 66,124,125For example, commercial extracts of fruits and vegetables are likely to losepotency over relatively short periods. Therefore, prick/punc-ture tests for these potential allergens should be performedeither with freshly made food extracts or by the prick-prickmethod in which the tester first pricks the fresh food and thenthe skin. This method may be particularly helpful when thereare differences in the allergenicity of different cultivar strains(eg, apples). 126,127 If interpretation of allergen prick/puncture tests are ex- pressed as a ratio of equivalency to a positive control (eg,HEP), selection of the positive control may affect the diag-nostic accuracy of the test. It has been shown that using aratio of allergen to positive histamine control for gradingragweed reactivity elicited better diagnostic accuracy than theratio of allergen to a codeine phosphate control. whealsreduced intertechnician reproducibility. 129 Several confounding issues concerning test extracts could limit diagnostic accuracy of prick/puncture tests. A recentreport demonstrated that approximately 16% of honeybeevenom allergic patients may be misdiagnosed as having mul-tivalent pollen sensitization because they reacted to nonspe-cific cross carbohydrate determinants in venom extracts. 130A recent study of patients sensitive to multiple tree pollensrevealed a lack of correlation between prick/puncture testsusing commercial extracts of 15 previously reported indige-nous tree species compared with actual mean tree speciespollen counts samples in the local aerobiology system. 99This study indicated that prick tests to tree pollens should only beperformed with those species that have been confirmed asbeing current airborne aeroallergens by aerobiologic sam-pling (see nationalallergybureauwww.aaaai.org/nab/). For unknown reasons, the diagnostic accuracy of intracu- taneous testing is superior to that of IgE-mediated anaphylactic reactions(eg, penicillin, years, however, even intracutaneous negative Hy- menoptera allergic patients have been reported to experience anaphylaxis. 131,132 Although the accuracy of prick/puncture tests in predict- ing the presence or absence of clinical allergy has beengenerally confirmed by previously cited studies, providedthe proper cutoff levels of interpretation are used, there arespecific reports of proven end-organ sensitivity in theabsence of positive prick/puncture or intracutaneous testresults. 133-143This occurrence has not been explained, al- though pathways such as locally secreted IgE, IgE-inde-pendent, or non-IgE stimuli have been suggested. 139,144,145 In the case of reactions to foods despite negative testresults, the trigger protein in the test reagent may not have VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S21been fully extracted (with respect to the appropriate epitope) or the causal protein was rapidly degraded.140-143 Safety Summary Statement 18. Life-threatening generalized sys- temic reactions are rarely caused by prick/puncture tests. In arecent retrospective survey, 1 death was reported in a patientwho received 90 food prick/puncture tests at one time. (C) In a retrospective analysis of children being tested for atopy, 6 cases of generalized reactions occurred in infantsyounger than 6 months who showed positive skin prick testresults to fresh food specimens. Other common features inthis group of patients were active eczema and a familyhistory of allergic diseases. All infants received prompttreatment and recovered well. 146The overall rate of gen- eralized reactions was 521 per 100,000 tested children. Ina 12-year survey of fatal reactions to allergen injectionsand skin testing in both adults and children from 1990 to2001, one fatality was confirmed after skin prick testingwith multiple food allergens. 147This patient also had mod- erately persistent asthma, and 90 food prick tests wereapplied at one time. Analysis of near or life-threateningreactions in the same survey revealed no instances ofreactions attributed to inhalant prick/puncture tests. In therecently published Practice Parameter, The Diagnosis andManagement of Anaphylaxis, the concurrent use of /H9252-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors is cited as a relative contraindication to skin testing.148-151 Intracutaneous Tests Present applications Summary Statement 19. Intracutaneous tests will identify a larger number of patients with lower skin test sensitivity andare used when increased sensitivity is the main goal oftesting. (B) Summary Statement 20. Intracutaneous tests are useful for evaluation of anaphylaxis, particularly drug (ie, penicillin)andHymenoptera venom anaphylaxis. (A) Summary Statement 21. When compared with specific na- sal challenge, skin end point titration (SET) is equivalent toprick/puncture skin tests. (B) Intracutaneous tests are generally used when increased sensitivity is the main goal of testing (ie, when prick/puncture test results are negative despite very convincing history ofexposure). 152They permit identification of a larger number of clinically reactive patients, especially those with lower skintest sensitivity. In addition, skin sensitivity to low potencyallergenic extracts may best be evaluated by this method. As previously discussed, intracutaneous tests are prefera- ble for diagnosis of drug and venom anaphylaxis. 153-161The utility of intracutaneous tests for diagnosis of drug-inducedpenicillin anaphylaxis has been extended to a variety of drugclasses, including cancer chemotherapeutic agents, musclerelaxants, insulin, and heparin. 162-166Although experience and standardization of these drug categories are limited comparedwith penicillin and venoms, their negative and positive pre- dictive values appear to be comparable.163 Although intracutaneous tests at strengths customarily per- formed (1:100 to 1:1,000 [wt/vol] from manufacturer's con-centrate) are more sensitive, there are conflicting resultsabout their ability to predict clinical allergy. Several studiesin the previously cited meta-analysis investigated how wellintracutaneous tests predict symptoms after natural or labo-ratory allergen challenges. 110Two high-quality studies con- ducted in cat- grass-sensitive patients concluded thatpositive likelihood ratios were poor (0.89 and 1.05 for cat andgrass, respectively) as were negative likelihood ratios (1.24and 0.98 for cat and grass, respectively). 111,167By contrast, the accuracy of intracutaneous tests was excellent for Alternaria species, as evidenced by positive and negative likelihoodratios of 8.80 and 0.05, respectively. 114These disparate re- sults probably reflect the intrinsic variability of individualallergens among investigators and their abilities to predictclinical allergy. 113 One recent investigation demonstrated that SET, which is a modified quantitative testing method, is equivalent to prick/puncture testing for both positive and negative predictabilityof clinical allergy when both are compared with nasal chal-lenge. 90The end point response in SET is the lowest concen- tration of allergen that produces a wheal: (1) that is the firstwheal 2 mm larger than the negative control wheal and (2) isfollowed by a second wheal that is at least 2 mm larger thanthe preceding one. 90It should be stressed, however, that SET is roughly equivalent to new skin prick tests only at dilutionsranging from 1:12,500 (wt/vol) to 1:312,000 (wt/vol). Bycomparison, from 1:100 (wt/vol) to 1:1,000(wt/vol). 90Indeed, a study designed to test the predictive response of timothy prick/puncture and intracutaneous teststo nasal provocation revealed that the addition of a singleintracutaneous test at a dilution of 1:500 (wt/vol) (No. 2 in theRinkel nomenclature) adds no additional predictability whenthe prick test result is negative and therefore appears to beunwarranted. 91Similar disappointing results were obtained when Alternaria intracutaneous tests at a dose of 1:500 (wt/ vol) were compared with specific nasal challenge93and con- trasted sharply with a previous Alternaria study.114 Techniques Summary Statement 22. Intracutaneous tests should be per- formed with small volumes (approximately 0.02 to 0.05 mL)of allergens injected intracutaneously with a disposable 0.5-or 1.0-mL syringe. (C) Summary Statement 23. As a general rule, the starting dose of an intracutaneous allergen test ranges from 100- to 1,000-fold more dilute than the allergen concentration used tests. (C) A single-unit, 0.5- or 1.0-mL disposable syringe with an attached hypodermic needle is preferred. The gauge of theattached hypodermic needle may vary from 26 to 30. 168The use of a Hamilton calibrated syringe ensures a reproducible S22 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYinjected volume, but this appears to offer little advantage to careful injections that produce wheals of similar size.168,169 The reproducibility of intracutaneous tests is affected by thesame variables as those described for prick/puncture tests. 57 These include the age of the skin, the area of the body wherethe tests are applied, skin pigmentation, interference by con-current medications, and potency and biologic stability of theallergen test extracts. Intracutaneous tests are usually placedon the upper arm or volar surface of the forearm rather than the back to allow for application of a tourniquet shouldsystemic symptoms occur. The back also reveals considerabledifferences in skin reactivity between different areas of theback of individual patients. 168There may be leakage of the allergen at the injection site because of improper technique,but this can be prevented by the use of unitized syringes andneedles. Concurrent tests with diluent control solutions alsoshould be performed. In addition, a positive histamine control(equivalent to 0.10 mg/mL [wt/vol] of histamine base) shouldbe included to evaluate the degree of skin response at the timeof the test. The volumes of intracutaneous test solutions mayvary from 0.02 to 0.05 mL, depending on the purpose of thetest. Delivery of small volumes ( /H110210.03 mL) is difficult to attain with regularity. Because of the greater possibility ofsystemic reactions after intracutaneous testing, special careshould be given to preparing less potent test dilutions. As ageneral rule, the starting dose of intracutaneous extract solu-tions in patients with a preceding negative prick test resultshould range from 100- to 1,000-fold dilutions of the con-centrated extracts used for prick/puncture tests. 58In the case of standardized allergens, such as ragweed, grass, dust mite,and cat, the range of starting intracutaneous test solutions inpatients with preceding negative prick/puncture test results isbetween 10 and 100 BAU. 58,170 Most of the factors that affect the reliability of prick/ puncture tests also apply to intracutaneous tests. Several ofthese have already been discussed (ie, smaller dose of thepositive histamine phosphate control and the unsuitability ofthe back for intracutaneous tests). Technical training forprecision and reproducibility of intracutaneous tests shouldalso be emphasized, especially for those persons performingbiologic equivalency tests. A recent investigation of intracu-taneous skin tests noted that intracutaneous testing had poorreproducibility, appearing to confirm a much earlierstudy. 171,172The effects of drugs on intracutaneous testing are similar to the agents discussed under prick/puncture tests.Although immediate-phase reactions are the late-phase cutaneous reac-tion is reduced. 45 Reading the test results Summary Statement 24. Intracutaneous tests are read 10 to 15 minutes after injection, and both wheal and erythema (inmillimeters) should be recorded. (B) For intracutaneous tests, histamine controls and allergen sites are usually read 10 to 15 minutes, respectively, after theinjections. Similar to prick/puncture tests, various indices,such as the longest diameter, the sum of the largest diameter and its orthogonal diameter divided by 2, products of thediameters, planimetry, and measurement of paper traced fromskin responses, have been used to interpret intracutaneousresults. Both erythema and wheal diameters should be mea-sured and recorded. Erythema can be measured as reliably aswheal reactions and is the sole criterion for bioequivalencytests in the United States. 59,124Any reaction larger than the negative control may indicate the presence of specific IgE antibody. Given the greater sensitivity and equivocal repro-ducibility of intracutaneous testing, however, small positivereactions may not be clinically significant. 173There are no evidence-based studies on standardized intracutaneous testgrading. Eighty-five percent of board-certified allergists re-cently surveyed reported that they used the criterion of 3 mmabove the negative control as a threshold for a positiveintracutaneous test result. 174The criteria for determining the SET titration threshold stipulate a measurement of 4 mmabove the negative control. 90 Clinical relevance Summary Statement 25. The diagnostic sensitivity of intracu- taneous tests is probably greater than prick/puncture testswhen testing for penicillin, insect venom, or certain drugclass (eg, insulin, heparin, muscle relaxants) hypersensitivity.(C) Summary Statement 26. The greater sensitivity of titrated intracutaneous tests, especially in the erythema component, isan advantage for determining biologic potency of allergenextracts units (BAU) as based on intra-cutaneous erythema assays in sensitive human volunteers. (B) In general, intracutaneous tests are useful in detecting patients with lower levels of clinical sensitivity when evalu-ating allergens (both natural and recombinant) of low Hymenoptera ). They have been evalu- ated and validated in diagnosis of several important IgE-mediated drug reactions, including anaphylactic reactionsinduced by penicillin, succinylcholine analogs, and cancerchemotherapeutic agents. In the case of penicillin anaphylac-tic hypersensitivity, intracutaneous testing (after initial pricktesting) is a first-line approach. Under the proper test condi-tions 1(use of both major and minor penicillin determinants), these tests were found to have a negative predictive value ofalmost 99% in a large, multicentered clinical trial. 153Recent reports suggested that intracutaneous tests might also beuseful adjuncts for the diagnosis of nonimmediate allergicreactions to aminopenicillins. accuracy of anaphylaxis associatedwith cephalosporins and other non- /H9252-lactam antibiotics is limited because standardized reagents are not available formost of these antibiotics. 176Intracutaneous tests are used mostly as a complement to prick/puncture tests in the evalu-ation of anaphylaxis to muscle concen- IgE-mediated reactions are much less frequent VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S23commonly used biologics (eg, protamine, human insulin, heparin), a number of case reports suggest that they may beuseful for confirming the immunologic nature of these reac-tions. 166,178-180Venom intracutaneous skin testing is the most useful in vivo immunologic procedure for confirming imme-diate hypersensitivity to venoms. 181 The greater sensitivity of intracutaneous tests offers an advantage for determination of biologic potency of allergenicextracts and their respective recombinant allergens. 75,182Di- agnostic markers for ABPA were identified by intracutaneoustesting a panel of recombinant antigens derived fromAspergillus fumigatus. 182Variability among commercial venom extracts may also be evaluated by intracutaneoustesting. 183 Dose response assays of erythema in response to intracu- taneous testing in sensitive human volunteers are the basis ofBAU in the United States. 124In Europe, it has been suggested that bioequivalency could be based on prick/puncturewheals 125 Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictiveindices Summary Statement 27. At dilutions between 10 /H110022and 10/H110023 (wt/vol), intracutaneous tests for most allergens exhibit poor efficiency in predicting organ challenge responses and cor-relating with the presence of detectable serum specific IgE.(C) Summary Statement 28. There are limited data about equiv- alency of sensitivity, specificity, and predictive indices be-tween intracutaneous and prick/puncture tests when com-pared with organ challenge tests. One study demonstratedthat more dilute intracutaneous concentrations were compa-rable to prick/puncture tests in predicting positive nasal chal-lenges. (C) Summary Statement 29. Similar comparative equivalency studies based on history and symptoms alone revealed thatintracutaneous tests were comparable to prick/puncture testsonly at intracutaneous titration end points between 10 /H110025and 10/H110026g/mL (wt/vol). (B) Summary Statement 30. Because clinical use of intracuta- neous tests is usually restricted to a single dose (ie, 1:1,000wt/vol), which may be irritant, predictive accuracy of thesetests at this concentration is often confounded by false-posi-tive results. (C) Quantitative estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and the predictive indices are difficult to evaluate because most of theclinical experience with allergen intracutaneous testing hasbeen performed at a single dilution (1:1,000 wt/vol). Forexample, a recent investigation of potential clinical moldallergy could not distinguish between atopic and nonatopicphenotypes in patients being tested to molds at this dilu-tion. 171However, a study comparing intracutaneous titration end point with prick testing showed a modest correlation fora panel of 8 allergens. 106Although these data suggest that intracutaneous end point titration might achieve sensitivityand specificity values equivalent to the prick test, there isonly one head-to-head comparison of the 2 methods with clinical history and/or provocation testing. 91By comparing intracutaneous end point titration, skin prick/puncture tests,and nasal provocation determined by acoustic rhinometry,this investigation revealed that skin prick/puncture tests weremore sensitive (85.3% vs 79.4%) and more specific 67.9%) than intracutaneous end point titration as a screen-ing procedure. The positive and negative predictive values ofintracutaneous end point titration were 75% and 73%, study comparing intracutaneous tests tests at 30 and 3,000 biologic units/mL, re-spectively, found positive predictive values intracutaneous and prick/puncture tests, respective-ly. also established optimum intra- cutaneous and prick/puncture cutoff values of 0.7 and 0.4HEP equivalents, respectively. 184Compared with clinical his- tory, the positive predictive value for detection of allergicsensitization was 77% for intracutaneous tests and 86% titrations a single allergen (ragweed) were compared with history andspecific in vitro IgE (RAST) in a group of patients beingevaluated for possible clinical allergy. 185At intracutaneous titration end points between 10/H110026and 10/H110028g/mL (wt/vol), 70% of the patients had a positive history and approximately50% of the patients had a positive RAST result. At intracu-taneous titration end points between 10 /H110025and 10/H110023g/mL (wt/vol), only 60% of patients gave positive histories and15% exhibited specific IgE. 185This study indicated that more dilute end point threshold levels of intracutaneous tests couldapproach the diagnostic accuracy of prick/puncture tests. In amore recent investigation using recombinant birch pollen 1 as serum IgE. 186Thus, in this study, the biologic sensitivity of the intracutaneous end point titrationthreshold appeared to outperform both basophil histaminerelease and serum specific IgE. Limitations Summary Statement 31. For most allergens, a fixed dilution (1:1,000 [wt/vol]) of intracutaneous tests has poor efficiencyin predicting organ challenge responses. (A) Summary Statement 32. Intracutaneous tests are occasion- ally negative in venom-sensitive patients who experiencelife-threatening reactions. (C) Summary Statement 33. Repetitive ( /H113502) intracutaneous penicillin testing may sensitize a small number of individualsto penicillin. (C) The chief problem with intracutaneous tests performed at a fixed dilution (1:1,000 [wt/vol]) for most allergens is rela-tively poor efficiency in predicting organ challenge re-sponses, the most reliable predictors of clinical sensitivity. Ina recent study that specifically evaluated this relationship,this limitation appeared to apply to most of the commonindoor and outdoor allergens. 171Similar findings were re- ported in an exposed population being evaluated for mold- S24 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYrelated health effects.187In venom allergy, intracutaneous skin test results are occasionally negative, even in patientswith near life-threatening reactions to the specific venom. 188 A deliberate sting challenge under controlled conditionsshould be considered in such an unusual circumstance. There is some evidence that anaphylactoid reactions to venom occur in a substantial number of patients with masto-cytosis or urticaria pigmentosa having relatively high consti-tutive levels of serum tryptase. 189,190Also, as discussed under Summary Statement 17, skin test results to inhalants andfoods may rarely be negative despite positive end organchallenge test results. Repetitive ( /H113502) intracutaneous penicil- lin testing may sensitize a small number of individuals topenicillin. 191Six of 239 (2.5%) volunteers who were skin tested to penicillin on 2 occasions converted to a positive skintest result. Intracutaneous tests often do not correlate wellwith serum specific IgE levels. One possible explanation forthis disparity was a recent study in which binding of allergenspecific IgE antibodies to the /H9251chain of Fc /H9255I receptor was suboptimal and did not correlate with either intracutaneoustests or specific basophil sensitivity. 186,192 Safety Summary Statement 34. Immediate systemic reactions are more common with intracutaneous tests; 6 fatalities werereported in a recent retrospective survey. (C) Summary Statement 35. Prescreening with prick/puncture tests is a practical way to avoid life-threatening reactions tointracutaneous tests. (C) Summary Statement 36. If prick/puncture prescreening is not used, preliminary serial threshold titrations should beconsidered, starting at high dilutions (10 /H110025to 10/H110028g/mL [wt/vol]). This is of particular importance if exquisite sensi-tivity (eg, anaphylaxis to foods and drugs) is suspected. (D) Although adverse events occurring after intracutaneous tests are rare, they can occur. 193,194Large local reactions, both immediate and late, may cause discomfort and occasionallymild, nonprogressive systemic reactions may be associatedwith the latter. Immediate systemic reactions are more com-mon with intracutaneous tests because larger volumes areinjected. Six fatalities attributed to intracutaneous skin testswere reported by the Committee on Allergen Standardizationof the AAAAI. 195Five of these patients had asthma and were tested without preceding prick/puncture tests. No fatalitieswere associated with intracutaneous testing in the most recent12-year survey of fatal reactions from 1990 to 2001. 147 To reduce the likelihood of adverse reactions during skin testing, several precautions may be taken. Prescreening withprick/puncture test is a practical way to avert an untowardnumber of adverse local and/or systemic responses in routineskin testing of patients. If prick/puncture tests are not per-formed routinely, preliminary threshold intracutaneous test-ing should be considered, beginning at higher dilutions (ie,10 /H110025to 10/H110028g/mL [wt/vol]). Even greater precautions should be observed if patients are suspected of having exquisitesensitivity, such as anaphylaxis, to certain foods and drugs. Insuch cases, even prick/puncture tests should be initiated with several serial 10-fold dilutions of the usual test concentration.Patients receiving /H9252-adrenergic blocking agents and mono- amine oxidase inhibitors may present special risk-benefitproblems. If a systemic reaction should occur, epinephrinemay not be totally effective in patients taking /H9252-blockers, and epinephrine may adversely affect patients taking monoamineoxidase inhibitors. 59 Late-Phase Cutaneous Reactions Definition and description Summary Statement 37. The late-phase cutaneous response is a continuation of either prick/puncture or intracutaneous test-ing, generally the latter, and is characterized by erythema,induration or edema, and dysesthesia. (B) The late-phase cutaneous reaction develops progressively at sites of immediate wheal-and-flare reactions and is char-acterized by erythema, induration or edema, dysesthe-sia. pres- ence of edema, mixed cellular infiltrates, and sometimesfibrin deposition scattered throughout the dermis without thedeposition of complement, IgG, IgA, IgM, or vascular dam-age. Less frequently, the late-phase cutaneous response mayoccur in the absence of an immediate skin test response andmay be confused with cell-mediated, delayed hypersensitiv-ity. 202,203Isolated late cutaneous reactions were observed in approximately 36% of children undergoing skin tests forsuspected allergies. Most of these isolated late-phase cutane-ous responses were due to inhalant allergens, such as cock-roach and various mold spores. 204The clinical significance of this is as yet unknown. Causes Summary Statement 38. The late-phase cutaneous response may occur after both immune and nonimmune activation.Many allergens have been implicated. (B) Late-phase cutaneous after both immune and nonimmune (eg, 48/80, kallikrein) mast cell activation.Agents stimulating immunologic mast cellsthat have induced the late-phase cutaneous response includeanti-IgE antibodies and the following (molds, pollens, danders, mites, and enzymes),penicillin, heparin, insulin, and possibly some foods. 205,206 The propensity to develop the late-phase cutaneous responsemay be dependent on the type of antigen, host sensitivity, andthe concentration of injected antigen or allergen. 207 Reading the test results Summary Statement 39. The late-phase cutaneous response should be read between the 6th and 12th hours after the skintests are applied; measurements of mean diameter and/or areaof induration or edema should be recorded. (B) After challenge with diverse stimuli causing immediate wheal-and-flare responses, the intensity of the late-phasecutaneous response increases rapidly (doubling or tripling insize) during the first 2 hours. 198-201,208The response plateaus between the 6th and 12th hours, is present at 24 hours, and VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S25usually disappears by 48 hours after challenge. Accordingly, these reactions should be quantified between the 6th and 12thhours (most commonly at the 6th or 8th hour) by measure-ments of mean diameter and/or area of induration or edema. Although the minimum size of induration or erythema of the late-phase cutaneous response has not yet been standard-ized, the extent of these measurements should be compareddirectly with previously applied diluent or histamine sites,which typically demonstrate neither induration nor erythema 6 to 8 hours later. 197,207One investigator suggests a minimum of 5 mm of induration and/or erythema be considered.204The late-phase cutaneous response is in part mediated by antigen-specific major histocompatibility complex restricted T cells,which in the past were thought to be prototypic of tuberculin-induced delayed-type hypersensitivity. However, it has beendemonstrated that characteristic features andthe occurrence of isolated cutaneous response afterimmunization with T-cell-specific small overlapping aller-genic (eg, from Fel d 1) peptides can distinguish between alate-phase cutaneous response and delayed-type hypersensi-tivity. 202,209Immunochemical histologic analysis at various stages of the inflammatory milieu of a late-phase cutaneousresponse reveals a diversity of cells, including macrophages,eosinophils, neutrophils, tryptase positive mast cells, Lang-erhans cells, and, interestingly, large numbers of ba-sophils. 210,211T cells are also present and the late-phase cu- taneous response is thought to be partially dependent onthem, possibly through effects of cytokines, particularly IL-4,IL-5, and IL-10. and after allergen-induced late-phase cu-taneous response. 215,216Not surprisingly, a variety of other mediators and proinflammatory cytokines have also beendescribed in association with the late-phase cutaneous re-sponse. 217-219 Clinical relevance Summary Statement 40. Although the clinical relevance of late-phase cutaneous response is not as yet fully established,several randomized, controlled studies suggest that reductionin sizes of late-phase cutaneous response may parallel clinicalresponse to immunotherapy. (B) Although the clinical relevance of late-phase cutaneous response cannot yet be delineated with certainty, there hasbeen preliminary progress about some potential clinical ap-plications. At least 4 randomized, controlled clinical trials ofimmunotherapy in patients with allergic rhinitis have shownmarked reductions in late-phase cutaneous response in pa-tients who experience successful reduction of clinical symp-toms. 212,220-222Furthermore, reduction in size of the late-phase cutaneous response was also associated with recruitment ofCD4 /H11001CD25/H11001regulatory T cells and CD4/H11001interferon- /H9253/H11001TH1 late-phase cutaneous re-sponse in cat-allergic subjects. 223It has been that patients with atopic dermatitis may be classified phenotypi-cally into either positive or negative late-phase cutaneousresponse reactors. 208Atopic dermatitis patients with signifi- cant late-phase cutaneous response reactions were morelikely to demonstrate higher levels of IL-5 and specific IgE tohouse dust mite antigens. 214,224Of related interest was a study in which birch pollen-sensitive patients with atopic dermati-tis and isolated late eczematous reactions to birch pollen-related foods demonstrated up-regulation of specific T cellsin biopsy specimens of delayed skin lesions. 225Recently, there have been numerous anecdotal case reports that suggestdelayed-type intracutaneous tests are useful for the diagnosisof various drug including nonimmediate these delayed intracutaneous tests were not inter-preted within the 6- to 12-hour range of the late-phase cuta-neous reaction, so it is not clear whether such repre-sents cell-mediated hypersensitivity reactions or variants ofthe late-phase cutaneous response. Further research is neededto clarify this issue. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive indices None of these indices are available for late-phase cutaneous response because there are too few clinical trials to provide apractical basis for determining sensitivity, specificity, pre-dictability, or likelihood ratios. Safety Summary Statement 41 . The same principles that pertain to safety of skin tests apply to late-phase cutaneous responses.(C) The same principles that pertain to safety of prick and intracutaneous tests used to detect immediate hypersensitivityapply to late-phase cutaneous responses. Possible severe im-mediate reactions would only occur during the initial imme-diate phase and not during the late-phase cutaneous response-evolving reaction in the 6- to 12-hour period after application of the test. However, systemic reactions that occur during thereading period of intracutaneous testing could possibly persistor worsen and present a clinical problem if the mediatorrelease was intense enough. This could occur at the same timeas the late-phase cutaneous response might be expected topeak. In both safety surveys previously discussed, no evi-dence of life-threatening events or fatalities to late-phasecutaneous responses has been reported. Antihistamines mayoffer symptomatic relief for persistent erythema and pruritus,presumably due to histamine newly released from previouslyunstimulated mast cells recruited to the lesion. Inhibitors of the late-phase cutaneous response Summary Statement 42. Preadministration of drugs, such as calcineurin inhibitors, misoprostol, prednisone, and azelas-tine, before application of skin tests partially or completelyinhibit the late-phase cutaneous response. (B) Preadministration of calcineurin and azelastine inhib- S26 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYitors.231-234However, none of these agents has been proven to be inhibitory once late-phase cutaneous response is fullyestablished. Number of Skin Tests Summary Statement 43. The number of skin tests and the allergens selected for skin testing should be determined basedon the patient's age, history, environment and living condi-tions (eg, region of the country), occupation, and activities.Routine use of large numbers of skin tests or routine annual tests without a definite clinical indication are clearly notjustified. (D) Although recommending a standard panel of skin tests that would encompass all possible clinical situations in NorthAmerica may prove to be unattainable, expert consensuspanels have ventured opinions with the expectation that rel-ative consistency of skin testing, including number of tests, isa desirable goal for both clinical practice and research. 235,236 These opinions are based on current principles regardingconstitutive allergenicity, cross-allergenicity, aerobiologicmonitoring, and correlation with organ challenge testing orsupervised natural exposure (ie, a park study or environmen-tal exposure unit). Wherever possible, evidence-basedsources should be used to determine whether specific allergentests based on pretest probability are likely to confirm asuspected clinical diagnosis. Special clinical situations and exposures must be consid- ered in selecting skin test reagents. Prick/puncture or intra-cutaneous skin tests are important for diagnosis of inhalantallergy. Some clinicians prefer to initially screen with prick/puncture followed by intracutaneous tests if the results of theformer are negative, whereas others exclusively use intracu-taneous tests. Initial prick/puncture screening followed byend point intracutaneous serial titration is an accepted regi-men for evaluation of Hymenoptera and several clinical drug sensitivities. Only prick/puncture tests should be performedto define food sensitivity. Each of these situations involvesspecial approaches, which will be addressed in the followingdiscussion. Restricted allergen panels may be adequate for epidemio- logic cross-sectional or prospective population studies. 236,237 Similarly, baseline atopic phenotype, as determined by se-lected skin test allergen panels, is a necessary prerequisite forevaluation of genetic or environmental interactions. For in-dividual patient evaluations, a larger number of skin tests isusually necessary in the rational planning of avoidance mea-sures and immunotherapy if that should be required. Although recognizing that the history may be a relatively insensitive predictor of clinical sensitivity in some situations,certain historical features serve as important pretest probabil-ity guides to the numerical extent of skin tests. Generally,fewer prick/puncture tests need to be performed in infants andvery young children ( /H110212 years of age) because these children are not likely to be sensitized to as many allergens as olderchildren and adults. In toddlers, sensitization is more apt toreflect intense and prolonged exposure to allergens encoun-tered earliest in life, such as foods, house dust mites, indoor molds, and animal danders rather than pollen. If inhalation allergy is narrowly confined to a single season (eg, ragweed in North America or birch in European northerncountries), a limited number of relevant skin tests wouldsuffice for confirmation of the clinical diagnosis and testingto irrelevant inhalant and food allergens would be inappro-priate. By contrast, perennial symptoms would require a moreextended skin test panel of both indigenous outdoor andindoor inhalants but not foods unless a history of food allergyhappened to be a concurrent problem of the patient. Occupationally related clinical allergy (eg, latex, food in- halants, chemicals) is a special circumstance for which lim-ited skin test reagents would be satisfactory. Similarly, skintests for a few drugs that cause anaphylaxis (eg, penicillin,succinylcholine analogs) reliably predict life-threatening ana-phylactic reactions. A history of anaphylactic reactions toinsect venom stings requires skin test confirmation. There are6 commercially available skin test preparations for stingingand biting insects (eg, honey bee, wasp, yellow jacket, yellowfaced hornet, white faced hornet, and imported fire ant). The most controversial aspect of defining a standardized skin test panel relates to inhalant allergens. Of these, there isgeneral agreement that significant indoor allergens such ashouse dust epidermals (cat, dog, feathers), should be tested inpatients with perennial respiratory symptoms. Pollens mayalso be found indoors when windows are kept open. 238The geographic variability of airborne-pollinating plants through-out the floristic zones of the world, particularly in NorthAmerica, raises a cogent concern about how to select thenumber of skin tests and treatment reagents for this class ofallergens. Certain key botanical and aerobiologic considerations are applicable to the selection process. First and foremost, all 5 ofthe postulates regarding clinically significant pollen allergensoriginally proposed by Thommen should be satisfied: (1)constitutive allergenicity of the pollen, as determined bysymptoms occurring during its exposure in addition to thepresence of a positive skin test result; (2) the pollen isanemophilous; (3) the pollen is produced in sufficiently largequantities; (4) the pollen is sufficiently buoyant to be carriedconsiderable distances; and (5) the plant producing the pollenis widely and abundantly distributed. 239Thus, pollen of water and insect pollinated plants are automatically eliminated fromfurther consideration. This applies to such plants as golden-rod, daisy, sunflower, dahlia, and rhododendron. Althoughpine pollen satisfies postulates 2 to 5, it is not a clinicallyimportant allergen because its constitutive allergenicity isweak. A cardinal principle of Thommen's postulates is thatskin test reactivity alone does not define clinical sensitivity.Skin test positivity must be combined with observable symp-toms, increased symptom scores or physical signs during aknown pollen season, controlled laboratory, or environmentalexposure unit challenges. 240,241Pollen quantitative sampling VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S27by Burkard traps, Hirst traps, Rotorods, or personal sampling must be sufficiently high to fulfill the other Thommen pos-tulates. Annual pollen sampling data in various regions of thecountry are available at the National Allergy Bureau web site(www.aaaai.org). Aerobiologic variability also affects pollen distribution. Masting, the simultaneous production of large numbers ofpollens by a plant population, is a common feature amongtrees in temperate forests. 242Allergenicity is enhanced with higher daily mean temperatures.243Successive wetting and drying cycles release not only pollen but also very smallcytoplasmic fragments (30 nm to 4 /H9262m) that retain allergenic activity.244,245The latter are detected by immunostaining of personal cascade impactors.244-246Pollen distribution also varies with altitude.247,248 The difference between cosensitization and cross-sensiti- zation is often misunderstood in the selection of relevant skintest and extract reagents. The Allergome database revealedthat pollen allergens can be classified 249-254Thus, the relevant allergen profile of ash shares epitopes with pollen allergens not only from other tree pol-lens but also from grass and weed pollen species. 255Similarly, pollen allergy to white birch, a member of the order Fagales,can be found in birch-free geographic areas that have othernon-birch tree species of the Fagales order. 256This is partic- ularly germane to the decision about number of tests becauseit demonstrates clearly that skin test reactivity alone cannotdecide the clinical significance of an allergen. A high per-centage of reactions to the ornamental black locust in polli-nosis patients is ascribed to cross-sensitization to panaller-gens in other common pollens. 257This is termed an allergy mirage .257Cross-sensitivity to pollen profilins has been part due causedby has also been reported invenom sensitization. 130,260These recent demonstrations of ex- tensive cross-sensitivity among all pollens must be criticallyreviewed either when selecting a skin test panel or wheninterpreting the results. The reported prevalence of outdoor airborne fungi depends on sampling technique (viable vs nonviable; bioaerosol vssurface) and the collecting device. 261-266Viable cultures also vary depending on media and duration of culture. In general,Cladosporium andAlternaria species are predominant in the summer months. Indoor mold sampling almost always detects species of Aspergillus andPenicillium . 267,268Recent molecu- lar cloning identify manyBasidiomycetes and Ascomycetes . 269Although many other species have been identified, their comparative significance isdifficult to ascertain. Cross-allergenicity among major classes of airborne fungi has not been well delineated. These facts about cross-allergenicity are particularly ger- mane to formulation of treatment extracts for a particularfloristic region, which should reflect the validity of aerobio-logic sampling, the constitutive allergenicity of pollens, asevaluated by direct skin, exposure, and/or challenge tests, andhow well positive test results correlate with the patient'sclinical symptoms. Other factors that may need to be incor-porated into the final formulation decision include unex-pected allergen exposure because of frequent travel to otherfloristic zones and commercial availability of appropriateallergen extracts. Food prick and puncture skin tests are excellent diagnostic modalities for the diagnosis of IgE-mediated and oralallergy The last is often associated with cross-sensitivity to panallergens in pollens. 270In many instances, the history suggests appropriate allergen testing; in othersituations, a preliminary diet history and diaries provide ad-ditional clues. At times, reconstruction of a suspected etio-logic meal may direct suspicion to specific food componentsin that meal. Relatively few foods account for most IgE-mediated allergic reactions in both children and adults. Themore common food allergens in infants and young childrenare cow's milk, hen's egg, peanuts, tree nuts, soybeans, andwheat, whereas the adult counterparts are peanuts, tree nuts,fish, crustaceans, mollusks, fruits, and vegetables. Commer-cial fruit and vegetable extracts rapidly lose potency so manyclinicians either prepare fresh extracts of these classes offoods or test by the prick-prick method. This method ispreferred to detect strain differences in fruit allergens (eg,apple). 126Because of many false-positive test results and potential risks, intracutaneous tests to foods are not recom-mended. Food tests are inappropriate for investigation ofchronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) or angioedema. The scope and number of skin tests for allergy diagnosis reflect the clinician's scientific knowledge and clinical expe-rience. The choice and number of test allergens should becontinuously refined in accord with scientific advances, bo-tanic and aerobiologic surveys, demographic trends, andavailability of relevant, defined reagents. Practice must bedirected to the best documented concepts of allergen preva-lence, geographic distribution, and immunochemical relation-ships. Although no prospective studies provide direct evidence for these issues, the literature concerning clinically relevantallergens suggests a rationale and evidence-based process fordetermining the number of skin test reagents. This issue hadreceived serious consideration by the Joint Task Force onPractice Parameters in conjunction with expert consultantsduring the preparation of Allergen Immunotherapy: A Prac-tice Parameter, at which time the Joint Task Force suggesteda core panel of indoor and outdoor inhalant allergens. Thislist includes representative species of the major classes of S28 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYtrees, grasses, and weeds, commonly sampled species of the Deuteromycetes fungal class, and a group of well-recognized indoor allergens. After full consideration of the previously discussed vari- ables and confounders that may affect clinical sensitization toinhalants, the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters con-cludes the number of skin tests (eg, /H1134970 prick/puncture intracutaneous tests) for inhalant allergens, as published inthe Practice Parameters on Allergy Diagnostic Testing in1995, is justified as an initial diagnostic evaluation. However,routine annual tests without a definite clinical indication areclearly not indicated. Based on recent extensive food allergy research reviewed in Food Allergy: A Practice Parameter, relatively few foodsare responsible for most clinical food allergy suggested by thepatient's history and pretest probability. However, this gen-erality does not exclude the possibility that larger numbers oftests may be required in certain disease states in whichmultiple or hidden food allergy is possible (eg, eosinophilicesophagitis; anaphylactic reactions after a restaurant meal;food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis) or for evalu-ating the potential that allergy to additional allergenic foodsmay exist or occur once a diagnosis of food allergy is con-firmed to be likely. Tests for venom and drug sensitivities arenot included in this calculation because these tests are per-formed only in patients with a strongly suggestive history ofanaphylaxis and not routinely in patients who present withinhalant or food allergy. Exceptions to these recommendations may occur based on causal factors suggested by the patient's history. Additionaltest allergens may be required for exposures to occupationalallergens, in patients with unusual hobbies or personal con-tact with less common pets (eg, rodents) or livestock. In somecases, the history may be misleading. For example, somepatients with predominantly seasonal symptoms and an in-definite history after exposure to house dust may exhibitpositive skin test results to house dust mites, subsequentavoidance of which may decrease both seasonal and nonsea-sonal symptoms. From time to time, patients may present with symptoms caused by previously unidentified substances that potentiallyare new allergens. There is a role for testing such patientswith properly prepared extracts of a new allergen. There isinsufficient evidence, however, to justify tests for nonprovenagents, such as newsprint, sugar, cornstarch, orris root, to-bacco smoke, cotton, formaldehyde, and smog. If a patient presents with idiopathic anaphylaxis, up to 30 screening prick/puncture tests have been reported to identifycausal foods in a small percentage of such patients. 271A subsequent overview of this study questioned whether thediagnostic yield of such a strategy was worthwhile. 272Nev- ertheless, in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected anaphy-laxis, it would be prudent to distribute the total number ofscreening tests over several clinic visits to avoid the possi-bility of severe anaphylaxis if multiple reactions occurred.Apart from the exceptions noted herein, the consensus of the Joint Task Force is that it is rarely necessary to exceed thenumber of tests cited in the previously published statement. ORGAN CHALLENGE TESTS Introduction Summary Statement 44. Respiratory challenge tests are used when an objective gold standard for establishing clinicalsensitivity is indicated. (B) Historically, provocation challenge tests with inhalant al- lergens have been used to clarify the role of allergens inspecific organs. They may occasionally facilitate or confirmthe diagnosis of clinical sensitivity when the history is sug-gestive but skin and/or specific IgE test results are nega-tive. 133-138,145,185,188If negative, a nonallergic trigger is likely. They also are used to evaluate response to therapy, eitherpharmacologic or immunologic. 273In general, these tests re- quire cooperative patients with respect to both age and mentalstatus. The site of specific organ challenge is history depen-dent (ie, conjunctival, nasal, bronchial, supervised insect stings). 189,274,275These tests are often the tools of research protocols that require anobjective gold standard for establishing clinical sensitivity.They are often required to substantiate clinical sensitivity ofoccupationally induced diseases after cutaneous and respira-tory exposure to proven and possible new workplace aller-gens. 276Since occupational exposures may occur via fluids, aerosols, vapors, or dust, special exposure apparatuses forsuch tests are necessary and may only be available in tertiarymedical centers. New techniques for assessing local andsystemic inflammatory biomarkers are emerging as usefulclinical diagnostic adjuncts for both immediate and delayedhypersensitivity diseases. In this regard, components of ex-ternal secretions (ie, tears, nasal lavage, induced sputum,BAL), exhaled nitric oxide, and breath condensates are cur-rently being used independently or in conjunction with chal-lenge regimens. Conjunctival Challenge Summary Statement 45. Conjunctival challenge tests are usu- ally conducted for suspected localized eye allergy but in somecases they may also be helpful in investigating nasal allergy.(B) Summary Statement 46. Conjunctival challenge tests are evaluated by symptoms of itching and objective indices,including tear volume, amount of mucus, and palpebral orbulbar erythema. (B) Although conjunctival tests are used primarily for sus- pected localized eye allergy, some clinicians also considerthem to be confirmatory for nasal allergy. 274,277,278The inferior conjunctival is a point where the inferior palpebral andbulbar conjunctivae meet and is the most convenient area toapply either dry or fluid challenge allergens. 279,280Dry mate- rials may be placed directly with an applicator (eg, tooth-pick), whereas fluid materials may be applied with an eyedropper, with a pipette, or through a high-water-content con- VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S29tact lens. For solutions, a starting concentration is usually 3- to 4-log fold less than prick/puncture allergen concentrations(ie, 1:10 [wt/vol]). If test results are negative at these dilu-tions, serial log fold increasing concentrations are tested up toa final concentration of 1:1,000 (wt/vol). Before beginningthe challenge, placebo tests (isotonic sodium chloride solu-tion or an inert, nonirritant dust particle) are applied to theopposite eye. Subjective and objective responses can be mea-sured before and 5, 10, and 15 minutes after the challenge. Subjective symptom scores for erythema, edema, and sensa-tion may be obtained for the subject. These 3 features areusually graded on a scale of 0 to 4. Sensation (usually itching)is usually the first to occur followed by erythema and edemawithin 10 minutes of the challenge. Recording the duration ofitching may add more objectivity to this measurement. 281 Quantitative measures include tear volume, amount of mucus,palpebral and/or bulbar conjunctival hyperemia or erythema,edema, or surface sensation of itching. Objective conjunctivalchanges can be examined with slit-lamp magnification. Amore precise technique is spectroradiometry, which uses thechromaticity of light reflected from the conjunctivae to quan-tify erythema. 281Edema can be measured with the fractional millimeter reticule of the slit-lamp microscope. Measure-ments are made of the lower lid and bulbar conjunctivae. 281 Tears and secretions can be further evaluated according tocomposition and cytology (ie, inflammatory cells, mediators,cytokines, specific IgE antibodies). 282,283 Nasal Challenge Summary Statement 47. Nasal challenges provide objective evidence of clinical sensitivity when the diagnosis is in ques-tion or in situations when it is desirable to evaluate efficacyof therapeutic management. (B) Summary Statement 48 . Nasal challenge responses are evaluated by subjective symptoms and objective measure-ments of nasal airway resistance, the number of sneezes, of inflammatory mediators in nasal secre-tions. (B) Blackley first reported the effects of applying allergen in the nose as a diagnostic and research tool. 1In clinical practice today, nasal challenge testing is infrequent but may be usedas an objective test of clinical sensitivity when the diagnosisis in question or to evaluate efficacy of therapeutic manage-ment. 90,185,133-138Clinical investigators consider it to be an especially valuable technique of evaluating new therapeuticagents. 284,285 Almost any allergen may be used for a nasal challenge. Over the years, many procedures for delivering allergen havebeen used. The allergen can be applied as a dry or fluidpreparation. Dry grains of pollen and other allergens havebeen placed or inhaled directly in the nasal mucosa but can bedifficult to distribute evenly and prevent inhalation into thelower airways. 286Allergen extracts can be directly applied to the nasal mucosa with paper disks, pipettes, syringes, orspraying with an atomizer. The particles should be largeenough to permit trapping in the nose because fine particlesmay tend to go beyond the nasal passages into the lower airways and produce undesirable effects. 287,288Paper disks soaked with fluid appear to provide the most localized deliv-ery and avoid the spread of fluid droplets to other areas,especially the lower airways. 279Dose responses using nasal solutions are similar to those described for conjunctionaltests. Fluid allergen preparations can also be sprayed intra-nasally by aerosol. Spraying aerosol particles (0.1 to 0.4 mL)with an atomizer reaches a wider area of the nasal passagesand has been referred to as a whole-nose challenge. 280The diluent often used is 0.9% saline. For research purposes,pollen exposure simulating natural exposures has been con-ducted in large exposure chambers or rooms. 281 Procedure Nasal challenges should be conducted in a quiet room with temperature and humidity being recorded. The subject shouldbe allowed to accommodate to the environment for at least 30minutes before testing is started. Inasmuch as nasal conges-tion is the primary response, a baseline measurement of nasalairway resistance is first performed (eg, anterior rhi-nometry). 286,288-300This is followed by a control challenge most often with the saline diluent. If the nasal airway resis-tance increases by more than 30% from baseline, the testingis deferred. Otherwise, testing continues with increasing con-centrations of the allergen challenge material and measure-ment of nasal airway resistance or ancillary tests at regularintervals (eg, every 1 minute for the first 5 minutes, every 2minutes for the next 10 to 15 minutes, every 5 minutes iftesting is continued beyond 15 minutes). 287,288,294-297 Supplementary measurements Subjective responses may be obtained by symptom scores or visual analog scales.298,299Objective ancillary measures in- clude counting of sneezes and measurement of secretions.The volume of secretions can be measured by collecting all secretions within a specified period by suction, lavage, hand-kerchiefs, filter paper, or simply gravity drainage from thesubject's nose into a container. 290,300Nasal secretions, as well as specimens obtained by lavage, biopsies, and brushingsafter a challenge can be studied and analyzed for inflamma-tory mediators, cytokines, cells, and other components. 301-304 Nasal specific IgE may suggest local production of IgEantibody. 301 Specific Bronchial Challenge Summary Statement 49. Specific (allergic) bronchial chal- lenge provides a measure of lower airway clinical sensitivitywhen there is uncertainty or dispute. (B) Summary Statement 50. Guidelines for the performance of specific bronchial challenge include factors such as withhold-ing certain medications before the test, determining the initialallergen dose by preliminary skin or methacholine challengetesting, a beginning forced expiratory volume in 1 second(FEV 1) baseline of 70% or better, the amount or duration of exposure to allergen, measurement of FEV1at intervals after S30 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYthe exposure, careful observation for late-phase responses, comparison to a placebo-controlled challenge usually per-formed the day before the specific challenge, and, optionally,repetition of methacholine challenge 24 to 48 hours afterspecific challenge for evaluation of induced bronchial hyper-responsiveness. (B) General considerations In general, specific bronchial challenge testing is most often performed for research or when there is diagnostic uncer- tainty or dispute. 305Additionally, possible new asthma trig- gers can be investigated and confirmed with specific bron-chial challenge. Before implementation of a specificbronchial challenge, many centers elect to determine thedegree of nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness as aguide to allergen dosage and duration of allergen challenge.This is usually scheduled 1 day before specific bronchialchallenge. After baseline and control FEV 1tests are mea- sured, dose increments of methacholine or histamine areinhaled every 10 minutes and followed by FEV 1tests. The end point PC of either methacholine or histamine is extrap-olated from the respective dose response curves at the pointwhere the FEV 1decreases 20% from the control (saline) test, PC20 METH or less or PC20 HIST of 8 mg/mL or less. The precautions and preparations recommended for specific new challenges areidentical to those for nonspecific testing (eg, methacholine,histamine). 273,306Use of short-acting /H92522-agonists should be stopped 8 hours before the challenge, whereas long-acting /H92522-agonists, leukotriene antagonists, and sustained-release theophylline should be withheld 48 hours before the test. Useof inhaled cromolyn and steroids is preferably discontinued 1month before the challenge if the purpose is to identify orconfirm a specific allergenic trigger. Antihistamines shouldbe withheld for at least 72 hours. Systemic steroids inhibitmainly the late response and should be withheld for at least24 to 48 hours if the presence of a late response needs to beobserved. If medications cannot be withheld without wors-ening of symptoms and maintaining the FEV 1at 70% or more of the normal predicted value, the test should be postponedbecause symptomatic, unstable asthma may lead to false-positive results. Ideally, if testing is being performed foroccupational allergens, the subject should have been awayfrom work for at least a week or until the asthma disappears.Specific bronchial challenge should be performed only in amedically supervised setting, usually a hospital or researchfacility, with resuscitation equipment readily available in theevent of life-threatening anaphylactic or asthmatic reac-tions. 307 In the case of natural allergens (eg, pollen, molds, house dust mite), there are no clear guidelines for the initial con-centration of allergen or exposure time to be used for test-ing. 307,308Standardized (AU or BAU) or conventional (wt/vol or protein nitrogen units [PNU]) allergenic extracts can beused. A prior intracutaneous skin test SET may be performedto estimate the initial challenge dose. In general, the initial concentration can be 10 to 100-fold more concentrated thanthe concentration that produced a 2 /H11001reaction with a wheal greater than 5 mm (eg, an initial concentration of 0.05 /H9262g/mL if the SET was 0.0005 /H9262g/mL).45Exposure to ambient and particulate allergens (eg, epidermals, pollens) is a more dif-ficult procedure because the combined logistics of locale,ambient measurements and exposure time require specialattention. Preliminary nonspecific bronchial challenge resultswith methacholine or histamine (ie, PC 20METH or PC20HIST ) may be useful for planning the duration of exposure.309 Procedures Because suspected allergens or agents in the home or work- place have different physical configurations, protocols forexposing a patient during a challenge are variable, and thereare currently no standardized or universally accepted proto-cols for specific bronchial challenge testing. For solubleallergens, aerosolization is the preferred technique. The di-luent used in the allergen extract should be used as the controlaerosol at the beginning of the specific bronchial challenge.Various types of nebulizers may be used, including the De-Vilbiss jet nebulizer, Wright nebulizer, Rosenthal dosimeter,or an ultrasonic nebulizer. 310The fall in FEV1after control exposure, if any, should be less than 10% from the baseline.A greater fall indicates bronchial lability that can affect testresults, and further testing should be postponed until theunderlying asthma is stabilized. Since the early airway response usually occurs within 10 to 12 minutes after challenge, the subject is dosed with increas-ing concentrations (2- to 5-fold) of allergen every 15 to 20minutes. Pulmonary function tests are best performed 10 to15 minutes after aerosol challenge. 311A sustained fall in FEV1of 20% or more from the baseline at any time is considered a positive response, and the testing is stopped ifthis occurs. The results of the challenge can be expressed asPC 20, which is derived from a log dose-response curve. In- haled short-acting /H92522-agonists should be given to restore FEV1to within 10% of baseline. Since late-phase asthmatic responses may occur, arrangements should be made for peakflow monitoring or direct observation of such reactions,which usually appear 6 to 12 hours later. 312Several doses of systemic steroids may be required if the FEV1does not reverse after inhaled /H92522-agonist treatment of the late-phase response. Some clinicians repeat methacholine challenge 24to 48 hours after specific challenge for evaluation of inducedbronchial hyperresponsiveness. Allergen exposure units Allergen exposure units, also known as challenge chambers, enable a controlled environment where the delivery of theallergen into the atmosphere can closely approximate naturalexposure and where the concentration can be rigorously con-trolled. Such units range from a simple enclosed space to aspecially constructed chamber for precisely monitoring vari-ables such as humidity and temperature. The Vienna chal- VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S31lenge chamber was the first chamber developed for controlled allergen exposure of several subjects at one time.303Most challenge chambers are currently located only in academicmedical centers and research facilities. 313 Occupational challenge testing Summary Statement 51. Occupational challenge testing re- quires special precautions with respect to the innate toxicityof the suspected allergen and special apparatuses used tomeasure and control the quantity of challenge substances,such as potentially irritating volatile agents and dust. (B) The American Conference for Governmental Industrial Hygienists sets the threshold limit value and short-term ex-posure limit for many occupational agents. 314Ideally, these limits should not be exceeded in any specific bronchial chal-lenge testing. If possible, the level of the suspected agent ismeasured in the workplace, and this level is used to guide thedose for testing so that unrealistically high concentrations arenot inappropriately used. The duration and concentration inthe challenge are determined by the investigator based on thesubject's clinical history, airway hyperresponsiveness onprior nonspecific bronchial challenge testing, and nature ofthe test agent. If the subject has a history of a severe,immediate reaction, exposure should be shorter and moreincremental. The lower the PC 20, the greater the baseline airway hyperresponsiveness and the greater likelihood of animmediate significant reaction. A shorter or longer startingduration of exposure is used if the PC 20is 0.25 mg/mL or less or more than 0.25 mg/mL, respectively.309,315High-molecu- lar-weight allergens (eg, animal or vegetable proteins) usu-ally cause immediate reactions with an isolated early orbiphasic reaction (early and late) and can often adequately betested in 1 active challenge day. 316On the other hand, low- molecular-weight agents (eg, polyisocyanates, plicatic acid) induce non-IgE-mediated isolated incremental testing over severaldays. 317Many OA laboratories conduct follow-up nonspecific bronchial challenge tests to determine if the challenge testitself has caused an increase in bronchial hyperresponsive-ness. 316,317 In 1989, the AAAAI Subcommittee on Bronchoprovoca- tion for Occupational Asthma released the Guidelines forBronchoprovocation on the Investigation of OccupationalAsthma, which reviewed general principles for specific bron-chial challenge testing. 318The Canadian Thoracic Society has also released guidelines on the diagnosis and management ofOA. 317The nature of workplace exposure should be simulated as closely as possible. Special protocols and closed circuitapparatuses for specific types of agents, including dust andvapor challenges, have been developed in OA research cen-ters. 316,317,319 Evaluation at and away from work Summary Statement 52. A practical clinical method of assess- ing OA is prospective monitoring of the worker at and awayfrom work by serial peak expiratory flow rates (PEFRs) orFEV 1values if this can be arranged by mutual agreement of employee and employer. (B) A practical clinical method of assessing OA is prospective monitoring of the worker at and away from work if this canbe arranged with mutual agreement of employee and em-ployer. After symptomatic asthma has disappeared duringabsence from work, the worker returns to his/her job for aperiod of 1 to 2 weeks. During this time, a symptom log iskept and supervised PEFR tests 4 times a day are obtained.Similar data are collected for 1 to 2 weeks away from work.The PEFR records are plotted serially to determine changesover time. This is accomplished by visual inspection, but acomputer-based pattern recognition system having the advan-tage of complete repeatability is available. 320 Animal exposure challenges Animal exposure challenges are used primarily in research settings to determine the efficacy of medication regimens orenvironmental interventions. Exposure challenges using livecats in enclosed rooms, commonly known as cat rooms, arebeing used more frequently to evaluate medication efficacy incat-allergic patients. 321Although levels of cat (Fel d 1) anti- gens vary widely, the cat room is still considered a conve-nient and valid challenge technique that closely approximatesnatural cat exposure. Workplace challenge is a direct approach to determine animal allergy in the workplace (eg, laboratory workerswhose primary research requires exposure to mice, rats,guinea pigs, and rabbits). 322,323It is estimated that a third of laboratory animal workers have allergy to animals and a thirdof allergic workers have asthma. 324The diagnosis is often made by a suggestive history, positive skin test responses tothe relevant allergens, and PEFR monitoring inside and out-side the workplace. Although specific challenge testing is rarely necessary in the laboratory, as with other occupationalallergens specific bronchial challenge may be useful underspecial circumstances. Inflammatory Biomarkers of Upper and Lower Airway Fluids Summary Statement 53. Many inflammatory correlates can be evaluated and studied serially in respiratory and other bodyfluids, such as nasal smears or lavage, induced sputum, andBAL. These may define specific phenotypes or in some casespredict severity. (B) Respiratory fluids (in some cases blood and urine) may reflect the presence of both specific sensitivity and non-specific inflammatory events. Measurement of inflamma-tory markers is emerging as a common clinical paradigm.Noninvasive techniques, such as nasal or sputum eosino-phils, have been previously discussed. However, improvednasal lavage and induced sputum techniques have substan-tially expanded our ability to measure various inflamma-tory indices. 303,304,325-332For example, the number of cytokines chemokines may S32 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYidentify specific asthma phenotypes or differentiate asthma severity.326,332In some instances, inflammatory mediators may be serially assayed in blood and urine.333,334Various cell populations and inflammatory proteins have also beenidentified in BAL. 335-341Soluble factors can be identified by proteonomic analysis.342,343 Summary Statement 54. Exhaled nitric oxide is a noninva- sive measure of airway inflammation and is useful for mon-itoring objective responses to topically administered cortico-steroids. (B) Many recent clinical studies have demonstrated that exhaled nitric oxide is a suitable, noninvasive measure ofairway inflammation, particularly in atopic subjects. 338-348 Several reports indicate that it is as good a predictor ofasthma as nonspecific bronchoprovocation tests. 344,345,347,349 It is particularly useful for monitoring objective responsesto topically administered corticosteroids. 338A recent lon- gitudinal monitoring study lung injury and reactiveairways dysfunction syndrome after short-term chlorineexposure revealed marked reduction of exhaled nitric ox-ide during the acute toxic phase with gradual return tonormal during the next 15 months. 350This was interpreted as a reflection of acute damage to epithelial cells, whichare the chief sources of nitric oxide synthesis. Summary Statement 55. Although breath condensate anal- ysis is an evolving noninvasive method for evaluation ofasthma, results are still variable and further refinements arerequired before it can be accepted as a valid diagnosticmethod. (C) Exhaled breath condensate analysis is an evolving nonin- vasive method for evaluation of asthma. 351A number of inflammatory and oxidative stress proteins associated withasthma have been demonstrated by this method. 351-354How- ever, results in several studies were variable, indicating thatfurther sensitivity adjustments in the technique wouldbroaden its applicability. 355 Summary Statement 56. Bronchoalveolar lavage obtained through flexible bronchoscopy is useful in phenotypingasthma. The finding of lymphocytic alveolitis may suggest adiagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. (B) Flexible bronchoscopy may occasionally be necessary for differential diagnosis of nonasthmatic endobronchial obstruc-tion-induced wheezing in adults. 356-359Several indications in children include suspected tracheomalacia, persistent middlelobe syndrome, and recurrent wheeze with cough. 360-364Bron- choscopy is used primarily to obtain BAL. All inflammatorymarkers previously discussed in the induced sputum sectionmay be readily evaluated in BAL. 335-343Higher levels of immunoglobulins in BAL may indicate increased permeabil-ity of respiratory membranes. 365Bronchoalveolar lavage is routinely evaluated before and after segmental bronchialchallenge, a research procedure. 340As asthma phenotyping becomes more of a clinical reality, the cellular components ofBAL assume paramount importance in distinguishing be-tween eosinophilic and neutrophilic asthma. Atopic asthma isalso 333,339,366,367The finding of lymphocyte alveolitis with increased CD8/H11001lymphocyte counts may contribute to the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis.368-370 TESTS TO DISTINGUISH CLINICALOBSTRUCTIVE DISEASES RESEMBLING ASTHMA Cystic Fibrosis Summary Statement 57. Cystic fibrosis may not only be confused with asthma, but certain genetic variants may beassociated with increased asthma risks. (B) Patients with well-defined genetic diseases, such as cys- tic fibrosis and /H92511-antitrypsin deficiency, may require con- firmatory tests if a differential diagnosis suggests a rea-sonable suspicion. In addition, specific allelic inheritancepatterns in these patients may predict a higher risk fordeveloping asthma in addition to the underlying disease.Whenever doubt exists, a sweat chloride sample should beobtained, especially in children and young adults. Com-mercial test kits are now widely available for cystic fibro-sis mutation testing. 371A recent large population survey in Denmark revealed that 5T homozygosity or F508 del het-erozygosity of the CF transmembrane conductance regu-lator gene was associated with increased asthma risk. 372 Cytokine levels (ie, IL-8 and TNF receptor) were higher incystic fibrosis than asthma patients. 373 /H92511-Trypsin Deficiency Summary Statement 58. Although major phenotypes of /H92511-antitrypsin deficiency do not occur in asthma, recent surveys demonstrated a high prevalence of asthma inyoung ZZ homozygous /H92511-antitrypsin deficiency patients. (B) The frequent occurrence of asthma symptoms among patients with /H92511-antitrypsin deficiency led to a brisk and persistent controversy, with conflicting reports about thescientific advisability of checking for /H92511-antitrypsin defi- ciency in children and young adults.374-382For many years, the debate focused on the major phenotypes of /H92511-anti- trypsin deficiency (MM, MX, MS, MZ), but the distribu-tion of these phenotypes in asthmatic patients does notdiffer from that found in the general population. 375,378Nev- ertheless, recent surveys demonstrated a high prevalenceof asthma symptoms in young ZZ homozygous /H92511-antit- rypsin deficiency patients. Furthermore, a gene-environ-ment interaction may predispose farmers with rare pheno-types (SZ, SS, and ZZ) to develop house mite sensitizationand asthma in contrast to what is found in other youngpeople living in rural areas. 380,382Despite these inconsis- tencies, /H92511-antitrypsin deficiency tests and even phenotyping be indicated under special cir-cumstances. Mutational screening for /H92511-antitrypsin deficiency may be obtained through pro bono commercialprograms. VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S33Specific tests are available to distinguish other wheezing disorders, such as carcinoid (urine 5-hydroxyindole aceticacid) and Intracutaneous TestsTuberculin and Recall Intracutaneous Tests Summary Statement 59. Purified protein derivative (PPD) of tuberculin is the prototype antigen recall test and providesdirect evidence that hypersensitivity, as opposed to toxicity,is elicited by the antigens in Mycobacterium hominis or related mycobacterial species. (B) Summary Statement 60. The tuberculin skin test is elicited by the intracutaneous injection of 0.1 mL of standardizedPPD starting with the intermediate strength of 5 tuberculinunits. (C) Summary Statement 61. Recall antigen skin tests are used to evaluate cellular immunity in patients with infection (eg,life-threatening sepsis), cancer, pretransplantation screening,end-stage debilitating diseases, and the effect of aging. (C) Summary Statement 62. Reduced or absent recall antigen tests are termed anergy, which develops frequently in certain diseases, such as hematogenous tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, andatopic dermatitis. (C) Present applications Purified protein derivative of tuberculin is the prototype recall test antigen. 386Purified protein derivative provokes a delayed cutaneous reaction in most (but not all) immunocom-petent subjects who have had past or present infection with M hominis. This test provides direct evidence that hypersensi- tivity, as opposed to toxicity, is elicited by the antigen.Purified protein derivative-tuberculin is an ammonium sul-fate precipitate of the aqueous ultrafiltrate from abroth culture of M hominis . The skin test is elicited by the intracutaneous injection of 0.1 mL of standardized PPD. Thereaction begins within hours and reaches maximum size in 48hours. The involved skin feels firm or indurated to the touch.Erythema and edema are not necessary components of thetuberculin reaction but are usually present. 387The reaction can persist for a week or longer. Rarely, vesiculation andblistering indicative of exquisite delayed cutaneous hypersen-sitivity may occur. A positive tuberculin skin test resultidentifies prior exposure and sensitization to the tuberclebacillus and/or possible active infection. Prior cross-sensiti-zation to nonpathogenic soil or atypical mycobacteria canproduce small or modest size positive tuberculin test re-sults. 388Although earlier studies recommended that a tuber- culin skin test of more than 10 mm in diameter identifies 90%of healthy persons who have been sensitized to the tuberculebacillus, a recent study in 2,848 healthy non-BCG-vaccinatedpersons revealed that this cutoff value was valid only if theinfection prevalence in the tested population was at least10%, but it lost predictive accuracy at low infection preva-lences. Thus, in populations with lower prevalences of latenttuberculosis, a cutoff value of more than 15-mm diameter is proposed. 389-391When the skin test is applied in immunoin- competent sick patients, smaller reactions, which may beindicative of prior sensitization to M hominis, are often ob- served. 392,393One of the most important uses of the tuberculin skin tests is to evaluate successful skin conversion after BCGvaccination. 394 Delayed-type recall antigen skin tests are used to evaluate cellular immunity in patients with infection (eg, life-threat- ening sepsis), cancer, pretransplantation screening, end-stagedebilitating diseases, and the effect of aging. 395-397Recall antigen skin tests can also be used to predict survival ofpatients, to detect disease-related changes in immunity, andas a guide to therapy outcome. 398-411A recent study suggested that anergy appears to be a simple and reliable biomarker ofinflammatory activity in sarcoidosis patients. 412Impaired in vivo reactions to recall antigens occur atopic normal in vitro lymphocyte transformation respons-es. 413It is postulated that this in vivo defect in cell-mediated immunity may also impair host defense for certain infections,such as chronic Molluscum contagiosum . 414A normal delayed hypersensitivity response provides evidence of intact cell-mediated immunity and predicts the host's ability to eliminateobligate intracellular pathogens and parasites. In contrast,anergy provides evidence of impaired cellular immunityand/or absence of prior sensitization such as occurs in hema-togenous tuberculosis. Discrepancies in interphysician eval-uation of delayed-type hypersensitivity skin tests occur be-cause of the use of different antigens, variability of readingtimes, and lack of standardization of test methods. 414Despite these differences, recall antigen skin tests are in vivo corre-lates of lymphocyte- and macrophage-dependent delayed-type hypersensitivity responses and may be used to avoidcostly and more labor-intensive laboratory tests of cell-me-diated immunity. 415 Summary Statement 63. Candida albicans ,Trichophyton mentagrophytes, andTetanus toxoid, the currently are injected intracutaneously in the same wayas the PPD test. (C) Currently available recall antigens other than PPD include C albicans (Candin Allermed 7 recall antigens, mumps skin test antigen, anda number of other bacterial and fungal recall antigens, is nolonger commercially available. The standard Mantoux method for performing recall anti- gen skin tests consists of the intracutaneous injection of 0.1mL of antigen solution. The skin test is initiated with thebevel of a No. 27 gauge, 0.5-in needle directed upward andthe needle held at a 15\u00b0 to 20\u00b0 angle to the skin. The needleshould be inserted into the skin and channeled several milli-meters through the dermis. When correctly done, the skin will S34 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYdimple with slight pressure or downward movement at the tip of the needle. Injection of a 0.1-mL volume of antigen solu-tion usually provokes a transient, mild burning discomfortand a 5- to 10-mm wheal in the skin. Prior high level ofnatural exposure is the criterion used to select potentiallyuseful toxoid. the case of tuberculin tests, several disposable varieties (tine test and Heaf) are available. 416-418 Reading the test results Summary Statement 64. The size of the delayed skin test reaction is measured 48 hours after antigen challenge, and thelargest diameter of the palpable firm area that outlines theinduration response should be measured to the nearest milli-meter. (C) The size of the delayed skin test reaction is measured 48 hours after antigen challenge. The diameter of the palpablefirm area of the induration response should be estimated asthe average of orthogonal diameters measured to the nearestmillimeter. Gentle pressure with a ballpoint pen can be usedto dimple the skin and define the homogeneous area ofinduration. 419Although measurement of accompanying ery- thema was not formerly considered to be essential, recentinvestigations showed that both erythema and indurationmeasurements were equally effective for identifying tubercu-losis hypersensitivity in schoolchildren vaccinated with BCGand active tuberculosis patients. 387,394,420A reaction diameter of 2 mm or greater should be used as the threshold for aminimal but measurable reaction. The size of all measurablereactions, including immediate ones, which can occur in up to90% of normal subjects, should be recorded. 420If immediate reactions to delayed-type hypersensitivity skin tests occur,the diameters of erythema and wheal at 15 to 20minutes, the erythema, edema, and induration at 6 and 24hours, and induration at 24, 48, and 72 hours should bemeasured. Notation of changes in the skin test reactions overtime should be used to differentiate immediate, late-phasecutaneous response, and delayed-type hypersensitivity reac-tions and detect adverse ( /H1102240 mm) skin test reactions under these circumstances. Although rare, severe local reactions caninclude blisters, necrosis, scar formation, changes in pigmen-tation, local lymphadenopathy, and systemic symptoms, suchas fever. 421,422 Summary Statement 65. When a single intracutaneous an- tigen (other than PPD) is used to evaluate prior sensitizationto a potential pathogen, a reaction of 5 mm or greater maysuffice as the cutoff point for positive tests, but smallerreactions (2 to 4 mm) may be clinically important. (C) Tuberculin reagents and reading criteria have been sub- jected to extensive prospective investigations. The PPD vac-cine is available in 3 strengths (first, intermediate, and sec-ond). Widespread use of the intermediate strength of PPD (5tuberculin units) has demonstrated that reactors can be sep-arated from nonreactors by diameters of 10 mm or greater ofinduration if the prevalence of active infection in the tested population at large is 10% or more. At this level, the presenceof turgidity was associated with a higher occurrence of activetuberculosis. 423The cutoff value is 15 mm or more when there is a lower prevalence of latent tuberculosis in the generalpopulation. 424Tuberculin skin test readings up to 168 hours after application may still be reliable.425Nevertheless, the number of mitigating circumstances to be discussed under\"Limitations\" may affect the interpretation of the tuberculin skin test. Most recall antigen tests for evaluation of delayed-type hypersensitivity have not been standardized to the same ex-tent as the tuberculin skin test. However, the potency ofseveral C albicans commercial antigens has been determined by delayed-type hypersensitivity skin tests in immunocom-petent human volunteers 426(Candin package insert). A posi- tive response at 48 hours is 5-mm induration or more. Whenmultiple antigens are collectively interpreted, the identifica-tion of 2 or more reactions of 2-mm diameter or more can beaccepted as reliable evidence of intact delayed cutaneoushypersensitivity. When a single intracutaneous antigen (otherthan PPD) is used to evaluate prior sensitization to a potentialpathogen, a reaction of 5 mm or more may suffice as a cutofffor a positive test result, but smaller reactions (2 to 4 mm)should also be clinically correlated. Clinical relevance Summary Statement 66. The absence of delayed-type hyper- sensitivity to all the test antigens would suggest an anergicstate. (C) The absence of delayed-type hypersensitivity to all of the test antigens suggests an anergic state. Above and beyond thenull reactive state, differences in relative levels of delayed-type hypersensitivity in diameters and the ratio of the numberof positive to the total number of tests must be compared inan appropriately matched control population within that pop-ulation's reference range of estimated exposures to the par-ticular test antigen(s). This has not been accomplished formost nontuberculin antigens. Thus, if all test results in theanergy panel are negative, the significance of this findingimplies that 95% or more of an appropriate reference popu-lation has reacted to 2 or more of the antigens on the samerecall test panel. Apart from the tuberculin skin test, qualityperformance of this type has only been established in the caseofC albicans delayed-type hypersensitivity. 424,426The recall panel on which this criterion is based contained Varidase, atest antigen that is no longer available. Since the 3 currentlyavailable recall antigens have not been compared en bloc ina large panel of immunocompetent volunteers, anergy mayonly be inferred if all 3 tested antigens are negative. Never-theless, in a relatively small study of immunocompetent chil-dren ages 6 weeks to 12 years, 73% of tested to 2recall antigens ( C albicans andTetanus toxoid) had at least 1 positive response. 427 Summary Statement 67. The most important use of de- layed-type hypersensitivity skin testing is epidemiologic VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S35screening of susceptible populations exposed to bacterial and fungal pathogens. (C) Summary Statement 68. The widest application of recall antigen testing is the detection of anergy and as an in vivoclinical correlate of cell-mediated immunoincompetency. (C) Summary Statement 69. Although anergy testing was for- merly conducted frequently in HIV patients to determinewhether a concurrent negative tuberculin skin test result rulesout active tuberculosis, recent evidence mitigates against thisapproach. Recall antigen anergy in HIV patients has alsobeen investigated as an indicator of staging, progression ofdisease, and response to therapy. (C) The most important use of delayed-type hypersensitivity skin testing is to confirm exposure to many bacterial andfungal pathogens such as tuberculosis and histoplasmosisin susceptible populations. Detection of positive reactionsto these and other organisms that induce delayed-typehypersensitivity may then lead to the proper diagnosis ofactive infection (if this is present) or a state of latent orherd infection that may or may not require appropriatetherapy. 428-433The use of delayed-type hypersensitivity skin tests for diagnosis of blastomycosis and coccidiomy-cosis is no longer considered to be reliable. 434Although histoplasmin has been used for diagnosis of histoplasmosisin the past, a commercial histoplasmin reagent is no longeravailable. Although tuberculin skin testing has been usedextensively to evaluate the efficacy of BCG vaccination,recent doubts have been raised about the reliability of suchtests, either for the protective capacity of BCG or theconfounding effect of BCG vaccination in detecting activeinfection in large populations. 435,436The widest application of recall antigen testing is the detection of anergy, an invivo clinical correlate of cell-mediated immunity incom-petency. In the case of tuberculosis detection, anergy ispurported to obfuscate tuberculin skin sensitivity in ap-proximately 8% of patients with active tuberculosis, par-ticularly those patients with meningitis and miliary tuber-culosis. 397,398,437Because active tuberculosis is so common in HIV-infected individuals, anergy skin tests were oftenperformed at the same time as the tuberculin skin test todetermine whether a negative tuberculin skin test resultcould reliably rule out tuberculosis. 438However, a number of recent studies have concluded that concurrent anergy isnot a reliable way of deciding whether HIV-infected indi-viduals have active tuberculosis. 439-441Apart from the question of HIV patients being coinfected with tuberculo-sis, recall antigen anergy has been investigated in AIDS asan indicator of staging, progression of disease, and re-sponse to therapy. 442-446As alluded to in the previous section, anergy investigations have been performed in dis-eases in which delayed-type hypersensitivity immunoregu-latory mechanisms are affected. Intracutaneous tests are currently being evaluated as diag- nostic adjuncts for nonimmediate allergic reactions to variousdrugs. 175-179There is no precedent for such testing because metabolites or allergenic determinants have not yet beenfound for many of these drugs. Nevertheless, anecdotal re- ports are appearing more frequently with respect to drugssuch as lidocaine, heparins, semisynthetic heparinoids, andeven iodinated contrast media. a larger prospective study of 947 patients with cutaneous adverse drug reactions,intracutaneous tests were not useful. 228 Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictiveindices Summary Statement 70. Although the standardized PPD an- tigen has been used for many years as a predictor of active orlatent tuberculosis infection, confounders, such as susceptiblepopulations, BCG vaccination, withother atypical species, have all affected thediagnostic accuracy of the tuberculin skin test and, by extrap-olation, other delayed-type hypersensitivity tests. (C) It would appear that these indices should be readily avail- able in the case of PPD, a standardized antigen used for manyyears as a predictor of active or latent infection. However,establishing the cutoff value for mean wheal diameter oftuberculin reactions has not been universally accepted be-cause of several confounding factors. First, part of the whealdiameter may be due to cross-sensitization with atypicalmycobacterial species, and if these are strongly suspected,specific delayed-type hypersensitivity skin tests for theseantigens may need to be evaluated. 387Other situations that influence and give rise to positive tuberculin reactions areprior BCG vaccination and a delayed boosting effect in healthcare workers. 451By contrast, tuberculin skin test reactions may be either reduced or abolished if concurrent anergy exists. Thus, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive indiceswould not be applicable to large population groups unlessthese confounders could be eliminated. Standardization ofother recall antigens present in anergy panels is incomplete,in respect to the antigens themselves, the diameters of whealand induration reactions, and the extent of exposure of testpopulations to various antigens in the panel with the possibleexception of C albicans . Limitations Summary Statement 71 . The gross appearance of a late-phase cutaneous response and delayed-type hypersensitivity reac-tions may not be completely distinguishable except that thelatter are more characterized by prolonged induration. (B) Summary Statement 72. Although systemic corticosteroids will render delayed-type hypersensitivity skin tests uninter-pretable, 28 days of treatment with high-dose inhaled fluti-casone (220 /H9262g, 2 puffs twice a day) did not suppress de- layed-type hypersensitivity to PPD in healthy volunteers. (B) Summary Statement 73. Neither anergy nor tuberculin test- ing obviates the need for microbiologic evaluation when thereis a suspicion of active tuberculosis or fungal infections. (F) Summary Statement 74. Several new in vitro assays (ie, interferon- /H9253and polymerase chain reaction) appear to be more reliable in predicting active tuberculosis in BCG-vac- S36 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYcinated persons or when cross-sensitivity to atypical myco- bacteria may coexist. (C) The gross appearance of late-phase cutaneous and delayed- type hypersensitivity reactions may not be completely distin-guishable except that the latter reactions are more character-ized by prolonged induration. If this should occur withantigens that both IgE-mediated- and delayed-type hypersensitivity skin test results uninter-pretable. 456Interestingly, 28 days of treatment with high-dose inhaled fluticasone (220 /H9262g, 2 puffs twice a day) did not suppress delayed-type hypersensitivity to PPD in healthyvolunteers. 557The validity of anergy testing as a guide to interpretation of tuberculin skin testing has been questionedby many experts. 458Neither anergy testing nor tuberculin testing obviates the need for microbiologic evaluation whenthere is a suspicion of active tuberculosis infection. In recentyears, reliability of delayed-type hypersensitivity skin testshave been compared with polymerase chain reaction assaysand a whole-blood interferon- /H9253assay based on stimulation with M hominis -specific antigens. Thus far, these studies appear to be more reliable in predicting active tuberculosis inBCG-vaccinated individuals and situations where cross-sen-sitivity to atypical mycobacteria may coexist. 459-464The Cen- ters for Disease Control and Prevention has recommendedthat of the recently FDA-approved interferon- Australia),replace the tuberculin skin test. 465 Safety Summary Statement 75. Immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported after tuberculinskin tests. (D) Immediate hypersensitivity reactions after tuberculin skin testing have occurred. Within an 11-year period from1989 to 2000, there were 24 reports that were classified asserious. 421,422Of these, 9 are identified as being due to anaphylaxis. There were no deaths in this group. Otherreactions included paresthesias, seizures, chest pain, syn-cope, Guillain-Barre \u00b4 syndrome, and vasovagal reaction. In 1% to 2% of positive test results, blistering or even localnecrosis may occur, but this is usually self-limited. Localreactions such as regional lymphangitis and adenitis mayalso occur on rare occasions. There is 1 reported case ofacute transverse myelitis associated with tuberculin skintesting. 466 Hypersensitivity Tests Summary Statement 76. The number of skin tests for delayed, cell-mediated hypersensitivity reactions is relatively limited.(C) As previously discussed, delayed hypersensitivity skin testing is now limited to tuberculin testing and anergy testingis available for 3 recall antigens ( Candida, Trichophyton, and Tetanus toxoid).Epicutaneous Tests History and background Summary Statement 77. First introduced by Jadassohn in 1896, the epicutaneous patch test has evolved as the defini-tive diagnostic technique for the diagnosis of ACD. (A) The patch test was introduced by Jadassohn in 1896 as the definitive method for verifying the presence of ACD. 467A small area of skin was covered with a semiocclusive bandagethat contained the reputed causative agent. A positive testresult was declared when the clinical disease state was repro-duced. Procedures for performing this deceptively simple testhave evolved to provide adequate, nonirritating controlledexposure to a defined amount of substance in a nonsensitizingand nonsensitizer-containing patch test system. Patch Tests Present applications Summary Statement 78. When clinical evaluations suggest that exposure to a specific contactant has occurred either in anoccupational or nonoccupational clinical setting, patch testingcan be used to confirm the diagnosis. (C) Summary Statement 79. From a public health perspective, patch testing is useful to identify potential health hazards ofunknown and newly introduced contact allergens for themedical community and industrial hygienists. (C) Patch testing is used to determine the causative agent in any chronic eczematous dermatitis if underlying or secondaryACD is suspected. Dermatitis of the hands, feet, lips, ano-genital region, and multiple areas of the body is a clinicalsituation in which patch testing is useful. Additional indica-tions include chronic occupational dermatitis to differentiateICD and also when a change of job is being considered.Contact dermatitis due to topical medications may be super-imposed on all dermatologic conditions, including atopicdermatitis. When clinical evaluation suggests exposure to aspecific contactant has occurred in a clinical setting, patchtesting can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Patch testing is also used when ACD is suspected but unproved and theallergen is unknown. Patch testing may also be important toinform a patient that sensitivity to a specific substance is notpresent. For medicolegal adjudication purposes, it is essentialto include or exclude the diagnosis of ACD. From a publichealth perspective, patch testing is useful to identify potentialhealth hazards of known and newly introduced contact aller-gens for the medical community and industrial hygienist. 59 This is of particular importance considering that there aremore than 85,000 chemicals in the world environment today,and of these, more than 3,700 substances have been identifiedas contact allergens. 468,469 Technique Summary Statement 80. The most common patch test tech- niques are the individual Finn Chamber and the T.R.U.E.TEST, an FDA-approved screening method for screeningcontactant allergens. The T.R.U.E. TEST is preloaded with23 common contactants and vehicle control that have been VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S37previously incorporated into a dried-in-gel delivery system, which is coated onto a polyester backing to form a patchtemplate. (B) Summary Statement 81. If photocontact sensitivity is sus- pected, the appropriate allergens should be subjected to pho-topatch tests primarily in the UV-A range of 320 to 400 nm.(C) Aluminum is the major substrate for current patch tests because of its low allergenicity. 470The Finn Chamber is the most popular system and uses small 8-mm (inner diameter)aluminum chambers that are occlusive and permit more ac-curate quantification of the dose of allergen per unit area ofskin. Individual Finn Chambers are filled with contactantsand applied at the time of testing. The chamber is applied tothe skin and held in place by hypoallergenic tape. TheT.R.U.E. (thin layer rapid use epicutaneous) TEST is anFDA-approved method for screening contactant allergens.The T.R.U.E. TEST is preloaded with 23 common contac-tants and vehicle control that have been previously incorpo-rated into a dried-in-gel delivery system, which is coated ontoa polyester backing to form a patch template. When thetemplate is applied to the skin, the allergens are released asthe gel becomes moisturized by transepidermal water. Although many contact allergens have been identified and reported, most cases of ACD are due to relatively few sub-stances. Fewer than 40 allergens produce most cases of ACD.Identification of the actual sensitizer in a complex productcan at times be daunting. Contaminating chemicals and minoringredients may be the actual allergen(s), whereas the parentcompound or major component(s) was originally consideredto be the sensitizer. In some contactant tests, mixtures such asbalsam of Peru, a mixture of various fragrances, the precisechemical antigen is yet to be determined. In other cases, thehapten may be an altered product metabolized after contact ofthe substance to skin has occurred. The allergens formulatedin the T.R.U.E. TEST panel can be estimated to identifyapproximately 25% to 30% of clinically relevant causes ofACD. 469-471Selected panels of contactant allergen based on the patient's history may be required to supplement thescreening panel of allergens to cover as completely as pos-sible the range of exposures of the patient. 472Kits for specific occupations (eg, hairdressers, machinists) and exposures (eg,shoes, plants, photoallergens) permit identification of othersignificant contactant allergens. Each new antigen that isevaluated requires identification, validation, and determina-tion of the MEC and the zero-level irritant concentration forappropriate patch testing. Petrolatum is the most widely used vehicle for dispersion of allergens. Although it has good stability and simplicity formany antigens, some substances do not disperse well in thismedium. The quality of dispersion can be evaluated by lightmicroscopy of a test substance in petrolatum. Substancesadded to enhance antigen dispersion in petrolatum introducean additional variable into patch testing and require patch testcontrols of the additive substance in petrolatum without an-tigen. Some materials penetrate the stratum corneum to agreater degree in aqueous (hydrogel) or propylene glycol- containing vehicles and will give consistently negative resultsif tested in petrolatum (eg, NSAIDs). 473Failure to appreciate the importance of vehicle-dependent delivery of a contactallergen may lead to errors in diagnosis. Therefore, an ap-propriate vehicle control must always be used. 474Individual Finn Chambers or the T.R.U.E. TEST template en bloc areplaced on the upper or middle back areas (2.5 cm lateral to amidspinal reference point), which must be free of dermatitisand hair. If shaving is required, an electric razor is preferable. Certain contactants (eg, antibiotics, PABA) may induce (eg, carrot, celery, fen-nel, lemon-lime, grapefruit). When these are suspected, photopatch tests, primarily in the UV-A range of 320 to 400 nm,are recommended. 475-478 Reading the test results Summary Statement 82. Traditionally, patch tests remain in place for 48 hours. After the 48-hour patch test reading,additional readings at 3 to 4 days and, in some cases, 7 daysafter the original application of the patch yield the bestoverall reading reliability. (C) Summary Statement 83 . A descriptive reading scale devel- oped by 2 major international ACD research groups is thecurrent standard for interpreting patch test results. (C) Traditionally, patch tests remain in place for 48 hours. 479A 24-hour reading time has also been used, but the 48-hourpatch test reading will detect a greater number of sensitizedpersons. 480Additional reading schedules have also been rec- ommended by 2 collaborative group studies (The Interna-tional Contact Dermatitis Research Group and the NorthAmerican Contact Dermatitis Group). 481,482These large-scale investigations documented that approximately 30% of rele-vant allergens that are negative at a 48 hour reading become positive at 96 hours. 481,482If positive reactions at 48 hours disappear by 96 hours, they may be due to irritants. Readingsat 96 hours are conducted 48 hours after removal of theoriginal 48-hour occlusive patch. For weak sensitizers, a7-day reading time may be necessary. Consensus of the 2 major ACD research groups has led to the development and refinement of the currently used non-linear descriptive scale, which has been accepted almostuniversally. 483,484This reading scale is described in more detail in Contact Dermatitis: A Practice Parameter. Withsome experience in grading, most observers can replicate thescores of more experienced graders. Although novel bioengi-neered techniques (laser Doppler or reflectance measure-ments) are objective and offer the advantage of metric results,they have not supplanted the descriptive scale for routineclinical observations. 485 Clinical relevance Summary Statement 84. Although patch tests are indicated in any patient with a chronic eczematous dermatitis if ACD issuspected, patch tests are especially important in identifyingboth ICD and ACD in the occupational setting. (C) S38 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYSummary Statement 85. Other important exposures associ- ated with ACD include the use corticosteroids, plant-induced ACD, and dermatitis oc-curring after use of cosmetics and personal hygiene products.(C) Summary Statement 86. Unprotected work and repetitive exposure to surfactants may predispose patients to occupa-tional dermatitis, including ICD and ACD. (C) Summary Statement 87. Certain contactant allergens in the T.R.U.E. TEST panel, such as nickel and some rubber chem-icals, have a high degree of relevant (approximately 75%)correlation with clinical sensitivity but others do not (eg,hydroxycitronellal, thimerosal). (B) Patch testing is the gold standard for identification of a suspected contact allergen. It is indicated in any patient witha chronic, pruritic, eczematous, or lichenified dermatitis ifunderlying or secondary ACD is suspected. Patch tests areespecially important in identifying occupational dermatitis.The most common occupations associated with occupationaldermatitis (both ICD and ACD) are the health professions(especially nurses), food processors, beauticians/hairdressers,machinists, and construction workers. Medicinal-induced CDis a common cause of ACD. It is estimated that up to 5% ofpatients using topical corticosteroids may develop ACD 486-489 (see Allergic tocosmetics and personal hygiene products are common be-cause these agents are ubiquitous in today's society. At times,inert formulation excipients in commercial formulations arethe sensitizers rather than the main ingredient. Plant-inducedACD is the most common form of ACD, but patch tests forthe various varieties of culprit plants are usually not appro-priate because of their high sensitization potentials. However,open patch tests are valuable to demonstrate ACD to sesquit-erpene lactones and tuliposides in florists, bulb growers, andother workers in the bulb industry. 490 Unprotected wet work and repetitive exposure to surfac- tants may predispose patients to occupational dermatitis.Lower irritant thresholds, initially determined by dose re-sponse reactions to a common detergent (ie, sodium laurylsulfate), were associated with subsequent development ofhand ACD in a prospective study conducted in apprenticehairdressers. 491 Certain contactant allergens in the T.R.U.E. TEST panel, such as nickel and some rubber chemicals, have high clinicalrelevance (approximately 75%) to clinical sensitivity,whereas others such as thimerosal and hydroxycitronellalappear to have decreasing clinical relevance in recentyears. 492,493Correlations between initial patch test reactivity and subsequent ROATs revealed a correlation between MECof various allergens on patch testing and positive reactionsafter use testing. 494 Because sensitivity to multiple allergens in test panels such as the T.R.U.E. TEST occurs frequently, it has been proposedthat a susceptibility factor may determine the occurrence ofmultiple ACD sensitivity in patients. One recent study pro- posed a \"multiple sensitivity index\" in patients exhibitingmultiple reactions. 495For 17 allergens examined, 131,072 possible combinations were evaluated in a total of 2,881patients. A total of 12.4% of these patients had multiplepositive patch test reactions ranging from 2 to 7 allergens. Nocluster patterns were evident in patients exhibiting 3 to 7positive combinations. However, dual combinations weremost frequently observed with nickel sulfate and potassium dichromate; formaldehyde and quaternium-15; and nickelsulfate and formaldehyde. In this study, nickel sulfate onceagain was the most frequent sensitizer. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive indices Summary Statement 88. Patch tests are most effective when the patients are selected on the basis of a clear-cut clinicalsuspicion of contact allergy, and they are tested with thechemicals relevant to the problem; these conditions satisfythe prerequisites of high pretest probability. (C) Summary Statement 89. Although the diagnostic accuracy of contactants cannot be compared with other in vivo or invitro tests, diagnostic concordance between patch test sensi-tivity and the outcomes of repeated open provocation testshas been demonstrated for some contactants. (B) If patch tests are to be considered as hallmarks of the evidence-based diagnosis of ACD, the sensitivity, specificity,predictive indices, and likelihood ratios must ultimately beascertained in cohorts of patients who have ACD and controlpopulations who do not. To some extent, these data areavailable for ACD of workers in certain industries. For ex-ample, a large industrial investigation revealed significantlyhigher sensitization rates of employees in the food processingindustry compared with the total test population for nickelsulfate 17.2%, 2.1%, P/H11021 .005). 496These results were predicated on a final physician diagnosis of ACD, which integrated the history of exposureand clinical appearance of the lesions with patch test results. In lieu of a valid clinical surrogate of ACD, the clinical relevance of patch tests has been investigated by correlatingthem with repeated open provocation tests. Of necessity,these are dose response studies and must establish the MECof contactants before the onset of use testing. Of the reportedassays of this type, colophony, cinnamic aldehyde, isoeuge-nol, and methyldibromoglutaronitrile concordancebetween thresholds of patch test sensitivity and outcomes ofuse tests with these chemicals. 494,497,498On the other hand, several chemicals such as hydroxycitronellal and formalde-hyde did not show good concordance with use tests, therebyposing the question of what constitutes a suitable gold stan-dard for predictors of clinical diagnosis. Given the currentuncertainty with regard to predictors, the opinion of 1 inves-tigator that \"patch testing is cost effective only if patients areselected on the basis of a clear-cut clinical suspicion ofcontact allergy and only if patients are tested with chemicals VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S39relevant to the problem (ie, high pretest probability)\" appears to be a reasonable summation of the utility of patch tests inACD. 499 Limitations Summary Statement 90 . The chief limitation to traditional patch testing for the diagnosis of ACD is the lack of a suitablegold standard by which it can be evaluated in terms ofdiagnostic accuracy predictors and likelihood ratios. (C) Summary Statement 91 . Other technical limitations of patch tests include the inclusion of relevant contact allergens,use of the proper vehicle, application to the proper skin area,proper reading and interpretation, and the ability to correlatethe tests with the patient's specific exposure. (B) Summary Statement 92 . Other limiting factors concern reproducibility, lack of information about irritant thresholds,and minimal elicitation concentrations (MECs) for manycommon chemicals in the human environment. (C) Summary Statement 93. The inability to separate irritants from allergic responses is often encountered in the angry backsyndrome, which occurs in approximately 6% of cases and islikely to develop in patients with a longer duration of theprimary dermatitis. (C) Summary Statement 94 Negative patch test reactions may occur even when the tests are performed with the correctsensitizing materials because the test fails to duplicate theconditions under which the dermatitis developed (eg, abra-sions, frequent use of irritating soaps, washing the hands withsolvents). (C) The chief limitation to traditional patch testing for diagno- sis of ACD is the lack of a suitable gold standard by which itcan be evaluated in terms of diagnostic accuracy predictors and likelihood ratios. It itself constitutes a direct organ chal-lenge with the suspected agent, and if irritancy effects can beexcluded, it could have the same challenge significance asother double-blinded organ challenge tests. The issue is fur-ther clouded by the fact that each of the 3,700 contactantsubstances has its own unique MEC, which may vary de-pending on whether it is incorporated into petrolatum oraqueous solvents. Attempts to relate positive reactions toclinical history are not feasible because specific agents areoften not suspected by the patient. One clinical approachsuggested many years ago was to correlate the test resultswith clinical response after elimination of the patch test-positive contactant. This can be accomplished by having thepatient take a vacation, a change in the nature of his/her work,a change in the home environment, or the use of protectivegloves. Even so, this is a painstaking process and does notlend itself to prospective scientific investigations with appro-priate cohort controls. Alternatively, after symptoms andsigns of dermatitis have subsided by an elimination trial,modified use tests conducted by single- or double-blindedprotocols could serve as a challenge gold standard regimenfor specified contactants. One of these tests is the ROAT,which is described in greater detail later in this section.Technical problems of selecting relevant contact allergens using the proper vehicle, applying them to the proper skinarea, reading and interpreting them properly, and correlatingthe tests with the patient's specific exposure constitute theother limitations of patch testing. Spurious outcomes mayalso be due to the difficulty of identifying a uniform testprocedure that reliably separates irritants from allergic re-sponses. The latter problem is especially prevalent in personswith the angry back or excited skin syndrome. 500Patch test reactions are not uniformly reproducible. The greatestsources of irreproducible reactions are apparently weak 1 /H11001or /H11001//H11002reactions. The accuracy of 1 /H11001reactions has been esti- mated to be 20% to 50%, depending on the allergen andvehicle, whereas 2 /H11001and 3/H11001reactions are accurate 80% to 100% of the time. 501Data are sparse about irritancy and the MECs for many common chemicals in the human environ-ment. Danish workers, however, have established that nickel-containing objects that release no more than 0.5 /H9262g/cm2per week of nickel pose a minimal risk of sensitization andelicitation of CD to nickel, which is one of the most prevalentsensitizers. 502 The diagnostic value of patch tests hinges on reproducibil- ity. Although an earlier study found 40% of patch tests to benonreproducible, recent studies have shown excellent repro-ducibility and reliability for a test panel of 30 allergens fromdifferent commercial sources, with 97.2% concordant positive results. reproducibility also applies to the T.R.U.E. TEST.504 The interpretation of a single test result is susceptible to both interobserver and intraobserver variation. Several largestudies have compared the results of simultaneous applica-tions of several allergens tested by different patch test tech-niques and interpreted by the same observers. Both Europeanand Asian study centers revealed a 64% concordance betweenFinn Chamber and T.R.U.E. TEST patch test methods. Irri-tant or questionable reactions occurred in less than 1% of allapplied patches, but false-negative and false-positive testresults can occur with either technique. 505,506The ability to separate irritant from allergic responses is often encounteredin the angry back or excited skin syndromes. A recent pro-spective study revealed that this occurred with a frequency of6.2% and was more likely to develop in patients with a longerduration of the primary dermatitis. 507The position of contac- tants in the testing template should be considered, especiallyif cross-reacting or cosensitizing substances are tested potent sensitizing agent. 508Not infre- quently, negative reactions occur even when the tests areperformed with the correct sensitizing materials because thetest fails to duplicate the conditions under which the derma-titis developed. Abrasions of the skin, frequent use of irritat-ing soaps, washing the hands with grease solvent, and ac-companying infection of the skin are all factors that could actas cofactors for either induction or elicitation of patch testsensitivity. S40 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYSafety Summary Statement 95. Systemic ACD after patch testing is rare, as is reactivation of patch test reactions after oral inges-tion of related allergens or even by inhalation of budesonidein patients with sensitization to topical corticosteroids. (B) Summary Statement 96. It is possible to sensitize a patient who had not been previously sensitized to the allergen beingtested. This is particularly true of plant contactants, such aspoison ivy or oak and aniline dyes. (B) Systemic ACD occurring after patch testing is rare. 509,510 However, it is not uncommon for patients to experience localflares over patch test sites after peroral challenges with fra-grance-containing foods, Chinese herbs, contactant chemicals(nickel, gold), or drugs. 511-516Reactivation of patch test reac- tions caused by budesonide have also been reported afterinhalation of the same drug weeks after the positive patch testresult. 517Exaggerated local reactivities may also be encoun- tered if the concentration of the patch test substance is toostrong, thereby causing both an irritant and increased allergicreaction. There is also the possibility of sensitizing a patientwho has not previously been sensitive to the allergen beingtested. This is particularly true of plant allergens, such aspoison ivy or oak, and aniline dyes. The possibility of activesensitization can be minimized by testing with dilute concen-trations of various materials. Foods that are prone to cause ACD and also have the ability to cause systemic CD include flavoring agents (eg, oilof cinnamon, vanilla, balsam of Peru), various spices, garlic,and raw cashew nuts. 512 Modified Epicutaneous APT and RUT Summary Statement 97. Two major variants of traditional patch tests are available: the atopy patch test (ATP) andrepeated use test (RUT). (B) Present applications Two major variants of traditional patch tests are available: APTs and RUTs. Evaluation of APTs as a dermatitis has occurred chiefly in non-North American international centers. The diagnostic valueof ATPs has also been investigated in eosinophilic esophagi-tis. 528Use tests have been developed for weak sensitizers (ROAT), substances with poor percutaneous absorption (thestrip patch test), and several premarketing skin dose responseprovocation assays for determining the minimal sensitizingdose in human volunteers. Technique and reading the test results Summary Statement 98. Atopy patch tests have been evalu- ated in patients with atopic dermatitis and eosinophilic esoph-agitis as an adjunct for the diagnosis of inhalant and foodallergy. (B) Summary Statement 99. Atopy patch tests for foods are prepared with dried or desiccated foods mixed into an aque-ous solution and placed in 12 mm Finn Chambers before positioning on the patient's back. (B)Summary Statement 100. Atopy patch tests for the diagno- sis of drug allergy are performed by incorporating liquid orpowdered drugs into petrolatum or aqueous solvents, whichare added to 12-mm Finn Chambers and placed on the back.(B) Summary Statement 101. Use tests have been developed for weak sensitizers (repeated open application test [ROAT]),substances with poor percutaneous absorption (strip patchtest), and several premarketing dose response provocationtests for determining the minimal sensitizing dose of potentialcontactants in human volunteers. (B) Summary Statement 102. In the strip patch test penetration of substances is enhanced by repeated adhesive tape strippingbefore application of the contactant patch to the stripped area.(B) Summary Statement 103. The ROAT is an exaggerated use test designed to determine a patient's biologic threshold orresponse to a suspected contactant, especially if this has notbeen achieved with prior open or closed patch testing. (B) Evaluation of APTs has occurred, particularly in Eu- rope. 517-528They have been used as adjuncts for the diagnosis of inhalant and food allergy in atopic dermatitis and eosino-philic esophagitis (only in the United States) and identifica-tion of drugs that induce mixed cutaneous reactions. 528-531For identification of food allergy, on the test da y2go f dried or desiccated foods is mixed with 2 mL of an isotonic salinesolution. The mixtures are placed in 12-mm (internal diam-eter) Finn Chambers on Scanpore (Allerderm LaboratoriesInc, Petaluma, California) and placed on the patient's back.Undiluted samples of commercially prepared single-ingredi-ent foods (foods, vegetables, and meats) are placed directly inthe Finn Chambers. The patches are removed at 48 hours andthe results read at 72 hours. Patch readings are the same asclassic patch test interpretation previously discussed. Al-though 6-mm chambers might be preferable on small backs ofyoung children, the 12-mm chamber size for APTs yieldsmuch better results than the 6-mm chamber size. 532A ready- to-use food APT (Diallertest) was recently compared with aFinn Chamber APT and was found to have good sensitivityand specificity. 533However, intercenter APTs are often dif- ficult directly because of the variability of testpreparations. 526,528 For determination of possible drug allergy, drug patch tests are performed with high concentrations of the commercialform of the drug. 531It has been determined that 30% is the highest concentration possible for preparation of a homoge-nous dispersion in petrolatum, water, or alcohol. To avoidserious reactions, dilutions ranging from 1% to 10% may bepreferable for specific drugs. If a commercial tablet is used,the coating must first be removed before the substance withinthe tablet is pulverized to a very fine powder. The powder isthen incorporated into white petrolatum at a concentration of30% and also diluted at the same concentration in aqueoussolvents. Powder contained in capsules is also tested at 30%in petrolatum or solvent. The jacket portion of the capsule ismoistened and tested as is. Liquid formulations are tested VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S41both as is and diluted 30% in solvent. Various formulations are loaded onto Finn Chambers and placed on the upper back.Because some drugs can cause immediate positive reactions,drug patch test results should be read in 20 minutes. Fordelayed hypersensitivity readings, it is necessary to read thepatches at 48 and 96 hours and, if the results are negative, onday 7. 531 An open topical provocation is also used for the diagnosis of mixed cutaneous drug eruptions. One modification of theopen technique is to incorporate drug preparations into di-methyl sulfoxide, which enhances absorption. 531This method has been successful for the diagnosis of metamizol- andnaproxen-induced fixed drug eruptions. 534 The traditional patch test has been modified in other ways, depending on the purposes for which they are intended. Testchambers of various sizes are commercially available. Theseinclude 8-, 12-, and 18-mm Finn chambers and 19- and25-mm Hilltop chambers. 535For relatively weak-sensitizing substances, the larger test chambers (12-mm Finn Chamber)may be more useful for detection of ACD. 536This is also the case in which irritant testing with such substances as sodiumlauryl sulfate is required. 535-537 The strip patch test is a variant of patch testing used for substances with poor percutaneous penetration. Penetrationof substances is enhanced by repeated application of adhesivetape before applications of the contactant patch to the skin.Thus, for sequential strips, a 25-mm-diameter Blenderm sur-gical tape is vertically applied and gently pressed downwardwith the fingertips for approximately 2 seconds. The tape isthen removed in one quick movement at an angle of 45\u00b0 in thedirection of adherence. Each strip is performed with a new piece of tape on exactly the same skin area until the surfacestarts to glisten. 538The older Al-Test consists of larger alu- minum strips with Webril pads affixed by heat. These havebeen found to be more useful for retaining substances of highvolatility and leachability (eg, ethylene oxide). 539For premar- keting research purposes, several tests, including the humanrepeat insult patch test (RUT), the 4-day semiocclusive patchtest, and an occlusive patch test to the popliteal fossae for 6hours daily for 4 consecutive days, are available. 540The ROAT is an exaggerated use test designed to determine apatient's biologic threshold of response to a suspected con-tactant, especially if this had not been achieved with prioropen or closed patch testing. It is often used as a special testfor leave-on products (eg, mascara, lotions, henna tattoos)intended for use on the skin. 541The ROAT is performed by applying a suspected contactant to the antecubital fossaetwice daily up to 1 week and observing for dermatitis. 540At times, ROAT can be performed by applying the patch test tothe popliteal areas or on the back of the ear. Clinical relevance Summary Statement 104. Although clinical relevance is still evolving with regard to the APT, several investigative groupshave reported that this test may be an adjunct in detection ofspecific allergens in atopic dermatitis and eosinophilic esoph- agitis. (B) APTs are as yet not standardized, there are ongo- ing attempts to establish reliable systems for evaluation ofclinical relevance. In patients being tested for aeroallergenreactivity, allergen-specific concordance of APTs was com-pared with prick/puncture tests and Pharmacia CAP testsusing 2 different concentrations and 2 different vehicles. In alimited US investigation, optimal concordance was obtained when petrolatum was vehicle and allergen concentrationwas [more than 1,000 PNU/g. 542Reproducibility was also tested with allergens from different commercial sources. Re-producibility was 56% using the same manufacturer's ex-tracts but much less when 2 different commercial extractswere compared. 543An interesting insight into APTs was pro- vided by a recent report that compared routine histologicanalysis and in situ hybridization between involved and non-involved skin of atopic dermatitis patients who exhibitedpositive ATP results. Interestingly, a positive APT reactionrequired the presence of epidermal IgE on the surface ofCD1a /H11001cells in both clinically involved and noninvolved skin.544 Although single-center studies have disagreed about the overall reliability of APT for the diagnosis of inhalant allergyin atopic dermatitis APTs had a higher specificity(64% to 91%), depending on the allergen, than skin prick/puncture (50% to 85%) or specific IgE tests (52% to 85%).Positive APT reactions were not seen in 10 nonatopic con-trols. The conclusion of this study was that the potential foraeroallergens and food as causes of atopic dermatitis flaresmay be evaluated by APTs in addition to prick/puncture andspecific IgE tests. 530 With respect to the diagnosis of food allergy by APT in atopic dermatitis patients, several European investigativegroups show data to support that APTs may be adjunctivediagnostic methods of evaluating food allergy in atopic der-matitis patients, especially those patients having nonimmedi-ate or delayed reactions and in patients younger than 6years. 522,523In studies of eosinophilic esophagitis limited to a center in the United States, the combination of prick/puncturetests and APTs led to the discovery of causative foods in 18of 26 cases. 528However, it is unlikely that APTs will have wide applicability in North America until issues of standard-ization and reproducibility of these tests are more fully re-solved. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive indices Summary Statement 105 . The role of the atopy patch in predicting clinical allergy to food is indeterminate. (B) In contrast to traditional ACD patch tests, both negative and positive predictive indices of APTs can be determined bycorrelation with gold standard inhalation or oral food chal-lenge tests. When APTs were evaluated in 173 patients re-ceiving double-blinded, placebo-controlled food challenges, S42 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYAPT was the best single predictive test (positive predictive value of 95%); the combination of positive APT and positiveprick/puncture test results optimized the positive predictivevalue to 100%. For hen's egg allergy, the APT was also thebest single predictive test (positive predictive value of94%). 525The conclusion of this study was that the combina- tion of positive APT results with high levels of specific IgEfor cow's milk or hen's egg, respectively, makes double-blinded, placebo-controlled food challenges unnecessary forthese respective food allergies in patients with atopic derma-titis. 525A recent larger study of suspected food allergy in 437 children (90% with atopic dermatitis) revealed that APT wasmore specific than a prick/puncture or specific IgE tests butless sensitive, so that oral food challenge was only unneces-sary for 0.5% to 14% of the subjects. 526 Limitations Summary Statement 106. The lack of standardization of APTs for diagnosis of both food and drug allergy is the chieflimitation. (C) Although progress is being made, the lack of standardiza- tion is still the major limitation of APTs. As previouslydiscussed, there is also a lack of uniformity in preparingreagents, vehicles, and how the test should be read in auniform way. The diagnostic value and reliability of tests areat present restricted to several clinical entities, so it is notpossible to extrapolate to allergic conditions other than atopicdermatitis or eosinophilic esophagitis. There have been nocollaborative attempts to standardize ATPs for the diagnosisof drug allergy. Results are highly variable at present, and itis impossible to predict whether such testing will ultimatelybe generally useful in the diagnosis of cutaneous drug reac-tions. Safety Summary Statement 107. Although the purpose of APTs is to test for food and drug nonimmediate reactions, the possibility of anaphylaxis must be considered because there could besignificant percutaneous absorption of proteins and/or simplechemicals with high anaphylactogenic potential. (B) Although the chief purpose of APTs is to test for food and drug nonimmediate reactions, occurrence of anaphylaxismust be considered. The possibility that there could be sig-nificant percutaneous absorption of proteins and/or simplechemicals cannot be ignored, particularly in patients with ahistory of exquisite anaphylactic sensitivity in addition totheir nonimmediate reactions. Number of Epicutaneous Skin Tests Summary Statement 108. The appropriate number of APTs is indeterminate because they are not routinely performed. (B) Atopy patch tests are being evaluated as diagnostic ad- juncts chiefly to evaluate the role of inhalant and food aller-gens in atopic dermatitis and less often for the diagnosis ofdrug hypersensitivity. The use of APTs in the United States iscontroversial because there is no consensus about their rele-vance or number. The decision to use them is made on acase-by-case basis, but previously discussed criteria for per- forming such tests should be reevaluated periodically as theirfuture use increases in the United States. Summary Statement 109. Because ACD is frequently caused by unsuspected substances, up to 65 patch tests maybe required for diagnosis. (D) The number of patch tests is highly variable and case dependent. The only FDA-approved test device is theT.R.U.E. TEST, which consists of 23 common contactants,but it is only diagnostic in approximately 25% to 30% ofcases. Supplementary patch tests are often required as sug-gested by the patient's exposure history, and up to 65 con-tactant tests are recommended by the North American Con-tact Dermatitis Research Group. IN VITRO DIAGNOSTIC TESTS OF IMMEDIATE HYPERSENSITIVITY Measurements of IgE AntibodiesHistorical Perspective One of the most important advances in allergy research was the 1966 discovery that reaginic activity resided in a previ-ously unidentified immunoglobulin class. 545-548After consol- idation of the available data, the WHO named this class ofimmunoglobulin IgE. The availability of an IgE myelomaprovided relatively large quantities of IgE and allowed theproduction of human anti-IgE antibodies, which led to im-munoassays capable of measuring both total and allergenspecific IgE concentrations in serum and other body fluids.The first assay for allergen specific IgE was reported in 1967and was termed the RAST. 549Since its initial description and commercialization, a number of technical improvements havebeen made in assay technology, including better character-ized allergen solid phases, monoclonal antibodies, decreasedassay time, less expensive instrumentation, automation, andthe substitution of enzyme labels for radioactive labels. Morerecent, modified allergen specific IgE antibody assays arecalibrated using heterologous against WHO75/502 international reference preparation.This common calibration strategy among assay methods per-mits a uniform system of reporting IgE antibody results inquantitative kIU A/L units traceable to a common IgE stan- dard. One of the major controversies in allergy has been the comparison of immunoassays for allergen specific IgE withbiologic tests of allergic sensitivity. 186Much of the contro- versy results from failing to make a clear distinction aboutprecise questions to be answered by these studies. As is thecase with skin tests, a direct correlation cannot be assumedbetween the presence of specific IgE antibodies and clinicaldisease. Accepting the skin test as the equivalent of clinicalhypersensitivity creates problems because of factors dis-cussed in the previous section: (1) the lack of uniform pro-cedures for performing skin tests, (2) the lack of uniformcriteria for grading skin test results as positive or negative, (3)the difference among natural, purified, and recombinant test VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S43allergens, and (4) the differential sensitivity of individuals sensitized to the same allergen. In addition, there has beenlimited effort to ensure the quality of skin tests, since skintests are typically performed as a single determination, andthe skin test result may be falsely negative or positive. At-tempts have been made to resolve the question of false-positive skin test results by performing allergen challenges,but this may not always be relevant since there is generalagreement that some patients with allergen specific IgE do not respond to an allergen challenge, an inherent limitation ofthese procedures. 550This suggests that a positive skin test result does not necessarily mean clinical allergy.550Con- versely, some patients who respond to end organ allergenchallenge do not have positive specific IgE in vivo or in vitrotest results. 90,133,136,185,527,551Notwithstanding these controver- sies, there is general agreement that, for most allergens,allergen-specific immunoassays detect IgE antibody in theserum of most but not all patients who are clinically allergic.The precise sensitivity of these immunoassays compared withprick/puncture skin tests has been reported to range from lessthan 50% to greater than 90%, with the average being ap-proximately 70% to 75% for most studies. 112,13,133,185,186,552-559In most situations, skin tests are therefore the most clinically usefultests for the diagnosis of IgE-mediated sensitivity. Total Serum IgE Assays Summary Statement 110. Total serum IgE concentrations are reported in international units or nanograms per milliliter (1IU/mL /H110052.44 ng/mL). (A) Summary Statement 111. Total IgE is cross-standardized with the WHO 75/502 human reference IgE serum verified byperiodic proficiency surveys. (B) Summary Statement 112. The clinical applications of total serum IgE are of modest value. High serum IgE concentra-tions occur in allergic bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis(ABPA), the therapeutic response of which is evaluated byserial IgE values. (B) Summary Statement 113. Total serum IgE is required for assessing the suitability of a patient for omalizumab therapyand determining the initial dose. (B) The most frequently used method for measuring total IgE concentrations is a sandwich-type assay. In this assay ananti-IgE antibody bound to a solid support is used to bind allIgE from the test sample. Serum proteins other than IgE arewashed away from the support, and the IgE remaining boundto the support is quantified by means of a second, labeled,anti-IgE antibody. 59,549,560 Total serum IgE concentrations are most frequently re- ported as international units or nanograms per milliliter (1IU/mL /H110052.44 ng/mL of IgE). Although the Systeme Inter- national (SI) specifies that IgE be reported as micrograms perliter with 2 significant digits (XX /H1100310n), it is still not widely used. 561There are now a number of national and international reference preparations for total serum IgE.562-564However, the WHO 75/502 is the principal human IgE reference serumpreparation to which all clinically used total serum IgE assaysare currently cross-standardized. The availability of these IgE reference preparations has led to improved interlaboratoryconcordance of clinical total IgE assay results. For mostcommercial methods, total serum IgE determinations shouldbe accurate to 2 significant digits, and the coefficient ofvariation for repeated assays should be less than 10%. 59,564 This level of proficiency has been recently confirmed withdata from the College of American Pathologists DiagnosticAllergy External Proficiency Survey. 565The routine quality control for total serum IgE assays is primarily directed towardassessing accuracy and precision. Previous problems withinterference by other serum proteins have been largely elim-inated by the availability of commercial antibodies specificfor human IgE with high specificity and avidity. Accuracyand precision are evaluated by the inclusion of both internaland external standards in these assays. One technical problem reported with some sandwich-type immunoassays for total serum IgE has been termed the hook effect . This term describes the problem of samples with very high total IgE concentrations that produce results identical tothose of samples with much lower IgE concentrations. Ifincreasing quantities of IgE are added in an assay, thereshould be a linear rise to a plateau. In some assays, however,the plateau may begin to fall to lower levels as increasingamounts of IgE are added. To avoid this problem, somelaboratories assay samples at 2 dilutions with the expectationthat the more dilute sample will produce a quantitativelylower result. If the more dilute sample does not produce alower result, the sample needs to be rediluted and reassayeduntil it is clear that the sample is appropriately diluted. At thispoint the concentration of IgE in the unknown can be extrap-olated from the linear rising portion of the standard calibra-tion curve. Interdilutional coefficients of variation shouldremain less than 20% for an assay that maintains parallelismbetween the reference curve and dilutions of test specimens. Allergen Specific IgE Assays Summary Statement 114. As with total IgE, commercial spe- cific IgE antibody assays are calibrated using heterologousinterpolation against the WHO 75/502 human IgE referenceserum, thereby enabling a uniform system of reporting. (E) Summary Statement 115. In addition to WHO 75/502 cal- ibration, an earlier specific IgE classification system wasbased on internal positive calibration curves from a positivecontrol heterologous serum containing specific IgE antibod-ies, which in the original RAST was white birch specific.However, FDA clearance for modified specific IgE testsrequires use of homologous internal control allergic serawhenever this is possible to obtain. (E) Summary Statement 116. The precise sensitivity of these immunoassays compared with prick/puncture skin tests hasbeen reported to range from less than 50% to more than 90%,with the average being approximately 70% to 75% for moststudies; similar sensitivity ranges pertain when immunoas-says are compared with symptoms induced after natural orcontrolled organ challenge tests. (C) S44 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYSummary Statement 117. As with skin tests, the interpre- tation of specific IgE results requires correlation with thehistory, physical examination, and, in some cases, symptomsdirectly observed after natural or laboratory exposure to al-lergens. This cannot be accomplished by commercial remotepractice laboratories, which base recommendations for im-munotherapy on a history form submitted by the patient andspecific IgE results. (B) Summary Statement 118. Because the constitutive allerge- nicity, potency, and stability are variable among commercialallergen extract reagents, sensitivity and the positive predic-tive value of both prick/puncture and specific IgE tests gen-erally tend to be higher among pollens, stable anaphylacto-genic foods, house dust mite, certain epidermals, and fungicompared with venoms, drugs, and chemicals. (C) Summary Statement 119. Proper interpretation of specific IgE tests needs to take into consideration variables such as thebinding affinity or avidity of allergens, solid-phase systems,cross-reactive proteins and glycoepitopes, specific IgG anti-bodies in system, and high total serum IgE ( /H1102220,000 IU). (E) Summary Statement 120. A multiallergen (up to 15 aller- gens bound to a linear solid-phase system) test can screen foratopic status, following which allergen specific tests are re-quired for more definitive evaluation. Summary Statement 121. Specific IgE immunoassays are not recommended as a definitive confirmatory test for severalspecific clinical conditions. They provide neither diagnosticnor prognostic information when measured in the cord bloodof newborn infants. They do not have sufficient sensitivity forfoolproof prediction of anaphylactic sensitivity to venoms orpenicillins. (B) Summary Statement 122. Specific IgE immunoassays may be preferable to skin testing under special clinical conditionssuch as widespread skin disease, patients receiving skin testsuppressive therapy, uncooperative patients, or when the his-tory suggests an unusually greater risk of anaphylaxis fromskin testing. (B) Summary Statement 123. Determination of allergen speci- ficity by inhibition of specific IgE binding is a unique at-tribute of specific IgE testing. (E) Summary Statement 124. Automated systems using multi- plexed allergen assays are being rapidly developed. One ofthese is cleared by the FDA for the simultaneous measure-ment of 10 allergens. (E) Commercially available assays for allergen specific IgE are based on the principle of immunoadsorption. 557,560,562,566The allergen specific IgE of interest binds to the allergen, whichhas either been previously bound to a solid phase or becomesbound to a solid phase after the IgE has been bound. IgE thatdoes not bind to the allergen, together with other irrelevant proteins, are then washed away from the solid phase. Theamount of the IgE bound to the allergen is quantitated usinga labeled anti-human IgE (monoclonal or mixture of mono-clonal) antibodies. The label can be a radioactive isotope anenzyme, or a ligand to which an enzyme or antiligand con- jugate is bound. A number of methods have been used throughout the years to report allergen specific IgE results. 562,566-569First, a quali- tative reporting scheme was used in which assay responseproduced by the test serum was compared with the resultsobtained with sera from nonatopic individuals who are knownto be free of allergen specific IgE antibody. The mean and SDare computed for the IgE antibody-negative sera. Only testsera that produces results greater than the mean /H110062o r3S D s are called positive. The results of a test serum also can beexpressed as a ratio or a percentage of the mean of thenegative sera. In original RAST-type assays, a ratio of morethan 3 was considered positive. This qualitative ratio methodis presently used only in research IgE antibody assays and isno longer used by clinical laboratories certified by the Clin-ical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 reportingpatient data. A second method for classifying IgE antibody results has been to compare the results of a test serum to a calibrationcurve derived from a serum with a known amount of the samespecific IgE. This method is called \"homologous interpola-tion\" because the IgE antibody specificity being measured inthe test and reference serum are the same. Although a ho-mologous interpolation scheme is considered by some inves-tigators as the most attractive calibration approach, it is notused in many FDA-cleared IgE antibody clinical assays be-cause it was not always possible to find sufficient quantitiesof serum containing IgE antibody (ie, 35 to 100 serum sam-ples) from patients with relatively rare clinical allergies.However, the FDA Final Guidance for Industry documentstipulates specific provisions for using \"allergen specific con-trol sera.\" 570 The first clinically used RAST incorporated a heterologous interpolation scheme that related all allergen-specific IgEvalues to a standard curve derived from sera containing IgEanti-birch pollen. 549To provide a grading scheme, the cali- bration curve was divided into arbitrary classes from 0 to 4.In an attempt to improve the sensitivity of the RAST, themodified RAST scheme was developed. The modified scor-ing system relates the number of radioactive counts in eachunknown to class scores using a single control point (ie, 750normalized counts). 571Although the modified scoring system artificially increases diagnostic sensitivity by lowering theassay threshold, it also reduces diagnostic specificity of theassay (ie, increase of false-positive results). This limitationconstitutes a major problem for those who continue to use thissystem. 59 The major FDA-cleared semiautomated and automated assays (Table 5) for allergen-specific IgE antibody use asecond, heterologous interpolation scheme in which a totalserum IgE calibration curve is used to report results as inter-national units of IgE per milliliter. This value can be con-verted into mass units of IgE per volume (eg, nanograms ofIgE per milliliter) because the IgE calibration curve is stan-dardized against the WHO Human IgE International Refer- VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S45ence Preparation 75/502.570There are some data to indicate that 1 IU/mL of allergen specific IgE antibody is equivalentto 1 IU/mL of total serum IgE. 572However, this needs further confirmation.559,573Table 5 is a partial compilation of current commercial assays compared with the original RAST immu-noassay. Current methods now use improved matrix bindingcombined with fluoroenzymatic or chemiluminescence detec-tion systems. In addition, most of them are either semiauto-matic or completely automatic. Apart from the obvious advantage of expressing specific IgE results in mass units, as compared with the WHO humanIgE reference standard, most specific IgE classification sys-tems (both radioactive and enzymatic) are currently based oninternal positive control curves calibrated with allergen-spe-cific antisera. According to current FDA guidance regula-tions, regarding RAST-based methods, the source and stabil-ity of allergen-specific control sera should be specified. 570In addition, confirmation of allergen IgE specificity should beidentified for each allergen contained in the internal controlsera. This implies that there be a homologous internal controlpositive reference specific IgE serum (eg, test serum IgE serum).A specific IgE serum control is not ideal andcould confound or mislead results inasmuch as allergen prep-arations are mostly mixtures of proteins that can vary composition, immunogenicity, semiautomatic assay manufacturer stipulates that each laboratory should establish its own expected reference rangespresumably with homologous antisera for various sensitivepopulations (pollen, mold, or other allergen-sensitive pa-tients) of interest. 575It is not known whether all technology manufacturers address this issue. Although it is recognizedthat homologous control sera might be difficult to obtain,store, and maintain stability for many allergens, homologousspecific reference sera to 8 major inhalant, 6 major food, and4 major venom allergens could readily be incorporated intocurrently available multiarray semiautomatic or automatedsystems (Table 5). This could be readily accomplished be-cause FDA clearance for commonly available allergosorbentsonly requires a maximum of 100 specific IgE positive serumsamples.Recent advances in lasers, computational power, DNA technology, component miniaturization, and other technolog-ical advances have allowed for the development of allergenspecific IgE multiplexing. 576Multiplexing, or the quantitative measurement of specific IgEs to numerous allergens simul-taneously using array technology, is a major potential im-provement over present day monoplex methods. 577Multi- plexed arrays for the measurement of specific IgEs usesmaller sample sizes and are potentially cheaper, faster, moresensitive, and more accurate than any present day technology.Approaches to multiplexed array allergy testing have beendescribed using glass slides with microdot placement of al-lergens or allergens covalently attached to microspheres and are spectrally distinguishable(liquid suspension arrays). 578,579One such liquid suspension array assay has been FDA (510K No. K020387) for thesimultaneous measurement of specific IgEs to house dustmite, cat, timothy grass, Bermuda grass, mountain cedar,short ragweed, Alternaria (mold), milk, egg white, and wheat. Secondary antibody detector systems include chemi-luminescence and fluorescence. Amplification methods, suchas DNA rolling circle amplification, have also been de-scribed. 580 In terms of quality control, all assays for allergen specific IgE antibody should have known IgE antibody-positive andIgE antibody-negative sera run with each lot of reagents.Known positive and negative sera should be included in eachassay for each specific allergen being tested. These qualitycontrol serum data confirm the quality and validity of theassay and the accuracy of the calibration curve. Resultsgenerated by the assay should not be reported if the results ofthe positive and negative quality control sera are not within95% confidence limits for the assay. 562 An investigation comparing analytic precision and accu- racy of specific IgE assays performed by 6 different com-mercial laboratories using various methods (or modificationsthereof) listed in Table 5 was reported in 2000. 563Coded and blinded serum samples containing different levels of specificIgE antibodies to 17 allergens were picked up from physi-cians' offices by each laboratory over a span of 6 weeks.Collectively, the statistical analyses of these data revealedthat assays performed by 4 laboratories gave different resultsfor different allergens, and there were multiple instances ofpoor precision, quantitation, and accuracy. Results from 2laboratories that use the ImmunoCap system could begrouped with results expected from an ideal immunoassay. 563 These disparate results should encourage commercial labora-tories to participate in proficiency surveys and to make theresults of such surveys readily accessible to the orderingclinician. 565 Some laboratories report negative IgE antibody results for rare allergens when the laboratory has never obtained specificpositive sera, which could demonstrate that the assay is reallycapable of detecting IgE with the expected specificity. In theUnited States, commercially available allergen-containing re-agents (eg, allergosorbents) are submitted to the FDA andTable 5. Representative List of Current Commercial Specific IgE Technology Method Detected by Technique Phadebas RAST Radioimmunoassay Manual ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYgiven FDA clearance when data are supplied by the manu- facturer that has analyzed at least specific 35 to 100 IgEantibody-positive serum samples from clinically allergic in-dividuals. When serum samples from 35 different sensitizedindividuals cannot be identified in the world for a particularallergen specificity, the FDA gives the allergen-containingreagent the designation of an analyte-specific reagent (ASR),which indicates that less than 35 serum samples beenused to quality control the allergen-containing reagent. TheASR reagents are not fully FDA cleared, but they have beenquality controlled sufficiently by the manufacturer to validateallergen specificity and permit their use in clinical laboratorytesting with the caveat that they are \"for research purposesonly.\" Ideally, a total serum IgE should be performed on all serum samples that are assayed for allergen specific IgE antibody. Ifthe total serum IgE level is high (eg, 20,000 IU/mL for someassays), steps such as automatic dilution should be taken bythe laboratory to ensure that the assay results for specific IgEare true positives and not the result of nonspecific binding inthe assay. The total serum IgE level that produces a false-positive result due to nonspecific binding is presumably iden-tified by the manufacturer of all commercially available al-lergen specific IgE assays 563,566,567and should be made available to the ordering clinician. A clue to possible non-specific binding is a report of weakly positive IgE antibodyresults with multiple allergens. 581Nonspecific binding by glycoepitopes (ie, cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants)is a potential source of a positive test result without clinicalsignificance. 582-584To check this, IgE reactivity of a glyco- protein to which the patient had not been sensitized (eg,bromelain) should be tested against the patient's serum. 582 An adequate presentation of the allergen in the assay is essential for optimal sensitivity of an assay.585Assay inaccu- racies can result from a number of conditions: (1) the proteinrecognized by IgE may be a minor constituent of the totalprotein in the allergen preparation and hence it becomes aminor fraction of the protein bound to the solid phase, whichleads to insufficient protein for adequate IgE binding; (2) theprotein recognized by IgE may be labile because of either itsmolecular structure or the presence of proteolytic enzymes inthe allergen preparation; and (3) the chemical linkage used tobind the protein to the solid phase may destroy the epitoperecognized by IgE or the linkage may occur at a site so closeto the epitope that steric hindrance occurs. IgG antibody specific for allergens may occur as a result of natural allergen exposure or active allergen immunotherapy.Since IgG antibody is often present in quantities greatlyexceeding the quantity of IgE antibody, specific IgG antibodymay bind to available sites of the allergosorbent, therebypreventing subsequent IgE binding and leading potentially tofalsely low or negative test results. 586 Different allergen extracts may have identical proteins or peptide epitopes recognized by IgE antibodies. In this case, apatient who is sensitized to an allergen may have a positivetest result to both the original allergen and other allergens thatcross-react with the original allergen. 587The relationship of cross-reactive IgE antibodies evaluated by either skin orspecific IgE tests to clinical disease is known for some but notall allergens. Exposure to cross-reactive allergens may ormay not (eg, most grass-sensitive patientstolerate wheat, a potent cross-reactant in grass pollen ex-tracts). This problem of allergen cross-reactivity may alsocomplicate interpretation of skin tests. The detection of allergen specific IgE antibody in serum with an FDA-cleared assay may be viewed as a risk factorthat supports a positive clinical history in making the diag-nosis of allergic disease. As with skin testing, IgE antibodyspecificities involving extracts that contain potent allergeniccomponents such as ragweed, house dust mite, and cat epi-dermals tend to correlate much better with clinical sensitivityand provocation tests. The use of purified fractions (ie, Amba 1, Der p I, Der f 1, Fel d 1, Alt a 29, Hev b 5) often fortifiessensitivity and the test's correlation with clinical diseasecompared with unfortified immunosorbent. 588On the other hand, extracts with weaker allergenic epitopes may demon-strate substantially less correlation with various indices ofclinical sensitization. This situation may be compoundedfurther in the case of foods in which multiple allergenicepitopes are often contained in the crude extract mixture andminor components may actually dilute the major allergenresponsible for clinical sensitization. Furthermore, as dis-cussed certain in foods (ie, wheat)may strongly allergens in 1 of the potentclasses of inhalant aeroallergens (ie, grass), leading to spuri-ously false-positive results. However, the predictive value ofanaphylactogenic food specific IgE for outcome of oral food challenge has received considerable attention and is discussedbelow and further in part 2. 140,589-591Because the constitutive allergenicity, potency, and stability are variable among com-mercial allergen extract reagents, sensitivity and the positivepredictive value of both prick/puncture and specific IgE testsgenerally tend to be higher among pollens, anaphylactogenic,stable food proteins, house dust mite, certain epidermals, andfungi compared with venoms, drugs, and chemicals. Inhibition of Specific IgE Antibody Binding The most expedient method for determining the specificity of IgE binding is to determine whether the addition of a smallquantity of a homologous allergen in the fluid phase willinhibit most IgE binding. Inhibition usually indicates that IgEbinding in the assay is a result of the IgE antibody specificallyrecognizing the allergenic protein. 564Theoretically, some al- lergen preparations may contain substances such as lectins,which could nonspecifically bind IgE. If IgE is being non-specifically bound, either most serum samples are positive inthe assay or there is a relationship between the total serumIgE concentration and an increase of assay positivity tomultiple lectin-containing allergens. In demonstrating spe-cific inhibition, be possible to inhibit at least 80% ofthe specific IgE binding in a dose response manner. 564 VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S47The degree of binding inhibition produced when a fluid phase allergen is added to a serum containing allergen spe-cific IgE depends on the ratio between the quantity of specificIgE and the quantity of allergen added. When the quantity ofspecific IgE is kept constant, the percentage of inhibitionproduced can be used to estimate the quantity of allergen inthe fluid phase. Under appropriate experimental conditions,including an adequate supply of potent allergen specific IgE,inhibition can be used to standardize allergen extracts, esti- mate the quantities of allergens, and evaluate cross-reactivitybetween allergens. 581 A specific allergen may be detected in a crude extract of multiple allergens using the inhibition technique.581For ex- ample, if a patient is known to be allergic to peanuts, and thepatient has symptoms of an allergic reaction after eating apiece of candy, the question could be whether the candycontained peanut allergen. If an extract of the candy inhibitsthe binding of the patient's IgE to a solid-phase peanutallergen preparation, there would be good reason to suspectthat the candy contained either peanut or an allergen thatcross-reacted with peanut. Allergen Specific IgG Statement may be mea- sured by immunodiffusion or immunoabsorption. (E) Summary Statement 126. Immunodiffusion antibodies to cow's milk are associated with Heiner's disease, a non-IgEdisorder that presents in infants with pulmonary infiltrates.(B) Summary Statement 127. IgG and IgG subclass antibody tests for food allergy do not have clinical relevance, are notvalidated, lack sufficient quality control, and should not beperformed. (B) Summary Statement 128. Although a number of investiga- tors have reported modest increases of IgG4 during venomimmunotherapy, confirmation and validation of the predictivevalue of IgG4 for therapeutic efficacy of venom immunother-apy are not yet proven. (C) Allergen specific IgG can be measured using immunoas- says similar to those used to measure allergen specific IgE. 586 Allergen specific IgG is often easier to detect than specificIgE because it is usually present in a higher concentration.The antibody used to measure the IgG bound in an assay canbe either an anti-human IgG IgG3, or IgG4). When subclass used, the quantity of the particular IgGantibody subclass can be determined. IgG and IgG subclassantibodies specific for allergens usually are measured inarbitrary units, although mass values may be extrapolatedfrom a total or subclass specific standard curve. An allergenspecific IgG assay is subject to the same technical problemsas specific IgE assays, and specific IgG assays should beevaluated using the same criteria and techniques as those usedfor IgE assays. The level of expected precision should be 2significant figures with variation less than 15%, or lower,since the quantity of IgG to be measured is often relativelylarge, especially after immunotherapy. 586Currently, no blinded proficiency surveys are available for evaluating in-terlaboratory performance of allergen specific IgG or IgGsubclass assays. Clinical Application and Interpretation Total serum IgE concentration Several studies have proposed using the total IgE concentra- tion in cord blood as a method for predicting an infant's riskof developing allergic disease. 592Although the results of the early reports were promising, subsequent studies have notfound the cord blood IgE concentration to be a reliablepredictor of risk. 592Even if it were possible to predict the risk of allergic disease, such knowledge would have little clinicalvalue because there are not as yet proven methods for pre-venting allergic disease in high-risk children. Measurements of total serum IgE concentration are of modest clinical value when used as a screen for allergicdisease or for predicting the risk of allergic disease. 592Al- though epidemiologic studies have shown that the risk ofasthma is highly correlated with the total serum IgE concen-tration, the variation from individual to individual is too greatto provide much diagnostic value. 592-595Similarly, the broad range of values and the variation among individuals meansthat total serum IgE concentrations provide only modestinformation about the risk of allergic disease on an individualbasis. 590Furthermore, a normal total IgE does not exclude clinical allergy. Evaluation of patients with suspected ABPAis one of the few clear indications for measuring serum IgEconcentrations. 596An extremely elevated total serum IgE concentration is found in nearly all patients with ABPA andis one of the major diagnostic criteria. There is also a sug-gestion that the serum IgE concentration is an indicator ofdisease activity and that serial determinations should be usedto evaluate the adequacy of treatment. 596 With the licensing of omalizumab (Xolair) for the treat- ment of allergic asthma, another application of total serumIgE is verification that the patient is a suitable candidate foranti-IgE therapy with total serum IgE levels between 70 and800 IU/mL. The total serum IgE level before taking omali-zumab combined with the patient's weight will determine thecorrect dosing to ensure efficacious reduction of free IgEcirculating in blood. After 1 month of taking omalizumab, anew assay that measures the level of circulating IgE that isfree or unbound with omalizumab can confirm the effective-ness of the dosing regimen. 597This test is not yet commer- cially available. Although as much as 62% loss in accuracywas observed in FDA-cleared human IgE assays, the Immu-noCAP system was sufficiently robust to provide accurateand reproducible total and allergen-specific antibody resultsin the presence of therapeutic levels of serum omalizumab. 598 Serum IgE concentrations are often abnormal in patients with congenital immunodeficiencies, but these abnormalitiesare rarely diagnostic. 599The primary exception to this state- ment is the syndrome of hyper-IgE, eczematous dermatitis,and recurrent pyogenic infections. In this syndrome, the total S48 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYserum IgE level is extremely elevated and is one of the major diagnostic criteria for the disease.599Nonspecific elevation of IgE level is also observed in the Wiskott-Aldrich, ataxiatelangiectasia, DiGeorge, and Ommen syndromes. 600 Patients with acquired forms of immunodeficiency may have altered levels of serum IgE, but these alterations are notdiagnostic. 601A few published reports have indicated that serum IgE is elevated in patients with HIV infection and thatthere is a modest correlation between IgE elevation and clinical course or state of the disease. 602 IgE myeloma is a rare form of multiple myeloma, with fewer than 40 cases reported worldwide.603Some cases of IgE myeloma may have been misdiagnosed as light chain diseasebecause of failure to measure serum IgE concentrations.Since the course of IgE myeloma is distinct from that of lightchain disease and other myelomas, IgE should be measured inpatients with clinical symptoms suggestive of myeloma andin whom myelomas of other isotypes have been ruled out. 603 Total serum IgE concentrations have been reported to be abnormally high in a variety of diseases. In drug-inducedinterstitial nephritis or graft vs host disease, there may be arelationship among the course of the disease, response totherapy, and the IgE level, but none of these relationships arefirm enough to recommend total IgE as part of the clinicalevaluation of these diseases. 592 Allergen specific IgE concentration Summary Statement 129. The probability distribution of specific IgE for several anaphylactogenic foods (peanuts, eggwhite, cow's milk, and codfish) can define clinical sensitivityas verified by double-blind oral challenge tests; similar rela-tionships have been defined for several respiratory allergens.(A) Multiple studies have shown that allergen specific IgE is rarely detectable in cord blood. 592In the few cases in which specific IgE for common allergens was detectable, neitherdiagnostic nor prognostic significance was demonstrated.Based on current information, there is no clinical indicationfor attempting to measure allergen specific IgE in cord blood.However, several investigations have shown that elevatedfood specific IgE in early infancy may predict respiratorysensitization at a later age. 604-607 A recent study claimed virtually equivalent specific IgE sensitivity results between a blood spot test and serum.608The blood spot test was performed using paper-absorbed or-eluted blood obtained by finger prick. 608Preliminary results suggested this was a successful method for determining IgEsensitization in preschool children. Prototypic, miniaturized,multiarray assays may offer a similar advantage in the fu-ture. 577,609 Efforts to develop a screening procedure have led to tests in which multiple allergens are coupled to a single solid-phase substrate 560,610,611(Table 5). If the multiple allergen test result is positive, there is a high probability that the patient isallergic to at least 1 of the allergens included in the test.Additional tests that use individual allergens then can be usedto determine other allergens to which the patient may be sensitive. In general, these multiallergen screening tests haveshown acceptable diagnostic sensitivity and specificity whencompared with skin tests. 560,610,611 The clinical value of multiple allergen screening tests depends on the selection of patients. In a symptomatic self-selected population, a positive test result would significantlyincrease the probability that the patient was allergic. If mul-tiple allergen tests were used to screen an unselected popu-lation, there would be an unacceptable number of false-positive and false-negative results. By itself, a positivemultiple allergen test result does not provide sufficient infor-mation to make a specific clinical diagnosis or to initiatetherapy. 59In addition, a negative multiple allergen test result does not exclude clinical sensitivity because the commercial-ly-available multiallergen screening tests only screen for ap-proximately 15 aeroallergens. Recommendations concerning the number of specific IgE tests for confirmation of suspected clinical sensitivity corre-spond to those discussed for prick/puncture tests in SummaryStatement 43. There are no clinical scenarios in which immunoassays for allergen specific IgE can be considered either absolutelyindicated or contraindicated. There are some situations inwhich immunoassays may be preferable to skin testing for thediagnostic evaluation of patients. If the patient has had anearly fatal reaction to an allergen, the immunoassay offersthe advantage of testing the patient for allergen specific IgEwithout the risk of inducing a severe reaction from a skintest. 612,613In this situation, an IgE antibody measurement using immunoassay is less likely to provoke severe patientanxiety about the possible adverse consequences of a skintest. A positive IgE antibody test result strongly supports theclinical impression. A negative test result reduces the prob-ability that the suspected allergen is causally associated, butit is essential that the negative result be confirmed by skin testbefore the allergen can be excluded as a possible anaphylac-togen. 612,613If both test results are negative, a supervised challenge may still be necessary. If a patient does not have asufficient large area of normal skin to allow skin testing,immunoassays for specific IgE are useful for confirmingclinical impressions. 550,564Examples would include individu- als with severe dermatographism, ichthyosis, or generalizedatopic dermatitis. Theoretically, a third situation in whichimmunoassay may be preferable is during the refractoryperiod immediately after a severe allergic reaction. If it wereclinically necessary to determine the patient's sensitivitywithin a few days after such a reaction, an immunoassaymight provide a better way to ascertain the necessary infor-mation. 550Antihistamines and drugs such as tricyclic antide- pressants reduce or block skin test reactivity550(Table 4). If it is necessary to document allergic sensitization either beforethe drug has been cleared from the patient's body or if it isinadvisable to stop taking the medication, an immunoassaymay provide needed information. When a patient is unable tocooperate with skin testing because of mental or physical VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S49impairment, measurement of specific IgE by immunoassay would be preferable because of reduced risk to an agitatedpatient or personnel who would normally perform the skintesting. Quantitative results from clinical IgE antibody assays have allowed investigators to study whether the quantity of serumIgE antibody has any predictive utility in defining clinicalsensitivity. In the area of food allergy, several groups haveshown that the quantity of specific IgE antibody in serum topeanut, egg white, cow's milk, and fish may define currentclinical sensitivity in many patients. 140,526,589-591,614Probabili- ty-based risk of clinical food allergy increases as the quantityof serum food specific IgE increases. Probability curves candefine, for some foods, levels at which reactions are highlylikely (eg, 95%) and may dissuade the need for an oral foodchallenge. Thus, the higher the value, the more specific thetest becomes in terms of clinical food allergy. Over interpret-ing values in the class 1 and 2 categories may lead to falseassumptions. When levels are undetectable, 5% to 20% maystill have reactions, and so the clinical history is important ininterpretation of results. 589 Probability-based risk evaluation has also been extended to respiratory allergy using quantitative allergen specific IgEantibody data previously reported from four European labo-ratories. 573A logistic regression model was used to compare the relationship between the physician's final diagnosis ofallergic respiratory disease (positive or negative) based on theclinical history, physical examination, and skin testing andserologic testing data and the quantitative level of serum IgEantibody alone. Probability curves were calculated in thisstudy to show the relationship between IgE antibody in bloodand the dichotomous clinical diagnosis of the absence orpresence of allergic respiratory disease. The probability ofobtaining a positive allergy diagnosis at a given serum IgEantibody level by the Pharmacia UniCAP System has beenevaluated for different allergens at 4 clinics. Differences inthe shape of the IgE antibody level vs probability of clinicaldisease curves was seen both between allergens within aclinic and between clinics for the same allergen specificity. 573 This indicates that use of specific IgE antibody levels tosupport the clinical diagnosis of respiratory allergic disease isdifferent for the same allergist depending on the particularinhalant allergen and between allergists for the same allergenspecificity. Importantly, however, the authors make the casethat quantitation of serum IgE antibody improves the confi-dence of the clinical diagnosis of inhalant allergies better thansimply knowing if IgE antibody is present or absent. Another group also studied the clinical utility of quantita- tive serum IgE antibody measurements in the diagnosis ofrespiratory allergy. 574They used purified recombinant timo- thy grass and birch pollen allergens to compare the relativeability of puncture skin testing, nasal provocation, and IgEantibody serology by the CAP System to reflect immediate-type respiratory sensitivity. Although the skin test and nasalprovocation results were significantly correlated, the intensityof these biological reactions did not correlate with the level ofallergen specific IgE antibody in serum. The authors con- cluded that factors in addition to IgE influence the extent ofallergic tissue reactions. A recent probability risk evaluation comparing skin tests and serum specific IgE to a panel of saprophytic mold aeroal-lergens revealed relatively poor correlations. 615The results of this investigation confirmed the relatively low sensitivityrank order for fungi when evaluated by in vitro serologictests. Predictability of both skin and in vitro tests for IgE-medi- ated anaphylaxis to Hymenoptera venoms may also require reconsideration, especially if patients are tested at extendedtimes after the anaphylactic episode. A recent investigationdemonstrated relatively poor reproducibility of both venomskin tests and serum specific IgE when 35 patients, who hadexperienced systemic reactions, were tested on 2 occasions 2and 6 weeks apart. 616 Immunoassays for allergen specific IgE offer a unique advantage when compared with skin testing in their ability touse soluble allergen inhibition to examine specificity andcross-reactivity among allergens. Although these assays areused chiefly for research purposes, they may be clinicallyimportant in some situations. For example, if a patient has ahistory of anaphylaxis after an insect sting and the patient isfound to be skin test positive to yellow jacket venom at a lowconcentration and positive to Polistes wasp venom at a higher concentration of venom, the question arises whether the pa-tient is sensitive to both insects or whether skin test reactivityto wasp venom is the result of cross-reactivity. An inhibitionassay showing that all the reactivity to Polistes wasp venom could be inhibited by yellow jacket venom strongly suggeststhat the positive skin test result to Polistes wasp was the result of cross-reactivity. Furthermore, the patient could be success-fully treated with yellow jacket venom alone, saving theadded expense of treating with Polistes wasp venom. Aller- gen cross-reactivity may also be clinically relevant whendeciding how many species of weeds, grasses, trees, andmites need to be included in an immunotherapy regimen. Allergen specific IgE measurements may be useful in evaluating fatalities that may have resulted from allergicreactions by determining the allergen responsibility for thefatal reaction. 612,613 Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is an inflamma- tory disease of the lungs characterized by severe asthma,sputum production, peripheral blood eosinophilia, and anincreased total serum IgE concentration. If untreated, it mayprogress to central bronchiectasis and, ultimately, pulmonaryfibrosis and death. After proper treatment with corticoste-roids, total serum IgE levels usually decrease. Total serumIgE should be followed during the disease since an increase inIgE may herald a relapse of disease. Aspergillus specific IgE and IgG are usually present in the sera of patients withABPA. Although the levels of these antibodies do not alwayscorrelate with disease activity, they tend to decrease as activedisease subsides. 596,617,618 S50 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYThe initial immune response to many endoparasitic and ectoparasitic organisms is predominantly an IgE response. Inmany parasitic infections, an increase in both parasite specificIgE and total serum IgE concentrations occurs. 592Detection and measurement of the parasite specific IgE (eg, Toxo- plasma gondii ) may be useful for diagnosis and potentially for following the course of the infection.619The major limi- tation of using assays for parasite specific IgE has been theavailability of adequate allergosorbent preparations from therelevant parasite. Cell-mediated immunity may be an equallyimportant pathogenetic factor in some parasite infections (ie,leishmaniasis). A recent report suggests that antimalarial spe-cific IgE in asymptomatic individuals may be associated withreduced risk for subsequent clinical malaria. 620It has been postulated that serum IgE may be a prognostic marker forAIDS in HIV-infected adults and that a switch to the T H2 profile might represent a turning point in HIV.621,622Anti-HIV IgE found in the serum of certain long-term pediatric survi-vors is associated with inhibition of HIV-1 production, pos-sibly through cytotoxicity rather than virus neutralization. 623 Remote Formulation of Allergen Extracts Several clinical laboratories offer nonallergists a service of preparing extract mixtures for allergen immunotherapy basedon results of specific IgE tests. In some cases, the extractprescription is also based partially on a patient self-adminis-tered questionnaire. One study prospectively compared theresults of allergy evaluations of 118 patients performed by agroup of practicing board-certified allergists vs a laboratorythat offered allergy diagnosis and recommendations for im-munotherapy. 624Although this study demonstrated that aller- gists identified allergy more frequently (53% vs 47%), theyactually immunotherapy less frequently thandid the laboratory (35% vs 59%). The recommendations of the laboratory were deficient in that they were solely based onthe history form and results. The laboratory was unable toclarify answers or to further explore areas that were suggestedby patient responses or allergy testing results. On criticalanalysis of the laboratory-based extract recipes, it was foundthat the laboratory ignored the history forms and developedan extract formulation based solely on the results of antibodyanalysis in several cases. Overall, approximately 50% of therecommendations by the laboratory were inappropriate orincomplete. Even more serious errors could occur if thelaboratory offering such a service had a record of poor orunsubstantiated quality control for performance of specificIgE tests. 563 This form of allergen treatment is therefore not in the patient's best interest and should be discontinued.624 Allergen Specific IgG Allergen specific IgG can be produced by persons either as a result of natural allergen exposure or as a result of immuno-therapy. 625-629Allergen specific IgG may have specificity for different allergen proteins or different protein epitopes thanthose eliciting an IgE response in the same person. There hasbeen no convincing evidence that the quantity of allergen specific IgG produced as a result of natural exposure isrelated to or predictive of disease. 590,629 Food specific IgG has been found in many healthy nonal- lergic individuals, and the quantity detected seems to dependon the quantity of the food ingested. 625,629Precipitating anti- bodies to cow's milk are associated with Heiner's disease,hallmarks of which are pulmonary infiltrates that disappearafter elimination of cow's milk. 630No studies have convinc- ingly demonstrated a relationship between the presence offood specific IgG antibodies and allergic disease (see \"Un-proven Tests\"). By substituting an antibody specific for anIgG the antihuman IgG in the is measure allergen-specific subclassdistribution of IgG antibody responses. 586A single study reported that persons having irritable bowel symptoms afteringestion of foods have increased levels of IgG4 antibodysubclass to the offending food. 631Unfortunately, high levels of the IgG4 subclass of food specific IgG antibody have notbeen consistent among studies so that the clinical value ofmeasuring subclass specific IgG antibody remains to be de-termined. 625,632Thus, IgG and IgG subclass antibody tests for food allergy have not been demonstrated to have clinicalrelevance, are not validated, lack sufficient quality control,and should not be performed. Some investigators have shown that there is a modest association between the quantity of venom-specific IgGproduced in response to immunotherapy and protectionfrom allergic reactions induced by an insect sting. 586,633,634 The value of measuring IgG antibody during or afterimmunotherapy with other allergens has not been demon-strated. Although allergen specificity may occur each ofthe 4 IgG subclasses during allergen immunotherapy, thereis conflicting evidence concerning the value of equatingsuch antibodies with efficacy. 586,633,634In the case of im- munotherapy with insect venoms, there appears to be amodest relationship between the presence of elevated spe-cific IgG4 for the venom and protection from anaphylaxisafter an insect sting. 586,633-637Other studies have not found any relationship between the quantity or specificity ofallergen specific subclass IgG and the outcome of pollenimmunotherapy. 564The general predictive value of sub- class IgG4 for successful immunotherapy is not proven atpresent. Allergen specific IgG has been reported to be a potentially important biomarker of exposure to specific chemical aller-gens in the workplace. 638Thus far, the predictive value for such antibodies and emergence of clinical disease in exposedworkers has not been demonstrated. 638 Immunoprecipitin tests to various adjuncts. 638-641Panels of the most common etiologic agents of these diseases are validated and commer-cially available. 642 VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S51In Vitro Methods of Allergen Standardization Summary Statement 130. Although allergens can be standard- ized either by radioimmunodiffusion or based on major allergenic epitopes, the FDA selectedBAU instead because in vitro analytic techniques would havebeen variable from allergen to allergen and would havecaused great confusion. (C) Background All medicines should have a label that describes quantity and potency. Traditionally, allergenic extracts have been labeledin weight to volume units or PNU, the quantity of phospho-tungstic acid precipitable nitrogen. Since allergenic compo-nents are known to be a small percentage of the total protein,source material can be manipulated to maximize the contentof proteins that contribute to the PNU value without regard tothe allergenically active proteins. Consequently, these proce-dures yield extracts whose labeling cannot be relied on toexpress the allergenic activity of the contents. In 1970 aprogram was initiated in the FDA Laboratory of AllergenicProducts to develop procedures that would permit a descrip-tion of the allergenic activity of extracts as determined bycomparison of laboratory and skin test reactivities. 59 Current methods The first extracts in which an attempt was made to provide lot-to-lot consistency were the insect venoms. These productsare labeled in arbitrary units of hyaluronidase enzyme per 100 /H9262g of protein. The next extract was that of short ragweed pollen. This was labeled in units of antigen E (Amb a 1) permilliliter (a unit of antigen E is approximately 1 /H9262g). Amb a 1 was initially measured by a radial immunodiffusion test andcurrently is measured by an enzyme immunoassay inhibitiontest. If this program had continued, there would have been as many types of analytical methods and labeled designations asthere are extracts, a situation that would have resulted inconsiderable confusion in the use of these products. There-fore, a potency unit was developed, BAU, which is based onskin bioreactivity. After this is determined, each lot is eval-uated by 1 or more laboratory tests that can be compared andexpressed in BAU potency equivalents. In the future, allstandardized extracts used in the United States will be veri-fied by carrying out the bioequivalent FDA tests. Procedures Standardization methods of allergenic extracts for use as skin and specific IgE reagents involve a series of tests. All tests aredescribed in detail along with statistical methods and vari-ability in the FDA's Manual of Methods of the Laboratory of Allergenic Products . 124 These methods include (1) identification of the source material used for extract production, (2) determination of asatisfactory procedure for preparing an extract, and (3) testsof the extract that include total protein, radial immunodiffu-sion test for a single allergen (eg, short ragweed antigen E [Amb a allergen (Fel d 1), enzyme assay (eg,hyaluronidase in venoms), or immunoinhibition (pollen, mite and mold extracts). Where applicable, immunoblotting frompolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or isoelectric focusingtechniques are performed to the allergenic identity ofextracts and the number of IgE-binding proteins. Using anextract standardized by these methods, serum pools collectedfrom sensitive patients can be evaluated to determine thevalidity and reproducibility of specific IgE tests. Test variability For the radial immunodiffusion method, the correlation co- efficient of the reference dose response line should be at least0.9. A single concentration for a test extract is reproducible to/H1100625% when estimated from the calculated regression line. 642 Immunoinhibition (RAST or ELISA) provides relative po- tency and consequently requires a reference preparation. Thedata are analyzed by means of parallel line statistics. There-fore, the frequently used methods of comparing extracts atextrapolated 50% inhibition values is without special mean-ing when this procedure is used for standardization of ex-tracts. All validity assays must be included in the data statis-tical analysis protocol as described in detail in the FDA's Manual of Methods . 124Prospective evaluation of the allergen standardization procedure was performed in the FDA labo-ratory and other laboratories by assessing more than 45 setsof data from 3 individual investigators. The variability isproportional to the number of test methods, all of whichshould be performed at least in duplicate. For 3 tests, thecalculated variability was 47% to 213%, and for 5 tests, it was56% to 180%. Histamine and Leukotriene Tests Summary Statement 131. Histamine and leukotriene release measurements from human basophils after incubation withallergen are valuable research tools for in vitro investigationsof allergy. (B) Summary Statement 132. The recent availability of several sensitive immunoassays for histamine and leukotriene C4 is asignificant technological advance for measuring these medi-ators in various biologic fluids or release from whole blood,isolated basophils, mast cells, or other cultured cells. (B) Summary Statement 133. Histamine and its N-methyl his- tamine metabolite may be measured in 24-hour urine samplesafter suspected anaphylactic episodes. (B) Background More than 75 years ago, Dale et al demonstrated the presence and physiologic action of histamine in different tissues. 643 Later work established that histamine in tissue is present ingranules of cells and that in human tissue these granules arepresent only in basophils and mast cells. Over the years it wasdemonstrated that histamine or histamine-like material wasreleased into the blood of experimental animals during ana-phylactic reactions. This approach led to the demonstrationthat the addition of specific antigen or allergen to the blood orwashed leukocytes of either experimentally sensitized ani- S52 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYmals or allergic persons can result in the release of histamine from basophils. Basophils are the only cells in human peripheral blood that contain histamine. The interaction of specific allergen withthe IgE antibody fixed to high-affinity Fc membrane initiates histamineand other inflammatory mediators associated with immediatehypersensitivity. The release of histamine is modulated by theaddition of a number of pharmacologic agents. The additionof plasma or serum factors is not essential for the releasereaction, although normal serum will enhance the releasereaction when conditions are suboptimal. The serum of aller-gic persons also contains blocking IgG antibodies that alsoreact with the allergen. When histamine release measure-ments are done with washed leukocytes, however, these an-tibodies probably do not influence the results. Applications Histamine release from human basophils is primarily a valu- able research tool for in vitro investigations of allergy. Inmost studies of histamine release, allergen or antigen is addedto washed leukocytes from venous blood. This can be sim-plified by eliminating the leukocyte preparation step andadding the allergen to whole heparinized blood. 644The hista- mine released into the supernatant then can be determineddirectly. More recently, leukotriene C4 release has been mon-itored from basophils exposed to allergen as an indication ofthe presence of specific IgE antibody. 645,646 In ragweed-allergic persons there is a good correlation between the severity of the clinical symptoms and the extentof in vitro histamine release. 647The histamine release also correlates with the magnitude of the skin test and the level ofserum IgE specific for ragweed Amb a 1. Both the antigenconcentration at which 30% to 50% histamine release (cellsensitivity) occurs and the maximum percentage of histaminerelease (cell reactivity) correlate with the clinical severity of allergic rhinitis and the skin test. Patients with high levels ofserum ragweed specific IgE release histamine with low con-centrations of antigen. Similarly, in Hymenoptera venom- sensitive patients, there is good correlation between positivehistamine release in vitro and the magnitude of the skin testwith venom antigen. 648This procedure is also being used to evaluate the functional characteristics of autoantibodies toIgE or the Fc /H9255R1 receptor in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU). Current Methods for Measuring Histamine The discovery of histamine and the demonstration of its biologic importance were accomplished through the use ofbiologic assay systems dependent on the contractility ofsmooth muscle after the addition of this biologically activeamine. This early technique has been superseded by chemical(fluorometric) and most recently, immunologic methods. Chemical A method for the chemical determination of histamine was first described by Shore et al in 1959. 649Since then, thismethod has been modified to increase both its specificity and sensitivity. It is based on the coupling of ophthalaldehyde tohistamine at alkaline pH to form a fluorescent product. Thefluorescence of the histamine-o-phthalaldehyde complex ismore intense and more stable at an acid pH, unlike thecomplex formed by some other amines. To remove interfer-ing compounds, the histamine is extracted before the conden-sation step. Protein is removed from the sample to be ana-lyzed by perchloric acid precipitation; the recovered in an aqueous hydrochloric acid by adding heptane. This dilute hy-drochloric acid solution is then used for the condensation ofhistamine with o-phthalaldehyde. The extraction procedurewith organic solvents is essential to remove histidine andother interfering compounds before the condensation step. Acompletely automated fluorometric technique is capable ofanalyzing 30 samples per hour with a precision between 1%and 2%. 650The sensitivity of the method is such that 0.1 to 10 ng/mL of histamine can be accurately determined. Thismethod is convenient in handling large numbers of sampleswith excellent precision. The methods for both the manualand automated histamine analysis method have been de-scribed in detail. 549,650 Immunoassay The fluorometric assay has technical requirements that min- imize its use to research laboratories. Simpler assay methodshave recently been developed that use antibodies to histamineor histamine analogs, and the reagents are available in com-mercially available kits. 651A variety of immunoassay kits are available. Many of these are competitive inhibition assays,and most use monoclonal antibodies. 652As with other immu- noassays, the methods used are sensitive, reproducible, and easy to perform.653 Interpretation Histamine release results are expressed as a percentage of total cellular histamine determined after incubation with acalcium ionophore or boiling an aliquot of cells. Controlmeasurements include the histamine released in the absenceof added antigen, and this value is subtracted to calculate thespecific release. In most experiments, the nonspecific \"blank\"release should be less than 10% of the total cellular hista-mine. High spontaneous release of histamine from washedleukocytes has been reported in a small percentage of patientswho are highly atopic or sensitive to food. 654The significance of that finding is not clear.654Appropriate controls should also include the testing of the allergen with the cells of nonallergicdonors to demonstrate that the allergen does not contain anycytotoxic materials or histamine itself. Similarly, allergens orpharmacologic agents should be tested to see whether theyinfluence the histamine assay procedure nonspecifically andcontribute to erroneous results. Histamine release results can be conveniently expressed by 2 parameters: (1) cell sensitivity: this is the concentration of VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S53antigen or allergen expressed in units (preferably micrograms per milliliter) required to release either 30% or 50% of totalcellular histamine; and (2) cell reactivity: this is the maximalamount (percentage) of histamine release obtained with anyamount of the antigen. A positive control in histamine experiments should be the addition of different dilutions of an anti-IgE antiserum to thecells. In general, the cells of most persons release more than10% histamine after challenge with anti-IgE. The number of false-positive reactions to allergens deter- mined by histamine release is low. These are defined assubjects having a negative skin test result and a positivehistamine release result with an allergen. The incidence of false-negative reactions is a more critical factor in the interpretation of histamine release tests. Somepatients have little histamine release at any concentration ofallergen, but nevertheless are sensitive by skin tests. Evenunder the best of circumstances, for example, skin test studieswith pure venom antigens, there is a significant number ofpeople who have positive skin test results and appear to beallergic by a convincing history but fail to release histamineafter challenge with appropriate allergens. The percentage ofthese persons may be as high as 10% to 15%. This raises theissue of how to interpret a negative test result. Cells frompatients with CIU frequently do not release histamine. De-sensitization of patients may also result in changes in thedegree of histamine release from leukocytes. Changes attrib-utable to immunotherapy are variable and inconsistent. Significance Histamine release from leukocytes of allergic persons is an excellent in vitro correlate of allergy. At present, it is primar-ily considered a research test and is not widely available fromclinical immunology laboratories. However, in rare instancesit may have confirmative value in assessing the presence orabsence of allergy. In vitro histamine release can be a usefuladjunct by supplying quantitative data on the degree of aller-gen specificity. Therefore, it can be compared with in vitroserologic methods using direct and inhibition techniques.Both of these assays suffer from the occurrence of false-negative results, that is, patients who are clinically sensitivebut exhibit negative findings to these tests. 655The serologic measurement of IgE antibody has the following advantages:(1) it requires a small amount of serum, (2) samples can bestored and processed at a central laboratory, and (3) thetechniques involving immunoassay are well established andFDA cleared. In contrast, histamine release requires a largerblood sample, it must be performed within a relatively shorttime after the sample of blood is obtained, and the techniquesare more complicated and not FDA cleared. The advantagesof histamine assays are that they require smaller amounts ofallergen, unlike skin testing they do not involve injection ofallergen into the subject, and they are not dependent oncoupling antigens to immobilized support systems with theinherent problems of antigen modification or unavailability ofbinding sites. By contrast, using washed leukocyte experi-ments, there is no competition between IgG and IgE for antigenic binding sites, and, therefore, IgG cannot interfere inthe release assays as sometimes is the case with IgE antibodyserology. Histamine and its metabolite, N-methyl histamine, may be measured in urine samples (usually 24-hour collection) aftera suspected anaphylactic episode or evaluation of suspectedmastocytosis. 636,637Plasma histamine is more likely to be elevated in patients who present to the emergency department with acute allergic syndromes than tryptase.656-658 Plasma Tryptase Summary Statement 134. Plasma tryptase, particularly the /H9252 form, should be obtained within 4 hours after an anaphylactic episode. (B) Summary Statement 135. Combined /H9251and/H9252species of plasma tryptase are elevated in patients with systemic mas-tocytosis. (A) Mast cells that have been activated during an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction release proteases and prestored his-tamine mediators into sur-rounding soft Tryptase (molecular a neutral serine esterase with trypsin-like substratespecificity that is found in relatively large quantities in mastcells (approximately 10 pg per lung mast cell and up to 135pg per skin mast cell). It is stored in the secretory granules asan active enzyme complexed to and stabilized by heparin.Although several forms have been described (I, II /H9252, III/H9251,T ) and all are found in mast cells, only the /H9252and, less frequently, /H9251species are clinically relevant. Since modest amounts are found in basophils (less than 1% than found in tissue mastcells), tryptase is considered to be a good clinical marker ofmast cell activation. 657,659When dissociated from heparin, tryptase enzy-matic activity. Immunoreactive tryptase levels in serum of healthy adults are less than 5 /H9262g/L. Elevated levels of tryptase ( /H1102210/H9262g/L as measured by immunoassay) can be detected in serum from1 to 4 hours after the onset of systemic anaphylaxis withhypotension. 660In some cases, tryptase may reach levels as high as 1 mg/L. Recommended serum collection times for aserum tryptase are 30 minutes to 4 hours after the onset of anacute event. Although postmortem specimens are difficult toanalyze for tryptase due to gross lysis of cells, levels ofapproximately 10 /H9262g/L in these specimens have been con- sidered abnormal. Elevated tryptase can be detected usuallywithin 15 to 30 minutes after an allergen challenge, and itdeclines with an approximate half-life of 2 hours. This is incontrast to histamine, which peaks more quickly within 5 to10 minutes after an event and may return to baseline levels inless than 1 hour. Tryptase has also been detected in BALfluid, nasal lavage fluid, tears, and skin chamber fluid, butthere are currently no clinical indications for such measure-ments. Like histamine, /H9252-tryptase is released from mast cells within 15 minutes after in vitro degranulation and is thepredominant form detected 1 to 2 hours in the serum after S54 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYTable 6.

The ECP measurements have limited clinical utility as an analyte for monitoring patientswith extrinsic asthma and other allergic diseases in whicheosinophils may play a role in tissue damage. 666-672 Several eosinophil chemoattractants (eg, IL-5, eotaxin) are elevated in nasal and BAL samples in patients with activeallergic inflammatory disease associated with recent or con-current exposure to aerogenic allergens. 303,304,672 Basophil Activation Test Summary Statement 138. A basophil activation test measured by expression of CD63 and CD203c and detected by flowcytometry is being evaluated for many IgE-mediated disor-ders. (C) The degree of basophil activation based on the expression of CD63 and recently CD203c is determined by flow cytom-etry. 672It has been evaluated in IgE-mediated pollen, food, drug, Hymenoptera venom, and latex reactions.673-681Sera of patients with CIU also demonstrate basophil-activating auto-antibodies. 682High sensitivity and specificity have been ob- served in most of these studies. Recently, a CD63 sensitivityassay was shown to be useful in monitoring clinical effects inpatients who receive omalizumab (Xolair) treatment. 683 IN VITRO DIAGNOSTIC TESTS OF CELL-MEDIATED IMMUNITY Background and Present Application Summary Statement 139. Tests that quantify lymphocyte function measure the ability of lymphocytes to (1) proliferate,(2) produce inflammatory mediators and cytokines or chemo-kines, (3) mount cytotoxic responses, and (4) regulate im-mune responses. (B) Summary Statement 140. Lymphocyte proliferative re- sponses may be evaluated by either (eg,phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin or pokeweed) or spe- cific soluble cell-bound antigens. (B) Summary Statement 141. In vitro proliferative responses to some soluble antigens, but not mitogens, have been shown tocorrelate with in vivo delayed hypersensitivity. The role,however, of lymphocyte proliferation as vitro inthe pathogenesis of the delayed-type hypersensitivity tissuereaction is unclear. (B) Summary Statement 142. Cytokines (IL-1 through IL-33) and growth factors are glycoproteins produced by a variety ofcells that are capable of altering activities of other cellsthrough interaction with specific surface receptors. (E) Summary Statement 143. Chemokines are small (8 to 10 kDa) proteins secreted by many immune and nonimmunecells with essential roles in inflammatory and immune reac-tions, including the late-phase cutaneous response. (E) Summary Statement 144. Cytokine and chemokine profiles play essential roles in allergic inflammation and are beingincreasingly evaluated as phenotypic markers and in thedifferential diagnosis of human hypersensitivity disorders.(B) The cell types that contribute to the cellular hypersensitiv- ity reaction include lymphocytes, macrophages, dendriticcells, Langerhans cells, and granulocytes. In vitro tests ofcell-mediated immunity may be used to evaluate (1) cellularfunction in patients who may have recurrent or multipleserious infections (eg, fungal, mycobacterial and protozoan);(2) depressed syndrome, sarcoidosis, and cancer); chronic hepatitis, and thyroiditis); and (6) many other inflammatoryentities.Table 7.

VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S59Tests that quantify lymphocyte function detect the ability of lymphocytes to (1) proliferate, (2) produce inflammatorymediators and cytokines, (3) mount cytotoxic responses, and(4) regulate immune responses. Lymphocyte proliferativeresponses can be evaluated by the use of nonspecific mito-genic stimulants such as phytohemagglutinin, concanavalinA, or pokeweed mitogen and by specific stimuli such assoluble and cell bound antigens. The nonspecific activation oflymphocytes measures both T (ie, phytohemagglutinin, con-canavalin A) and B (ie, pokeweed mitogen) cell function,although the kinetics of these responses differ. In contrast,specific antigenic challenge appears to measure only T-cellfunction. In addition, by using autologous and homologousserum in the cultures, one can also determine whether thepatient's serum contains factors that may interfere with orenhance the proliferative response. Cytokines and growth factors are glycoproteins produced by a variety of cells that are capable of altering activities ofother cells through interaction with specific surface recep-tors. 684-694They are secreted by lymphocytes, macrophages, epithelial cells, and a variety of effector cells (eg, eosinophils,mast cells) among others. They have significant growth dif-ferentiation and activation functions on contiguous or distantcells and tissues. There are 4 major families of cytokines thathave been identified: (1) interferons, (2) colony-stimulatingfactors, (3) TNFs, and (4) ILs (Table 6). The last is dividedinto subfamilies, which consist of an expanding list of newcytokines, now numbering from IL-1 to IL-33. Historically,cytokines have been called lymphokines if they were pro-duced by lymphocytes or monokines if were producedby monocytes or macrophages. Many cytokines produced bylymphocytes have also been termed interleukins even though most of their functions are not restricted to between cells.Both immune and nonimmune cells produce chemokines andsmaller proinflammatory by lympho- cytes and monocytes indicates that these cells are capable ofproducing factors that are involved in both afferent andefferent limbs of the cellular inflammatory mediators, mac-rophage MIF, has an essential role in the expression ofcell-mediated immunity and a number of inflammatory dis-eases. 698-707In the past, MIF and its correlate, leukocyte de-layed-type hypersensitivity skin reactivity, although they donot necessarily measure the function of a particular cell type(T or B cell). 708,709 The ability of lymphocytes to act as cytotoxic killer cells in response to either allogeneic, target, or malignant cells hasclinical relevance in patients undergoing a transplant proce-dure and patients with cancer. T-cell regulation of immuno-globulin synthesis or antibody production, as well as lym-phocyte proliferation, also has clinical application. Excessiveor diminished regulation of these immune responses canresult in disorders associated with humoral immunity, cell-mediated immunity, or both. In 1960, Nowell described thatphytohemagglutinin, a lectin extracted from kidney beans,nonspecifically transformed small lymphocytes into prolifer-ating lymphoblasts in vitro. 710Subsequently, in addition to plant lectins that activate all normal T cells, it was shown thata variety of antigens could also induce proliferation. 711This occurred, however, only in those persons who had positivedelayed skin test reactions to these antigens. In vitro prolif-eration to some soluble antigens, but not to mitogens, hasbeen shown to be a good correlate of specific in vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity. However, the lymphocyte pro-liferation in the pathogenesis of delayed-type hypersensitivityskin reactions is unclear. On the basis of what is known about the biologic activities of cytokines and chemokines, these factors appear to be bettercandidates for investigating pathogenesis. In fact, when thesein vitro tests are correlated with skin testing in normal sub-jects and in patients with diseases associated with defects indelayed-type hypersensitivity, lymphokine levels more oftenclosely parallel the results of tests than doeslymphocyte proliferation. 712Effector lymphokines, particu- larly MIF, therefore correlates of delayed-type hypersensitivity. Antigen-induced inhibition of cell migration has been used as a bioactivity index of delayed-type hypersensitivity sinceits original description in 1932. Development of the capillarytube method for measuring macrophage migration has facil-itated the significance of migratory inhibitors, particularlyMIF. 713The latter was first described by David, Bloom, and Bennett714,715; it is a protein produced by sensitized lympho- cytes after activation by specific antigens or 8.

July 28, 2006 (Epub ahead of print). S60 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYinitial studies, human MIF exhibited heterogeneity in its molecular weight, isoelectric point, and glycosylation.716 Some of the heterogeneity was found to be due to contami-nation with other cytokines (ie, interferon- /H9253, IL-4, and TNF-/H9251also having macrophage migration inhibitory activi- ties) in conditioned media samples from stimulated lympho-cytes. 717A small gene for purified, monomeric MIF, which has a molecular weight of 12,000 kD and does not sharehomology with IL-4 or interferon- /H9253, has been cloned.717,718 Further, MIF protein has been crystallized and analyzed byx-ray diffraction, thereby confirming that it is clearly distin-guishable from other cytokines with migration inhibitoryactivities. 719Native and MIF chemically factor, a but higher-molecu- lar-weight cytokine originally isolated by molecular sievechromatography, was found to inhibit neutrophil but notmacrophage migration. 722Similar to MIF, it was antigen specific and associated with delayed-type hypersensitivity.However, its significance was overshadowed by MIF, and itis no longer used as a bioactivity index of delayed-typehypersensitivity. Extensive research of purified MIF has fully established its importance as a critical T-cell proinflammatory cytokine in adiversity of human diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis,sepsis, the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, renalinfections, blunt trauma, reaction, diabetes,and atopic dermatitis. 698-723Recently, a significant associa- mild and the low expression, 5-CATTMIF allele, suggests that MIF may also play a role in asthmavia promotion of T H2 responses.724As a result of these associations, the bioactive profile of in vitro cell-mediatedimmunity may now be estimated by both functional andbiochemical assays of MIF. Current Methods Summary Statement 145. Other bioactive indices of cell- mediated immunity include cytotoxic assays, cultures ofmixed lymphocytes, and inhibition. (E) Summary Statement 146. Most cytokines and chemokines can be measured by commercial ELISA and ELISpot immu-noassays. (E)Summary Statement 147. Proinflammatory cytokines or chemokines, associated with cell-me-diated protein 1 (MIP-1), 1, 2, and 3. (B) Functional Assays Lymphocyte activation and proliferation Nonspecific assays are performed to evaluate the general responsiveness of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PB-MCs) or isolated T cells (10 6per well).725Appropriate reagents consist of Phytohemagglutinin test cell function, whereas and trichophyton) or other specific are addedto test wells containing isolated lymphocytes in accordancewith an optimal dose response protocol. In both specific andnonspecific assays, unstimulated lymphocytes serve as /H9262Ci of3H thymidine.726 are incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified carbon diox-ide incubator and followed 0 hours for spontaneous blas-togenesis, 3 days for phytohemagglutinin and concanava-lin A, 5 days for mixed lymphocyte culture assay, and 6days for pokeweed mitogen and specific soluble antigens.After an additional 3H thymidine pulse for 4 hours, cells are placed on a glass fiber mat using a cell harvester,scintillation fluid is added, and cells are counted for 1minute. Proliferative responses are reported as mean netcounts per minute (cpm) (experimental cpm /H11002control cpm) or preferably as a stimulatory index (experimentalcpm/H11004control cpm). 726 To circumvent the use of using radioactive reagents, non- radioactive alternative methods have been developed. One ofthese is based on the incorporation of a pyrimidine analog,5-bromo-2 1-deoxyuridine (BrdU) instead of thymidine into the proliferating cells. After suitable incubations, asdescribed herein, BrdU is detected by standard Autoantibodies Associated with Systemic Vasculitisa region of VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S61minescent ELISA detection systems.727,728T-cell activation can also be determined by an increase in intracellular aden-osine triphosphate, which occurs when cells proliferate. Aftercellular proliferation, adenosine triphosphate levels increaseand a linear relationship between cell concentration and aden-osine triphosphate level is proportional to light intensity,which can be measured by a luminescence assay. This tech-nique has the added advantage of requiring only small vol-umes of whole blood and results can be reported in 24hours. 729Currently, this technology has been cleared by the FDA for an in vitro phytohemagglutinin test (www.ibtreflab.com). Cellular cytotoxicity Cytotoxic function can be readily demonstrated in mixed lymphocyte culture techniques wherein irradiated effectorcells are incubated with varying proportions of 51Cr-labeled target cells. Cytotoxicity of target cells is detected by radio-active chromium release after suitable incubation. An alter-native, nonradioactive toxicity assay labels (EU) penta-acetic acid (DTPA)chelate. Lysis of labeled targets by effector T cells releasesthe EU-DPTA complex, which is measured in time-re-solved fluorometer. 730,731 Cytokine or chemokine release and histopathologicanalysis Depending on their stability in various media, most but not all cytokines can be measured by commercial ELISA and ELIS-pot immunoassays. 732Many of these immunoassays have sufficient sensitivity to be detected in small assay procedures can also be used to detect in vitro cytokine andchemokine synthesis and release from PBMCs cultured assays, which measured interfer-on- /H9253release from PBMCs stimulated with nickel sulfate, positively correlated with both positive patch test results andlymphocyte proliferation. 732Simultaneous measurement of multiple cytokines or chemokines in small fluid samples ofantibody-array techniques is emerging as a potentially usefulmethod. 733,734This assay combines the specificity of ELISAs, sensitivity and high-throughput of assays are available to measure macrophage migration: (1) indirect (2 step) and (2) direct (1 step).59,735In the indirect method, PBMCs are cultured with antigen to produce MIF,which is then assayed on indicator cells (human monocytes)at a different time. The direct method entails mixing PBMCs,antigen, and indicator cells (monocytes). MIF is producedlocally, and its effects are measured at the same time. Inhi-bition of migration is read at 18 to 24 hours. Functionalassays of MIF may be subject to false-positive results due tononlymphokine factors, such as antigen antibody complexesand the antigen itself, both of which might inhibit migration.Table 10.

S62 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYFalse-negative results may also occur because of individual variation of indicator cells. Because of their complexity andtechnical skill requirements, functional MIF in vitro assaysare not commercially available. They are used chiefly forresearch of patient populations rather than individual patients.However, they may be of adjunctive clinical value for pur-poses of identifying certain pathogenetic factors, monitoringthe results of therapy and the clinical course of patients withdepressed cell-mediated immunity. Immunoassays As discussed herein, direct measurement of several cytokines in blood, BAL, sputum, and other body fluids by commercialELISAs may act as biologic markers of acute or chronicinflammation /H9253release by peripheral lymphocytes has been recommended by the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention for diagnosis of latent tuberculosis. 465Increased serum levels of MIF have been found in range ofexogenous and autoinflammatory T-cell-mediated diseas-es. 698-707Normal serum concentrations to 8/H9262g/mL. In situ hybridization of MIF messenger RNA in macrophages can also be documented in delayed-type hyper-sensitivity skin lesions. 698 Nonspecific Screening Tests for Cellular ImmuneCompetency Summary Statement 148. Simple, cost-effective tests include (1) an absolute lymphocyte count, (2) the absolute number ofCD4 /H11001T cells, and (3) the CD4/H11001/CD8/H11001ratio. (B) Several simple cost-effective screening tests are available for the evaluation of competency of cell-mediated immunity.These include (1) an absolute lymphocyte count (a count lessthan 1,200/mm 3suggests an abnormal immune response); (2) number of total T cells, as measured by anti-CD3 surfacemarkers; (3) estimation of CD4 /H11001helper cell by immunofluorescence ap-propriate phenotypic /H11001CD29/H11001 T-cell of the percentage of CD4 /H11001, CD25/H11001Fox P3/H11001immunoregulatory T cells. The latter cells may be in- creased after successful allergen immunotherapy. Current Status of Cytokines and Chemokines These cellular products were first identified more than 25 years ago and new ones are being discovered almost everyyear. As of 2007, there are 33 recognized IL cytokines andmany more that do not have the IL designation. 696,741Tables 6 and 7 are summaries of selected cytokines and chemokines,respectively. They are derived from multiple cell sources andoften have redundant and overlapping biologic functions,which have been investigated extensively in knockout andtransfected animal models. Their chief utility in diagnosis ofhuman hypersensitivity is to determine the relative signifi-cance of cellular interactions involving dendritic cells, T-cellsubsets, NK-T cells, macrophages, NK cells, mast cells andepithelial cells in various immune inflammatory processes.For example, body tissue secretions that contain IL-4, IL-5,IL-10, and IL-13 are associated with IgE-mediated allergicinflammation, whereas the predominant cytokines found incell-mediated immunity inflammation are IL-12 and interfer-on- /H9253. Likewise, in situ hybridization techniques enable specific cytokines as TNF- /H9251and IL-5 are nonselective and eotaxin, RANTES, techniques. 688,693 For the most part, cytokine and growth factor identification and profiling in human disease are still research oriented.736- 741However, a number of reports suggest that cytokine pro- files may be useful in differential diagnosis of a variety ofhuman diseases. 742-749For example, serologic profiles may differentiate infectious from noninfectious uveitis and may beof prognostic value in acute pancreatitis. 742,743Similar reports concerning the utility of cytokine profiling for the diagnosisand follow-up of allergic or allergy-related diseases have alsorecently appeared. 734,750-760 Chemokines are small (8 to 10 kDa) proteins secreted by many immune and nonimmune cells with essential roles ininflammatory and immune reactions, including the late-phasecutaneous response. 697,761Although principally chemoattrac- tants, they have diverse functions during an inflammatory orimmune response, which involve cellular recruitment, activa-tion, and differentiation. 762The processes of intravascular rolling, tethering, and diapedesis of inflammatory arecomplex and also involve integrins, adhesion molecules, andselectins. 763-766The approximately 50 human chemokine re- ceptors and their corresponding ligands are classified on thebasis of the number and structural characteristics of canonicalcysteine residues (Table 7). 697,761,762Understanding chemo- kine biology is at times confusing because a single chemo-kine can bind to multiple receptors and vice versa. High serum levels of thymus and patients with allergic disease.758Once acti- vated and differentiated, TH2 cells for eotaxin, RANTES, and TARC. Human T cells express higher CCR4, with 767Lymphocytes of nonallergic asthma patients T H2 cytokines. CCL2 may enhance IL-4 production in activated T lymphocytes. Specific chemokines have been reported to be associated with TH1o rTH2 cytokine production.768Both 769Both IL-8 and eotaxin levels were increased in patients with severe asthma compared with patients with mildasthma. 770,771Fracktalkine (CX3CL1) contributes to mast cell recruitment in asthma.772Eotaxin levels are elevated in both aspirin tolerant and intolerant patients.773 Although there is increased expression of RANTES, CCR3, and CCR5 in lesional in atopic diseases. 775,776 OTHER DIAGNOSTIC IMMUNOLOGIC TESTS Summary Statement 149. Investigation of non-IgE and non- cell-mediated clinical immunologic disorders may requiretests that indicate abnormal adaptive and innate immunereactions. (B) Evaluation of non-IgE and non-cell-mediated clinical im- munologic diseases may include laboratory screening for (1)primary and acquired immunodeficiencies, (2) immune-me-diated gammopathies, (3) complement activation disorders,and (4) a diverse spectrum of autoimmune and vasculiticdisorders. Immunodeficiency The scope of diagnostic procedures for primary immunode- ficiency has been reviewed in the recently published PracticeParameter for Primary Immunodeficiencies. Current status ofimmune-based diagnostic and monitoring of HIV-acquiredimmunodeficiency and fully developed AIDS have been re-viewed elsewhere. 777,778It is generally agreed that HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4 cell counts are important predictors ofsubsequent virologic and clinical outcomes. 777 Immune-Mediated Gammopathies Summary Statement 150. Abnormal serum and urine proteins, including cryoglobulins, may be associated with several ab-normal malignant gammopathy. 779,780 Abnormal serum and urine protein levels are detected byelectrophoresis and immunofixation. Free light chains mayalso be demonstrated in serum. 781Cryoglobulins may also develop, and these are usually classified as type I, type II, ortype III. 782,783Type I contains a single monoclonal IgG, type II is a mixture of monoclonal IgG with polyclonal IgGs, andtype III is polyclonal IgGs of different isotypes,most frequently IgG and IgM. Types II and III are also calledmixed cryoglobulins. 784,785Cryofibrinogenemia may alsohave to be considered in the differential diagnosis of cold precipitable proteins.786 Nonspecific Tests of Immunologic Inflammation Summary Statement 151. The inflammatory consequences induced by immune functions may be detected by nonspecifictests, such as complete blood cell count with differential,sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and other acute-phasereactants. In some instances, functional assays of neutrophilsand macrophages may be necessary to pinpoint inflammatoryresponses. (B) Routine laboratory tests, such as a complete blood cell count with differential, sedimentation rate, C-reactive pro-tein, and other acute-phase reactants immunity. 787-789Functional assays of macrophages and neutrophils, the primary host defense cells, may indicateeither impaired defense (eg, decreased or absent chemotaxis,phagocytosis, bacterial killing, and cytokine or chemokinesynthesis) or uncontrolled inflammatory responses (ie, themacrophage activation syndrome). 790-793Neutrophil and mac- rophage function tests may only be available in specializedmedical centers. High ferritin levels associated with the mac-rophage activation syndrome can be used to monitor treat-ment of this disorder 792 Complement Activation Summary Statement 152. Evaluation of complement activa- tion with a decrease of C3 and C4 may indicate complementdeficiency, drug reactions, or the presence of immune com-plexes, which often are associated with increases in serumcryoglobulins and C1q binding. (B) Although complement is a major component of innate immunity to pathogenic microorganisms, it may also be ab-normally activated by adaptive immune pathways such asimmune complexes or cytotoxic antibodies. In most cases,these pathways of complement function can be estimated by immune hemolysis (CH 50and AH50) and a functional ELISA lectin binding pathway.794,795Decrease of C4 and C3 and increase in factor B are general screening tests forcomplement activation. 796-798Specialized laboratory centers can also determine individual complement components. Eval-uation of both inherited and acquired forms of complementdeficiencies, including C1 esterase inhibitor, have been dis-cussed in Practice Parameters of Immunodeficiency. Immunecomplex activation of complement may be associated with anincrease in serum cryoglobulins and/or an increase of C1qbinding. 153. Autoantibody profiles offer impor- diagnostic adjuncts in the diagnosis of collagen vasculardiseases, vasculitides, and cytotoxicity disorders. (B) Many tissue antigens are capable of provoking autoim- mune responses when the milieu of genetic susceptibility (ie,major histocompatibility subtypes) and environmental inter-action is apropos. The discoveries of rheumatoid factor and S64 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYantinuclear antibody in association with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, respectively, providedimpetus for the clinical significance of autoimmunity. 800Ta- ble 8 is a partial list of common autoantibodies and theirprevalence in corresponding autoimmune diseases. 800,801Thy- roid autoantibodies may occur in up to 30% of patients withCIU. 802,803IgG autoantibodies to IgE or the /H9251subunit of Fc/H9255R1 may also be demonstrated in approximately 40% to 50% of patients with CIU.804,805The diagnostic or pathophys- iologic significance of these autoantibodies in CIU is as yetindeterminate. Selection of any one or a combination of these tests should be predicated on a reasonable clinical pretest probability. Vasculitides Small, medium, and large vessel vasculitides are most com- monly diagnosed by characteristic clinical features and bi-opsy with demonstration of appropriate immune complexeswithin vessel walls. 800Some cases of palpable purpura are associated with type III cryoglobulins.780A low C1q antibodies806may be associated Several small associated with antineutro-philic cytoplasmic and glomerular basement membrane anti-bodies (Table 9). Human Cytotoxic Antibodies Antibodies of this type may induce hemolytic anemia, neu- tropenia, or thrombocytopenia. These conditions may occurspontaneously or in association with drug therapy. Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia includes paroxysmal nocturnalhemoglobinuria, paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria, and coldagglutinin disease. 807-810Direct and indirect Coombs tests are useful screening tests for red cell autoantibodies. A gel mi-crocolumn assay is purported to increase sensitivity. 811A quantitative antiglobulin consumption technique can detectIgG on granulocyte cell membranes, which occurs in the Felty syndrome. 812Because definitive tests are not generally available in most clinical laboratories, immune-induced neu-tropenia and thrombocytopenia are less well studied. 813-817 Drug-induced autoantibodies to red cells, neutrophils, andthrombocytes have been induced by a number of drugs butmost often they are associated with penicillin, propylthioura-cil, and quinine/quinidine, respectively. 818-827 Analytic Techniques The clinician should be aware that there is considerable interlaboratory variation of the methods described in thissection. Techniques that originally used agglutination, turbi-dimetry, nephelometry, double immunodiffusion, counterim-munoelectrophoresis, and indirect immunofluorescence Western blotting, and in some situationsimmunoblot assays. 828However, ELISA antinuclear antibody screening assays may lack sensitivity for certain collagenvascular diseases and therefore require confirmatory indirectimmunofluorescence tests. 829In recognition of these possible confounders, future diagnostic accuracy of these tests will bebased on likelihood ratios.830Because multiple autoantibodies tend to occur in autoimmune diseases by a process known asepitope spreading and specific autoantibody profiles mayhave greater diagnostic predictability or prognostication,multiplexed proteomic platforms are in current developmentfor SLE and 831,832As yet, optimal con- ditions for autoantigen arrays have not been established sothese high throughput measures will require thorough valida-tion in the future. 832 UNPROVEN TESTS Summary Statement 154. Procedures for which there is no evidence of diagnostic validity include cytotoxic tests, prov-ocation-neutralization, electrodermal testing, applied kinesi-ology, iridology, hair analysis, food specific IgG, IgG4,and IgG/IgG4 antibody tests. (B) Cytotoxic Tests The cytotoxic test is performed by placing a drop of whole blood or buffy coat as an unstained wet mount on a micro-scope slide precoated with a dried food extract. The techni-cian observes the unstained cells for changes in shape andappearance of the leukocytes. Swelling, vacuolation, crena-tion, or other cytotoxic changes in leukocyte morphology aretaken as evidence of allergy to the food. 833,834The test is time consuming and entirely subjective, and there are no standardsfor time of incubation, pH osmolarity, temperature, or otherconditions of the test. 835Controlled studies have shown that results are not reproducible and do not correlate with clinicalevidence of food allergy. 836-840It offers no reliable help in establishing a diagnosis of food allergy.836,837 Provocation-Neutralization This procedure is purported to diagnose allergy to foods, chemicals, inhalant allergens, and endogenous hormones.Varying concentrations of test extracts of these substances aregiven to the patient by intracutaneous or subcutaneous injec-tion or sublingually. The patient records all subjective sen-sations for 10 minutes afterward, and any reported sensationis taken as a positive test result for allergy. In the event of apositive test result, other doses of the same substance aregiven until the sensation has disappeared, at which point theaction is said to be \"neutralized.\" Some proponents recom-mend measuring increase in the size of the injected wheal inthe intracutaneous provocation procedure, but the primaryindication of a positive result is the provocation and neutral-ization of symptoms. This procedure has been evaluated bydouble-blind, placebo-controlled trials, which showed thatresponses to test substances are no different from responses to placebo. 841Furthermore, there is no rational immunologic explanation for provocation and prompt neutralization ofsubjective symptoms under these conditions. 841Application of neutralizing injections of milk and wheat in a patient withunsuspected urticaria pigmentosa resulted in a potentiallylife-threatening reaction. 842 VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S65Electrodermal Diagnosis This procedure measures changes in skin resistance while the patient is exposed to an allergen, either food or inhalant.Allergen exposure is done in various ways, the most commonof which is placing a sealed glass vial containing allergenextract onto an aluminum plate inserted in the electricalcircuit between the skin and the galvanometer. A drop in theelectrical resistance of the skin is said to indicate allergy.Although promoted by a single study, electrodermal testingor \"Vega\" cannot be recommended because its rationale isunsound and not evidence based. 843-845Two double-blinded, placebo-controlled, prospective studies revealed no signifi-cant differences between allergic patients and control, non-atopic volunteers. 846,847 Applied Kinesiology This technique is one in which change in muscle strength in extremities is measured before and after the patient is ex-posed to a test allergen. The usual exposure is performed byplacing a sealed glass vial of allergen extract on the patient'sskin. Measurement of muscle strength is measured in thecontralateral arm. 848Two controlled and blinded studies dem- onstrated that the technique was no more useful than place-bo. 848,849 Iridology Iridology attempts to relate the anatomical features in the iris to various systemic diseases.850Several systematic reviews concluded that iridology as a diagnostic tool does not havescientific validity. 851,852 Chemical Analysis of Body Fluids, Hair, or Other Tissues Based on unsupported theories that environmental chemicals induce allergies or a toxic effect on the immune system,certain practitioners have recommended measurement of var-ious exogenous environmental chemicals, particularly or-ganic solvents and pesticides in such endogenous substancesas amino acids, minerals, and various cytokines. These mea-surements have been made in samples of blood, urine, fat,and air. Exquisitely sensitive analytic chemistry techniquespermit detection of quantitation of almost any chemical atextremely low levels, but to date there has been no evidencethat allergic patients differ from nonallergic controls in theirbody burden of any of these compounds. Hair analysis has important uses in screening for metal intoxication, but this does not necessarily carry over to itsutility for nutritional deficiencies or chronic diseases. In onestudy, duplicate hair samples of 2 healthy volunteers weresent to 13 different laboratories that performed multimineralhair analysis. Reported levels of most minerals varied con-siderably among identical samples. Six laboratories recom-mended food supplements, but the types and amounts variedwidely. 853In another study, hair analysis samples in patients proven to be fish allergic by oral provocation were sent toseveral laboratories, which did not recognize fish-allergicpatients and, in fact, reported that other allergies were found in these individuals. 854Specific IgG Antibodies IgG antibodies to allergens such as foods can be detected and quantified by Unicap or ELISA techniques. The presence ofIgG antibodies, however, does not indicate allergy to theseenvironmental substances. Detection of IgG antibodies, IgGsubclasses, or IgG/IgG4 antibody ratios were discredited asreliable diagnostic tools. 855,856IgG antibodies to common foods can be detected in health and disease. This reflects thelikelihood that circulating immune complexes to foods occurin most normal individuals, particularly after a meal thatwould be considered a normal physiologic finding. It wastherefore concluded that food specific IgG or IgG subclassesshould not be used in the diagnostic evaluation of foodallergy. 857,858 PART 2 The purpose of this section is to provide evidence-based guidance about the application of in vivo and in vitro diag-nostic tests to the evaluation of 5 common clinical entities ofunique interest to the allergist/immunologist. An essentialprerequisite to understanding the variables posed during in-dividual clinical assessments is the potency and availabilityof allergens that are used in both in vitro and in vivo testprocedures. Only a few of the protein allergen extracts havebeen standardized in biologic or mass units (ie, house dustmite, cat, ragweed/grass pollens, and insect venoms). Cus-tomized extraction of unusual pollens or testing with freshfoods is sometimes necessary. Patch tests are often appliedusing nonirritant concentrations of commercial products towhich a patient is exposed. If positive, special patch tests torelevant components of the product are subsequently tested.Although some laboratories can prepare a customized solid-phase immunosorbent for unusual allergens (eg, occupationalchemicals, latex, drugs), the validity of such tests is unknown.Since keeping every available extract or patch test reactant inthe office stock is impractical and testing every patient forevery known allergen is unnecessary, the practicing allergistmust choose from current catalogs of commercially availabletest reagents. This poses a considerable dilemma for evalua-tion of CD since the commercially available FDA-approvedpatch test reagents (T.R.U.E. TEST) may only account for25% to 30% of clinical contact sensitivity problems so furthertesting may be needed. Each of the foregoing sections willaddress specific issues that are germane to that particularclinical topic. The situation with respect to diagnostic reagents required for specific IgE testing is somewhat more complicated be-cause of the rapidly changing technology. For example, in thecase of new, multiplexed arrays for measurement of specificIgE and the ability to test for many allergenic determinantssimultaneously, the anticipated use of component-resolveddiagnosis may pave the way for using recombinant markersor partially purified allergens. As each of these diagnosticreactants is introduced into clinical practice, prospective cor-relative studies will be required to validate their respectiveclinical utility. S66 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYALLERGENS Introduction and General Considerations Summary Statement 155. Although North American inhalant allergens are botanically and ecologically diverse, severalexpert committees consisting of members with botanic andmycologic expertise have compiled and selected 36 key al-lergens in North America, based on Thommen's postulates.(D) Summary Statement 156. For individual patients, the choice of test allergens is guided by the history and physicalexamination and the physician's knowledge, training, andexperience. (B) The catalogs of manufacturers that produce allergen ex- tracts or market in vitro tests list a wide range of pollens,molds, epidermals, insects, foods, and other substances avail-able for diagnostic allergy testing. Allergen extracts are com-mercially available for most recognized allergenic materials,although field collection and customized extraction of un-usual pollens or other substances or testing with fresh foodsis sometimes necessary. Allergen-bound solid matrix materi-als for in vitro immunoassay are available for approximatelythe same number of substances as skin test diagnostic aller-gen extracts, but some laboratories can prepare custom solid-phase immunosorbents for unusual allergens. Since keepingevery available extract in the office stock is impractical, andtesting every patient for every known allergen is unnecessary,the practicing allergist must choose from the variety of avail-able extracts. Because North America is diverse botanically and demo- graphically, it is not possible to devise a universal list ofappropriate inhalant, food, and other allergens for testing inall patients with a given symptom complex. For pollens,regional lists are available but have generally been unsatis-factory because such lists are either too broad for a given areain the region or are incomplete and inaccurate. Thus, theselection of extracts for testing can be guided, but not di-rected, by the sciences of botany and mycology. As previ-ously discussed, the range of extracts stocked in the allergyoffice should reflect the following: (1) recent local aerobio-logic data obtained by a qualified counting station; (2) cor-relation between patients' symptoms and aerobiologic data;(3) results of local and regional botanical and mold surveysconducted by a qualified botanist and mycologist, respec- tively; (4) knowledge of locally and regionally indigenousallergenic plants and other flora; (5) knowledge of foods inpatients' diets; (6) knowledge of fungi prevalent in outdoorand indoor air; (7) knowledge about the clinical significance(sensitization) of allergens in the region; and (8) knowledgeof cross-reactivity patterns between allergens. Unfortunately, this information is not available for all potential allergens, particularly the fungi, in all areas. Oftenone must rely on the opinions and experience of local col-leagues in stocking the skin testing laboratory. In some areas,consultation with a local or regional allergy-immunologytraining program might prove useful. The ImmunotherapyCommittee and the Allergen Subcommittee of the AAAAI compiled and selected 36 key allergens in North America(Table 10). For an individual patient, the choice of allergens for testing should be guided primarily by the patient's history and phys-ical examination and will reflect the physician's knowledge,training, and experience. Indiscriminate testing is inconve-nient to patients and office staff and is an unwise use of healthcare resources. Parameters for appropriate numbers of skintests have been suggested by the Joint Task Force on PracticeParameters for Allergy and Immunology, distributed by theJoint Council of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology and re-considered in the previous section on \"Numbers of SkinTests.\" The Skin Testing Form Summary Statement 157. A well-designed skin test or labo- ratory ordering form should provide useful information to theordering physician, his/her staff, health care providers, andother physicians who may be consulted in the future. (B) A well-designed skin testing form or laboratory test order form should reflect the physician's knowledge oflocal aerobiology, foods, and possibly other substancesthat may have clinical relevance. Knowledge about cross-reactivity is also an essential prerequisite in the design ofthis form. As an important part of the medical record, theform should provide useful information to the orderingphysician, as well as to other physicians and health careproviders. At a minimum, a skin/laboratory testing form should in- clude the following: (1) name, address, and telephone numberof the physician; (2) the patient's name and the date oftesting; (3) name or initials of the person performing testing;(4) method(s) used for testing, (ie, prick, puncture, intracu-taneous; laboratory method); (5) measurement of reactionsizes of both wheal and erythema in mm should be recorded,and numerical grades (0- /H110014) are not recommended; (6) con- centration at which allergens are tested for codeine phosphate) used for positive control(composition of material used for negative control); (8) re-sults of positive and negative control tests (in millimeters);(9) an unambiguous common name for all allergens tested;(10) when allergen mixes are used, a listing of the individualcomponents and precise ratio of the extract mix; (11) since itis not practical to record extract source, manufacturer's lotnumber, and expiration date on the skin testing form for manyclinicians, these records may be kept separately; and (12) forspecific IgE testing, the quantitative result (in kIU/L) ispreferred to \"class\" results. The following are optional: (1) binomial Latin nomenclature (ie, Poa pratensis ) for pollens and fungi in addition names (Kentucky bluegrass) or genericdesignations ( Baccharis spp). The manufacturers of allergen VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S67extracts and in vitro materials are encouraged to provide this information both in their catalogs and on product labels; (2)arrangement of test allergens by botanical classification; (3)especially in academic centers, it is useful to include timingof pollination periods. A typical example of a skin test formis included in the subsequent section on \"Evaluation of In-halant Allergy.\" Specific Allergen Types Pollens Summary Statement 158. The best indicators in the selection of appropriate pollens for clinical use are extensive preva-lence in the air and concurrent allergy symptoms duringannually recurrent seasons when such pollens are expected tobe present in the ambient air. (B) Regional native plant geography is relatively well defined for most areas, and lists of prevalent plants in various floristiczones are available from various sources. 235,239,859,860Such lists, however, do not generally consider various plants suchas trees being introduced as ornamental species. Therefore,lists are only a starting point and should not be taken literallyor overinterpreted. In selecting appropriate pollens for clinical use, the com- bination of extensive prevalence in the air and accompanyingallergic symptoms during annually recurring periods remainsthe best indicator of potential importance. Well-standardizedaeroallergen collection procedures can generate comparativedata from year to year and from collection station to collec-tion station in various localities and floristic regions. Thesedata can be used to establish the dates of onset and ending ofa flowering season, identify peak days of pollination, andquantitate the types and numbers of pollen and spores duringthe seasons of the year. Clinical application of these datashould consider the following. First, collection sites relatively close to each other can have both quantitative and qualitative differences in da- ta. 239,247,262,263,861Second, single-site collection in a community can only roughly estimate an individual patient's actual ex-posure. Use of a personal sampler worn throughout the day athome or at work may provide more meaningful data inselected cases. Spore and pollen counts may vary by as muchas 1,000 times at certain sites of activity. 248,862Third, in many regions, several plant species concurrently shed windbornepollens that are both antigenically similar and morphologi-cally indistinguishable, making it impossible to discriminatemajor from minor source species even after extensive sourcesurveys. Botanical groups that especially reflect this diffi-culty in North America include the grasses, the chenopod-amaranth complex, and the ragweeds. 863Many families of anemophilous plants, however, include 2 or more (and oftenmany more) species with pollens that are similar in form, allergenicity, and distribution. 863In some of these groups, 1 or more shared allergens determine partial or complete cross-reactivity, but pollens of related species may contain distinc-tive or unique allergenic epitopes, as well as shared determi-nants. 251,252-256,260,863When available, cross-reactivity data cansimplify testing when sensitization has been demonstrated not to be species specific. These principles of cross-reactivity arebest illustrated among grass and tree pollens. Rye, timothy,blue, and orchard grasses share common allergens and arefrequently considered to be allergenic have separate and distinct allergenic proteinsand therefore should be tested separately when there is sig-nificant clinical exposure. Various trees also share majorallergens, including elder, birch, oak, hazel, and beech. Juni-per and cedar, trees of the cypress family, share commonallergens with the elder-birch family despite the fact that theyare separate and distinct species. Unfortunately, characterization of cross-reactivity patterns between species or within families or other botanic groupshas proceeded slowly. Since clinically relevant allergenicdifference among related pollens occur commonly, valid sin-gle \"representatives\" of such groupings seldom can be iden-tified. 256,260When common airborne pollens cannot be judged to be interchangeable in allergen content, testing and treat-ment with multiple locally prevalent pollens may be requiredto avoid clinically significant omissions. Fourth, the dose response relationship in pollinosis or asthma is often difficult to define. The degree of clinicalsensitivity varies from the very sensitive patient with overtsymptoms at low pollen concentrations to those only devel-oping symptoms at high concentrations. Data on thresholdlevels are available only for grass and ragweed pollens in some patients, a level of 50 grains/ m3was required to affect all sensitized grass patients.860In some patients who are ragweed sensitive and already \"primed,\" 7 to 15 pollen grains/m3provoke symptoms.865,866 Fifth, pollens exposed to atmospheric pollutants may have increased allergenicity.867,868The increased number of allergic individuals in regions with high levels of air pollution may bea function of this factor rather than simply an alteration ofairway permeability to allergens. 869 Sixth, diverse factors, including air temperature, relative humidity, body position, ocular stimulation, respiratory in-fection, simultaneous exposure to airborne irritants, and otherpollens, may modify response to a specific pollen chal-lenge. 235,243,262,264 Seventh, sensitization and allergy in children may depend on pollen load, with the influence of pollen load strongest onthe development of specific IgE and less on skin test reac-tivity and manifest allergies. 870-872 Eighth, magnitude of pollination or spore production does not alone denote clinical relevance of airborne pollens. Pinepollens and Cladosporium spores appear in great numbers but seem less sensitizing than grass and tree (eg, oak and birch)pollens or Alternaria spores, which seem to be sensitizing at low levels in ambient air. 836Pine pollen, in fact, is nonsen- sitizing. S68 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYNinth, skin reactivity or specific IgE tests may be shown to pollens that occur at low levels or not at all in aerobiologicsurveys. In such cases, it is arguable that sensitization hasoccurred at levels not generally considered high enough toprovoke symptoms, that apparent sensitization reflects shar-ing of 1 or more allergenic epitopes with other importantpollen types (ie, cross-reactivity), that sensitization reflectsexposure to sufficiently high concentrations of a clinicallyrelevant anemiophilous pollen, that the results of the aeroal-lergen survey are not applicable to the patient's actual envi-ronment, or that the demonstrated sensitization is not clini-cally relevant. In most of such situations, the truth remainsobscure and may vary from site to site. When a patient ishaving clear-cut seasonal symptoms unexplained by results ofroutine testing, the clinician might consider testing with moreesoteric allergens, perhaps based on a home visit. Fungi Summary Statement 159. The clinical significance of a single fungus test reagent may be difficult to ascertain because ofimportant confounders, such as sampling method, cultureconditions, nonculturable species, be-tween spores and hyphae, and preferential ecologic niches.(A) Summary Statement 160. For clinical purposes, molds are often characterized as outdoors ( Alternaria and Cladospo- rium Alternaria, Aspergillus, andPenicillium species). (B) Although there is diversity of opinion regarding the prev- alence and clinical importance of fungal allergy, there is astrong sense among clinicians that fungi contribute to symp-toms of respiratory allergy, with the dark-spored (dematia- ceous) asexual forms especially implicated. Apart from theassociation of spore blooms with thunderstorms, there is littleevidence, however, linking exposure to well-defined singleagents with isolated or recurring periods of morbidity. 873,874 Establishing the practical importance of the various aller- genic fungi involves many of the same basic problems facedin pollen allergy. 261,262,264,265,267-269,872These include a large number of potentially sensitizing species, uncertain allergenicrelationships, and limited aerobiologic data. In addition, fungipresent distinctive concerns such as the limited value of fieldstudies when sources are microscopic, the apparent extremebiologic diversity of the organisms within the deuteromyceteform genera, the need to identify many fungus colonies inculture, the relative importance of apparently potent sensitiz-ers in both indoor and outdoor environments, and difficulty inidentifying many spores of the fleshy fungi. For clinical purposes, molds are often characterized as outdoor ( Alternaria andCladosporium species) and/or indoor (Aspergillus andPenicillium species). Traditional gravity or Rotorod air sampling equipment does not collect fungalspores as efficiently as pollens, and many counting stationshave made no attempt at differentiating among the variousfungal forms. 263,266Several taxa of deuteromycetes (eg, major Cladosporium species) occur universally in all but the coldest regions. Therelative prevalence of even the common types, however,remains to be defined by aeroallergen sampling methodshaving high sampling efficiency for small particles (ie, sporetraps). Since isolated spores within and among many groupsof fungi are similar, species determinations require carefulstudies of isolates in culture. Present efforts to achieve thesebasic and essential goals are still at an early stage of devel-opment for the deuteromycetes, although molecular charac-terization of airborne fungal spores appears to be a promisingadvance. 269The identification of the Ascomycetes andBasid- iomycetes is complicated by failure of many of these organ- isms to produce distinctive growth on laboratory media. Formost Basidiomycetes , this is a modest limitation since field collections readily provide spores for extraction and insightinto relative species prevalence. Ascospores, however, typi-cally originate from minute fruiting bodies that are not easilyfound or identified. Even when laboratory propagation isfeasible, the spore harvest tends to be sparse. As a result, fewstudies of human reactivity to ascospores or basidiosporeshave been recorded, of both groups is demonstrable. 875These cur- rent investigations may lead to the inclusion of some of theseorganisms in future routine clinical testing. When the fungal extracts are grown in the laboratory, the source of specific organism for propagation and the culturemedia selected for use should be explicitly noted. Increasingevidence suggests that, at least among the Deuteromycetes , individual species should be assumed to differ allergenicallyuntil proven otherwise. Fungal extracts should derive fromauthenticated species and be labeled accordingly; extractsbearing only generic designations should be rejected. Labels,skin testing sheets, and specific IgE test reports should reflectcontemporary nomenclature, avoiding discarded designationseven if these are familiar. When recent taxonomic changethreatens confusion, both the new and old names should besupplied. At no time should extracts of a single organism besupplied under 2 or more deuteromycetal synonyms. Thehistoric tendency of taxonomists to give distinctive names todifferent life cycle stages of single fungus organisms is a factthat all must recognize. Although it is often proper to relateselected Deuteromycetes to their sexual stages, which are more reliably classified, product labeling should show fromwhich growth form(s) the extract was derived, that is, thesexual or asexual stages. At present, the optimal preparative approach for fungus extracts has not been defined, although a systematic evalua-tion of available options is clearly overdue. Such compari-sons must confront the tendency, especially among the Deu- teromycetes , to undergo somatic mutation and antigenic shifts under extended culture conditions. In addition, possible im-munospecific differences among strains of single taxa, onprimary isolation, are suggested by limited experience. Thesesources of diversity are of special concern because methodsfor assaying extracts for major fungal allergens are still VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S69rudimentary. Similarly, the potential of fungus enzymes to degrade allergens of diverse origins (including other fungi)should be continually evaluated in practice. The apparentprimary importance of airborne spores as dispersive vectorsfor many common fungi is evident, but this does not precludea clinical role for hyphal and secreted products. Possibleallergenic difference among spores, hyphae, and metabolicproducts have been suggested without the emergence of de-finitive proof. Pending resolution of this issue and recogniz- ing that advantages of using separated spores may stillevolve, it seems appropriate, at least for Deuteromycetes ,t o base fungal extracts on actively sporulating whole colonies. 876 On the basis of this approach, the major allergen of Alterna- ria alternata (Alt a 29 subsequently Alt a 1) has been iden- tified.877 Insect and acarid allergens Summary Statement 161. Five Hymenoptera venom extracts are available for evaluation of anaphylactic reactions to hon-eybee, yellow jacket, yellow hornet, white faced hornet, andPolistes wasp. A whole-body extract is the only currently available diagnostic reagent for fire ant sting allergy. (A) Summary Statement 162. Major inhalant acarid and insect allergens include several species of house dust mite andcockroach. (A) Venom extracts are widely accepted as the standard re- agents for diagnostic testing and immunotherapy for Hyme- noptera anaphylactic allergy. The major allergenic venom proteins have been identified and most have enzymatic ac-tivities. Honeybee venom, the most thoroughly studied, con-tains the major allergen, Api m I, phospholipase A, apamin 158,878Trace kinins and histamine have been found in wasp venom.879,880 Five Hymenoptera venom extracts are available for clinical use: honeybee, yellow jacket, yellow hornet, white-facedhornet, and Polistes wasp. Honeybee venom is collected by inducing bees to sting against an electric grid. Commercialvespid venoms are primarily collected by microscopic dis-section of individual venom sacs. Venoms are supplied aslyophilized powder to be reconstituted with special diluentcontaining pasteurized HSA as a stabilizing agent. Venom skin testing is the most useful and sensitive immu- nologic procedure for confirming immediate hypersensitivityto venoms. 183,881Circulating levels of venom specific IgE may be measured in the laboratory.132The original RAST method is less sensitive than skin tests, but current methods (eg,ImmunoCap) demonstrate substantial improvement of sensi-tivity. 882,883The significance of skin or in vitro sensitization is unclear when the sting history is negative, but the conversesituation (negative test, results positive history) is also prob-lematic. 131,159 The venoms used for treatment are the same as those used for skin testing. In cases of sensitivity to multiple venoms, amixture of yellow jacket, yellow hornet, and white-facedhornet venoms is available for treatment. 158,884Imported fire ant whole body extract is the only reagent presently available for diagnostic testing and immunotherapyfor fire ant sting allergy. 885Although most imported fire ant whole body extracts appear to be useful for diagnosis andtreatment, some preparations contain variable concentrationsof relevant venom allergens. One possible explanation forvariability among imported fire ant whole body extract prep-arations may be seasonal variation in antigenic activity. Onestudy revealed a more than 100-fold difference in phospho-lipase activity in extracts prepared from ants collected inearly summer compared with winter. Solenopsis invicta imported fire ant venom is currently available only for research purposes. Unique among Hyme- noptera venoms, fire ant venom contains 95% Sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the commercialimported fire ant venom product revealed bands identical tothose found in pure fire ant venom at approximately 15, 26,28, and 37 kD. These bands represent the molecular weightsof the 4 allergens identified in imported fire ant venom (Soli, I, II, III, and IV). 887Monoclonal antibody assays have been developed for all of the antigens. Sol i 1, the venom phos-pholipase of imported fire ant venom, cross-reacts withvespid venom. 888All 4 Soli proteins are important allergens. Most patients react to all 4 allergens, whereas some reactalmost exclusively to a single allergen. Mosquitoes (Diptera) and fleas (Siphonaptera) pierce the skin with their needle-like mouth parts and feed directly in acapillary or a pool of extravasated blood. 889Antigens respon- sible for mosquito bite reactivity include 4 different nondia-lyzable components extracted from the head-thorax portion ofthe mosquito and, more specifically, a high-molecular-weightprotein fraction isolated from the oral secretions. A dialyz-able low-molecular-weight material has been extracted fromthe oral secretion of the flea. Antigens involved in thesereactions have been obtained from extracts of whole body,body segments, and oral secretions of both mosquitoes andfleas. Studies of the efficacy of immunotherapy with whole-body extract of these insects have yielded variable results.The use of the low-molecular-weight hapten isolated fromflea saliva has been anecdotally effective. 889 The most commonly reported and well-characterized ana- phylactic type of reaction to biting insects ( Hemiptera )i s caused by the saliva of the genus Triatoma of the reduviid group.890These are called kissing bugs, cone nose bugs, or assassin bugs and are commonly found in the southwesternUnited States from Texas to California. Rohr et al havereported the successful treatment of 5 patients with anaphy-lactic reactions to Triatoma , using immunotherapy with extract. 891 Several other biting insect allergens have been identified and partially purified. Baur and coworkers have isolated,characterized, and analyzed the amino acid sequences of thespecific antigenic proteins from the midge, Chironomus thummi already shown by other investigators to cause asth- S70 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYma.892Baur et al demonstrated that chironomid hemoglobins were the major inhalant allergens and of midge hemoglobins were cross-reactive in RASTinhibition studies. Exposure to fish food containing midgelarvae is a possible inhalant source of sensitization. 893 In the past decade, there has been an upsurge of home infestations by the multicolored Asian lady beetle, Harmonia axgridis . Hypersensitivity symptoms, reported.894 Inhalant insect allergens have long been recognized as possible causes of clinical sensitivity. The earliest recognitionof this problem occurred in patient populations exposed toswarming mayflies or caddis flies at certain seasons of theyear. 895Localized mini-epidemics of asthma have also oc- curred after exposure to dust from insect larvae.896More recently, the importance of cockroaches as an indoor allergenhas been emphasized. 897The major cockroach allergens (Bla g I and Bla g II) have been isolated. Other inhalant allergensources have also been identified, although not all have beenpurified. The proteins share similar immunochemical proper-ties with other known allergens in that they are abundantlyavailable, retain their tertiary structure, and have the appro-priate size for airborne dispersal and inhalation. House dust mites are a major source of the house dust allergen worldwide. 898,899House dust mites also are major causes of asthma.900The pyroglyphid mites dominate and The major allergens of D ptero- nyssinus (Der p I, Der p II) and D farinae (Der f I, Der f II) have been characterized. Tovey et al showed that dust mite feces contain the clinically significant aeroallergen of housedust. 902Krills et al demonstrated many distinct D pteronys- sinus allergens.903 Epidermals Summary Statement 163. Animal clinical sensitivity is most often associated with domestic pets (cats, dogs, birds) andlaboratory animals (rodents, rabbits). Specific testing isguided by history of appropriate animal exposure. (A) Animal allergen sensitization may result in either trivial or severe symptoms and may be both socially and occupation-ally important. Selection of animal allergens for testing isgenerally guided by history of animal exposure. Exhaustivetesting is rarely indicated. Cat allergen extracts have beenwell characterized (ie, Fel d l) and are derived from seba-ceous glandular protein in skin. To a lesser extent, allergenscan also be identified in cat saliva. Standardized cat extractsare commercially available. Similar antigen characterizationstudies are now available in several rodent laboratory ani-mals. Urinary allergens have also been demonstrated in thesespecies. Other mammalian extracts have been less carefullystudied, but clinically relevant sensitizations are easily de-monstrable to dog (the major allergen of which is Can f I),birds, and farm animals. On occasion, customized extractpreparation is indicated for evaluation of sensitization to more exotic animals, including those found in zoos. Foods Summary Statement 164. Selection of food tests for IgE- mediated clinical sensitivity is usually tailored to the patient'stemporal history, which may be supplemented by a fooddiary. (A) Immediate or IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to foods may be particularly important in infants and young children. Manyof these clinical responses are severe and result in anaphy-laxis. 613In children younger than 3 years, the most important food allergens include milk, egg white, peanuts, soybean, andwheat. The prevalence of clinical sensitivity to food appearsto decline with age based on evidence that positive skinreactivity confirmed by double-blind oral food challenge isless than 2% of the general adult population. Despite theseobservations on relative prevalence, any individual at any agecan develop IgE-mediated sensitization to foods that cantrigger symptoms in gastrointestinal, skin, or respiratory or-gans. All clinicians caring for allergic patients must thereforebe aware of the indications for and limitations of food testing.Nearly any food can be allergenic, and cross-reactivity cannotgenerally be assumed. The absence of reactivity to one mem-ber of a group of botanically related foods cannot be taken asevidence for the lack of sensitivity to other foods in thegroup. Although many food allergens have been well char-acterized, standardized food extracts are not available. Patient history is important in the selection of foods for testing, and a patient's spontaneous history may be supple-mented by a meticulous diary of foods eaten and symptomsobserved. This approach is indicated primarily in patients with the potential for food-induced and food-dependent ex-ercise-induced anaphylaxis. Testing for the most commonallergenic foods usually detects most suspected food hyper-sensitivity, although more tests may be required dependingon the clinical situation. Many clinicians test with a limitedpanel of commonly allergenic foods when food allergy issuspected and there is no clear-cut history of symptomsoccurring after exposure to specific foods. Exhaustive testingto the 200 or so foods available for skin or specific IgE testingin patients presenting with anaphylactic reactions is rarelyindicated. The diagnostic yield and cost effectiveness of sucha strategy have been seriously questioned. 271,272The routine use of food prick tests when the history is negative for foodallergy is not justified. Testing to a food product not com-mercially available may be indicated in certain clinical situ-ations. Furthermore, testing with commercially available ma-terials may produce false-negative results because ofalteration of relevant allergens by storage, cooking or thedigestive process. Additionally, the allergens of many plant-derived foods are labile, and testing with the fresh product orprick-prick testing may be necessary. This is especially ger-mane in the case of fruits and berries. Aerosolized foodproteins in certain occupational settings such as bakeries, VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S71crab processing, or spice factories may induce severe forms of respiratory sensitization. Antibiotics, other drugs, and chemicals Summary Statement 165. Although commercial skin tests for drugs, biologics, and chemicals are not available, specializedmedical centers prepare and use such tests under appropriateclinical situations. The validity of such tests is adjudged on acase by case basis. (C) IgE-mediated mechanisms are implicated in adverse reac- tions to many antibiotics, pharmaceuticals, and biologic insulin, protamine, heparin, streptokinase, andchymopapain. Penicilloyl skin allergenic determinant in penicillin(ie, a penicilloyl major catabolic product) and detected 80%of penicillin-sensitive patients, is no longer commerciallyavailable. Many severe reactions, however, can only be con-firmed by minor penicillin metabolic determinants, whichoccur in lower (minor) concentrations. 153,154Routine clinical testing for standardized minor determinant mixtures is notfeasible because they are not commercially available. Somephysicians test with aged penicillin as a surrogate for minordeterminants in the hope that minor determinants will formon aging; however, studies of these aged test preparationshave not confirmed that this occurs. Some medical centersprepare major and minor determinants in their own laborato-ries. Cross-sensitivity to penicillin analogues, includingamoxicillin and imipenem, ofreactive metabolites derived from the /H9252-lactam ring.156Cross- sensitivity to 1 of the monocyclic /H9252-lactam antibiotics, az- treonam, has not been demonstrated thus far, and this drugcan be used with caution in patients with known prior peni-cillin sensitivity. It is also estimated that 6% to 15% ofpenicillin-sensitive patients will exhibit cross-sensitivity tothe first generation of the cephalosporin family of drugs, butthis may be as low as 1% to 2% in the case of second- andthird-generation analogs. Standardized skin test reagents forprediction of cephalosporin sensitivity are not available. Re-cently, it has also been demonstrated that a significant pro-portion of patients with clinical histories of /H9252-lactam antibi- otic sensitivity and immediate skin test reactivity respondonly to side-chain specific determinants. 904The diagnostic validity of commercially available specific IgE tests for alldrugs, including penicillin, has not been confirmed. It isemphasized that negative specific IgE test results do not ruleout the possibility of penicillin allergy, and therefore suchtests should not be used to detect penicillin allergy. In centers that have proper reagents, penicillin skin tests should be used to evaluate the likelihood of an immediatehypersensitivity reaction in a patient with a history of apenicillin reaction when the clinical requirement for penicil-lin is strongly indicated and an effective alternate antibioticcannot be substituted. 905Under these conditions, 2 scenarios are possible. A skin test-negative patient may receive peni-cillin without anticipated problems. A skin test-positive pa-tient will require rapid oral or parenteral desensitization topenicillin with close monitoring in the hospital. Skin tests may also be used to determine whether IgE-medicated mech-anisms were involved in a reaction that occurred in the recentpast. It has been argued that penicillin skin testing could beperformed in individuals who have had a history of non-life-threatening reaction to penicillin to prevent antibiotic resis-tance (eg, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus) and allowmore efficacious and cost-effective selection of antibioticssince, in most instances, such patients have been found not to be penicillin-sensitive when skin tested and subsequentlychallenged. 905This has been considered to be especially use- ful in the pediatric age group in which antibiotic use forpharyngitis, otitis media, and various other infections is fre-quent and recurrent. Routine penicillin testing before admin-istration of penicillin or related analogs in a history-negativepatient is not recommended. Sulfonamide adverse reactions have increased significantly since the advent of AIDS. Approximately 30% of thesereactions are attributed to IgE mechanisms, as detected bypositive skin test results with an immunogenic metabolite,sulfamethoxazoyl-poly-L-tyrosine. 906Most adverse reactions are due to toxic hydroxylamine metabolites, which induce invitro cytotoxic reactions in peripheral blood monocytes ofpatients with AIDS. 907-909Clinical confirmation of these re- actions may be accomplished by a cautious graded oral chal-lenge protocol. If a positive response is obtained, an extendedoral desensitization or graded tolerance regimen is begun. 910 Similar oral challenge testing and graded challenges havebeen accomplished with aspirin, isoniazid, rifampicin, sul-fasalazine, and allopurinol. 911 Skin and in vitro tests may be used to detect sensitivity to vaccines that contain egg protein, other biologic large-mo-lecular-weight materials (enzymes, protamine, insulin, heter-ologous monoclonal immu-noglobulin preparations, and other blood products), andcertain other drugs such as suxamethonium muscle relaxants.These materials are not available commercially. and testmaterials are usually prepared locally with fresh materials.Appropriate concentrations for testing with these materialshave not been well studied in large groups of patients andcontrols. The predictive value of negative skin or in vitro testresults to these substances is therefore not known, and testscan only be interpreted in the context of an individual pa-tient's clinical situation. For example, in the case of reactionsto vaccines that contain traces of egg protein, other proteinsunrelated to egg may account for some reactions and thatmost egg-allergic children may tolerate such vaccines (ie,MMR vaccine). 912 Large- and small-molecular-mass additives in foods anddrugs Although rarely considered, many chemicals (sulfonechlor- amide, azodyes, fragrances, parabens, vegetable gums) con-tained in food and drugs or used for processing biologicmaterials may induce classic IgE-mediated reactions. Large-molecular-weight substances may also induce similar reac- S72 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYtions. Excipient chemicals may also induce contact urticaria (ie, butylated, hydroxyanisole). In addition to IgE-mediatedreactions, many excipients in food and drugs contain a sizablenumber of agents that may cause ACD. Allergenic food anddrug additives and excipients have been reviewed extensivelyelsewhere. 913 Occupational Allergens Summary Statement 166 . More than 300 low- and high- molecular-weight occupational allergens have been identi-fied. Test reagents for these agents are generally available inspecialized occupational allergy centers. (A) More than 300 occupational allergens have been report- ed. 266Many of these are large molecular weight substances that only occur as significant inhalant agents in certain industriallocales. In addition, a large number of low-molecular-weightsubstances, anhydrides, metallicsalts, azo dyes, have been shown tocause allergic symptoms by classic immunologic mecha-nisms. A complete listing of these agents is available. 276If exposure to these compounds is by respiratory route, asthmaand/or hypersensitivity pneumonitis may ensue. The epider-mal route of exposure may induce ACD, the most commonimmunologic occupational disease. Less commonly, skin sen-sitization may also evoke clinical respiratory allergy. 276 Miscellaneous Plant Products Summary Statement 167 . A variety of plant or plant-derived proteins or glycoproteins may be associated with systemicallergic symptoms. (A) A variety of other plant products has been associated with allergic symptoms. These include kapok, papain, in hospitalgloves, airborne sources, and medical appliances have in-creased in clinical importance since the introduction of uni-versal barrier precautions. Although NRL standardized skintest extracts are not commercially available, they exhibitsuperior sensitivity for detecting NRL clinical sensitivity incomparison to FDA-approved specific IgE assays. 914-916Test- ing with nonstandardized reagents from commercial sourcesor prepared locally is generally guided by clinical history ofsymptoms after exposure. Various vegetable gums are \"hid-den\" ingredients of commercial food and drug products, anda clear patient history of exposure is rare. In fact, they are soprevalent in the diet that exposure may be assumed. Testingwith vegetable gum extract may be indicated in selected patients with clear-cut symptoms not otherwise explained. Contactant Allergens Summary Statement 168. Chemicals, plant resins, and lipid constituents are the chief causes of ACD, which requirespatch testing for confirmation. (A) Chemicals, plant resins and lipid materials are the chief causes of classic ACD. Complex topical medications maycontain potential antigens and additives. The major compo-nent of a complex mixture may not be the sensitizer. The 23 antigens in the FDA-certified T.R.U.E. TEST detect 25% to 30% of all cases of ACD. 469,504For this reason, an updated panel of 65 allergens has been designatedby the North American Contact Dermatitis Group. After thisscreening test panel, selected allergens based on the patient'shistory must then be used to supplement the screening panel(see section, \"Evaluation of Contact Dermatitis\"). General Principles of Cross-reactivity of Plant-Derived Allergens Summary Statement 169. As previously emphasized, knowl- edge of specific patterns of cross-reactivity among tree, grass,and weed pollens is essential in preparing an efficient panelof test reagents. (A) Summary Statement 170. Although cross-reactivity among related pollen families can usually be ascribed to specificepitopic determinants, more diffuse cross-reactivity due toplant profilins and cross-reactive carbohydrate determinantsmay also be present. (A) Summary Statement 171 . Cross-reactivity data on fungi are extremely sparse. (C) Botanical taxonomy may be used to infer cross-reactivity, but this assumption depends on 2 premises. The first is thatthe more closely related plants are, the greater will be theirsimilarities and shared antigens. The second premise is thatthe present botanical classification truly reflects phylogeny.Two plants in the same genus might therefore be expected toshare at least some allergens, 2 in the same family shouldshare a lesser number. Distantly related plants would beexpected to show little if any cross-reactivity. However, evenin closely related species, unique allergenic epitopes mayexist and have clinical relevance. 239 Cross-reactivity data on pollens are limited and extremely sparse on fungi. Pollen data suffer in some cases from beingderived from older techniques, being incomplete, or beingoccasionally contradictory. Several more recent studies in-vestigating characterized allergens have addressed cross-re-activity in a limited fashion. There have been few attempts tocollate this information 859,917(see Allergome.com). Data on conserved epitopes between genera and families have beendiscussed previously under \"Number of Skin Tests.\" Trees Available information reveals marked diversity, with little cross-reactivity except some notable exceptions. 253,255-257Co- nifers of the Cypress family (including cypresses, cedars, andjunipers) strongly cross-react. Thus, testing with a singlemember is probably adequate in most clinical situations. Theother conifers do not cross-react. 917Members of the 2 closely related birch and beech families (beech, oak, birch, alder,hazel) cross-react with each other within the family but notcompletely across family boundaries. The birch family mem-bers appear to be the most closely related 918,919; testing with 1 or 2 should be adequate in most clinical situations. The olivefamily shows moderate cross-reactivity among olive, privet, VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S73and ash.255,920Information on other tree families is too frag- mentary to make useful recommendations. Indeed, a recentstudy failed to show correlation between regional pollencounts and percutaneous reactivity to tree pollens grasses belongs to Fescue subfamily or the northern pasture grasses. Extensiveresearch with the rye group antigens (eg, Lol p I) suggestsshared antigens and strong cross-reactivity across most of themembers of this subfamily that have been studied 921-925; how- ever, complete cross-reactivity rarely occurs. Timothy andJohnson grasses may possess additional unique antigens. 926In most clinical circumstances it is reasonable to test with Tim-othy and/or Johnson grasses and 1 or 2 locally prevalentnorthern pasture grasses. Southern grasses, such as Bermudagrass, show greater diversity and should be tested separatelyin areas where these are common or when dealing with amobile population. Bermuda, although not sharing majorallergens with the northern pasture grasses, has been shownto cross-react with some western prairie grasses of minorsignificance. 927,928Bahia grass likewise does not appear to cross-react with northern grasses.929 Weeds The composite family contains a number of potent sensitiz- ers, the most important of which are the ragweeds of thegenus Ambrosia . Short ragweed has been the most exten- sively studied, and several major and minor allergens aredescribed. Information on which ragweeds contain the major allergens Am b a I (antigen E) is conflicting, but by RAST inhibition the 4 major species (short, giant, western, and falseragweed) all strongly cross-react. 587Other members of the same tribe and other composites do not cross-react.930,931 Recent data on the sages and mugworts(genus Artemisia ) suggest strong cross-reactivity.252Thus, in many critical cir- cumstances it may be reasonable to test for 1 or 2 Ambrosia species and a single Artemisia . Other compositae should betested separately. The Chenopod and Amaranth familiesare closely linked and contain plants of major importance,especially in the western United States. Members show vary-ing degrees of cross-reactivity, even across family lines. 859,932 TheAtriplex weeds (salt bushes, wing scale, shad scale) are nearly identical antigenically, and testing for a single locallyprevalent species should be adequate in most cases. TheAmaranthus weeds (eg, redroot pigweed and Palmer's ama- ranth) are likewise almost identical, whereas another memberof the family, western water hemp, shows some differences.The 2 major tumbleweeds, Russian thistle and burning bush,show only partial cross-reactivity. Lamb's quarters shows thelargest degree of cross-reactivity with other family members.In endemic areas, testing for Russian thistle, burning bush, anAmaranthus, and an Atriplex should be sufficient in most clinical situations.Allergen Compendium The choice of extracts for testing and treatment should be continuously refined in accord with scientific advances, bo-tanic and aerobiologic surveys, demographic trends, andavailability of relevant, defined reagents. Practice must bedirected by the best documented concepts of allergen preva-lence, geographic distribution, and immunochemical relation-ships. From time to time patients may present with symptoms caused by previously unidentified substances that could bepotential new allergens. There is a role for testing thesepatients with properly prepared extracts of a new allergen.There is insufficient evidence, however, to justify tests forsuch agents as newsprint, sugar, cornstarch, tobacco smoke,orris root, cotton, smog, formaldehyde, and human dander. An entirely satisfactory basis for establishing guidelines for choice of allergen extracts is not currently available. Abroad listing of allergens, based on botanic and aerobiologicsurveys of North America, the catalogs of various extract, andspecific IgE test manufacturers and miscellaneous othersources is presented in Table 11. For the pollens, fungi(currently alphabetical by genus), and foods, the list is orga-nized taxonomically. For other allergens, the list is alphabet-ical within categories. The most current Latin binomial no-menclature is used, and older names are listed in parentheses,for example, Aureobasidium (Pullularia ). Likewise, the most commonly encountered vernacular names are listed and syn-onyms (some of which are more colloquial than factual) areprovided in brackets. The use of the common English namesfor definitive identification of regional plants is not advised.For instances, the tree commonly called Chinese elm (imply-ingUlmus parvifolia ) is properly termed Siberian elm ( Ulmus pumillia ). Similarly, the term cottonwood may apply to 5 or more species in the genus Populus . Although reasonably comprehensive, the list is not exhaustive. Pollens and other allergens not in these lists were omitted because they werejudged to lack current evidence of allergenic impact. Numer-ous substances on the list are included even though theyprobably are of minor importance. It is difficult to make clinically relevant recommendation for testing with fungal extracts. In the listing of fungi, variousorganisms have been classified on the basis of what is cur-rently known about prevalence and clinical activity. Primarilybecause of problems of procurement and manufacture, how-ever, the capacity of many commonly prevalent spores toelicit IgE-mediated sensitization has not been evaluated. Italso seems likely that sampling in previously unstudied situ-ations will reveal new important forms; therefore, any listmust admit later additions and corrections, as analyses ofcollections become more factual.

S98 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYSummary Statement 173. A skin prick/puncture test is superior to intracutaneous testing for predicting allergic rhi-nitis and allergic asthma triggered by cat allergen exposure.(B) Summary Statement 174. The skin prick/puncture test can be used to rule out allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma trig-gered by cat allergen exposure. (B) Summary Statement 175. Knowledge of allergen cross- reactivity and local aerobiology is important in selectingappropriate allergens and in minimizing the number of aller-gens required for skin and specific IgE tests. (D) Summary Statement 176. In general, skin prick/puncture testing is more sensitive for identifying sensitization to in-halant allergens and confirming clinical allergy. However,dated specific IgE assays with defined quantifiable thresholdlevels can also predict positive respiratory responses afterallergen exposure. (B) Summary Statement 177. Demonstration of sensitization to an occupational agent by specific IgE and/or skin testingalone is insufficient to establish a diagnosis of OA. (B) Summary Statement 178. Skin prick testing with certain well-characterized occupational protein allergens possessesadequate sensitivity such that a negative skin test result(/H110213-mm-wheal diameter) can be used to rule out clinical allergy. (B) Summary Statement 179. Test performance characteristics of specific IgE assays and skin testing for detection of chem-ical IgE-mediated sensitization must undergo validation andreproducibility in controlled studies using standardized anti-gens and assay protocols before these can be consideredreliable for routine evaluation of workers suspected of OA. (B) Summary Statement 180. In patients undergoing evaluation for suspected work-related natural rubber latex (NRL) al-lergy, a positive skin prick test result with a NRL extract (ifavailable) is preferred to demonstration of elevated specificIgE with an FDA-cleared assay due to higher sensitivity ofthe former. Current IgE-mediated allergy and asthma causedby NRL allergens is highly unlikely in the presence of anegative skin prick test result with a reliable crude NRLallergen extract. Elevated in vitro specific IgE levels can beused to confirm NRL allergy, but a negative result does notexclude NRL allergen sensitization. (B) Clinical Indications and Utility Skin testing and specific IgE evaluation of specific IgE are methods used to demonstrate IgE-mediated sensitization toinhalant allergens. In clinical practice, skin and/or specificIgE testing that demonstrate specific IgE for inhalant aeroal-lergens are utilized to (1) confirm or exclude a suspecteddiagnosis of allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis, or asthmatriggered by aeroallergens; (2) determine the need for envi-ronmental control recommendations to reduce exposure tooutdoor or indoor aeroallergens; (3) demonstrate sensitizationto inhalant occupational allergens, which cause OA or rhini-tis; and (4) guide selection of inhalant allergens for inclusion in allergen immunotherapy extracts. A clinician must be familiar with performance charac- teristics of skin testing and specific IgE measurement sothat test results are applied accurately to diagnose and treatallergic respiratory disorders. To optimally define testperformance, a method should be reproducible and vali-dated against a diagnostic benchmark or gold standard. Amedical history is subjective and not adequate alone fordefining clinical sensitivity or specificity of in vivo orspecific IgE tests. 101,120-123,933Evaluation of symptoms or physiologic responses during direct allergen challengetests under supervision of a physician or in associationwith natural exposure to inhalant allergens (ie, pollen, cat,house dust mite) are appropriate ways to validate skinprick/puncture tests, intracutaneous tests, and specific IgEassays. 111,167,934Although such validation studies are lim- ited both in number and scope of allergens evaluated, theyprovide objective evidence for defining test characteristics,including sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, andlikelihood ratios. Performance of Skin Tests in Evaluation of Inhalant Allergy In clinical practice, skin prick/puncture testing is used as an initial screening test and is often followed by intracutaneoustesting for inhalant allergens eliciting negative prick testresults. This long-standing practice is based on the assump-tion that intracutaneous testing has greater sensitivity thanskin prick/puncture testing. However, there is evidence that apositive intracutaneous test result at a fixed dose of 1:500 or1:1,000 (wt/vol) in the absence of skin prick reactivity cor- relates poorly with clinical sensitivity. 167,171When seasonal allergic rhinitis was confirmed by nasal challenge with grasspollen allergen, only 11% of patients with positive intracu-taneous test results (and negative prick/puncture test results)exhibited a positive challenge test result, and this outcomewas identical to symptomatic patients with negative intracu-taneous test results. In contrast, 68% of symptomatic patientswith skin prick/puncture test reactivity to grass pollen exhib-ited positive nasal challenge test results. 167Based on history alone, a positive skin prick/puncture test result to cat definedby a wheal 3 mm or greater than the negative control pos-sessed 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity. 97Wood et al reported that skin prick/puncture testing using a 27-gaugehypodermic needle exhibited 94% sensitivity, 80% specific-ity, 90% positive predictive value, and 87% negative predic-tive value for identifying subjects with increased upper re-spiratory tract symptoms elicited by live cat exposure. Foridentifying subjects with lower respiratory tract symptomsafter cat exposure, skin prick testing had 84% sensitivity (vs35% for intracutaneous tests), 87% specificity, 88% positivepredictive value, 82% negative predictive value, and 97%sensitivity for predicting a reduction in FEV 1during live cat challenge.111 VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S99In allergic rhinitis patients, skin prick/puncture testing with a standardized cat extract was validated by symptom scoresand nasal mediators collected after direct intranasal allergenchallenge (Table 12). 935In this study, a 3.0-mm-diameter wheal cutoff for a positive test result provided 100% sensi-tivity and 100% negative predictive value. As indicated inTable 12, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysiswas used to identify optimal wheal size cutoff points fordifferent validation methods. For example, when increasedsymptom scores after nasal allergen challenge were used asthe gold standard, a prick/puncture wheal diameter cutoff of5.5 mm increased test specificity to 89%, albeit at the expenseof sensitivity (88%). This study illustrates the potential valueof measuring prick/puncture wheal dimensions for predictingclinical respiratory sensitivity. 936 As discussed in part 1, SET of intracutaneous tests achieves similar sensitivity and specificity compared withnasal challenge, but the intracutaneous threshold dose is 1 to2 logs more dilute than 1:1,000 (wt/vol). 90 In Vitro IgE Immunoassays for Evaluation of AllergicRespiratory Disorders Due to Inhalant Allergens Since introduction of the Phadebas RAST assay in 1967, specific IgE assay technologies have evolved considerably. 937 Performance characteristics of in vitro specific IgE tests havebeen determined largely by studies that rely on medicalhistory and questionnaire-derived diagnoses of allergic rhini-tis and prick/puncture tests as the standards for test valida-tion. 104,122 The ROC analysis has been used to determine optimal thresholds for defining a positive PHADEZYME assay. Class2 binding or 0.7 to 3.5 Phadebas units (PRU)/mL exhibitedoptimal sensitivity and specificity in identifying skin pricktest-positive patients with clinical history of allergy to grasspollen, cat epithelium, and birch pollen. 934The ROC analysis has been applied to determine optimal cutoff values for thePharmacia CAP specific IgE assay. In a case-control study,optimal cutoff values differentiated between symptomaticand asymptomatic patients with positive skin prick test resultsto allergens of interest. 120These thresholds were 10.7 kU/L allergens and 8.4 kU/L for perennial allergens. In1 report, estimated sensitivity and specificity of the RAST-CAP-FEIA for identifying pollen allergy were 79% and 72%, respectively, and the positive predictive value was only9.3%. 122In a validation study of subjects with clinical allergy to house dust mites, an optimal cutoff threshold value forPhadezyme RAST for mite was determined to be more than3.5 PRU/mL by ROC analysis or at least class III. Using 3.5PRU/mL as a positive threshold, RAST sensitivity and spec-ificity were 84% and 77%, respectively, vs 100% and 32%for dust mite skin prick testing. 934 The Phadezyme RAST and CAP-RAST system have been well validated for predicting cat allergy confirmed by live catroom challenges. 111In this model, increases in upper respira- tory tract symptoms or lower respiratory tract symptoms andreduction in FEV 1of 15% are defined as positive challenge responses. When a positive test result was defined as valuesgreater than 0.35 kIU/L, RAST had 87% and 91% sensitivityand specificity, respectively, in identifying those subjectswith confirmed upper respiratory tract symptoms to cat chal-lenge. Sensitivity of RAST was 76% in subjects with lowerrespiratory tract symptom responses after cat challenge andtest specificity was 95%. In this study, skin prick testing hadgreater sensitivity (79%) than RAST (69%) for identifyingpositive challenge responders, and both tests were highlyspecific ( /H1102290%). 111 In summary, the precise role of in vitro testing in clinical diagnosis of allergy to common inhalant aeroallergens isuncertain. Based on limited data, validated specific IgE as-says tests can be useful in confirming clinical sensitization tocertain allergens (eg, cat). Because skin testing has greatersensitivity than in vitro IgE tests, a negative serologic testresult cannot be relied on for excluding clinical sensitivity toinhalant allergens. In Vivo and In Vitro Testing in Diagnosis of Occupational Allergic Disorders Agents that cause OA and related disorders are broadly classified into categories of low-molecular-weight (princi-pally chemicals) and high-molecular-weight substances(animal and plant proteins) (Table 13). Both OA andrhinitis due to high-molecular-weight proteins are usuallyIgE mediated, whereas OA caused by chemical agents isTable 12.

In the latter case, immunologic testing has not been shown to be diagnostically useful.Although proving sensitization to occupational agents isinformative, demonstration of decrements in lung functionwith exposure to the causative agent is necessary to con-firm a diagnosis of OA. There are few commerciallyavailable occupational protein antigens. Test antigens forassessing sensitization to chemicals have been preparedand evaluated in individual research laboratories and arenot generally available. Chemicals Chemical antigens that have been used to evaluate specific antibody responses use antigens that are prepared by conju-gating chemicals with a protein (eg, HSA). However, becauseprotocols for assays, reference positive and negative controls,and conjugate preparation methods have not been standard-ized, results obtained from different laboratories are not com-parable. For most chemicals that cause OA, skin prick testingis not indicated with the exception of a few agents that areknown to induce IgE-mediated haptens that form by proteins. 946Phthalic suitable sensitization to phthalic anhydride. 947In a in which occupational rhinitis and OA were confirmedby challenge testing, acid anhydride-HSA skin prick testingexhibited 71% sensitivity and 80% specificity. 947Persulfatesalts are common ingredients in hair bleaching products. Positive skin prick test results with ammonium persulfate salt solutions indicate that IgE-dependent mechanisms appear toplay a role in persulfate induced OA, but there is inadequateexperience to define test performance characteristics. 942Al- though positive skin test results have been detected in anec-dotal cases of diisocyanate asthma, skin prick testing withdiisocyanate-HSA antigens has low diagnostic sensitivity. 947 Skin prick testing with hexachloroplatinate salts, (PtCl6)2-,has been used for many years to confirm sensitization toplatinum salts in refinery workers. 944In a validation study, 82% of workers responding to the specific inhalation chal-lenge had positive skin prick test results with (PtCl6)2-,whereas 18% were skin test negative. 945Thus, specific chal- lenge testing was necessary to confirm OA. In several studies of workers suspected of diisocyanate asthma, performance characteristics of in vitro IgG and IgEimmunoassays were evaluated against results of specific in-halation challenge tests, which is considered to be the diag-nostic gold standard for diisocyanate asthma. 948-950Elevated serum specific IgE levels by the ELISA method exhibited31% sensitivity and 97% specificity for identifying workerswith confirmed diisocyanate asthma, whereas sensitivity andspecificity for IgG was 72% and 76%, respectively. 900Tee et al reported diagnostic sensitivity of 32% and 100% specific-ity for elevated diisocyanate HSA specific IgE measured byPhadebas RAST (positive test result defined as a RAST ratioof/H113503) and that assay sensitivity was optimized when sera were collected during active workplace exposure to diisocya-nates. 950There are limited data pertaining to in vitro cellular immune assays for diagnosing of OA due to chemicals.Elevated in vitro production of MCP-1 production by mono-Table 13.

VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S101nuclear cells after stimulation with diisocyanate-HSA anti- gens exhibited 79% sensitivity and 91% specificity in iden-tification of exposed workers with confirmed OA.Replication of these results, however, in larger diisocyanate-exposed populations is needed before this assay is adopted forclinical use. 951 Protein Allergens in the Workplace Inhalant proteins encountered at work readily induce sensiti- zation and elicit allergic contact urticaria, rhinoconjunctivitis,and/or asthma at work. In general, skin prick testing withprotein allergens (or high-molecular-weight sensitizers) arehighly sensitive tools for evaluating workers with suspectedOA. In the case of NRL, skin prick testing has greatersensitivity compared with FDA-approved in vitro specificIgE assays. 916 A nonammoniated latex extract was reported to possess both high sensitivity (99%) and specificity (100%) at a testconcentration of 100 /H9262g/mL in identifying health care work- ers with latex allergy based on medical history.952,953In a study that confirmed NRL induced OA based on responses tocontrolled challenge with NRL gloves, pricktesting specificity. Specific IgE reactive with NRLwas not evaluated in this study. 954However, a negative skin test result alone virtually excluded NRL-induced OA definedby a positive specific inhalation challenge. 954Among health care workers reporting a history of NRL allergy, skin pricktesting with standardized commercial NRL extracts has su-perior sensitivity for detecting NRL sensitization comparedwith FDA-approved in vitro specific IgE assays. 914-916An important practical limitation in the United States is the lackof a standardized commercial NRL skin test reagent. Becauseuncharacterized powdered glove extracts prepared by physi-cians have variable diagnostic sensitivity (64% to 96%), anegative test result must be interpreted cautiously. 955In a recent study, CAP and UniCAP immunoassays identified53% to 77% of NRL skin test prick-positive health careworkers with latex allergy. 956 A similar study design was used to investigate test char- acteristics of skin prick testing with a commercial bovineallergen extract (1:100 wt/vol), which provided 100% sensi-tivity, 50% specificity, and 100% negative predictive value inidentifying OA based on specific challenge testing with bo-vine dander extract. On the other hand, bovine dander spe-cific IgE measured by quantitative fluoroenzymatic immuno-assay (UniCAP) exhibited 82% sensitivity and 100%specificity. 957 Finally, in a study of workers exposed to industrial en- zymes that used specific inhalation testing as the diagnosticgold standard, investigators reported 100% sensitivity and93% specificity for skin prick testing with enzyme solutions(10 mg/mL) compared with 62% enzyme allergosorbent IgE assay. 958ASSESSMENT OF FOOD ALLERGY An adverse reaction to food can result from nonimmune (eg, intolerance, pharmacologic effects) or immune (allergy) ori-gins. Immune-mediated adverse reactions to foods (food al-lergy) may be to IgE antibody-mediated mecha-nisms (eg, food-induced anaphylaxis), cellular mechanismswith no detectable food specific IgE antibodies (primarilygastrointestinal disorders), and disorders in which both IgEantibody-mediated and cellular mechanisms have been iden-tified (eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, atopic dermati-tis). 959 Summary Statement 181. The primary tools available to evaluate patients' adverse reactions to foods include history(including diet records), physical examination, prick/punctureskin tests, serum tests for food specific IgE antibodies, trialelimination diets, and oral food challenges. (B) The general aims of diagnosis are to determine if food is causing the disorder under evaluation and, if so, to identifyspecific causal food(s). A proper diagnosis will allow thepatient to receive instructions regarding avoidance of prob-lematic foods. Just as important, specific diagnosis will pre-vent unnecessary and potentially deleterious dietary restric-tions when a suspected food allergy is not present. Thediagnostic tools available to the clinician include simple andrelatively inexpensive tests, such as the clinical history, phys-ical examination (that may reveal associated atopic disordersand raise the likelihood of a food allergy 960), prick/puncture skin tests, and serum tests for food specific IgE. Additionaltests (oral food challenges) are more involved timewise, maybe more expensive, and may carry additional risks. Therational selection and interpretation of diagnostic tests requirean appreciation for the utility of the tests themselves and anevaluation of the level of certainty required for the diagno-sis. 959 Summary Statement 182. A detailed dietary history, at times augmented with written diet records, is necessary todetermine the likelihood that food is causing the disorder,identify the specific food, and determine the potential immu-nopathophysiology. (D) The history is the starting point at which the clinician must decide on the possibility that food is a potential cause of adisorder or reaction. The features of the reaction may alsoindicate whether the pathophysiology of the disorder may benon-immune-mediated (intolerance, pharmacologic reaction)or allergic, and if the latter, whether it is IgE mediated orassociated or not (thereby guiding further diagnostic evalua-tion). Historical points of interest include age of the patient; a list of suspect foods, ingredients, or labels for manufacturedproducts; the amount of food necessary to elicit a reaction;the route of exposure eliciting a reaction; the typical timeinterval between exposure and onset of symptoms; clinicalmanifestations of reaction(s) after exposure to each food;duration of symptoms; ancillary events (exercise, use ofNSAIDS, alcohol); treatment of reactions and patient re- S102 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYsponse; and the consistency with which a reaction occurs on exposure. Key points in the history, such as symptoms and timing of onset after ingestion or chronicity, may identify reactionslikely to be dependent on IgE antibody (eg, sudden reactionssuch as anaphylaxis), those that are associated with IgE toparticular foods in many but not all cases (eg, chronic disor-ders such as atopic dermatitis), or disorders not associatedwith IgE antibodies or ones unlikely to be allergic in nature(eg, lactose intolerance, isolated gastrointestinal disorders ofinfancy). 959 In addition to identifying a pathophysiologic basis, the history may indicate specific food triggers and a starting pointto estimate the probability that a particular food is causal (eg,prior probability of an association). Diet records, includingreview of labels from packaged foods, may facilitate identi-fication of specific triggers. 961,962Common reasoning would indicate that a food previously tolerated on a routine basis isless likely to be a trigger than one eaten rarely. Similarly, fora person with a previously confirmed food allergy to a ubiq-uitous food (eg, milk, peanut) who reacts to a specific meal,consideration that the previously identified allergen may bepresent as a hidden ingredient or contaminant should beentertained. Age is important since the epidemiology of foodallergy indicates a higher probability of reactions to cow'smilk, egg, wheat, and soy in infants; peanuts, tree nuts,seafood, and raw fruits in older children and adults; and apredilection of certain 959Consistent reac- particularly acute ones, to a specific food raise theprobability that the food is causal; in 1 study of infants,specificity of urticaria after ingestion of cow's milk was 0.77,but specificity of atopic dermatitis was only 0.22. 95Indeed, the history is notoriously poor in identifying causal foods forchronic disorders such as atopic dermatitis when comparedwith outcomes of definitive oral food challenges. 590,960,963 Food allergy is commonly suspected but rarely incriminatedin chronic urticaria and/or angioedema. Summary Statement 183. With regard to evaluations for IgE antibody-associated food allergies, tests for food specificIgE antibody include percutaneous skin tests (prick/puncturetests) and serum assays. In general, these tests are highlysensitive (generally /H1102285%) but only modestly specific (ap- proximately 40% to 80%) and therefore are well suited foruse when suspicion of a particular food or foods is high. Theyare not effective for indiscriminate screening (eg, using pan-els of tests without consideration of likely causes) and there-fore generally should not be used for that purpose. (B) Modalities to determine the presence of IgE antibody to specific foods include prick/puncture tests and serum assays.Both techniques merely detect the presence of antibody (sen-sitization) and do not necessarily indicate, by themselves, thatingestion would result in clinical reactions. Even infants canbe tested. 95,964Commercial reagents for food allergy skin testing have not yet been standardized and may have varyingconcentrations of relevant proteins. 965,966Clinically importantbut labile proteins, particularly ones in fruits and vegetables, may degrade, making extracts inadequate for an evaluation;fresh extracts may therefore be needed to evaluate sensitiza-tion to these allergens. 965A retrospective review of medical records (1,152 children) concerning prick/puncture tests withfoods indicate a very low rate of generalized reactions (521per 100,000 tested; 95% confidence interval, 105-937), butall reactions in infants (n /H110056) occurred in infants younger than 6 months of age tested with fresh food specimens. 967 Another means to detect food specific IgE is serologic to determine the presence of food specific IgE antibodies in theserum. There are a variety of manufacturers, substrates, andmanners of reporting results as discussed in part 1. The clinical utility of prick/punctures testing and serum food specific IgE has been evaluated in various referralpopulations of infants and children evaluated by oral foodchallenges for suspected food allergy. 140,589-591,960,963,968-970 Sensitivity of a positive test result is generally more than 0.7and in most studies exceeds 0.85; specificity is lower, gen-erally in the range of 0.4 to 0.8. Test utility varies by intrinsicfeatures of the test (technique, definition of positive, type offood) and features of the population tested (age, disease).These test characteristics generally indicate that a negativetest result has a high utility to rule out IgE-mediated reactionsto the food tested but that a positive test result may not beassociated with true clinical reactions. Consequently, panelsof food allergy tests should not be performed without con-sideration of the history because one may be faced withnumerous irrelevant positive results (particularly in disorderswith high total IgE antibody). 960The serum assay for specific IgE may be less sensitive than skin prick tests,970,971so if there is a suspicion of a reaction when in vitro test results arenegative, a skin test may detect sensitization. 589However, in many cases the sensitivity is similar.589,590,960 Summary Statement 184. Intracutaneous skin tests for foods are potentially dangerous, are overly sensitive, increasethe chance of a false-positive test result, and are not recom-mended. (D) Intracutaneous allergy skin tests with food extracts give an unacceptably high false-positive rate, can elicit systemic re-actions (rarely an issue for prick tests), and should generallynot be used. 972 Summary Statement 185. Based on studies in infants and children, increasingly higher concentrations of food specificIgE antibodies (reflected by increasingly larger percutaneousskin test size and/or higher concentrations of food-specificserum IgE antibody) correlate with an increasing risk for aclinical reaction. (B) Studies in children support the notion that increasingly higher concentrations of food specific IgE antibody, reflectedby increasingly larger prick/puncture test results or highserum IgE antibody concentrations, are correlated with in-creased risks for clinical reactions. 85,589,590,968-973Thus, instead of considering a test result for IgE as positive or negative withone decision point (positive-negative at \"detectable\" serumfood specific IgE or a particular skin test size such as 3 mm), VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S103additional clinical utility may be achieved through consider- ation of prick/puncture test result size and serum food-spe-cific antibody concentration. Various studies have correlatedreaction likelihood with test results in this re-gard, 85,140,589,590,964,968-973but it is clear that results may vary by technique, food involved, age group studied, the specificpatient history, and the disorder under consideration. Al-though the size of the prick/puncture skin test result orconcentration of food-specific IgE antibody by in vitro assaymay be positively correlated with an increasing likelihood ofa clinical reaction, the level of IgE is poorly correlated withclinical manifestations of the allergy (eg, severity or dosecausing a reaction). 974-976 Summary Statement 186. A trial elimination diet may be helpful to determine if a disorder with frequent or chronicsymptoms is responsive to dietary manipulation. (D) In the evaluation of disorders with chronic symptoms for which foods may be causal (eg, atopic dermatitis, gastroin-testinal symptoms), elimination of suspected causal foodsmay be undertaken to determine whether symptoms are dietresponsive. There are no studies to define the utility of thisapproach. Factors that may complicate interpretation of sucha trial (eg, a trial failure when the disorder is truly foodresponsive) include incomplete removal of causal foods, se-lection of the wrong foods to eliminate, inadequate timeallowed for resolution of chronic inflammation (eg, atopicdermatitis), and additional triggers may be causing symptoms(eg, skin infection in atopic dermatitis). The underlyingpathophysiology is not a significant consideration in usingelimination trials. Selection of foods to eliminate may bebased on a variety of factors, including historical features,results of tests, and epidemiologic considerations. Informa-tion concerning strict adherence to the diet must be carefullyreviewed, similar to what is needed for treatment of foodallergy after a definitive diagnosis. Diets may vary fromdirected ones (removal of one or a few targeted foods), evenmore restricted ones with elimination of most allergenicfoods (eg, a prescribed diet without major allergens andlimited numbers of allowed foods), or even to extreme oneswith essentially no source of potential allergen (eg, use ofamino acid-based formula alone or with a few other provensafe foods). A positive response to an elimination diet shouldnot be construed as a definitive diagnosis unless there iscompelling supportive evidence regarding specific foods. An-other use for an elimination diet is to establish baseline statusbefore undertaking oral food challenges; the response to oralfood challenge is potentially definitive but must be performedfor each food under consideration. Severe reactions haveoccurred when previously ingested, IgE antibody-positivefoods were added back to the diet after they had been re-moved from the diet for a period. 977 Summary Statement 187. Graded oral food challenge is a useful means to diagnose an adverse reaction to food. (B) The oral food challenge is performed by having the patient ingest increasing amounts of the suspected food under phy-sician observation over hours or days. 961,962This represents adefinitive test for tolerance since ingestion of a relevant amount of the food with no reaction excludes the diagnosis ofan adverse reaction to the tested food. The test result is opento misinterpretation when not done in a masked manner.Therefore, procedures to reduce this possibility need to beimplemented, such as masking the challenge substance(blinding) and using placebos. The format of a food challengecan be applied to evaluate any type of adverse event attrib-uted to foods due to both allergic and nonallergic hypersen-sitivity mechanisms. The challenge procedure, its risks, and its benefits must be discussed with the patient and/or the caregiver. Several fac-tors are considered, including the evaluation of the likelihoodthat the food will be tolerated, the nutritional and social needfor the food, and ability of the patient to cooperate with thechallenge. In limited circumstances, the food could be ad-ministered with potential adverse reactions monitored athome by the patient and parents. This may be considered ifthe expected adverse reactions are delayed in onset, non-IgEmediated, atypical (eg, headache, behavioral issues), mildgastrointestinal, and not potentially anaphylactic. On theother hand, if there is a reasonable potential for an acuteand/or severe reaction, or if there is strong patient anxiety,physician supervision is recommended. Except in the uncommon circumstances described previ- ously, oral food challenges are undertaken under direct med-ical supervision. A risk evaluation must be made regardinglocation of challenge (office, hospital, intensive care unit) andpreparation (eg, with or without an intravenous line in place).These decisions are based on the same types of data evaluatedfor the consideration of food allergy in the early diagnosticprocess: the history of the possible food allergic reaction,patient's medical history, and prick/puncture skin test results.Although generally considered a safe procedure when under-taken by qualified personnel, it must be appreciated that oralchallenges can elicit severe, anaphylactic reactions, so thephysician must be immediately available and comfortablewith this potential and be prepared with emergency medica-tions and equipment to promptly treat such a potentiallylife-threatening reaction. 978In high-risk challenges, it may also be prudent to have intravenous access before commenc-ing challenges. 962,979Even non-IgE antibody-mediated food allergic reactions can be severe, such as food protein-inducedenterocolitis syndrome that may include lethargy, dehydra-tion, and hypotension, and may be complicated by acidosisand methemoglobinemia. 980The details regarding undertak- ing an oral food challenge are described in the publishedFood Allergy Practice Parameter and other resources. 961,962,981 Challenges can be performed openly, with the patient ingest-ing the food in its natural form; single-blind, with the foodmasked and the patient unaware if the test substance containsthe target food; or double-blind and placebo-controlled, withneither patient nor physician or medical professional knowingwhich challenges contain the food being tested. Although theopen challenge is most prone to bias, it is easy to performsince no special preparation is needed to mask the food. S104 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYIndeed, if the patient tolerates the ingestion of the food, there is little concern about bias. Bias becomes an issue when thechallenge food causes symptoms, particularly subjectiveones. Therefore, open challenges are a good option forscreening when several foods are under consideration, and ifa food is tolerated, nothing further is needed. If there is areaction to an open challenge used in the clinical setting, andthere is concern that the reaction may not have been physi-ologic, the format could be altered to include blinding andcontrols. False-negative rates for double-blind, placebo-con-trolled food changes are low (usually /H113493%). 982After a neg- ative challenge, consideration should be given to having thepatient eat the food prepared in the same manner and amountthat caused the original reaction. Summary Statement 188. A number of additional diagnos- tic tests are under investigation, including APTs (APTs) andtests for IgE binding to specific epitopes. (B) Various additional diagnostic tests, particularly APTs, are under evaluation and are at various stages of acceptance orstill under research scrutiny investigation of food aller-gy. 95,523-530,983-985The test response is noted in the days after application and may potentially identify food triggers that arenot associated with IgE antibodies, which is a particular issuefor gastrointestinal food allergies. 945,947Although increasing studies, primarily from Europe, are assessing the utility ofthese tests, more work is needed on standardization andclinical correlation before widespread routine clinical use canbe advocated. 946Several recent European experiences suggest that the ultimate utility of APTs in reducing the need for oralfood challenges may be limited. 526,530Additional diagnostic tests under development may use proteins of particular rele-vance or map informative protein epitopes for improveddiagnosis of IgE antibody-mediated reactions. Summary Statement 189. The rational selection, applica- tion, and interpretation of tests for food specific IgE antibod-ies require consideration of the epidemiology and underlyingimmunopathophysiology of the disorder under investigation,estimation of prior probability that a disorder or reaction isattributable to particular foods, and an understanding of thetest utility and limitations. (D) Tests for food allergy, like other medical tests, are neither 100% sensitive nor 100% specific. The diagnostic utility of atest in regard to making a diagnosis in an individual patient isinfluenced by (1) the possibility of the disease existing in theindividual being tested (prior probability) and (2) the char-acteristics of the test itself (sensitivity, specificity). To deter-mine prior probability, it is necessary to undertake a carefulhistory and to understand the epidemiologic features of foodallergic disorders. Description of the latter is beyond thescope of this Practice Parameter but may be found in re-views 959,986,987and the Food Allergy Practice Parameter.981 To evaluate the clinical utility of a test, studies are per- formed comparing outcomes of oral food challenges (prefer-ably double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges).Many studies use open food challenges with objective symp-toms as an end point, or sometimes they rely on convincing clinical histories. Such studies have reported skin test sizes above which clinical reactions are virtually 100% likely (eg, wheal diam-eter/H113508 mm for cow's milk or peanut and /H113507 mm for egg in infants) or levels of IgE antibody at or above which reactionsare more than 95% likely (eg, 7 kIU/L for egg, 15 kIU/L formilk, 14 kIU/L for peanut and 20 kIU/L fish, mea-sured by Pharmacia CAP-System FEIA) in atopic children ata median age of 3.8 years. 85,589This approach is helpful in identifying persons who are likely to be clinically allergic, forwhom an oral food challenge is not indicated. Conversely,progressively lower levels of food specific IgE (reflected bysmaller skin test results or lower serum test results) areassociated with a better chance to tolerate the food. 589,974,988 As described herein, the clinician must appreciate that the predictive data are reflective of the characteristics of thetested population. For example, studies of young children(younger than 2 years) show that 95% reacted to egg if theirIgE level was more than 2 kIU/L or milk if their IgE level wasmore than 5 kIU/L, values lower than those calculated forolder children. 969,970Additional studies have confirmed age- related differences among children in regard to the foodspecific IgE concentrations indicative of a high risk of reac-tion. 591,989Another study also confirmed the utility of thresh- old values,589,990although there are some discrepancies in the actual values associated with specific outcomes (eg, predic-tive values were higher in a German study of children). 591As a note of caution, reactions may occur when at risk childrenhave undetectable food specific IgE (eg, approximately 20%with egg or peanut specific IgE /H110210.35 kIU/L have clinical reactions to these foods); most 970,971but not all971,976such patients have a positive prick/puncture test results, indicatinghigher sensitivity of the test. As more studies emerge com-paring serum and prick/puncture skin test results with clinicaloutcomes in wider age groups and populations with variousdisorders, further conclusions of test utility will be possible.In regard to skin prick testing, various reagents (fresh food,commercial extracts) and techniques of testing (probe type,location on the body, method of measurement, timing ofmeasurement) are variables that affect final results and areadditional obstacles in regard to applying study results to aparticular patient. 141 An additional and complementary way to interpret tests takes into consideration the individual's history to establish aprior probability on which to interpret a test result. Forexample, at a serum concentration of peanut specific IgE of 2kIU/L, children with a history of a peanut allergic reactionhad approximately a 50% chance of tolerating peanut. 974 However, in a group of children with a positive test result butno history of a reaction, 50% tolerated peanut at a peanutspecific IgE concentration of 5 kIU/L. Similarly, a wheal sizeof 3 mm to peanut in children with atopic dermatitis wasassociated with a positive predictive value of 61%, whereasthe same wheal size had a positive predictive value of 28% inchildren at low risk according to their clinical histories. 93,973 VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S105These examples illustrate the importance of clinical history (including age and frequency of reactions) and calculation ofa prior probability for allergy in regard to test interpretation. A means to apply prior probability and test results in a particular patient to improve diagnostic accuracy is throughthe use of a calculated likelihood ratio. The likelihood ratio issimply the ratio of the odds that the patient whose test resultsfall within a particular range has the disease divided by theodds that they do not. The formula can most conveniently beexpressed as: (likelihood ratio /H11005sensitivity)/(1 /H11002specificity) as applies to a positive test result. To be useful, a likelihoodratio needs to be determined for each diagnostic test used inevaluating the probability of food allergy. Unfortunately, thisis not available for most food allergy tests. When the likeli-hood ratio is known, a pretest probability (based for exampleon the medical history) is estimated and a nomogram can beused to determine the posttest probability that a person hasthe disorder. Although likelihood ratios are not calculated for most tests of food allergy, the concept of likelihood ratio and pretestprobability has practical implications for routine practice.Consider, for example, 3 individuals: (1) a child with 3 severeallergic reactions to peanut requiring epinephrine, (2) a childwith chronic atopic dermatitis who eats peanuts but has nohistory of a reaction to peanut, and (3) a nonatopic child whosometimes has headaches on days he eats peanut. Each pa-tient is tested by prick/puncture testing to peanut and has a4-mm wheal, a positive test result with modest sensitivity(approximately 50%), and good specificity (approximately90%). The meaning of a 4-mm wheal to peanut when therehas been recurrent anaphylaxis in patient 1 (high prior prob-ability of peanut allergy, virtually 100%) is that it confirmsreactivity and no food challenge should be undertaken. In achronic condition like atopic dermatitis in patient 2, a modestsize skin test may reflect clinical reactivity in only approxi-mately half of patients (depending also on age) and may be arelevant positive in this scenario, needing confirmation byother means (oral food challenge) or additional testing toimprove diagnostic accuracy (serum test). The test result inpatient 3 with headaches is most likely of no clinical concernbecause the pretest probability is essentially zero. Consider-ing again the patient with multiple episodes of peanut-relatedanaphylaxis, if there were no wheal to peanut, the clinicianwould not be likely to trust the result because the pretestprobability is so high that the correct course of action wouldbe to repeat the skin test or perform an in vitro test andconsider a supervised oral food challenge if the test resultwere negative. Similarly, one could argue that a test forpeanut causing migraines is not necessary since the priorprobability is so low. Thus, 1 test (eg, prick/puncture) canprovide pretest probability for another test (eg, oral foodchallenge). It therefore is important to remember that every patient must be evaluated individually and the history taken as care-fully as possible. Otherwise one risks obtaining a falselypositive or negative history that could skew interpretation ofsubsequent tests since they depend on the pretest probability generated by the history. This emphasizes the fact that face-to-face evaluation of the patient is essential and that remotepractice of allergy is not valid. At this time, there are a number of publications about the diagnostic utility of IgE antibody tests for egg, milk, andpeanut for children at a range of ages and clinical circum-stances that show excellent predictive ability. The studies onthese same age groups have not determined strong diagnosticutility for soy or wheat, 589,591,974-990and more studies are needed for determination of results for additional foods, clin-ical problems and ages, and the specific impact of cross-reactive homologous proteins in reagents currently used fortesting. ASSESSMENT OF STINGING INSECT ALLERGY Clinical Indications and Utility Summary Statement 190. Diagnostic skin and/or specific IgE tests are used to confirm clinical sensitivity to venoms in apatient with a history of a prior systemic reaction. (B) Summary Statement 191. Although diagnostic tests identify species specificity of venom sensitization, they do not reli-ably predict severity of the sting reaction. (B) The diagnosis of insect sting allergy requires confirmation of the clinical history with an accurate diagnostic test. This ismost important in patients who require venom immunother-apy such as those with a history of systemic reactions tostings. Testing is not usually performed in those who havehad only large local reactions to stings because they haveonly a 5% risk of systemic reaction to subsequent stings. 991-993 Testing is also not recommended to individuals without ahistory of a systemic reaction to stings because 25% of suchpersons will have positive diagnostic venom test results. 994 The overall clinical significance of this finding (asymptom-atic skin sensitization) is uncertain, but there is an estimated15% chance of systemic reaction in such individuals. 995Di- agnostic tests are also used during venom immunotherapy todetermine whether the sensitivity has diminished or disap-peared. 996 The utility of diagnostic tests for insect allergy is limited to identifying the presence and species specificity of venomsensitization. Although there is a statistical correlation, thestrength of the venom sensitivity shown by either skin orspecific IgE diagnostic tests does not reliably predict theclinical severity of the sting reaction. Some patients havevery strong test results but only local swelling reaction to asting, whereas others have barely detectable sensitivity andyet have life-threatening anaphylaxis when stung. Diagnostic Reagents for Hymenoptera and Fire Ants Summary Statement 192. Standardized honeybee, Polistes, andVespula antigens are commercially available as skin test reagents. (A) Summary Statement 193. The skin test reagent available for evaluation of imported fire sting allergy is a nonstandardizedwhole-body extract. (C) S106 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYSummary Statement 194. In the case of a history of ana- phylaxis to Hymenoptera venoms, intracutaneous skin tests are generally performed to 5 of the available venoms in adose response protocol (up to 1 /H9262g/mL [wt/vol]) when pre- liminary prick/puncture test results are negative. (B) Summary Statement 195. The FDA-cleared specific IgE assays have comparable specificity but decreased sensitivitycompared with venom skin tests. (B) Hymenoptera venom extracts are widely accepted as the standard reagents for diagnostic testing and immunotherapyfor insect sting allergy. The commercially available productsare lyophilized protein extracts for honeybee, Vespula (yel- low jacket), and Polistes wasp venoms. The last 2 are mix- tures of clinically relevant species. Also available are 2Dolichovespula venoms (yellow hornet and white-faced hor- net). A mixed vespid venom product that contains equal partsof the 3 Vespula venoms (yellow jacket, yellow hornet, and white-faced hornet) is available for treatment but is not rec-ommended for diagnostic use. Honeybee venom is standard-ized for the content of phospholipase A (Api m 1), the majorallergen in honeybee venom. Vespula venoms are standard- ized for their content of hyaluronidase. However, the primaryvespid venom allergen is a nonenzymatic protein designatedas antigen 5 (eg, Ves v 5). This could be a basis for a possiblediscrepancy between skin test results and sting response.Lyophilized venom products are reconstituted and dilutedwith buffered saline diluent that contains 0.03% HSA, whichfunctions to stabilize the small amounts of protein allergensin the solutions and prevent adsorption to the walls of thevials. Although the activity of the allergens is stable for 12months at the full concentration (100 /H9262g/mL [wt/vol]), it may decay more rapidly at lower concentrations used for skintesting or early immunotherapy. Venoms for laboratory useare typically dialyzed to remove small-molecular-weightcomponents, which can interfere in some assays. Dialyzedvenoms may be more accurate for skin testing and are avail-able in Europe but not in the United States. Imported fire ant whole-body extract is the only reagent presently available for diagnostic skin testing and immuno-therapy for fire ant sting allergy. Most imported fire antwhole-body extracts have been shown to contain sufficientvenom allergens to be useful for diagnosis and treatment, butsome preparations contain variable quantities of the relevantallergens. 997-999Fire ant prick/puncture tests are performed first at the dose recommended by the manufacturer. If theresults are negative, intracutaneous skin tests may be startedwith concentrations as low as 1:1,000,000 (wt/vol) in highlysensitive patients but are considered to be indicative of thepresence of specific IgE antibodies if a positive responseoccurs at a concentration of 1:500 (wt/vol) or less 1000 Venom skin tests are generally performed using the intra- cutaneous technique of injecting a small volume (0.02 to 0.03mL) superficially in the skin to raise a bleb of 3 to 4 mm. Theprick/puncture method (with a venom concentration of 1.0 /H9262g/mL [wt/vol]) is used for preliminary skin testing, espe- cially in patients with a history of very severe anaphylaxis,but when these results are negative, intracutaneous tests are required for diagnosis. Venom skin tests are generally per-formed with all 5 of the available venoms (and/or fire antwhole-body extract when indicated). The prick/puncturemethod is unable to detect the allergy in most patients (usingconcentrations /H113491.0 /H9262g/mL [wt/vol]), but like all venom skin tests, can cause false-positive irritative reactions when [wt/vol]). Intracu- taneous skin tests are generally performed beginning with concentrations of 0.01 /H9262g/mL (wt/vol) or less, but when they give negative results at the lowest concentration, the skintests are repeated serially at 10-fold higher concentrationsuntil a positive response occurs or until the result is negativeat a concentration of 1.0 /H9262g/mL. Higher concentrations can cause false-positive reactions in some cases. Serologic diagnostic tests provide measurements of ven- om-specific IgE antibodies in serum using the FDA-clearedassays, including RASTs and RAST modifications. Modifiedassays (see part 1) have shown improved accuracy but arestill subject to the validity and reproducibility of the clinicallaboratory performing the assays. 132This means that homol- ogous internal controls (eg, specific venoms) are essential forin vitro venom tests. Performance Characteristics of Insect Venom Tests (Prick, Intracutaneous, Specific IgE) Summary Statement 196. Paradoxically, as many as 16% of insect allergic patients with negative venom skin test resultshave positive results in currently available specific IgE invitro tests. (B) Summary Statement 197. A small percentage of patients (1%) with negative results to both skin and in vitro tests mayexperience anaphylaxis after a field sting. (B) Summary Statement 198. A skin test refractory period lasting up to 6 weeks after a venom sting has been demon-strated by recent data. (B) Although venom skin tests have been said to be highly accurate, recent studies have focused on deficiencies in bothsensitivity and specificity, which are related to the testingreagents and to the natural history of this condition. Venomskin tests are more sensitive than specific IgE tests, sinceinsect allergic patients with positive skin test results havenegative specific IgE results in 15% to 20% of cases. How-ever, it has been reported that skin test results are negative in10% to 30% of patients with a convincing history of systemicreaction to a sting. 188,1000,1001This may occur in patients with near life-threatening reactions to a specific venom, as previ-ously noted under Summary Statement 32. 188Some of these patients will have a positive specific IgE test result so thatcomprehensive testing (both skin and specific IgE tests)rarely misses the diagnosis. Some patients with negative skinand specific IgE test results but a positive history may notexperience a reaction to a field sting. This suggests that eitherthe history itself is a poor predictor or the specific IgE thatwas initially present has disappeared over time. Conversely,1% of patients with a positive history of an allergic sting VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S107reaction have negative results to both skin and specific IgE diagnostic tests and yet may have a systemic reaction to asubsequent sting. 1001Absolute reconciliation of these results is difficult. Stated otherwise, although available tests arealmost always sufficient for diagnosis, they are not 100%foolproof. One possible reason for negative venom skin test results in insect allergic patients is the refractory period that occursafter an allergic reaction to a sting. One published reportdescribes this phenomenon in 50% of patients tested within 1week after the sting reaction, but more than half of the skintest-negative patients had positive specific IgE results at thesame time, such that the diagnosis was made in 79% usingboth test methods. 1002In the other 21% of patients the test results were positive only 6 weeks after the sting reaction.When venom skin test and specific IgE test results are neg-ative more than 6 weeks after the sting reaction, it has beenrecommended that the tests should be repeated at a later date.This is based on the observation that venom skin test re-sponses may vary over time such that relatively mild sensi-tivity may fluctuate around the lower level of detection andgive negative results on one occasion and positive on another.This observation has been reported in one clinical investiga-tion. 616 The immunologic specificity of venom skin tests is excel- lent but clinically limited. Positive skin test results invariablydemonstrate the presence of venom specific IgE antibodiesbut are not absolute indicators of clinical allergic reactions tostings. Studies of the natural history of insect allergy haverevealed that clinical reactivity is variable and can disappeardespite the persistence of sensitization demonstrated withdiagnostic tests. 995,1003-1006The risk of systemic reaction to a sting in patients with positive venom skin test results and ahistory of previous systemic reactions has been reported to beas high as 61% and as low as 30%. 1005-1007This broad range has been explained by multiple factors, including the age ofthe patient, the severity of prior sting reactions, the degree ofskin test (or specific IgE) sensitivity to venoms, and variablesrelating to the insects themselves. Specific IgE in vitro tests have shown improved sensitivity using modified assay methods. 134The sensitivity of these tests is still not as good as skin tests, but the specificity is com-parable. Many such assays show reduced accuracy when thelevel of venom IgE is in the low range. Compared withvenom skin tests, current serologic tests still give false-negative results in some cases, but the converse has becomeequally important. As many as 10% of insect allergic patientswith negative venom skin test results have positive results inthe most highly sensitive specific IgE in vitro assays. 1001A single report of a Western blot technique claims equivalentsensitivity and specificity to skin tests, provided that specific bands for antigen 5 or hyaluronidase are measured. 1008The clinical significance of positive specific IgE tests in a patientwith negative skin test results is uncertain, but this situationclearly indicates the potential for insect sting reactions asshown in case reports of such patients who had systemic reactions to challenge stings. 188 Complementary Skin and Specific IgE Testing Summary Statement 199. Because of predictive inconsisten- cies of both skin and serum specific IgE tests, patients with aconvincing history of venom-induced systemic reactionsshould be evaluated by both methods. (D) The performance characteristics of the diagnostic tests described herein provide a clear rationale for the combineduse of the skin tests and serologic tests. Neither test alone isfully accurate, and some insect allergic patients (by history)show positive results to only one but not the other test. It istherefore important to perform the other test when 1 testresult is negative in a patient with a clear history of severereaction to stings. This is also true for individual venoms. Theneed to perform specific IgE tests or repeat skin testing wheninitial skin test results are negative is most clear in patientswho have had severe anaphylactic reactions, but there is noconsensus about whether this should be done in all patientswith negative skin test results who are candidates for venomimmunotherapy based on their history of systemic allergicreactions to stings. 132,1019 Cross-allergenicity Summary Statement 200. Cross-allergenicity among insect venoms is (1) extensive among vespid venoms, (2) consider-able between vespids and Polistes , (3) infrequent between bees and vespids, and (4) very limited between yellow jacketsand imported fire ants. (B) Venoms of different species and genera may demonstrate cross-allergenicity consistent with phylogeny or across phy-logenetic lines. There is infrequent specific IgE cross-aller-genicity between the venoms of honeybees and vespids. 1010 Both hyaluronidase and cross-reacting carbohydrate determi-nants have been attributed as the basis for this cross-allerge-nicity. 1010,1011The clinical significance of IgE antibodies with such cross-allergenicity is unclear but is thought to be mini-mal. There is also very limited cross-allergenicity betweenyellow jacket and fire ant venoms, which is of unknownclinical significance. 1010Bumblebee venom allergy can be diagnosed by specific IgE testing, but there is no approveddiagnostic material for skin testing in the United States.Although some cross-allergenicity exists with honeybeevenom, most bumblebee allergic patients have negative testresults for honeybee venom skin test reagents. 1012,1013 There is more extensive cross-allergenicity among the vespid venoms. Vespula venoms (yellow jacket species, hor- nets) show almost complete cross-allergenicity, which ismanifested by positive diagnostic test results to all 3 vespidvenom reagents in most yellow jacket allergic patients. Thereare some individuals who show positive test results to only 1of these venoms, and it is clear that some species have unique allergenic determinants. 1014Polistes wasp venom is not as closely related to the other vespids. More than half of yellowjacket allergic patients have positive venom test results to S108 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYPolistes venom as well. In almost half of these cases, the IgE antibodies can be shown to be fully cross-allergenic by dem-onstrating complete inhibition of the Polistes specific IgE test by the addition of yellow jacket venom in the assay. 1015The other half of the patients have separate and distinct sensitiv-ities to yellow jacket and Polistes venom allergens. A specific IgE inhibition test can be used to exclude the need for waspvenom immunotherapy in many patients whose tests showmultiple vespid venom sensitivities. Unfortunately, this test isnot commercially available. Number and Frequency of Tests Summary Statement 201. If Hymenoptera venom sensitivity is suspected, initial prick/puncture tests followed by serialend point titration with intracutaneous tests may be required.(B) Summary Statement 202. Venom skin test may be repeated once or twice at 3- to 6-month intervals to confirm thediagnosis in a patient who initially had negative test results.(D) When testing is started with prick/puncture tests, the com- plete set of 5 Hymenoptera venoms should be used, as well aspositive and negative controls. If fire ant sting has beenconfirmed, prick/puncture and intracutaneous testing is lim-ited to this single insect. When prick/puncture test results forHymenoptera venoms are negative, as they are in most cases,serial intracutaneous tests that use the same materials (includ-ing intracutaneous controls) may begin at concentrations of0.001 and end at 1.0 /H9262g/mL.1016 Venom skin tests may be repeated once or twice at 3- to 6-month intervals when necessary to make the diagnosis in apatient who has negative initial diagnostic test results. Thismay also be useful when initial skin tests show inconsistentresults for the vespid venoms, so as to clarify whether addi- tional venoms should be included in immunotherapy. In pa-tients who are treated with venom immunotherapy, someclinicians may repeat skin tests every 2 to 5 years to deter-mine whether the patient has lost sensitivity. In patients whoare not treated, there is generally no need to repeat skin tests,but examination for loss of sensitivity may be of interest after2 to 5 years. Challenge Testing Summary Statement 203. When the diagnosis is highly sus- pected but not proved by skin and specific IgE tests, super-vised live insect challenge sting may confirm clinical sensi-tivity. Nevertheless, most of patients with suspected venomallergy do not require live stings. (D) The importance of supervised challenge testing in clinical practice has been established for food and drug allergy, and asimilar rationale may be used in some cases of insect stingallergy. In research studies for the efficacy of venom immu-notherapy and to determine the relapse rate after discontinu-ing venom immunotherapy, live sting challenge has beenused as the gold standard. However, even among untreatedpatients with a compelling history of allergic sting reactionsand positive venom skin test results, approximately half will not react to a challenge sting. 1003,1005,1006Some investigators have therefore suggested that many patients do not needvenom immunotherapy and that these individuals should beidentified by deliberate sting challenge. Although it is truethat no available test can reliably distinguish those who willreact to a sting from those who will not in every case, theoutcome of sting challenge is also not fully reproducible. Upto 20% will react to a subsequent sting after experiencing aninitial negative challenge sting. 1003Therefore, sting challenge is less sensitive than venom skin tests and only somewhatmore specific. Although deliberate sting challenge in theUnited States is limited because of both practical and ethicalconcerns, it is clear that specific patients would benefit fromsupervised challenge with live insects if this procedure wasmore widely available in regional allergy and anaphylaxiscenters. Nevertheless, most patients with suspected venomallergy do not require live sting challenges. ASSESSMENT OF DRUG ALLERGY Summary Statement 204. Evaluation of drug specific IgE antibodies induced by many high-molecular-weight and sev-eral low-molecular-weight agents is often highly useful forconfirming the diagnosis and prediction of future IgE-medi-ated reactions, such as anaphylaxis and urticaria. (B) Summary Statement 205. Neither immediate skin nor tests for specific IgE antibodies are diagnostic of cytotoxic, im-mune complex, or cell-mediated drug-induced allergic reac-tions. (B) IgE-mediated mechanisms are important in adverse reac- tions to many antibiotics, pharmaceuticals, and biologic pro-teins, such as insulin, protamine, and heparin. In the case ofimmediate hypersensitivity reactions mediated by IgE anti-bodies, demonstration of the presence of drug specific IgE isusually taken as sufficient evidence that the individual is atsignificant risk of having an anaphylactic reaction if the drugis administered. This is helpful in the case of high-molecular-weight agents. However, insufficient knowledge about drugdegradation products and/or metabolites and how they areconjugated with body proteins has been an impediment todeveloping either skin or specific IgE assays for most small-molecular-weight drug chemicals. Evaluation of drug specific IgE antibodies induced by many high-molecular-weight and several low-molecular-weight agents is often highly useful for confirming the diag-nosis and prediction of future IgE-mediated reactions, such asanaphylaxis and urticaria. 1017-1019Immediate-type skin tests are usually the most sensitive diagnostic tests but in certaincases where skin testing is not possible (ie, a negative hista-mine control test result, dermatographism, or generalizedeczema), specific IgE assays (eg, Immulite, ImmunoCap) areavailable though not adequately standardized for either neg-ative or positive predictability. In the case of small-molecu-lar-weight drugs, validated and reliable skin test reagents areonly available for penicillin. 1020They have excellent negative predictive values in predicting that severe reactions to peni- VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S109cillin will not occur. Immunoassays for penicillin specific IgE antibodies are less sensitive than skin tests, and therefore skintesting is preferred. Neither immediate skin nor specific IgEtests for IgE antibodies are diagnostic of cytotoxic, immunecomplex, or cell-mediated drug-induced allergic reactions. Summary Statement 206. The availability of specific lab- oratory tests for non-IgE-mediated drug allergies is limited.(C) Summary Statement 207. Atopy patch tests, lymphocyte proliferation tests, and basophil activation tests are additionaldiagnostic tests for drug allergy. Further studies are requiredto confirm their clinical utility in the evaluation of drugallergic patients. (B) Both direct and indirect Coombs test results are often positive in drug-induced hemolytic anemia. This may reflectthe presence of complement and/or drug on the red cellmembrane or an Rh determinant autoantibody (eg, as useful as diag- nostic adjuncts, elevated levels can occur in individuals whoreceive the drug and do not experience a clinical reaction. 1020 Specific antibody tests for drug-induced neutropenia orthrombocytopenia have been reported from specific researchlaboratories but are not clinically available. Furthermore,using small-molecular-weight native drugs for these in vitrocytotoxicity tests may be insufficient because they may not beimmunogenoric unless coupled to protein or patients mayonly react to specific drug metabolites. 1021Furthermore, test- ing with the native drug may be insufficient or patients mayreact to a variety of drug metabolites. 981Drug-specific tests are generally available in specific research laboratories andtherefore are not clinically applicable for most drugs. Summary Statement 208. A graded challenge (test dose) is a procedure to determine if a drug is safe to administer and isintended for patients who are unlikely to be allergic to thegiven drug. In contrast to desensitization, a graded challengedoes not modify the immune response to a drug. (B) Graded challenge (ie, test dosing), is intended for patients unlikely to have an IgE-mediated reaction to a drug and doesnot modify an individual's immune response to a givendrug. 1022-1025The objective of graded challenge is to introduce a medication cautiously so as not to induce a severe reaction.Although it is not possible to be absolutely certain that apatient is not allergic to a drug because valid diagnostic testsare not available for most drugs, the procedure is intended forpatients who, after a full evaluation, have low pretest prob-ability of being allergic to the given drug. The starting dosefor graded challenge is generally higher than for drug desen-sitization, and the number of steps in the procedure may be 2or several. It is postulated that a graded challenge consistingof more than 4 or 5 steps may induce modifications ofimmune effector cells and therefore induce tolerance in thepatient. Since tolerance status is impossible to predict, futureadministrations of the drug should be given cautiously. Thetime intervals between doses are dependent on the type ofprevious reaction, and the entire procedure may take hours ordays to complete. Readministration of a drug via gradedchallenge is absolutely contraindicated if it caused a severe non-IgE-mediated reaction such as Stevens-Johnson syn-drome, patch lymphocyte proliferation tests, and basophil activation tests are additionaldiagnostic tests for drug allergy. Further studies are requiredto confirm their clinical utility in the evaluation of drugallergic patients. (B) In recent years there have been reports concerning the diagnostic utility of APTs with drugs in non-IgE-mediatedcutaneous drug reactions. 1026,1027A positive reaction may be useful by identifying a specific drug in a patient receivingmultiple drugs, provided that it is properly compared with agroup of negative controls. The lack of standardization ofreagent concentrations may limit the clinical usefulness ofthis procedure. The lymphocyte proliferation test has beenstudied as an in vitro correlate of drug-induced cellular reac-tions. 1028This is used primarily as a retrospective test and is not clinically available in most medical centers. There isconsiderable disagreement among investigators about thevalue of this assay in evaluating drug allergies because nei-ther its positive nor negative predictive values have beensystematically investigated. One potential advantage of thetest for some patients is that it is possible to obtain in vitroevidence of lymphocyte transformation by the parent drugitself and liver microsomal products of the drug, therebybypassing the need for precise knowledge of metabolic de-terminants. 1028,1029Although the general clinical applicability of these tests has not been validated in any large-scale study,a number of investigators have shown that Basophil activation tests have recently been used in the diagnosis of drug allergy. Basophil activation tests are invitro tests that measure expression of activation markers,principally CD63 203C on the surface of basophils. Thesetests are typically performed by incubating peripheral bloodsamples with allergen and IL-3 to enhance the expression ofCD63, which is detected by flow cytometry. This method hasbeen reported by European investigators in a variety of casesof drug hypersensitivity reactions with drugs such as neuro-muscular blocking agents, /H9252-lactams, and NSAIDs and by Australian investigators for succinylated gelatin.677,1035-1037In a study of patients with perioperative allergic reactions toneuromuscular blocking agents, intracutaneous skin dilution CD63 (64%). 1040The specificity of the basophil activation test was relatively high(93%), whereas the specificity Another study evaluated basophil activation tests in 60 subjects with a history of aspirin orNSAID-induced respiratory and/or cutaneous reactions. 1037In this study, the basophil activation test with aspirin had aspecificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 43%. Further confir- S110 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYmatory studies, especially with commercially available tests, are needed before its general acceptance as a diagnostic tool. Penicillin Summary Statement 210. Penicillin skin testing is the most reliable method for evaluating IgE-mediated penicillin al-lergy provided that the necessary reagents are available.When performed with both major and minor determinants,the negative predictive value of penicillin skin testing forimmediate reactions approaches 100%, whereas the positivepredictive value is between 40% and 100%. (B) Penicillin is the only low-molecular-weight agent for which validated testing has been documented. 1019,1020The major determinant of penicillin, penicilloyl polylysine, is theonly skin test reagent licensed for antibiotic skin testing.Currently, neither minor nor major determinant reagents areavailable commercially in the United States. Some medicalcenters prepare these reagents for their own local institutionaluse. Immediate-type penicillin allergy cannot be accurately di- agnosed by history alone. This observation is partially ex-plained by the fact that patients with documented penicillinspecific IgE may lose their sensitivity over time. 1038Addi- tionally, patients with vague reaction histories may be aller-gic and demonstrate positive skin test results. Overall, ap-proximately one third of patients with positive penicillin skintest results report vague reaction histories. 1039Penicillin skin testing is the most reliable method for evaluating IgE-medi-ated penicillin allergy. Specific IgE tests (RAST, Immuno-CAP, or ELISA) are less sensitive and specific comparedwith skin testing. 1040-1042Penicillin skin testing detects the presence or absence of penicillin specific IgE antibodies, and it is neither useful nor indicated for clearly non-IgE-mediatedreactions (ie, penicillin-induced hemolytic anemia, serumsickness-like reaction, or ACD). Ideally, both major and minor determinant reagents are used for skin testing. Currently, the major determinant is notcommercially available as penicilloyl-polylysine (PrePen) ina premixed 6 /H1100310 /H110025M solution but, as cited herein, it has been prepared for local use in various medical centers. Al-though not actually a minor determinant, penicillin G iscommercially available and traditionally has been used forskin testing at a concentration of 10,000 U/mL. The otherminor determinants (penicilloate and penilloate) are used forskin testing at 0.01M but have never been commerciallyavailable in the United States. Penicillin G left in solution(\"aged\" penicillin) does not spontaneously degrade to formseparable minor determinants and therefore cannot be used asa substitute for the other minor determinants. 1043The negative predictive value of penicillin skin testing (using penicilloyl-polylysine, penicillin G, and penicilloate and/or penilloate)for serious immediate-type reactions approaches100%, 1019,1044,1045and the positive predictive value (based on limited challenges of skin test-positive patients) is between40% and 100%. 1019,1045,1046Likelihood ratios for positive skin test results based on a history of penicillin allergy have been calculated based on theresults of 4 studies involving a total of 9,526 patients who hadpenicillin skin testing performed. 1047The overall likelihood ratio for a patient with a history of penicillin allergy to havea positive penicillin skin test result was 1.9 (95% confidenceinterval, 1.5-2.5). Conversely, the negative likelihood ratiowas 0.5 (95% confidence interval, 0.4-0.6), indicating thelikelihood that a patient without a history of penicillin allergywould have a positive penicillin skin test result. Summary Statement 211. Skin testing with penicilloyl- polylysine and penicillin G appears to have adequate negativepredictive value in the evaluation of penicillin allergy. (C) When penicilloyl-polylysine was available, most allergists performed penicillin skin tests with only penicilloyl-polyly-sine and penicillin G. However, some studies report thatapproximately 10% to 20% of penicillin allergic patientsshow skin test reactivity only to penicilloate or pe-nilloate. 1019,1044,1048-1053The clinical significance of these find- ings is uncertain. Penicillin challenges of individuals skin testnegative to penicilloyl-polylysine and penicillin G 1046,1049 have similar reaction rates compared with individuals skintest negative to the full set of major and minor penicillindeterminants. 1019,1044,1045Therefore, based on the available lit- erature, skin testing with penicilloyl-polylysine and penicillinG appears to have adequate negative predictive value in theevaluation of penicillin allergy. To date, the positive predic-tive value of penicillin skin tests has not been carefullystudied. Penicillin skin testing should only be performed by per- sonnel skilled in the application and interpretation of this typeof skin testing, with preparedness to treat potential anaphy-laxis. Appropriate positive (histamine) and negative (saline)controls should be placed. First, full-strength reagents areapplied by the prick/puncture technique, and if the results arenegative, intracutaneous testing should be performed. Thereis no uniform agreement on what constitutes a positive skintest response, but most experts agree that it is defined by thesize of the wheal that should be 3 mm or greater than that ofthe negative control for either prick/puncture or intracutane-ous tests. Penicillin skin testing, using the reagents describedherein and proper technique, are safe, with only a rare risk(0.1%-2%) of a systemic reaction occurring. 1044,1050Patients with a history of anaphylaxis to /H9252-lactams and a history of drug reactions occurring within an hour may be at greater riskfor systemic reactions to skin testing with /H9252-lactams.1051 Summary Statement 212. Penicillin skin test-negative pa- tients (as determined by testing with major and minor deter-minants) may receive penicillin, and depending on whichskin test reagents are used and the reaction history, the firstdose may need to be given via a test challenge with a lowerdose under observation. (D) Penicillin skin testing is indicated in patients who have a reaction history consistent with a possible IgE-mediatedmechanism. Penicillin skin testing may be performed elec-tively (when patients are well and not in immediate need of VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S111antibiotic therapy) or only when treatment with a penicillin compound is contemplated. There is lack of agreement regarding the need to perform an elective challenge with penicillin immediately after anegative penicillin skin test result. Surveys of patient whoexhibited negative penicillin skin test results (without subse-quently being challenged with penicillin) found that a largeproportion were not given /H9252-lactam antibiotics because of fear expressed by either the patient or the treating physi-cian. 1052In an enclosed health maintenance organization set- ting, review of medical records found that subsequent pre-scriptions for penicillins in penicillin skin test-negativepatients were comparable in those individuals who were orwere not challenged with oral penicillin after their skin test(47% vs 48% during the year after the skin test). 1053If penicillin skin testing is performed with only penicilloyl-polylysine and penicillin G, initial administration of penicil-lin, depending on the pretest probability of the patient beingallergic, may need to be done via graded challenge (ie, 1/100of the dose, followed by the full dose, assuming no reactionoccurs during a brief observation period). Summary Statement 213. In the absence of validated skin test reagents, the approach to patients with a history ofpenicillin allergy is similar to that of other antibiotics forwhich no validated in vivo or in vitro diagnostic tests areavailable. Therapeutic options include (1) prescribing an al-ternative antibiotic, (2) performing a graded challenge, and(3) performing penicillin desensitization. (D) Currently, penicilloyl-polylysine, the major determinant of penicillin, is not commercially available. Penicillin testingwithout the major determinant fails to identify most penicillinallergic patients. Therefore, some medical centers preparethese reagents for local, institutional use only. In the absenceof validated commercial or locally prepared skin test re-agents, therapeutic options include (1) prescribing an alter-native antibiotic, (2) performing a graded challenge, and (3)performing penicillin desensitization. If a therapeuticallyequivalent antibiotic is available, this would typically be thesafest choice. However, in some cases penicillin would be thedrug of choice. In this scenario, the decision of performing agraded challenge or desensitization would be based on factorssuch as the documentation and description of the reaction topenicillin, the time elapsed since the allergic reaction, andpresence of comorbid conditions (eg, coronary artery dis-ease). For example, in a healthy patient with a childhoodhistory of a morbilliform eruption to penicillin 30 years prior,a graded challenge could be considered. In contrast, a patientwith congestive heart failure and a history of anaphylaxis topenicillin 2 years ago should likely undergo an empiric pen-icillin desensitization. Summary Statement 214. In patients who have reacted to semisynthetic penicillins, consideration should be given toskin test the implicated antibiotic and penicillin determinants.(B) Some patients with immediate-type reactions to amoxicil- lin or ampicillin are able to tolerate other penicillin-classcompounds. 1054,1055These individuals appear to have reactions directed at the R-group side chain, which distinguishes thechemical structure of different penicillin-class compounds.These patients may have skin test results that are positive toa nonirritating concentration of either amoxicillin or ampicil-lin but test negative to penicillin major and minor determi-nants. Therefore, when skin testing patients who have reactedto semisynthetic penicillins, consideration should be given toinclude the implicated antibiotic and penicillin determinants. The negative predictive value of skin testing with nativesemisynthetic penicillins is unknown, and there is no consen-sus regarding the appropriate concentration that should beused. Other Antibiotics Summary Statement 215. There are no validated diagnostic tests of sufficient sensitivity for evaluation of IgE-mediatedallergy to antibiotics other than penicillin. (C) Summary Statement 216. Skin testing with nonirritating concentrations of other antibiotics is not standardized. Anegative skin test result does not rule out the possibility of animmediate-type allergy. A positive skin test result suggeststhe presence of drug specific IgE antibodies, but the predic-tive value is unknown. (C) Most patients with immediate allergic reactions to cepha- losporins react to the R1 side chain rather than the /H9252-lactam ring, and skin test results are often positive in such pa-tients. 1056Specific IgE test results have been positive in some patients with histories of cephalosporin allergy, some ofwhom had negative skin test results. 1057A positive cephalo- sporin skin test result (using a nonirritating concentration)implies the presence of drug specific IgE antibodies, and thepatient should receive an alternate drug or undergo desensi-tization. A negative cephalosporin skin test result (using anonirritating concentration) does not rule out the presence ofdrug specific IgE antibodies. IgE antibodies to cephalosporinmetabolic products not used in the testing may be present butnot detectable. Therefore, since the negative predictive valueof cephalosporin skin testing is unknown, a cautious gradedchallenge should be performed (eg, 1/100 of the therapeuticdose, increasing tenfold every 30 to 60 minutes up to the fulltherapeutic dose) in cases of negative skin test results. Thenumber of steps in the graded challenge and the pace of thechallenge are determined by the reaction history. If the pre-vious history is consistent with a severe IgE-mediated reac-tion, rapid desensitization may be undertaken instead. allergy to /H9252-lactams (eg, aztreonam, carbapenems) is analogous to cephalosporins inthat relevant degradation products are unknown, and thusthere are no standardized skin test reagents available. Skintesting with a nonirritating concentration of non- /H9252-lactams has the same limitation and questionable predictive value aswith cephalosporins. For most non- /H9252-lactam antibiotics, there are case reports of positive skin test results with the native drug; however,large-scale validation of such skin testing has not been ac- S112 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYcomplished. It is well recognized that most antibiotics have multiple end products, and therefore it is possible that therelevant allergens may be metabolites and not the parentdrug. Although no validated in vivo or in vitro diagnostictests are available for non- /H9252-lactam antibiotics, skin testing with nonirritating concentrations of the drug (ie, negativeskin test reactivity in a panel of normal, nonexposed volun-teers) may provide useful information, and nonirritating con-centrations for 15 commonly used antibiotics have been pub-lished (Table 14). 1058If the skin test result is positive under these circumstances, it is likely that drug specific IgE anti-bodies are present. Some clinicians also verify this interpre-tation by demonstrating a negative skin test result in a non-allergic control subject tested at the same time as the patient.Therefore, the patient should receive an alternative non-cross-reacting antibiotic or undergo rapid desensitization. Onthe other hand, a negative skin test result does not denote thatdrug specific IgE antibodies are absent, since it is possiblethat a drug metabolite not present in the test reagent may bethe relevant allergen. However, if this particular antibiotic isrequired for treatment, the amount of drug injected intracu-taneously can be used as the initial starting dose for rapiddesensitization. In skin test-negative patients who have mildreaction histories, a graded challenge procedure may be con-sidered. Readministration of drugs that caused severe non-IgE-mediated reactions (such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome,toxic epidermal necrolysis, and others), either by desensiti-zation or graded challenge, is absolutely contraindicated. Aspirin and NSAIDs Summary Statement 217. A presumptive diagnosis of aspirin- exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) can often be madeby history; however, in some cases, aspirin provocation testsmight be considered for a definitive diagnosis. (B)One type of adverse reaction to aspirin or NSAIDs is AERD, a clinical entity characterized by aspirin- or NSAID-induced respiratory reactions in patients with underlyingasthma. There is no diagnostic skin prick/puncture or intra-cutaneous test for AERD. The diagnosis is usually estab-lished by history, but if the history is unclear or, whendefinite diagnosis is required, a provocation test with aspirinor acetylsalicylic acid may be performed. Aspirin or acetyl-salicylic acid provocation tests have been performed usingvarious routes of administration, including oral, bronchial,nasal, and rarely intravenous. 1059In the United States, only oral challenges are available. Twenty-four hours before thechallenge, use of anticholinergics, antihistamines, cromolyn,and short-acting should potential for exacerbating a patient's asthma, oral and and long-acting bronchodilators should be con-tinued time of the challenge. Leukotriene modifiersmay block bronchospastic responses but often do not inhibitaspirin or acetylsalicylic acid-induced lower respiratory tractreactions. 1061,1062 Oral aspirin or acetylsalicylic acid challenges in patients with suspected AERD are typically done more than 3 dayswith the first day being performed with placebos to ensurebaseline stability of asthma (ie, FEV 1should change /H1102115%). A commonly used protocol begins with 15 to 30 mg of aspirinor acetylsalicylic acid on day 2 followed by doses of 45 to 60mg and 100 mg in 3-hour intervals with serial measurementof FEV 1hourly.1060On day 3 of the challenge, aspirin or acetylsalicylic acid doses of 150 mg, 325 mg, and 650 mg aregiven in 3-hour intervals. If 650 mg of aspirin or acetylsali-cylic acid is administered and there is no reaction and thepatient is not taking more than 10 mg of prednisone or aleukotriene modifier, the test result is determined to be neg-ative. Reactions to aspirin or acetylsalicylic acid in patientswith AERD typically occur within 15 minutes to 1 hour afteringestion of aspirin. Reactions include not only broncho-spasm (which may be severe) but also naso-ocular symptomsand infrequently cutaneous and gastrointestinal symptoms.Physicians need to be prepared to treat these reactions ag-gressively. Summary Statement 218. Urticaria, angioedema, and ana- phylactic reactions to NSAIDs are distinctly from AERD reactions. In contrast to AERD reac-tions, anaphylactic reactions to NSAIDs are usually drugspecific and patients typically tolerate other structurally dis-similar NSAIDs. (B) Aspirin or acetylsalicylic acid and NSAIDs may also cause urticaria and angioedema or even anaphylaxis. The approachto these patients differs from that for patients with AERD.Patients with a history of urticaria or angioedema to NSAIDsmay be challenged using a graded challenge (test dose) pro-tocol similar to other drugs. For most patients with anaphy-lactic reactions to NSAIDs, these reactions are drug specificand challenging with a structurally different NSAID would bethe preferred strategy. 1063Table 14. Intracutaneous Antimicrobial 10/H110024 VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S113Perioperative Anaphylaxis Summary Statement 219. Skin testing is a useful diagnostic tool in cases of perioperative anaphylaxis, and when skintesting is used to guide subsequent anesthetic agents, the riskof recurrent anaphylaxis to anesthesia is low. (C) Skin testing has been reported to be of diagnostic utility in identifying the causative agent in cases of anaphylaxis duringgeneral anesthesia in both retrospective and prospective stud-ies. 1064,1065Intracutaneous testing is the most widely used method and has been determined to be a valid and reproduc-ible method in several studies. 1064,1065Prick testing has also been evaluated, and 2 prospective studies confirmed thatprick testing was a useful diagnostic tool and highly corre-lated with intracutaneous skin testing. 1036,1065For propofol reactions, intracutaneous testing is more reliable.1066,1067Skin testing has not been applied to any gold standard for anes-thetic allergy due to the inherent dangers with challenging a patient with a history of anaphylaxis and the inherent phar-macologic effects of the anesthetic. When skin testing is usedto guide subsequent anesthetic agents, the risk of recurrentanaphylaxis to anesthesia is low. 1066,1068Nevertheless, false- negative skin test results have been reported and the true-negative predictive value remains unknown. 1066 The concentrations and dilutions for skin testing used in different studies is varied.1069One approach recommended by the French Society of Anesthesiology and used in a study of789 patients being evaluated for allergic reactions to anes-thetics uses a combination of prick and intracutaneoustests. 1070The drugs tested in this study included neuromus- cular blocking agents, antibiotics, hypnotics, opioids, andothers. Prick tests are performed with undiluted drug, with theexception of atracurium, mivacurium, Intracutaneous testsare performed with 0.02 to 0.05 mL of serial dilutions of thedrug every 15 minutes. The initial dilution is 10 /H110024(wt/vol) if the prick test result is positive and 10/H110023(wt/vol) when the prick test result is negative and subsequent intracutaneoustests are performed at 10-fold higher concentrations up to10 /H110021(wt/vol) for most drugs. The final testing dilution for morphine, rocuronium, and cisatracurium maximal dilution of10 /H110023(wt/vol) is IgE tests for detecting sensitization to neuromus- cular blocking agents and latex have been used before generalanesthesia to prevent anaphylaxis during surgery. 1071In this French study, specific IgE was positive in 79% of cases ofanaphylaxis attributed to neuromuscular blocking agents and88% of cases attributed to latex. 1071For neuromuscular block- ing agents, skin testing appears to have greater sensitivity;however, a few patients may have positive specific IgE testresults with negative skin test results. Tryptase has been evaluated for its diagnostic value in perioperative anaphylaxis. In the previously cited Frenchstudy, 112 of 175 patients (64%) with anaphylaxis had atryptase level of more than 25 /H9262g/L, whereas only 9 of 84anaphylactoid reactions (11%) had an elevated tryptase level.1071For diagnosis of perioperative anaphylaxis, tryptase measurements had a positive predictive value of92.6% but a negative predictive value of 54%. The positivelikelihood ratio for an anaphylactic event based on atryptase level was 6.0 and the negative likelihood ratio was0.4. Chemotherapeutics Summary Statement 219. Skin testing is not helpful in cases of taxane-induced anaphylactoid reactions. (C) Summary Statement 220. Skin testing to carboplatin yields favorable predictive values. (C) Summary Statement 221. Skin testing with asparaginase before treatment is recommended but does not identify allpatients at risk of reactions. (C) Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported for virtually all commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. Reactions rangefrom mild cutaneous eruptions to fatal anaphylaxis. In somecases, it is difficult to determine whether a reaction is ana-phylactic (ie, mediated by drug specific IgE antibodies) oranaphylactoid (due to nonimmune degranulation of mast cellsand basophils as occurs with Cremophor-EL, a solvent usedfor many cancer chemotherapy drugs). For some chemother-apeutics, skin testing may help identifying patients at highrisk for allergic reactions to chemotherapy. In the taxane family, paclitaxel and docetaxel produce anaphylactoid reactions in as many as 42% of patients on firstadministration and rarely (3%) with subsequent cycles. 1072 The pathophysiology of these reactions is unknown but un-likely to be IgE mediated because skin test results to taxanesare negative in patients with these anaphylactoid reactions 1062 and prophylactic therapy with antihistamines and corticoste-roids reduces hypersensitivity reactions to approximately4%. 1073Test dose protocols have been used to reduce the incidence of reactions and cost of drug wastage. However, thelargest study to date using test dosing of paclitaxel in 130patients revealed no significant difference in hypersensitivityreactions compared with patients treated without using thetest dosing protocol (2.3% in test dose group vs 6.2% group, P/H11021.20). 1074Of note, 1 severe reaction oc- curred in the non-test dose group, but none were observed inthe test dose group. Finally, the test dose strategy was actu-ally more expensive (increased cost of $6,100 for 130 pa-tients). Platinum compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxiplatin) typically cause hypersensitivity reactions after completion ofseveral treatment courses, suggesting an immunologic mech-anism. 1075,1076Skin testing with carboplatin has been shown to help predict patients who will have allergic reactions tocarboplatin. A study of 47 patients receiving carboplatin forgynecologic malignancies had intracutaneous tests with 0.02mL of undiluted carboplatin and found that a negative skintest result accurately predicted the absence of an allergicreaction in 166 of 168 courses of therapy. 1077This rate of reactivity was lower than historical controls who had a 27% S114 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYincidence of allergic reactions. A larger study of 126 women with gynecologic cancers performed intracutaneous skin testswith 0.02 mL of undiluted carboplatin in women who hadreceived more than 6 courses of platinum-based chemother-apy. 1078Of 668 negative skin test results, 10 were associated with hypersensitivity reactions (1.5% false negatives butnone were severe. Although most patients with positive testresults did not receive further carboplatin, 7 patients who hadpositive skin test results received carboplatin and 6 of 7 had allergic reactions. On the basis of this information, it has beenrecommended that skin testing to carboplatin be performedbefore the eighth cycle of chemotherapy. 1079 Immediate-type reactions to asparaginase occur in as many as 43% of patients, and the reaction rate increases after thefourth weekly dose. 1080It is unknown whether the mechanism is anaphylactic or anaphylactoid, and it may be different indifferent patients. Use of skin testing with asparaginase be-fore treatment is recommended but does not identify allpatients at risk of reactions. 1080In addition to false-negative skin test results, false-positive skin test results may alsooccur. 1080Polyethylene glycolated-asparaginase has also been reported to cause anaphylaxis, and skin test results toEscherichia coli derived granulocyte colony-stimulating IgE-mediated mechanisminvolving bacteria-specific antigens. 1081This report suggests that patients with allergic reactions to E coli -derived aspar- aginase should avoid other products synthesized with recom-binant E coli systems and that skin testing may be helpful in confirming such cross-reactivity, although the predictivevalue of this testing is unknown. Local Anesthetics Summary Statement 223. Skin testing for diagnosis of local anesthetic allergy is limited by false-positive reactions. Thegold standard for establishing a diagnosis of local anestheticallergy is the provocative challenge. (C) Local anesthetics are commonly used and adverse reac- tions to injections of local anesthetics may occur. Nearlyall of these reactions are due to vasovagal reactions, anx-iety, psychosomatic, or toxic effects. IgE-mediated or ana-phylactoid reactions to local anesthetics are extremely rareand have been documented in only a few case re-ports. 1082,1083The gold standard for establishing a diagnosis of local anesthetic allergy is the provocative challenge.Skin testing has also been used as a diagnostic tool; however,several studies have indicated false-positive intracutaneousskin test results. 1084-1086In patients who subsequently tolerate a provocative challenge without an adverse reaction, false-positive intracutaneous test results occur in approximately19% and 9% of history-negative and history-positive patients,respectively. 1087On the of the low pretest probability of IgE-mediated local anesthetic allergy and the occurrence offalse-positive results, it is unclear whether intracutaneoustests have any benefit in the diagnostic approach to localanesthetic allergy. 1088,1089Rare patients may also have positive skin test results to methylparaben additives in the local an-esthetics and some of these may be false-positive skin test results because subsequent subcutaneous challenge to localanesthetic with methylparabens are often negative. 1090Sub- cutaneous local anesthetic challenges using a graded incre-mental approach after skin tests have been reported as a safemethod in a study of 236 patients with histories of adversereactions to local anesthetics. 1088Rechallenge without prior skin tests was reported to be an easy and cheap alternative toskin testing. 1091However, the possibility of a rare, systemic reaction must still be kept in mind. Corticosteroids Summary Statement 224. The specificity and sensitivity of skin tests for systemic corticosteroid allergy are unknown,and cases of corticosteroid allergy with negative skin testresults to the implicated corticosteroid have been reported.(D) Immediate-type allergic reactions to corticosteroids are rare. The mechanisms of these reactions remain unclear, andboth IgE- and non-IgE-mediated reactions have been pro-posed. 1092Skin testing has been used in the diagnosis of corticosteroid hypersensitive reactions with variable results.Prick and intracutaneous tests have been used with a varietyof concentrations 1093-1095and have been found to be nonirri- tating in normal controls even up to undiluted concentra-tions. 1096The specificity and sensitivity of skin tests for corticosteroid allergy are unknown, and cases of corticoste-roid allergy with negative skin test results to the implicatedcorticosteroid have been reported, including a case with apositive provocative challenge. 1095Finally, other components added to corticosteroid preparations (eg, carboxymethylcel-lulose) have been reported to be responsible for anaphylaxisafter injection of parenteral corticosteroids. 1097 Additives and Preservatives Summary Statement 225. For most allergic reactions to addi- tives, skin tests are of no diagnostic value, and placebo-controlled oral challenges are required. (C) The number of additives used by the food and drug indus- tries is extensive. Only a small number of additives have beenimplicated in IgE-mediated or other adverse reactions. Formany tests are no diagnostic value, andplacebo-controlled oral challenges are required. 981In rare cases of sulfite sensitivity, positive skin test results to sulfiteshave been described. 1098,1099Natural food additives, such as annatto, saffron, carmine, and erythritol, have been describedto rarely cause anaphylaxis and positive skin test results havebeen demonstrated. 1100-1103Antibacterial additives such as parabens and benzylkonium chloride may also induce IgE-mediated symptoms. 909 ASSESSMENT OF ALLERGIC CONTACTDERMATITIS Summary Statement 226. Contact dermatitis is a common skin disorder seen by allergists and dermatologists and can VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S115present with a spectrum of morphologic cutaneous reactions. (C) Contact dermatitis is a common skin problem for which 5.7 million physician visits per year are made.468,1104All age groups are affected, with a slight female preponderance basedon a large population-based survey of public health issues. 1105 The acute clinical expression of CD is characterized byredness, edema, papules, vesiculation, weeping, crusting, andpruritus most nonspecificterm applied to a number of dermatitides, including atopicdermatitis. Prolonged persistence of this dermatitis may beassociated with acneiform eruptions secondary to irritation offollicular function, hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentationdue to alterations in melanocytic biology, skin thickening,lichenification, and fissuring. Exposure to UV light mostcommonly causes a phototoxic or sunburn type of reactionand less commonly a photoallergic reaction when the UVlight interacts with chemical agents (ie, fragrances, PABA,plants, parsnips, figs, or several ingested drugs) inducingphotosensitization of various forms. Summary Statement 227. The initial approach to clinical diagnosis of CD is to distinguish between ACD and ICD. (C) Contact dermatitis encompasses all adverse cutaneous re- actions that result from the direct contact of an exogenousagent (a foreign molecule, UV light, or temperature) to thesurface of the skin or mucous membranes. The skin can reactimmunologically and/or nonimmunologically to such exoge-nous agents. The inflammatory process resulting from anallergic substance is mediated through immunologic mecha-nisms, whereas irritant reactions result from direct tissuedamage, which initiate alternative inflammatory reactions.However, the distinction between ACD and ICD has becomeincreasingly blurred. Often these exogenous forms dermatitis to be superimposed onan endogenous eruption, most commonly encountered whencompresses or topical antibiotics are used too long on barrierimpaired skin. Based on several studies, the bulk of exogenous cases are diagnosed as ICD. The appropriate diagnosis is made byevaluating the location and evolution of the inflammation,together with morphologic nuances, to arrive at a probablediagnosis. Patch testing remains the most useful method forconfirming ACD. Irritant contact dermatitis is a diagnosis ofexclusion without firm criteria or when patch test results forACD are negative. However, if patch tests fail to test for theappropriate substance, an ICD diagnosis could be incorrect. Summary Statement 228. The inflammatory lesions of CD may result from either ACD or ICD mechanisms. Factors thataffect response to the contact agent include the agent itself,the patient, the type and degree of exposure, and the envi-ronment. (A) The potential for substances that could cause either ICD or ACD is variable. Thus, detergents have a higher irritancyindex, whereas nickel is a major allergenic contactant chem-ical. The severity of the CD ranges from a mild, short-lived condition to a severe, persistent, but rarely life-threatening,disease. The thickness and integrity of the skin influence thepotential for developing ICD or ACD. Thinner skin sites,such as the eyelids, ear lobes, and genital areas, are mostvulnerable, whereas the thicker palms and soles are moreresistant to injury induced by irritation or sensitization. Ex-posure time to allergenic contactants, which phases of varies frombeing brief (eg, poison ivy) to protracted (eg, nickel in jew-elry or other chemicals in the work environment). Similarly,irritant substances may damage the skin in either the short orlong term. Summary Statement 229. Tissue reactions to contactants are attributable primarily to cellular immune mechanismsexcept for contact urticaria. (A) Contact dermatitis reactions are noted almost exclusively at the site of exposure with the putative antigen. Most ACDantigens are small-molecular-weight molecules or haptensthat become after conjugation with proteins inthe skin. 1106Less commonly, large-molecular-weight peptides or proteins (eg, latex, cashew nuts) may both induce and elicitthe classic inflammatory lesions of ACD. Summary Statement 230. Irritant contact dermatitis is usu- ally the result of nonimmunologic, direct tissue reaction andmust be clearly differentiated from ACD. (A) Irritant contact dermatitis is generally a multifactorial re- sponse that involves contact with a substance that chemicallyabrades, physically irritates, or damages the skin. 1107Irritation is usually a direct cytotoxic reaction produced by a widevariety of agents (eg, chemicals, detergents, solvents, alcohol,creams, lotions, ointments, and powders) and by contributoryphysical factors that include excessive scrubbing, washing,overhydration, improper drying, perspiration, and tempera-ture extremes. Any impairment to the epidermal barrier layer(eg, fissuring, superhydration) increases skin susceptibility toan irritant defect. The evolution and resolution of ICD areless predictable than those of ACD. The clinical presentationof ICD is more limited to the skin site directly in contact withthe offending agent(s) with little or no extension beyond thesite of contact. Summary Statement 231. The diagnosis of ACD is sus- pected from the clinical presentation of the rash, which thenmust be supported by a history of exposure to a putative agentand subsequently confirmed by patch testing whenever this ispossible. (C) The suspicion of ACD is the first step in making the diagnosis. Thus, the history remains an essential part of thediagnosis and subsequent management of this disease. Al-though history can strongly suggest the cause of ACD, it hasbeen reported that experienced physicians accurately predictthe sensitizer in only 10% to 20% of patients with ACD whenrelying solely on the history and physical examination. 1108 For ACD to occur, the site of inflammation must have come in direct contact with the offending agent. Initially, thearea may itch, burn, or sting. The evolution of the lesion S116 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYdepends on multiple factors, including the innate allergenicity or irritancy of the agent, the integrity of the involved skin,environmental conditions, a history of prior reactions, andimmunocompetency status. Activities that involve exposureto sun, water, or airborne allergens may affect the skindistribution. Remissions and exacerbations may be related toweekends, vacations, and work schedule. Work history must be carefully reviewed. The exact nature of the work duration of each activity and similar skin effectsin coworkers may be relevant. Recent changes in procedureor chemical exposures, including vapors and fumes, must beprobed. Protective wear and compliance with its use may givea clue as to the nature of the suspected allergen. Certain jobsrequire frequent hand washing and the use of special cleans-ing agents that not only may impair skin barrier but also maycause irritant hand dermatitis. Although moisturizers afterhand washing may prevent dehydration, they may expose thepatient to unsuspected allergens in the moisturizer prepara-tion. Since the worker may be unaware of specific chemicalsto which he/she is exposed, material safety data sheets mayhave to be obtained from the manufacturer. 1109Chronologic exposure histories and other activities must be obtained. Hobbies and nonwork activity, such as gardening, mac- rame\u00b4, painting, ceramic work, carpentry, and photography, may be sources of exposure to other contactants. Obtaining adetailed history of animal exposure is essential. Pet dander,products used on pets, and traces of outdoor allergens all cancause ACD. The history should also include response toprevious treatment. Many patients will have tried to eliminatemultiple agents or have used various remedies before seeinga physician. Summary Statement 232. The skin site of the dermatitis is important in the diagnosis of ACD because the area of pre-dominant involvement and the regional distribution of thelesions often reflect the area of contact with the allergen. (A) All inflammatory and spongiotic clinical reactions should include ACD as a possibility. Each lesional site usuallycorresponds to the site of contact with the putative allergen,and the physical appearance of the lesion may also suggestthe potential for ACD. Particular attention should be given tocertain anatomical sites, which include eyelids, face, neck,scalp, hands, axillae, lower extremities, and the anogenitalarea. 1110-1116 Summary Statement 233. Epicutaneously applied patch tests are the standardized diagnostic procedures to confirmACD. (A) Patch testing is the gold standard for identification of a contact allergen. 1107Although occlusive patch testing is the most common technique, open, prophetic (provocative), re-peated insult, photopatch, and atopy patch tests are alsoavailable if special situations indicate their use. For example,open patch tests are preferred for potential photosensitizers,volatile substances, mascara, antiperspirants, shaving creams,dentifrices, and strong topical medicaments that could act asrelative primary irritants. If photosensitization is suspected,photopatch tests should be performed by a physician withexpertise in UV radiation. Duplicate applications of the sus- pected photocontactant(s) are placed on each side of theupper back. One side is irradiated wit h5Jc m /H110022of UV-A 24 to 48 hours later, and both radiated and unradiated sides areread 48 hours later. The number of appropriate patch tests required to diagnose ACD may vary, depending on the nature of the clinicalproblem and the potential for significant allergen exposure.The value of a test depends on whether the clinical presen-tation warrants its use, the quality of reagents used, the timingof the application, an appropriate interpretation of the reac-tion, and establishing relevance for the benefit of the patient.Although the application of allergen patch testing is rathersimple, allergen selection, the proper test concentration, andinterpretation of the test require expertise. Clinical researchdefining the validity of each of these components has beenextensive. Such data are well described in textbooks andprevious practice parameters (Practice Parameter for AllergyDiagnostic Testing and Contact Dermatitis: A Practice Pa-rameter). 235,1108-1120These sources provide details for the pur- chase and/or preparation of allergens and materials for appli-cation, forms for record keeping, preparation of patch testsites, application of the allergens, times of reading, andinterpretation according to internationally approved guide-lines. 1117,1120Because it is impractical to test an unlimited number of contactants, standardized sets have been designedand validated by collaborative dermatologic research societ-ies. 469,481,482,1121,1122These vary somewhat to reflect differences in exposure patterns in different parts of the world. Newallergens are added from time to time, depending on changesof product utilization and exposure patterns. Since 2001, theNorth American Contact Dermatitis Group has enlarged itsstandard panel to 65 allergens and/or allergen mixes. How-ever, use of the FDA-certified antigen panel available in theUnited States can fully evaluate approximately 25% to 30%of patients with ACD, especially those patients who areallergic to rubber, metals, fragrances, cosmetics, and medi-caments. 469 Summary Statement 234. Patch tests are indicated in any patient with a chronic, pruritic, eczematous, or lichenifieddermatitis if underlying or secondary ACD is suspected. (C) Virtually any eczematous lesion could be caused or aggra- vated by a contactant. 481,482,1107,1121-1124The decision to patch test under these circumstances is often independent of thehistory because the patient may be unaware of any relevantexposure. Based on repetitive tests in patients with the angryback syndrome, it is recommended that patch testing shouldbe deferred until the underlying dermatitis is no longer acuteor severe. 507Under such circumstances, the entire skin may be irritable and false-positive reactions may occur. There isalways the possibility that a positive patch test result may trigger an exacerbation of the original dermatitis. In thissituation, however, negative patch test results to a standardbattery of allergens can be valuable in excluding a suspectedagent. VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S117Summary Statement 235. Patch test results are affected by oral corticosteroids but not by antihistamines. (A) Immunocompromised adult patients, including those tak- ing oral corticosteroids ( /H1102220 mg of prednisone per day or its equivalent) or those undergoing cancer chemotherapy, mayshow diminished or absent reactivity to the patch tests. 1125,1126 A multicenter, randomized, double-blind study revealed thatsystemic steroids in doses of less than 20 mg/d were notlikely to suppress strongly positive patch test results, but theycould suppress milder responses. 1126The same study con- cluded that equivalent doses of prednisone did not affectirritant responses 1126The effect of systemic corticosteroids on the results of patch testing is less understood for children. The skin site where the patch tests are to be applied should have had no topical potent corticosteroid or calcineurin in-hibitor applied for 5 to 7 days before testing since localanti-inflammatory effects of these agents can diminish orobliterate a possible positive test result. Systemic antihista-mines do not affect the interpretation of patch tests. Surpris-ingly, patients who have late HIV disease are still reactive tocontact allergens. 1127 Summary Statement 236. Reading and interpretation of patch tests should conform to principles developed by theInternational Contact Dermatitis Research Group and theNorth American Contact Dermatitis Research Group. (A) Summary Statement 237. A 96-hour reading may be nec- essary because 30% of relevant allergens that are negative atthe 48-hour reading become positive in 96 hours. (A) The initial reading of patch test results should be per- formed 48 hours after their application. Tests may need to beread 30 minutes after removal of the patch to allow resolutionof erythema due to occluding pressure or the tape and/orchamber if present. Ideally, there should be an additionalreading 3 to 4 days after the initial application and occasion-ally after 7 days for certain contactants. 483,1128,1129A collabo- rative study documented that approximately 30% of relevantallergens that were negative at the 48-hour reading becomepositive at a 96-hour reading. 484Conversely, some irritant reactions at 48 hours tended to disappear by 96 hours. Thereading itself is based on a nonlinear, descriptive scale thatwas developed and validated by the International ContactDermatitis Research Group. 1130The details of this rating system and corresponding clinical interpretation with a visualkey may be found in the parameter, Contact Dermatitis: APractice Parameter. In general, there is good concordance ofpositive patch test results between individual Finn Chambertests and the T.R.U.E. TEST technology and between differ-ent commercial manufacturers. 503-505The relevance of posi- tive reactions to clinical ACD can only be established bycarefully correlating the history, including exposure to theallergen with the test results. 504,1135Laser Doppler perfusion imaging of cutaneous blood flow has been proposed as analternative to visual reading. 1131This technique correlates with visual scoring but is not useful in distinguishing betweenallergic and irritant reactions. 1132,1133Summary Statement 238. Nonstandardized and customized patch testing is often required, depending on the patient'sexposure history. (C) When an agent not included in the standard set is sus- pected, kits for specific occupations (eg, beauty operators,machinists) and exposures (eg, shoes, plants, photoallergens)permit identification of many other significant allergens. Notinfrequently, it may be necessary to customize patch tests inaccordance with a patient's specific exposure history.\"Leave-on\" cosmetics (eg, nail polish, lipstick, rouge, foun-dation), clothing, gloves, and foods may be applied \"as is.\"\"Wash-off\" cosmetics (eg, shampoos, conditioners, /H110022or 10/H110023) before applica- tion.1118,1131Other household and industrial products should only be tested after ascertaining their safety in material safetydata sheet background information and in accord with anauthoritative text on patch test concentrations. 1106Even after this research, nonirritant concentrations may need to be per-formed in nonexposed controls if more precise toxic infor-mation cannot be obtained. If photosensitization is suspected, photo patch tests should be performed by a physician with expertise in UV radiation.Duplicate applications of the suspected photo contactant(s)are placed on each side of the upper back. One side isirradiated wit h5Jc m /H110022of UV-A 24 to 48 hours later, and both irradiated and unradiated sides are measured 48 hoursafter irradiation. 1134 Summary Statement 239. A problem-oriented approach to diagnostic patch testing using evidence-based principles oflikelihood ratios and posttest probability is more likely toconfirm clinical ACD than a randomly selected patch testapproach. (B) Recently, the question of proper pretesting probability measurement has been raised with the purpose of discourag-ing random patch testing, which has a low pretest predictiveprobability. 499It is postulated that pretest probabilities can be estimated by the data of large-scale prevalence studies ofcontact allergy in the general population. Using these data,likelihood ratios and postpatch test probability of contactallergy can be ascertained. 499 Summary Statement 240 . Several in vitro procedures are being investigated for the diagnosis of ACD. (A) The potential for induction and elicitation of sensitization is augmented if the allergen also has the ability to induceirritant signals, presumably through the innate immune sys-tem. 1135Irritant signals may induce the synthesis and release of factor.1135 Thus, there is a rationale for developing alternative in vitrodiagnostic tests. The lymphocyte transformation test ismostly used for research 235Recently, linked immunospot IL-2, IL-4) by the patient's peripheral mono- nuclear cells, was compared with patch tests and lymphocytetransformation test. Overall, there was a statistically signifi- S118 ANNALS OF ALLERGY, ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGYcant relationship ( P/H11021.05) among the 3 tests.1135Several recent research methods for classifying allergenic potency ofcontact allergens could possibly facilitate the clinical utilityand reliability of patch tests in the future. 1136-1139 Summary Statement 241. The differential diagnosis for CD is influenced by many factors, such as clinical appearance ofthe lesions, distribution of the dermatitis, and associatedsystemic manifestations. (B) Clinically, CD is an eczematous disease. Eczema encom- passes a group of pleomorphic, cutaneous disorders (with orwithout identifiable exogenous causes) presenting with aninflammatory tissue response. The diagnosis of CD is basedon the clinical appearance and the presence of intercellularedema of the epidermis known as spongiosis with varyingdegrees of acanthosis and superficial, perivascular, lympho-histiocytic infiltrate. 1105,1119Clinically, the lesions of CD range from red clustered papules to vesicles and bullae.Scaling and pruritus are prominent features. There are manydermatologic entities that may simulate the clinical appear-ance of CD at various stages of their evolution. A summaryof these conditions appeared in \"Contact Dermatitis: A Prac-tice Parameter.\" Summary Statement 242. Occupational contact dermatitis is an inflammatory cutaneous disease caused or aggravatedby workplace exposure. (B) According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, occupa- tional skin diseases (chiefly ICD and ACD) rank second onlyto traumatic injuries as the most common type of occupa-tional disease. In 1999, the incidence rate of occupationalskin disorders was 49 cases per 100,000 (http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocdrm1.htm). The OCD rate tends to be high-est in small manufacturing plants ( /H11021500 workers) because they lack comprehensive health care programs. Chemicalirritants such as solvents and cutting fluids account for mostICD cases. 1140,1141More than 40% of Worker's Compensation cases involve the skin, and it is estimated that OCD consti-tutes 90% to 95% of all occupational skin diseases and thatICD is found in 70% to 80% of all OCD. 1142,1143Of 5,839 patients tested in a study of the North AmericanContact Dermatitis Group, 1,097 (19%) were deemed to beoccupationally related. 1144Sixty percent were allergic in na- ture and 32% were irritant related. Hands were and 80% of ICD. Carba mix, thiurammix, epoxy resin, formaldehyde, and nickel were the most common allergens. 1144 Reducing this cost to industry and preventing morbidity in workers should be the goal of occupational medical ex- perts.1145Unfortunately, distinction rarely is made between ICD and ACD, either retrospectively or in ongoing surveil-lance programs. Summary Statement 243. There are 7 generally acceptable criteria for establishing causation and aggravation of OCD.(C) The responsibility for determining that dermatitis was caused or aggravated by employment is incumbent on theexamining physician. As a practical guideline for this evalu-ation, Mathias proposed 7 criteria for confirming this judg-ment. 1145These include (1) the clinical appearance is consis- tent with CD; (2) potential cutaneous irritants or in the workplace; (3) the anatomic distribution ofdermatitis is consistent with skin exposure to chemicals in thecourse of various job tasks; (4) the temporal relationshipbetween exposure and onset of symptoms is consistent withCD; (5) nonoccupational exposures are excluded as probablecauses of the dermatitis; (6) dermatitis improves away fromwork exposure and reexposure causes exacerbation; and (7)there are positive and relevant patch tests performed accord-ing to established guidelines. Four of the 7 criteria must bepositive to conclude that dermatitis is OCD. The validity ofthe Mathias criteria was recently confirmed in a 2- to 5-yearprospective study. 1146,1147 Summary Statement 244. Among health care professionals, ACD may occur as part of the spectrum of immunoreactivityto NRL in latex gloves. (A) With the advent of AIDS and consequent universal barrier control required for health care professionals, the repetitiveuse of latex gloves eventuated in a progressive increase in theprevalence of both occupational and nonoccupational reac-tions, both immune-mediated and urti-caria, rhinitis, asthma, and/or anaphylaxis. In most cases,these clinical events could be confirmed by specific prick orspecific IgE tests. 1153, 1154However, a large multicenter, pro- spective study conducted by the British Contact DermatitisGroup revealed that 1% of patients with hand eczema hadpositive patch test results to NRL. 1155Health care workersTable 15. Common Non- Rhus Plant Contactants and parsnips UnknownCannabinaceae Nettles (hops) UnknownRutaceae Oranges, lemons, grapefruits Unknown VOLUME 100, MARCH, 2008 S119may develop ACD to other chemicals in rubber gloves, including bisphenol A in vinyl gloves.1156,1157In such in- stances, patch tests to various rubber mix chemicals or thesuspected article itself are appropriate. Patients with provenACD may experience flares of generalized or localized der-matitis after ingestion of foods cross-reactive with NRL (seePractice Parameters on Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis). Summary Statement 245. Allergic contact dermatitis from exposure to plants is the result of specific cell-mediatedhypersensitivity induced by previous contact with that familyof plants. (A) Toxicodendron dermatitis (poison ivy) is the most common form of ACD and can be readily identified by its streak-likeor linear papulovesicular presentation. While the poison ivygroup of plants (Anacardiaceae) causes most cases of plantdermatitis, other plants that are common sensitizers are listedin Table 15. The sensitizing substances in most plants arepresent mainly in the oleoresin fraction; in some plants, theallergens are water-soluble glucosides. Most plants must becrushed to release the antigenic chemicals. Summary Statement 246. Contact dermatitis is commonly implicated after exposure to topical medications, includinglanolin, PABA, caine derivatives, antihistamines, iodochlor-hydroxyquin, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids. (A) If an eruption worsens, rather than improves, after the application of lanolin, PABA (in sunscreens), caines (anti-itch preparations), antibiotics, antihistamines, and/or topical 16). a topicalsensitizing agent is used systemically in sensitive individuals,CD can occur at the original site of sensitization. Summary Statement 247. Allergic contact dermatitis due to topical corticosteroids may occur in up to 5% of patients withsuspected CD. (A) Corticosteroids are used extensively in all areas of medi- cine and are administered orally, parenterally, intralesionally,intra-articularly, intrathecally, nasal/asthma dis-pensers, and topically to the skin. 486,1164Certain groups of diseases put patients at increased risk of corticosteroid ACD.These include treatment of refractory eczema, leg ulcers, andstasis dermatitis. 486The patient usually notes a failure to improve or experiences a flare-up of the underlying derma-titis being treated with the topical corticosteroid. Patch testing to corticosteroids is complicated by the therapeutic, anti-inflammatory nature of the drug itself, which results in fre-quent false-negative results. Patch test readings should alsobe performed 7 days after application because of the immu-nosuppressant nature of the test reagent itself. 487 The most commonly used screening agents in patch testing for topical corticosteroid allergy are budesonide and tixocor-tol tivalate 1% in petrolatum. 488Because these allergens do not detect all cases of sensitivity, other screening agents havebeen suggested. Coopman et al have suggested that 4 majorgroups of corticosteroid preparations should suffice becausethere is considerable cross-reactivity within groups and pos-sible cross-reactivity between them. 489For budesonide test- ing, Rhinocort nasal formula can be sprayed onto a FinnChamber and used as a patch test. 1165Testing with the pa- tient's own corticosteroid product may be required for defin-itive evaluation of possible corticosteroid allergy. Ferguson etal have reported that intracutaneous tests demonstrate allergicreactivity when corticosteroid patch test results are nega-tive. 477Sensitized patients must be instructed to avoid corti- costeroid administration by nontopical (including inhalantand oral) routes, because such treatment may cause local anddistant exacerbation of ACD. Summary Statement 248. Simultaneous exposure to aller- gens and irritants may produce both additive and synergisticACD responses due to their interaction. or the irritantdomain of an allergen is important for initiation of ACD. 1166 Another possible interaction is that the irritant may facilitatepenetration of the allergen. Conversely, patients with positivepatch test results tend to have a lower irritant threshold andthus greater susceptibility to skin irritation. 1167Several inves- tigations have documented that exposure to irritants before orat the same time as allergen patch tests significantly de-creased elicitation thresholds and concentration required forpatch test reactivity. 1168,1169 Summary Statement 249. The role of detergents in hand dermatitis is a reflection of their ability to disrupt the skinbarrier. (A) In a prospective, controlled study of consumers for evalu- ation of potential ACD to granular and liquid detergents,0.7% had a positive patch test result. 1170On further testing, these reactions either could not be replicated or were identicalto control patch test sites. This apparent patch test positivitywould suggest that this was due to an irritant rather than anallergic response. By contrast, other investigators have foundevidence of ACD hand dermatitis. In a separate investigationof ACD in patients with hand dermatitis vs nonhand ACD,ACD (63%). fissured forms than hyperkeratotic andpompholyx-like hand dermatitis. Taken together, these stud-ies emphasize the important role of barrier injury as a pre-requisite to ACD.Table 16. Classification of Preservative Agents in Cosmetics Formaldehyde releasers & IMMUNOLOGYSummary Statement 250. Allergic contact dermatitis is a significant clinical problem in children. (A) Although less frequent in the first years of life (ie, before the age of 10 years), the rate of occurrence beginning at thisage and through teen years attains and even exceeds thatobserved in adults. 1172,1173The order and prevalence of ACD to individual allergens are generally comparable to a generaladult population with nickel, fragrances, and rubber chemi-cals being similar in occurrence in the 2 groups of patients. 1174 The influence of fashion trends, hobbies, and lifestyle activ-ity, such as body piercing, decorative skin paintings (eg,black henna tattoo), natural remedies, and cosmetics (eg, teatree oil)m or the use of products with fragrances and herbalingredients are important determinants for ACD in this agegroup. 1174-1176 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Published Practice Parameters of the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters for Allergy & Immunology include: 1.
