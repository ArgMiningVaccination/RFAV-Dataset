Successful development and expansion of aquaculture sector largely depends upon the control and prevention of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases which can result in economic loss, food safety hazards and environmental hazards. This review was conducted to investigate the currently available fish vaccines for use in finfish aquaculture against different infectious diseases and the limitations in effective vaccine development. Information was collected from different secondary sources, then compiled systematically and arranged chronologically. The Review reveals that vaccination strategies have become highly effective and economical in protecting the health of fish and other aquaculture organisms from various infectious disease-causing agents. Recent developments in vaccines and vaccinology offer valuable opportunities to discover new vaccine candidates to combat fish pathogens, including mycotic and parasitic agents. This study shows that currently a lot of commercial fish vaccines are available to use against infectious bacterial and viral diseases of fish, but no vaccine is available to control infectious parasitic disease and fungal disease. An immobilized adjuvant heat shock protein (Hsp70C) vaccine has been reported to confer high protection of fish against parasitic disease, Cryptocaryonosis which can be a great breakthrough in parasitic vaccine development for farmed and ornamental fish. Most of the available fish vaccines are empirically designed vaccines based on inactivated or live attenuated bacterin vaccines. Novel and advances in the field of immunology, biotechnology, and molecular biology have led to the development in designing novel and effective fish vaccines and improving the existing vaccines to provide sufficient immune protection against diseases. Introduction Aquaculture is currently the fastest growing human food producing agricultural sector in the world [1-2]. It provides a great contribution to food security and socio-economic development in many countries. The World aquaculture practice has shifted from extensive to semi-intensive and intensive culture system where high-value fish species are reared at higher stocking density using commercial feeds [2-4]. But there are many constraints against the sustainable development of this aquaculture sector. Among these, the disease is the most devastating threats to semi-intensive and intensive aquaculture system which results in economic Abbreviations ERM= Enteric Red Mouth Disease, Virus, EHNV= Epizootic Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus, ISAV= Infectious Salmon Anemia Virus, SVCV= Spring Viremia of Carp Virus, GCHD= Grass Carp Hemorrhage Disease, VNNV= Viral Nervous Necrosis Virus, VHSV= Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus, CCVD= Channel Catfish Virus Disease, Freshwater Species, MW= Marine Water Species, KHVD= Koi Herpes Virus Disease, DNA= Deoxyribonucleic Acid, NASS= National Agricultural Statistics Service, BKD= Bacterial Kidney Disease, PKD= Proliferative Kidney Disease, Hsp70C= Heat Shock Protein, and RTF= Rainbow Trout Fry.Bacterial infectious diseases are the most prevalent disease challenges in fish farming while viral diseases are more difficult to control due to the lack of anti-viral therapeutics, challenges in developing effective viral vaccines and lack of information on the mechanisms of viral pathogenesis and disease resistance in fish [6]. The unavailability of efficient treatment modules to control viral and bacterial diseases posed a vital demand for developing and implementing effective approaches for prevention and con- trol of these diseases [1]. Besides, the adverse effects of infectious diseases has also demanded the strategic development of vaccine design because indiscriminate use of antibiotics in aquaculture can make rise in problems of developing bacterial resistance, food safety hazards and environmental problems [5,6]. Treatment of many bacterial infections in fish using only antimicrobials is im- possible [1].Methodology This Review was conducted using the information available in different scientific research papers and the literatures published in different journals either in peer reviewed journals or not, periodicals, proceedings, annual reports, relevant books and other sources. Electronic media was also an important source for information. Information was also collected visiting the websites related to fish health management and fisheries research institutes. All the information collected from the secondary sources have been compiled systematically and chronologically. Review Findings Vaccines are preparation of antigens derived from pathogens and made non-pathogenic through various ways which stimulates immune response in fish and increase disease resistance. Fish vac- cination was started in 1942 against Aeromonas salmonicida infec- tion [3,4,8]. Advancing vaccination is the most important and the prior approaches for prevention and control of infectious diseases of fish [1]. Protection at stock level can be achieved through vac- cination. Besides, the licensing and registration of new vaccine is much easier than antibiotics [4]. Currently, there are many commercial vaccines available against infectious bacterial and viral diseases of fish for using in aquacul - ture. The first commercialized fish vaccines were bacterial vaccine, introduced in the USA in late 1970s [1,3,8] . These vaccines were inactivated whole-cell immersion vaccines and proved efficient in preventing many bacterial diseases [8]. Advances in biotechnology and immunology has led to development and commercialization of many other fish vaccines like DNA vaccines, Nano vaccines, subunit vaccines, genetically modified vaccines and Polyvalent vaccines [1,2]. Modified live Edwardsiella ictaluri vaccine, produced in 2000 is the first licensed bacterial live vaccine in aquaculture [1,7]. Inactivated bacterin vaccines and live attenuated vaccines have been proved efficient by immersion of fish [8]. Simple inactivated bacterin vaccines works well against vibriosis but other bacteria Viral diseases are more difficult than bacterial infectious diseas - es to control due to the lack of anti-viral therapeutics and effective viral vaccines [1,7]. The World Organization for Animal Health has listed certain viral diseases as catastrophe for large scale aquacul - ture industry such as Epizootic Hematopoietic Necrosis (EHN), Herpes Disease (KHVD), Necrosis Virus (IHNV), Hemorrhagic Septicemia (VHS) [1,10] . Large number of research trials have been conducted but only a few viral vaccines are licensed [8]. Currently available commercial viral vaccines for aquaculture are inactivated virus vaccines or recombinant protein vaccines. No live attenuated vaccines are currently licensed for using in aquaculture, only one DNA vaccine against IHN (Infectious hematopoietic necrosis) dis - ease is available [7]. Inactivated viral vaccines are effective at high dose if delivered by injection, but cost-effective inactivated viral vaccines are difficult to develop where live viral vaccines showed good results in fish. The lack of effective viral vaccines is one of the main problems facing fish vaccinology [8,21,22] . Currently, vaccines are available for some economically impor - tant bacterial and viral diseases, like there is a Salmon pancreas disease vaccine available under a PMA [1,8]. Economically impor - tant fish species such as punctatus) [11,13,21,22] . But unlike all the other Salmon vaccines designed for administration in a single injection this has to be given sepa- rately from any other injectable vaccine. To date there is not yet any vaccine available for trout. There are also some other bacterial and viral diseases of fish against which no vaccines have been de - veloped yet [8]. Novel advances in Biotechnology and Immunology can lead to effective vaccine design against this disease [1]. Development of fish vaccines is a challenging task, due to a vari- ety of pathogens, hosts, and the uniqueness of host-susceptibility to each pathogen [7]. Major limitations in fish vaccine develop- ments are less understanding of fish immunology, many vaccines unlicensed, not cost effective (expensive) and stressful on admin- istration [8]. It is hoped that, in near future vaccine developments may promote from the increased knowledge of the fish immune system and knowledge of pathogen and virulence mechanisms which helps in development of live vaccines, improved DNA vac- cines, sub unit vaccines, polyvalent and monovalent vaccines, improved adjuvants and Oral delivery systems. New vaccination strategies, aquaculture expansion and disease investigation center should be initiated [1,7,20] .In this situation, fish vaccination has become the most impor - tant, easy and effective approaches to prevent and control infec- tious diseases in fish. Vaccination is a process by which protective immune response is induced in animals administering preparation of antigens derived from pathogens and made non-pathogenic by means of heat or other ways. Vaccines stimulates fish immune response and increase protection against diseases. Several signif - icant progress have been made for developing effective fish vac- cines. But until now, only a few vaccines are commercially available against infectious viral and bacterial diseases for fish farmers [1]. Currently, vaccines are available for some economically important fish species for treating bacterial and viral diseases. This review aimed to investigate the currently available commercial vaccines against infectious bacterial and viral diseases of fish and their ef- ficiency. This study also focuses on those diseases for which still now there is no vaccine is available.are more difficult to control [4]. Polyvalent vaccines, for Salmonids incorporating different Vibrio species and Aeromonas salmonicida as an antigen, are also available. DNA vaccines also were employed experimentally as safe live vaccines with a high level of success against Furunculosis but their approval for use in the field has not yet been forthcoming [7,8].16 Citation: (2018): 15-19.Vaccines for Use in Finfish AquacultureSL.

Besides, there is a wide range of infectious parasites in both wild and intensive aquaculture fish stocks. Several parasitic infes - tation create dangerous problems in fish farming such as Amoebic Gill Disease, Whirling Disease, White Spot Disease, PKD and Salm - on lice disease, but no parasite vaccines are commercially available [7]. Parasitic infection in fish results in losses and a decreased im- mune response in infected fish. These pathogens have been con- trolled by chemicals that cause limitation for human consumption so vaccines are needed for these parasites. There have been sev - eral attempt to produce vaccines against some fish parasites but no commercial vaccine is available [8].17 Citation: in Finfish AquacultureType of Disease Causative Agents Fish Species Affected Disease Viral DiseasesViral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus Trout, turbot, Japanese flounder VHS Disease Viral Nervous Necrosis Virus Marine fish species VNN Disease Other betanodavirus Groupers, Seabass, halibut Betanodavirus Disease Disease Bacterial DiseaseFlavobacterium branchiophilum Salmonids, Carps, FW species Bacterial MW fish species Mycobacteriosis septicaemia Streptococcus phocae Asian sea bass, Salmonids Streptococcosis Table 2: Major infectious Viral and Bacterial diseases of fish against which vaccines are not available [3,7,8,9]. Limitations and Future Prospects Fish vaccines have become an established, proved and cost- effective method of controlling infectious diseases in aquaculture. Vaccination can significantly reduce specific disease-related losses resulting in reduction of antibiotics use. The existing vaccines can induce protection after a single administration until the fish are harvested, but actual protection mechanisms has not been inves - tigated properly [8]. Cost effectiveness is an essential limitation to commercial fish vaccine development. The effective viral vaccines for aquaculture in preventing mortality are expensive to produce and license [7]. Conclusion Vaccination is now widely used in almost all food-producing animals. In case of aquaculture, vaccination reduces the use of anti - biotics and protects fish from infectious diseases avoiding the risk of drug resistance [1]. Most of the fish vaccines have been devel- oped and commercially available are for high-value fresh water and marine fish species to prevent bacterial and viral diseases of fish [11]. But Vaccines for protection against parasitic and fungal dis - eases have not yet been developed [7]. Currently available vaccines are based on simple empirically developed inactivated pathogens. A few recombinant subunit vaccines and DNA vaccines are also available. Limited knowledge on immune systems of fish limits the Some commercial vaccines for fish are consisted of mixtures of two, three, four even five vaccine products. But all the antigens do not stimulate protective immune response. It has become dif - ficult to formulate these complex mixtures into safe and effective commercial products [13]. Many fish species are highly vulner- able to handling stress during vaccination and post vaccination side effects [14]. Most of the research on fish vaccines has been performed by pharmaceutical companies and sufficient scientific information is not available [8]. In some species, the major disease problems occur in the larval or fry stage, when the animal is large enough to be vaccinated. Lack of knowledge on maternal immunity in fish also limits the possibilities to protect offspring by parental vaccination [7,15]. In addition, no vaccine is available for parasitic infectious dis - eases and fungal diseases of fish. It is more difficult to cultivate parasites for the preparation potential inactivated, killed or live vaccine, even it is more expensive than virus cultivation because a host population is usually required for culture rather than only cell cultures. Along with the high costs, using natural host animal for cultivation of parasites has high possibility to create major prob- lems with respect to safety documentation [7,8]. So it is very im- portant to identify safe host species and production of protective antigens is probably the most feasible strategy towards for low cost commercial parasite vaccines development. Advances in genome sequencing of pathogens can accelerate the opening of opportunities to investigate new generation vac- cines such as subunit vaccine, DNA vaccine, virus-like particle and vector-vehicle vaccine. Recently, the genome of salmon and several other fish species has been fully sequenced. These findings can lead to novel vaccine development strategies in near future [1]. Im- provement in oral immunization with biodegradable micro particle based vaccines can facilitate booster vaccination, development of new non-mineral oil adjuvants, development of polyvalent vaccines and standardization of a vaccination calendar with molecular biol- ogy and modern technologies can make possible to development novel approaches vaccination [16]. Plant based edible fish vaccines can also contribute a lot in the field of fish vaccination.18 Citation: (2018): 15-19.Vaccines for in Finfish AquacultureVolume 2 Issue 11 November 2018 \u00a9 All rights are reserved by Shoaibe Hossain Talukder Shefat.Bibliographydevelopment of vaccines based on non-empirical . Vaccines against intracellular bacterial and viral pathogens is one of the big challenges for the coming years. DNA vaccine can also play an important role in such cases. New vaccination strategies, aquaculture expansion and disease investigation center should be initiated [7,8]. Strong coordination should be created between pharmaceutical companies and academic research for a better de - velopment of live fish vaccines. 1.
