Note: City Council suspended some of these powers and duties in November 2013 for the balance of the term ; however they are automatically restored on December 1, 2014. Consent to a Speaker If the Mayor consents in writing , Council will elect a Speaker and Deputy Spe aker to preside over meetings of City Council. Despite the election of a S peaker to preside over meetings, the Mayor o may still take the Chair at any time; and o remains the Chair of Council for all other purposes outside of the meeting itself. If the Mayor does not consent to the election of a Speaker and Deputy Speaker, the Mayor and Deputy Mayor will preside over meetings of City Council. Presiding Over Meetings The City Clerk and her staff provide support to the Mayor when he or she chairs City Council meetings. When it comes to procedure, the roles of the chair and the Clerk can be summarized as follows: o The City Clerk advises the Chair, but does not rule ; ad o The Chair makes rulings on the advice of the City Clerk . The City Clerk's staff will provide sc ripts while the Mayor is in the chair to help keep the meeting flowing in an orderly way. While the scripts will assist the Mayor, they also assist the City Clerk in 1.1.3 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 recording the proceedings of the meeting and ensuring certain procedural steps are alway s completed. If the Mayor wishes to make a detailed ruling or statement, please ask the City Clerk's staff to assist by preparing a script in advance. The City Clerk will provide a separate briefing on procedure for the Mayor. If the Mayor intends to p reside instead of a Speaker, a more detailed briefing will be provided to support the Mayor in that role . Mayor can call Special Meetings of City Council The Mayor can call special meetings of City Council with 24 hours notice and in accordance with the C ouncil Procedures. To call a special meeting, the Mayor should contact the City Clerk. The City Clerk will need to establish: o The date of the meeting ; o The time of the meeting ; and o The purpose of the meeting . Since a special meeting can only consider matter s falling under the purpose of the meeting listed in the Notice of Meeting, special attention needs to be given to the wording of the purpose. As there are considerable resources that need to be marshalled for a meeting of City Council, advance consultati on with the City Clerk on dates, times and subject would be appreciated where possible. Mayor can call Special Emergency Meetings of City Council The Mayor can also call Special Meetings of City Council with less than 24 hours notice in the event of an eme rgency. A majority of Members must give their written consent to waiving notice before the meeting begins, which the City Clerk will assist in obtaining. This provision has never been used to date and should only be used for the most serious emergencies. 1.1.3 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 3 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 Pre-Meeting Briefing The Mayor will be provided with an agenda briefing for City Council meetings. The agenda briefings are normally scheduled by the City Clerk's office in consultation with the Mayor's scheduling staff to take place within 2 days of the start of the meeting.

The purpose of the agenda briefing is to brief the Mayor on: o Status of agenda items including issues arising during committee debate ; o Supplementary information expected to be placed before Council ; o Procedural or legal issues related to agenda items ; o Late items or new business ; o Scheduling issues and order of business ; and o Anticipated security or other disruptions .

If the Mayor wishes to add new business after the main agenda deadline, it must be done by motion without notice. The City Clerk's staff is available to advise on the form of reports and motions to be added to the agenda and help in their preparation. The Mayor is consulted on late Motions without Notice In accordance with s. 27 -65C, the City Clerk consults with the Mayor to review all motions without notice before the Council meeting to ensure the matter addressed by the motion w ithout notice complies with the definition of urgent matter . If, after consultation with the Mayor, the City Clerk deems the matter urgent, the motion is listed on the agenda. If it is not urgent, the City Clerk automatically submits the matter to the ne xt meeting of the appropriate standing committee. Note that this only applies to motions without notice received after the main deadline and before the City Council meeting. The Mayor has no official role in vetting notices of motions submitted by Members before the agenda deadline. (However, a Member may or may not consult with the Mayor before submitting a motion). The Mayor may w ish to designate a member of their staff to consult with the Clerk on these motions. The consultation is normally conducted in the afternoon of the business day before the Council meeting. Mayor's Key Matters The Mayor may identify one or two key matters on a City Council agenda, and the order and time at which they will be debated. The Mayor's key matters will be listed on the Order Paper. The Mayor should advise the Manager, Council Secretariat Support, of any key matters by the end of business on the day before a City Council meeting. 1.1.3 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 5 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 The Mayor may be questioned on a key matter regardless of whether he or she speaks to the item or not.

The Mayor may be quest ioned any time he or she speaks The Mayor may be questioned any time he or she speaks on an agenda item in Council. This rule applies regardless of whether the Mayor places a motion or not. The Mayor may also be questioned on a key matter regardless of whether he or she speaks to the item or not. The Mayor must vacate the chair to speak if he or she is presiding If the Mayor wishes to speak on an item while he or she is presiding over the meeting, he or she must vacate the chair and take up the other seat provided to him on the Council floor.

If the Mayor is required to sign by -laws, the City Clerk's staff will deliver originals to the Mayor's Office for signature. The Mayor must sign by hand (i.e., no stamps or digital or mechanical reproductions.) 1.1.4 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 1 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 Restoration of Mayor's Powers and Resources Issue City Council temporarily suspended various powers and duties of the Mayor and assigned certain powers, duties and resources to the Deputy Mayor. These provisions were approved until the end of the term on November 30, 2014. Background At its meetings on November 15 and 18, 2013, City Council suspended various rules delegating certain powers to the Mayor until the end of the term on November 30, 2014. The suspended powers included the following: 1. The power of the Mayor to appoint and dismiss the Deputy Mayor a nd Standing Committee Chairs under Section 27 -40 of the Council Procedures. 2. The right to designate or set times for key matters on the City Council agenda. 3. The right to chair the Executive Committee (the Deputy Mayor was appointed chair) 4. The right to be considered a member of all Council committees by virtue of office, and the rights and privileges of other committee members when present at a committee meeting 5. The right to elect to speak first or last on agenda items at City Council meetings 6. The power to to chair or assign the chair's position for the Striking Committee 7. The right to designate the chair of the Civic Appointments Committee 8. The right to designate a member on the Affordable Housing Committee 9. The right to be consulted by the City Clerk on urgency of motions without notice received after the agenda closing and before the Council meeting under Section 27 -65. 10. The right to sign the minutes of the meetings of City Council 11. The power to appoint the nominating panels for appointments to the City's corporations. 1.1.4 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 City Council also temporarily transferred the following duties and powers to the Deputy Mayor: 1. Mayor's powers delegated by City Council to the Mayor under its own authority under Toronto Munic ipal Code Chapter 59, Emergency Management 2. Mayor's powers delegated by City Council to appoint and chair the selection panels for the Accountability Officers 3. Mayor's powers and duties with respect to the Debenture Committee and the issuance of d ebt. City Council also reduced the Mayor's Office budget and staff complement and transferred the balance of the budget and staff to the City Clerk's Office for the remainder of the term. City Council assigned the supervision of the budget and staff to t he Deputy Mayor. Implications Since City Council only suspended or made temporary provisions until the end of the term, all of the previous rules and powers and duties of the Mayor revert to the way they were before City Council acted in November 2013.

Ask to see the person's identification with a si gnature (such as a driver's licence or passport). Make the person aware of the force and effect of the declaration.

The public service serves the Council or Board as a whole , supports the decision -making process and the combined interests of all members. An impartial and professional public service advances the objective that citizens des erve government services and policies that place the public interest ahead of the personal and ideological preferences of individual public servants . It reinforces the principle that citizens can expect to receive fair, professional and objective treatmen t from public servants. The City Manager heads the Toronto Public Service, wh ich implement s the priorities and directions of Council and is responsible for the delivery of more than 40 major services that have continuous impact on residents and Toronto's quality of life. Many services are provided around the clock, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. City Agencies also provide many important public services and are part of the broader public service. Strengthening Public Service Governance : A Toronto Public Service By-law City Council approved a Public Service By -law for Toronto in June 2014 to come i nto effect at the end of 2015. The Public Service By -law applies to the Toronto Public Service and extends the application to most of the City's agencie s recognizing them as part of the broader public service. The Toronto Public Service By -law includes the following key elements: Objectives; Public Service Values; Role, Responsibilities and Authorities of the City Manager and Other City Officials to Manage Human Resources under their authority; Role, Responsibilities and Authorities of City Agencies to Manage Human Resources under their authority; Human Resource Policy Requirements; Ethical Provisions for Conflict of Interest, Political Activity and Disclosure of Wrongdoing and Reprisal Protection; and The Establishment of Ethics Executives. 1.4 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 The Public Service By-law is important foundation legislation that strengthens the separation between the administrative and political components of Toronto's g overnment, and advances the Toronto's public service as professional, impartial and ethical. It works in concert with the Members Code of Conduct and the Code of Conduct for Local Boards to set out the distinct roles that the public service and elected officials play in the effective functioning of Toronto's government. Council and Agency Board Members are also responsible for preserving public trust and confidence in the integrity of the public service and for upholding a professional, objective and im partial public service. Members play a critical role in supporting public servants' responsibility to provide professional and frank advice. Toronto will be the first Canadian municipal government to enact by -law provisions consistent with public servi ce legislation. A public service by -law is appropriate for Toronto given the size and complexity of its government. It will further strengthen the City's capacity to provide good governance within its jurisdiction through a democratically elected, respon sible and accountable government. Considered vital for the effective functioning of a fair and democratic system of government - public service legislation is a cornerstone of the 'machinery of government' across international federal and provincial governments, many in place for over a hu ndred years. Public service legislation codifies in law the employment framework and ethical framework for a public service. The employment framework sets out the roles, responsibilities and authorities of government officials and entities for the mana gement of government human resources under their authority and separates political considerations from the appointment, promotion and removal of public servants. The employment framework ensures that the public service is neutral and impartial and protects a public service from inappropriate politicization. The ethical framework establishes provisions related to conflict of interest, political activity and wrongdoing including: Conflict of interest provisions that ensure a public servant's private interests do not compete with their public service duties and responsibilities. 1.4 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 3 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 Political activity provisions that affirm the constitutional right of public servants to engage in political activity as long as it does not impair the impartiality of the publ ic service in carrying out their official duties, set out requirements for public servants when they seek political office and establish political activity limitations for some public servants. Mechanisms to disclose, investigate and resolve allegations of government wrongdoing and reprisal protection for public servants who in good faith disclose government wrongdoing.

The City is the sole shareholder o f City -controlled corporations and their accountability is established through a Shareholder Direction and corporate by-laws approved by City Council. The Shareholder Direction sets out the governance principles for the corporation, the accountability and relationship between the Board of Directors and the City (the shareholder) and informs the residents of Toronto of the shareholder's fundamental principles regarding the corporation's business. The by -laws of the corporations describe the internal rules g overning the management of the corporation and are approved by the shareholder. Corporations are required to submit their annual audited financial statements and reports to City Council as the shareholder, but Council does not approve their budgets or po sitions. City-controlled corporations include: Build Toronto Community Housing; Toronto Hydro; and Toronto Pan Am Sports Centre Inc.1; and Toronto Port Lands. 1 The Toronto Pan Am Sports Centre Inc. is a City - services corporation established under the authority of the City of Toronto Act, 2006.

The Province of Ontario subsequently included a requirement in the City of Toronto Act, 2006 to est ablish an Auditor General, an Integrity Commissioner, an Ombudsman, a Lobbyist Registry and authority to appoint a Lobbyist Registrar (collectively the \"Accountability Officers\") . To meet its statutory obligations and round out the City's accountability system , City Council established a lobbyist registry and appointed a Lobbyist Registrar in 2007 and an Ombudsman in 2008. Mandate of the Accountability Officers It is the Accountability Officers' role to provide objective and independe nt oversight and to ensure the transparency and accountability of City government. Each Officer has a specific mandate and role to play in advancing transparency and accountability at the City. Accountability Officers can only act on matters and investiga te organizations within their individual mandates. Part V of the City of Toronto Act, 2006 (COTA) provides broad powers and duties for each Accountability Officer to carry out t heir respective mandate, including the power to gather evidence, compel disclosure of information, summon and examine witnesses under oath, and ability to conduct t heir work in private as required. COTA requires each officer to perform their duties in an independent mann er. The Act also establishes a duty of confidentiality on the part of the Accountability Officers and persons working under their instructions which prevail over the provisions of the Municipal Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act . The Auditor General is responsible for assisting City Council in holding itself and its administration accountable for public funds and for the achievement of value for money in City operations including all City 1.6 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 CUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 divisions, agencies, and the offices of the Mayor and Members of Council. The Auditor General also manages the City's Fraud and Waste Hotline. The Integrity Commissioner is responsible for providing advice, complaint resolution and education to elected officials (the Mayor and Councillors) and appointees of local boards on the application of their respective Code of Conduct, and other by -laws, policies and legislation governing ethical behavior. Applicable Codes of Conduct, include: Code of Conduct for Members of Council ; Code of Conduct f or Members of Local Boards ; and Code of Conduct for Members of Adjudicative Boards The Integrity Commissioner also plays a role in investigating complaints (formal or informal) about the conduct of Members of Council, Members of Local Boards and Adjudicat ive Boards and in determining whether or not there has been a violation of the City Codes of Conduct. The Lobbyist Registrar promotes and enhances the transparency and integrity of City government decision making through public disclosure of lobbying acti vities and regulation of lobbyists' conduct. The Lobbyist Registrar's responsibilities include overseeing the lobbyist registration system, providing advice on Chapter 140, Lobbying, of the Toron to Municipal Code, conducting inquiries and investigations and enforcing compliance with the Chapter 140 and advising City Council on lobbying matters. The Ombudsman works to ensure that th e City treats the public fairly, and that services are provided in a fair and equitable manner for all. The Ombudsman is res ponsible for addressing concerns about City services and investigating complaints about administrative unfairness related to City divisions , most City agencies, and City Corporation s. City Council does not fall within the Ombudsman's purview. Balancing Independence and Accountability The City's Accountability Offices were established with clear principles of independence, balanced with direct accountability to City Council . In April 2009, City Council adopted a comprehensive policy framework for the City's Accoun tability Officers , codified in the Toronto Municipal Code, Chapter 3, Accountability Officers including which reinforce s both their arm -length relationship to the City adminis tration and their independent status within the City's governance system. 1.6 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 3 CUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 The Officers report to and are directly accountable to City Council for the management of their offices, the administration of the services they provide, their performance in fulf illing their mandates and their use of public funds. There are a number of mechan isms through which the Officers ' accountability to City Council is achieved, including: Annual report transmitted directly to City Council , except for the Auditor General whose various annual report s are transmitted t hrough the Audit Committee ; Annual Attest Audit as part of the City's annual attest audit; Annual Compliance Audit transmitted directly to City Council, except for the Auditor General whose compliance audit is transmitted t hrough the Audit Committee ; An external peer review of the Auditor General conducted every three years to ensure compliance with government auditing standards transmitted to City Council through the Audit Committee ; Annual review and approval of the Officers' budget requests through Council's budget process ; Inquiry and i nvestigation reports transmitted directly to City Council except for the Auditor General whose audit reports are transmitted through the Audit Committee ; and Policy -related reports reported to Council through its Executive Committee. Independence Features of the Accountability Officers Independence is essential to the effectiv eness and credibility of these offices , and is a statutory duty of each Accountability Officer s under COTA. Independence for the City's Accountability Officers is achieved through the accountability framework contained in the Toronto Municipal Code, Chapter 3, Accountability Of ficers including: Appointment and removal of the Accountability Officers by a 2/3 vote of all Members of City Council ; Defined and transparent appointmen t, renewal and removal process by Council ; 1.6 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 4 CUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 Removal for cause only which will provide security of tenure throughout the term of office ; Direct reporting relationship to City Council, not through the City's administration ; Fixed term of office ; Responsibility and authority to manage and staff their own offices in accordance with a human resources protocol ; and Annual budgets submitted directly through Budget Committee and Council, except for the Auditor General whose budgets are submitted through the Audit Committee, in accordance with the budget protocol, for consideration and approval.

Generally, the City and its agencies are required by law to give public notice of meetings and to hold all meetings in public. Someti mes it is necessary to close a meeting or part of a meeting to the public so Council or an agency can consider confidential information as permitted by law. Meetings of City Council and its agencies can only be closed to consider confidential information that falls into one of the following statutory categories/exceptions: Security of the property of the municipality or agency . Personal matters about an identifiable individual . A proposed or pending acquisition or disposal of land. Labour rela tions or employee negotiations. Litigation or potential litigation, including matters before administrative tribunals . Advice that is subject to solicitor -client privilege. Education or training of the members, so long as no decision -making is advanced. Any other matter permitted or required by statute. Under the Act, City Council may close part of a meeting, but it is not required to do so to consider the matters noted above. No votes can be taken in closed session, except for votes on procedure and votes to give confidential instructions to City staff, its agencie s or agents. Council and its agencies are also required to begin and end a meeting in public and to adopt a motion to close a meeting setting out the nature of the subject to be discussed and the statutory reason for closing the session. City Corporations which operate under the Ontario Business Corporations Act, 1990 , are not required to have open meetings unless Council as the shareholder so directs. 1.7 TRANSITION TO 20 14-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 Currently, Council has directed that the board meeting s of Build Toronto and Toronto Port Lands and their committees be held in public , and consider confidential info rmation in accordance with the requirements of the Act. Toronto Community Housing Corporation and Casa Loma Corporation also conduct its meetings in accordance with these rules . No Informal Meetings The implications of the open meeting law mean that bodies covered by it cannot hold informal or private meetings or briefings. Members of Council should take steps to avoid situations where a quorum of a decision body, including a committee, gathers outside of an official meeting context. Open Meeting In vestigator As provided for in the City of Toronto Act , 2006, the City has appointed an investigator to handle complaints and investigate compliance with the open and closed meeting provisions of the Act and the Procedures By -law. If the investigator finds that a meeting has been closed improperly, he or she will report that finding to Council or the appropriate agency together with any recommendations. 1.8 TRANSITION TO 20 14-2018 TERM PAGE 1 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 Public Participation in Decision Making Public participation in the City's decision -making is essential and is a cornerstone of good governance. Toronto residents play an important role in shaping the decisions of their government, which have a direct impact on their quality of life and the Ci ty's economic, social and environmental health. The public participates in and contributes to Council and Agency decision - making through a variety of methods and forums that vary depending on the nature of the issue; whether the involvement is legislate d or formal, or sought on a more discretionary or informal basis; and whether the issue is neighbourhood or community based or of a city -wide nature . Public participation includes for example: Speaking (making a deputation) at Committees of City Council or Agency Boards on policy issues and at Community Councils on local matters; Accessing information and following Council and committee meetings through traditional and on -line means ; Responding to polls and surveys to provide input on city -wide, neighbou rhood and community issues; Participating in public meetings about planning applications and development activities required under the Planning Act , or requesting input under a prescribed Environmental Assessment; Serving as board members on the City Agenc ies; Serving on Council and Board citizen advisory bodies and panels to provide advice on specific topics; Participating in program and service committees established by City and agency officials; Providing feedback on planning notices, surveys and questio nnaires; Participating in town hall meetings, information sessions and consultations on emerging and important issues; Providing input to the Toronto Public Service and City Agency staff as programs, services and policies are developed and modified to meet current and emerging community needs, and participating in community development activities; and Participating in City -sponsored civic literacy programs. 1.8 TRANSITION TO 20 14-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 For further information about how to participate in your City government see: Get Involved : http://goo.gl/fBfqnc Open Data : http://goo.gl/DLbsuA Agendas & Minutes of Council http://toronto.ca/council Public Appointments: http://goo.gl/Qf9bjg Have Your Say : http://goo.gl/NQo15Y 1.9 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 1 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 Public Appointments Summary The City appoints more than 1,100 people to 129 agencies and boards using a variety of methods.

Current Status and Next Steps Given Council's strategic objectives to embed diversity, equity and human rights into all aspects of City policies, programs and services and advance Toronto's motto \"Diversity our Strength\", the City is undertaking the following actions , among others : Administering the Count Yourself In: Workforce Survey to all active Toronto Public Service employees. The 2014 results will be reported to City Council in the first half of 2015. Developing a Corporate E quity, Diversity and Human Rights Framework and related measurement tools , to be brought forward for Council consideration in 2016.

There are 92 men for every 100 women. This is down from 93 men in 200 6. Average personal income for men was $52,716; for women was $37,015. 26.1% of households earned an annual household income over $100,000 19% had after -tax income below Statistics Canada's Low Income Measure (LIM -AT) 207,097 (43.5%) renter households and 157,813 (27.6%) owner households were spending 30% or more of their income on shelter costs. Community estimates show that approximately 70,000 Aboriginal people live in Toronto Immigration 49% of those living in Toronto were immigrants. This percentage is higher than the rest of the GTA/H (38%) as well as the Canada -wide rate of 21%. One-third of immigrants in Toronto are newcomers, having arrived in Canada in the last 10 years. Toronto's immigrant population tended to be slightly older at age of immigr ation than in the rest of GTA/H or nationally. Fifty -four percent of immigrants in Toronto were 25 years or older when they arrived in Canada, compared to 49% in the rest of the GTA/H and 50% in Canada. Residents of Toronto identified over 230 different et hnic origins in the 2011 NHS. 49% of those living in Toronto (1,264,395 people) identified as a visible minority. 3.1 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 5 COUNCIL BRIEFING VO L.1 38% of those living in the rest of the GTA/H and 19% nationally identified as a visible minority. The top three visible minority groups in Toronto were: South Asian (12% of total 2011 Toronto population), Chinese (11%) and Black (9%). The most common countries of birth of immigrants living in Toronto were China and the Philippines. Language Groups Toronto continues to be a mosaic of language s. According to the 2011 Census, 45% of Toronto residents had a mother tongue other than English or French. This represents a 2 per cent decrease from the 2006 figure of 47%. The City of Toronto, York Region, and Peel Region are the most linguistically div erse areas in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. Statistics Canada has identified about 160 mother tongues in the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area. 28% of people in Toronto regularly spoke a language other than English or French at home (down from the 2006 figure of 31%), compared to 19% in the rest of the GTA/H. 5% of Torontonians had no knowledge of either official language, the same percentage as in 2006. Chinese languages, Tamil, Spanish, Tagalog, and Italian were the top non-English languages spok en at home. Of the top -15 non -English home languages in Toronto, Mandarin is the fastest growing, increasing by 32% since 2006. The number of Bengali, Persian, Tagalog, and Spanish speakers is also increasing. 3.2 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 1 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabil ities Act, 2005 Issue The Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2005 (AODA) was enacted to achieve accessibility for people with disabilities in Ontario by 2025. The AODA establi shes the Integrated Accessibility Standards Regulation (IASR) and their compliance deadlines phased in between 2011 and 2021. IASR cover s the five domains of Custome r Service, Information and Communication, Employment, Transport ation, Built Environment as well as accessibility criteria in procurement. The City's multi -year Accessibility Plan, as required by AODA, is a strategic roadmap, developed to identify, remove a nd prevent barriers to people with disabilities and meet accessibility standards requirements. Compliance with the AODA and its standards align with the City's goal o f becoming a barrier -free city. Background Prior to the AODA, the Ontarians with Disabilities Act 2001 (ODA) require d an annual Accessibility Plan, first filed by the City in 2003. The Accessibility Plan reported on strategies to improve accessibility in policy, programs and service delivery. In 2009, Toronto City Council adopted a \"Statement of Commitment to Creating an Accessible City,\" consistent with the principles of the AODA . AODA requirements that differ from the ODA 's: Coverage includes public and private -sector organizations . Provide s for the development, implementation and enforcements of standards . Targets set to ensure progress towards achiev ing the level s of accessibility set out in the standard . Enforcement measures and penalties established for individuals and corporations . Organizations to file accessibility reports with the Province to determine compliance with standards. The City established the Disability Issues Committee , a community -based advisory body in the year 2000, before any legislative requirement s. The Disabil ity Issues Committee was established as a requirement under the Ontarians with Disabilities Act, 2001 (ODA) and the AODA, 2005. 3.2 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 To date, t he City has complied with the following AODA requirements by: Provid ing a Corporate AODA -IASR training suite . Provid ing Individualized Emergency response information for people with disabilities . Integrat ing Accessibility Criteria in Procurement . Working with City agencies to advise them of thei r compliance obligations . Provid ing input and consultation on new proposed standards . Actively consult ing with the public, people with disabilities and the City's D isability Issues Committee to meet accessibility goals . Filing Accessibility Compliance Report s as required . The City's current Multi -Year Accessibility Plan initially covers the years 2012-2016. It will be reviewed and updated once every five years from its first posting on the City's website in January 2013. The City is responsible for ensuring that its agencies and third -party contractors who deliver municipal services also achieve compliance. Implications Implementation of AODA standards is a legislated requirement. There are challenges with respect to meeting the requirements and costs of different standards within the timeframe set by the Province. The License Appeals Tribunal is under con sideration to hear appeals against orders issued to a person or organizational for contravention of the legislation and standards. Administrative monetary penalties will be imposed on individuals or organizations that do not comply with the AODA standards. Non-compliance with the AODA Standards can lead to increased human rights complaints, negative media coverage and potential, considerable future costs to the City. Contraventions of major impact can be assessed at $100,000 per day for a corporation; and $50,000 per day for an individual or unincorporated association. Current Status and Next Steps The City will continue to focus its efforts to meet both legislated requirements and non -legislated commitments to ensure accessibility and equity are embedded in City processes. 3.2 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 3 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 Focus for 2014 - 2015 1. Enhance accessibility tools and resources including : An Accessible Communications Policy and Guidelines Review and Update of the 2004 Accessibility Design Guidelines 2. Provide strategic advice on the identification, removal and prevention of barriers for people with disabilities and ensure the City's accessibility policies align with AODA and Ontario Human Rights legislation.

Under the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) , employers are legally obligated to have a program, policy, complaint resolution process and training to prevent and address employee complaints of harassment. The Accessibility for Ontarian's with D isabilities Act (AODA) requires the City to undertake prescriptive actions to ensure all aspects of employment and service delivery are accessible to persons with disabilities. Employees and citizens, who believe their rights have been infringed, can file complaints to provincial tribunals. B reaches of the above noted legislation can result in considerable fines and/or penalties against the City. Background In 1998 Toronto City Council adopted a Human Rights and Anti - Harassment/Discrimination Policy and Complaints Procedures (amended in 2008 and 2013) and established the Human Rights Office. The policy articulates the City's commitment to both its legal obligations and goal of inclusion - ensuring all City programs, policies, systems, facilities, services, etc., are designed and administered to foster full integration of diverse individuals and groups protected under the Code. The C ity's Human Rights Office (HRO ) administers the Human Rights and Anti-Harassment/Discrimination Policy and Complaint Procedures , the Hat e Activity Policy /procedures and the Accommodation Policy /procedures that flow from and are required under the above noted legislation. On average, the HRO responds to over 1000 harassment/discrimination inquiries/complaints annually. T he HRO offers expert advice and effective internal dispute resolution process es for all City of Toronto employees , Members of Toronto City Council, third party contractors and citizens/ service recipients. It should be noted that the mandate of the City's HRO is limited to City divisions and services and does not extend to employment practices or the 3.3 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 services of the City's Agencies and Corporations. However, the Auditor General's Office in 2008 recommended , and Toronto City Council in 2008 and 2013 requested , that the City's Agencies and Corporations ensure their anti-harassment policies reflect the principles of the City's policies to ensure consistent human rights and equitable practices . Education, commun ications , policy development and the production of an annual Human Rights Office Report are undertaken by the HRO to support the strong human rights culture in the Toronto Public Service . Implications The Accessibility for Ontarian's with Disabilities Act (AODA) , the Ontario Human Rights Code (the Code) , and the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) have continuously expanded protections for employees a nd citizens while at the same time placing substantial obligations upon the City as an employer and service provider to meet its legal responsibilities . Breaches of the legislation can place the City at considerable financial and image risk; fines for a single breach can cost in excess of $100,000 under the Code, $100,000 per day under the AODA and up to $500,000 per infraction under the OHSA . However the HRO's mandate to advance inclusion through its complaints management function has proven successful; to date, all investigations undertaken by the HRO that have become the subject of a legal hearing, have been upheld by adjudicators. Current Status and Next Steps The dispute resolution approach of the City's HRO, with its strong focus on advancing inclusion has repeatedly proven to be a viable alternative for resolving harassment and discrimination internally , reducing the risk of penalties and the likelihood that employees and citizens will file complaints to costly, legal avenues. HRO staff will continue to promote its progressive approach to all employees and citizens, building on the City's excellent human rights track record .

The goals outlined in the Statement contribute to the recognition of a distinct Aboriginal identity and create a sense of inclusion. The Statement of Commitment identifies seven distinct goals to be fulfilled as part of the Urb an Aboriginal Strategy/Framework. Toronto City Council re -established the Aboriginal Affairs Advisory Committee in 2011 to assist the City in achieving its commitments to the Aboriginal community. Background Aboriginal Peoples hold a unique legal and con stitutional position in Canada as reflected in section 35 of the Constitution Act , 1982. The City of Toronto has affirmed this position in its vision statement on Access, Equity and Diversity , which states, \"The City recognizes the unique stat us and cultural diversity of the Aboriginal communities and their right to self - determination.\" With that guiding principle in mind t he following action items from the Statement of Commitment were developed in collaboration with the Aboriginal Affairs com mittee of Toronto. The \"Aboriginal Representation on Agencies and Corporations \" report was adopted by Council on July 2012. Currently, the city is working with agencies and corporations to increase Aboriginal representation for upcoming vacant positions. The Toronto Public Service Education Strategy on Aboriginal History and Culture was created in July 2012. Learning objectives and suggested learning methods have been p resented and information is shared regularly with employees . A review of current cours es is being conducted to determine other educative aspects that may be appropriate for the Toronto Public Service. 3.4 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 The Aboriginal Empl oyment Strategy was adopted by C ouncil in February 2014 . Human Resources and the Equity , Diversity and Human Rights Division have responsibility for implementing this strategy and have developed an implementation plan ; the work is ongoing. The City's Equity, Diversity and Human Rights Division is responsible for the ongoing public awareness of Aboriginal life in Toronto th rough such events as flag raisings, sunrise ceremonies, Aboriginal art and craft fair s and proclamations for National Aboriginal Day, Louis Riel Day and events coming from the year -long Truth and Reconciliation proclamation. Implications The adoption of the Statement of Commitment to the Aboriginal Communities of Toronto contributes to the City of Toronto Stra tegic Actions #9, 10, 11 and 13 in areas of strengthening n eighbourhoods , enhancing the city's quality of life, advanc ing Toronto's m otto 'Diversity our Strength', and develop ing and implement ing a workforce p lan. The adoption of the Statement of C ommitment and the year-long proclamation on Truth and Reconciliation affirms Council's commitment to the principle of Aboriginal self determination, and recognizes the city's Aboriginal heritage . Current Status and Next Steps The work of fulfilling the Statement of Commitment is ongoing. The commitments that have been initiated to date need to be developed further. Work on outstanding commitments has to be implemented. Council will consider the establishment of the Aboriginal Affairs Advisor y Committee in the first quarter of 2015 . This committee provides leadership on the development of the Urban Aboriginal Framew ork as it relates to the Statement of Commitment. 3.4 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 3 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 Additional Information Statement of Commitment to the Aboriginal Communities of Toronto: Towards a Framework for Urban Aboriginal Relations in Toronto http://goo.gl/15MmHC Contact Mae Maracle Consultant , Equity & Diversity Equity, Diversity and Human Rights 416 392 5583, mmaracle@toronto.ca Ahmad Saidullah Manager, Diversity & Human Rights Equity Diversity and Human Rights 416 392 4991 , asaildul@toronto.ca INDEX TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 Council Briefing Book Volume 1: Toronto's Government Tab 4 - Human Resources 4.1 Collective Bargaining and Collective Agreements 4.2 Workforce at a Glance - Five Year Trend 4.3 Fair Wage Policy and Labour Trades Obligations in the Construction Industry 4.4 Health and Safety: Target Zero Continuous Improvement 4.5 Management Span of Control 4.1 TRANSITION TO 2014-2018 TERM PAGE 1 COUN CIL BRIEFING VOL.1 Collective Bargaining and Collective Agreements Issue This briefing note provides an overview of collective bargaining and the applicable collective agreements at the City of Toronto . Background The City of Toronto and a number of its Agencies and Corporations each have one or more collective agreements with various unions (bargaining agents). Each collective agreement provides for specific terms and conditions of employment i nclud ing, for example, salaries, benefits and hours of work . Each agreement also has specific contractual time periods resulting in different or varying term lengths. The City 's Employee & Labour Relations Section of the Human Resources Division (HR/E&LR) is responsible for the (7) collective agreement s, representing 31,000 City of Toronto employees: CUPE Local 79 (Full Time Unit) CUPE Local 79 (Part Time Unit B) CUPE Local 79 (Long Term Care Homes & Services Unit) CUPE Local 79 (Recreation Workers Unit) TCEU/CUPE Local 416 (Outside Workers & Paramedics) Toronto Professional Fire Fighters' Association Local 3888 CUPE Local 2988 (A ssociation of Community Centre s) City Council has delegated authority to the Employee & Labour Relations Committee to establish a mandate for the City's bargaining team (HR/E&LR) to negotiate with the se unions . However, Cit y Council must approve any tentative collective agreement reached at these negotiations. City Agencies and Corporations Negotiations for City's Agencies and Corporations are undertaken by those respective organizations, except in cases where the City's HR/E&LR has entered into direct Shared Service Agreements. HR/E&LR has a direct Shared Service Agreement with Exhibition Place that provides full labour relations services (including collective bargaining ) for its 4.1 TRANSITION TO 2014-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUN CIL BRIEFING VOL.1 eight ( 8) collective agreements . HR/E&LR also has a Shared Service Agreement with the Toronto Zoo to lead their collective bargaining with its union, CUPE Local 1600. In March 2014, HR/E&LR en tered into a Shared Service Agreement with the Toronto Police Services Board and is now leading negotiations for the six (6) collective agreements with the Toronto Police Association that all expire on December 31, 2014. Settlements reached at the City's Agencies and Corporations impact the City's Toronto Public Service settlements and vice versa. For example, if a settlement is reached that is seen as higher than norm al, it may be used as a new standard in following Union negotiations and settlements with the City. There is significant variability among City Agencies and Corporations with respect to end dates for collective agreements. City Council, as per legislation or shareholder direction , has no direct influence on any of the City's Agencies or Cor porations bargaining mandates or outcomes. Current Status and Next Steps Collective bargaining planning process for the Toronto Police Service Board (TPSB) (represented by HR/E&LR) commenced in June 2014 with the Toronto Police Association for their six collective agreements. The TPSB approved a mandate for negotiations on August 19, 2014 and negotiations with the TPA will commence in November 2014 . Collective bargaining between the City of Toronto and TPFFA Local 3888 (Fire Fighters) will commence November 27, 2014 . At its meeting on August 22, 2014, t he EL&R committee approved a mandate for staff to begin negotiations . Collective bargaining between the City of Toronto and CUPE Local 79, CUPE Local 29 88 and TCEU/CUPE Local 416 will commence in late fall 2015. Seven of eight collective agreements with Exhibition Place also expire at the end of 2015, and mandates will be sought for negotiations to commence in late 2015 or early 2016 for those collective agreements. 4.1 TRANSITION TO 2014-2018 TERM PAGE 3 COUN CIL BRIEFING VOL.1 Additional Information Charts 1 to 4 provided in Appendix A summarize the entities within the City of Toronto government , the numerous unions/bargaining agent(s), the term of each collective agreement, and the salary increases for 2011 or 2012 onwards.

Although turnover can potentially have negative impacts on the organization (e.g., loss of corporate knowledge, skills and talent, difficulty re cruiting highly skilled, high performing employees), it also provides renewal and opens up opportunities for groups such as Generation X (34 -49 years), Millennial (less than 34 years) and equity se eking groups to gain access to C ity of Toronto employment o r to move up to higher levels in the organization. Implications Overall c urrent staffing trends for the Toronto Public Service: Total average employee headcount decreased from 34,376 in 2009 to 32,675 in 2013, a decrease of 5%, or 1701 employees. The total average headcount fluctuates seasonally with the largest headcount in the summer months. Total permanent workforce headcount decreased from 20,253 in 2009 to 19,411 between in 2013, a decrease of 4%, or 842 employees. The City's permanent workforce headcount was stable in 2009 and 2010, decreased in 2011 and 2012 and increased slightly in 2013. The average age of the City's workforce (excluding recreation workers) increased from 46 in 2009 to 47 in 2013. The average service length of employees (exc luding recreation workers) increased from 14 years in 2009 to 15 years in 2013. 4.2 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 Other notable staffing trends: In 2013, there were 4,251 non -union employees. Managers and supervisors represented 2,404 of non -union employees. The headcount of non -union employees has increased each year since 2012 (see Table 1 in the Appendix) . The majority of the increase was in professional/technical groups such as Information & Technology (I&T) staff hired for the delivery of the City's (I&T) capital projects portfolio. The turnover rate of all employees (excluding recreation workers) ranged from 5.50% to 7.43% during the period 2009 to 2013. During this same time period, the turnover rate of permanent employees ranged from 2.86% to 5.72% (see Table 2 in the Appendix). The highest turnover rate during the last 5 years was in 2011 when the City offered a voluntary separation package to employees. Notable Retirement Trends (2014-2018): By the end of 2018, 33% of the City's permanent employees are or will be eligible to retire. The number of permanent employees eligible to retire will grow from 2,575 in 2014 to 6,311 by 2018. By 2018, approximately 35% of permanent employees represented by Local 3888 (Firefighters), Local 416 (outsi de workers and paramedics) and the non -union employees will be eligible to retire. 31% of active non -union employees are or will be eligible to retire by 2018. Of these employees, 48% of directors and above w ill be eligible to retire by 2018. 37% of managers and supervisors will be eligible to retire by 2018. Of the City's unionized employees, 36% of fire fighters , 32% of outside and paramedic employees, and 26% of inside full -time employees, are or will be eligible to retire by the end of 2018. Only 2.5% part -time unionized employees are or will be eligible to retire by 2018. Current Status and Next Steps The new workforce plan endorsed by City Council, the Talent Blueprint 2014 - 2018 Building a great Toronto Public Service provides direction on how the City will prepar e to manage the retirement and other risks.

Binding obligations regarding the construction trades are set out as a separate schedule to Toronto Municipal Code, Chapter 67, Fair Wage . They are also listed in the City's Fair Wage Policy to alert potential contractors of the City's legal obligations. Background The City of Toronto adopted a Fair Wage Policy in 1998 that applies to all goods and services. Objective The Fair Wage Policy is designed to: Produce stable labour relations with minimal disruption; Establish a balanced compromise between wage differentials of organized and unorganized labour; Create a level playing field in competition for City work; Set common minimum standards in the workplace that contractors must meet; Protect the public; and Enhance the reputation of the City for fair and ethical business dealings. Establishment of Fair Wage Rates The Manager, Fair Wage Office has delegated authority to establish prevailing Fair Wage rates and update Fair Wage schedules every three years . The City's current fair wage schedules were updated and approved by City Council on De cember 18, 2013. 4.3 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 Fair wage rates do not apply to small businesses, typically those with owner - operators, or partnerships, or principals of companies as long as they undertake the work themselves. Construction Industry Construction -related fair wage rates are based on a division of the construction industry into sectors determined by work characteristics. The current fair wage schedules are in effect for the period of 2013 -2016. The Fair Wage Policy covers five construction sectors involv ing \"field work\" and has established wage rate schedules that are applied along the following sectors: Industrial, Commercial and Institutional (ICI) ; Road Building Work ; Sewer Water Main Construction ; Heavy Construction Work ; and Utility Construction Wor k. Non-Construction Industries Non-construction fair wage rates are established according to prevailing wages for non -union workers in a geographic area based on market and industrial surveys. A General Classification schedule is applied to occupations such as security guards, building maintenance , cleaners and landscapers etc. Additionally, the policy applies to \"shop work\" involving manufacturers and manufacturer locations from which the City procures goods or services. Legislated Labour Trade C ontractual Obligations in the Construction Industry Prior to amalgamation, the former City of Toronto and former Municipality of Metro Toronto were certified under the Labour Relations Act by various construction trade unions. Most of these certifications date back to the early 1980s. The amalgamated City is bound to contractual obligations to these construction trade unions pursuant to the Public Sector Labour Relations Transition Act 1997 (Bill 136) . The Labour Trades' contractual obligations are a reflection of the City's legal obligations to the nine construction unions that are certified with the City representing: asbestos workers ; bricklayers ; carpenters ; electricians; glaziers; iron workers ; 4.3 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 3 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 painters; plumbers ; and sheet metal workers If a particular project includes work that falls within the jurisdiction of the above nine trades in the Industrial, Commercial, Institutional (I.C.I.) sector of the construction industry, that work must be performed by union members. This is accomplished either by the general contractor assigning the work to members of that union directly or by sub -contracting that portion of the work to companies that are bound to the applicable union. Where work does not fall within the jurisdiction of these unions (road building, sewer and water main work, heavy construction utility work), it must be performed in compliance with the fair wage schedules (2013 -2016), but does not require to be assigned to unionized firms o r workers. Fair Wage Office The Fair Wage Office administers the Fair Wage Policy and Labour Trade Contractual Obligations in the Construction Industry involving City procurement needs. Key elements of the program involve: Verifying contractors(s) and sub-contractor(s) eligibility; Enforc ing provisions of the Fair Wage Policy ; Investigat ing construction trade grievances filed against the City of Toronto; Conduct ing on-site investigations and interviews with trade workers, labourers, mechanics, company and City officials; Review ing certified weekly/biweekly payroll records; Exercis ing contract holdback involving non ring disqu alification recommendations to S tanding Committee; and Submit ting annual reports to Committee and Council . Examp le of the activities carried out by the Fair Wage Office: Examine, monitor and report on contracted services such as curbside garbage collections Dis trict 2 vendors wage compliance; Examine and determine status of contractors and sub -contractors employing an independent contractor providing services to the City, to ensure that the relationship is a true indep endent contracting relationship; 4.3 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 4 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 Monitor contractor 's compliance when companies engage workers through temp, personnel, and day labour recruitment age ncies when performing City work; Uncovered and reported questionable labour practice contractors and sub-contractors engaged in alleged overbilling on City contracts ; Monitor the appropriate reports and list of disqualified/suspended contractors and identif ying the respective individuals and companies as a necessary step in any complianc e review or field investigation; and Involved in the recovery of approximately $2.1 million in back wages, over the past 10 years, to 1,700 workers who encountered certain contractors and sub -contractors practices such as: underpayment of wages and misclassification of workers, under reporting of hours worked and the number of workers, cash payments, non -payment of wages, unpaid overtime, banked overtime hours, non -payment of benefits, off the -the-clock violations and late payments.

It is a commitment to a strong health and safety culture with a target of pursuing a zero injuries workplace. Background In 2007, the Province identified the City of Toronto as a \"high risk employer\" due to our level of injury experience. The City launched the Target Zero Continuous Improvement initiative to create an embedded safety culture that would significa ntly decrease workplace injuries and the associated personal and financial costs. \"Target Zero\" is a joint Union/Management initiative that adopts comprehensive health and safety principles that go beyond compliance based programming. Key actions of the initiative include: An enhanced labour -management process, in particular establishing a high value on Joint Health and Safety Committees and their members. Increased openness, empowerment, mutual resp ect and pride of accomplishment; Creation of a self -sustaining continuous improvement initiative in all City divisions ; A strengthened Occupational Health and Saf ety Program in the organization; Improved health and safety communication between supervisors and workers; Improved supervisory investigation of inci dents and injuries ensuring that corrective actions are identified and taken; and Incorporation of health and safety accountability into work plans and performance reviews. Implications The ongoing support and commitment fro m City divisions, Unions and City Council has contributed to the success of the initiative. There has been a 50% decrease in the number of lost time injuries resulting in 25,186 fewer days lost due to workplace incidents from 2007 to 2013 since the 4.4 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 impleme ntation of the Target Zero initiative .

Background In 2012, the City Manager initiated a Review of the Toronto Public Service 's Management Span of Control and Management Levels . The Review was conducted by Western Management Consulting (WMC) and an internal senior management group. WMC research indicated the industry standard is between five (5) and eight (8) staff per manager. The Review determined that the City's average Management Span of Control was 8.8 staff to 1 manager, indicating a leaner structure than the industry standard . The City of Toronto has established the following standards for managers' span of control : A minimum of five (5) direct staff reports per manager ; and A maximum of five (5) management reporting levels within a Division . Span of Control Managers comprise 6.77% of employees at the City of Toronto . There are 2,292 managers responsible for supervising 31,545 union and non - union/exempt staff. The WMC review concluded that the overall average manager span of control for the City was 16.29. However, when outliers are considered ( i.e., removal of positions that had very larg e spans of control ), the adjusted manager span of control average was 8.8. # Positions Span Range # of Managers Percentage of Managers Average Span for Range # Staff in Span Range 1 - 4 506 22% 2.6 1,316 5 - 10 965 42% 7.39 7,131 11 - 15 385 - 20 185 8% 4.5 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 Research and common industry -wide practices indicate that the average manager span of control range s from five (5) to eight (8) direct staff reports . The City's Manage ment Span of Control is higher (8.8) than the average industry norm indicating that managers at the City have more staff directly reporting to them than the industry average . The Review concluded that the City of Toronto's Manage ment Span of Control compared favourably to similar organizations in Canada and the United States. A comparative analysis was done specifically to the City of Chicago, and after factoring in the differences in organization structure and service delivery models, the consultants stated , \"Toronto's span of control is very favourable (i.e. better) than its American counterpart.\" Management Reporting Levels Management reporting levels are a measure of the hierarchy of managerial positions. In large complex enterprise -level organizations, t he recommended standard for \"lean management\" is f ive (5) management reporting levels . In 2012, 189 out of 209 sections (90.4% ) of all City divisions were within the five (5) management reporting levels standard, and 9.6% of the remaining sections (20 out of 209 Sections) had more than five (5) management reporting levels. The following chart summarizes the City's 2012 management reporting levels. Summary of Management Levels (2012) Management Levels Number of City Divisions % of City Divisions Number of Sections in City Divisions % of Sections in City Divisions 5 Management Reporting Levels or less (Standard) 34 75.6% 189 90.4% 6 Management Levels 10 22.2% 19 9.1% 7 Management Levels 1 2.2% 1 0.5% Total 45 100.0% 209 100.0% The Review concluded that the overall number of management reporting levels is considered good. 4.5 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 3 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 Implications The Review did not result in recommendations or suggestions for significant changes to the existing organizational structure at the City of Toronto. Analysis by both the internal team and WMC determined that in the majority of cases, there were valid reasons f or the current divisional structures. For example, where the M anagement Span of Control and/or Management Reporting Levels were found to be outside of the norm , the exception was supported by unique operational needs of the business and the specific geogr aphic/site location coverage required. WMC also advised caution in giving too much emphasis to span of control when evaluating the effectiveness of organizational structures. It is one of many factors that need to be considered. Additional Information Since the completion of the review, City D ivisions have been directed to ensure that consideration is given to span of control whenever they are undertaking or contemplating organizational restructurings as well as when new management -level positions are created. This ensures that the corporate standard is met or that the proper rationale exists where there may be deviation from that standard. Contact s Bruce L.

Background Financial Planning and Management Framework The City's financial planning and manage ment framework is composed of five key components: Capital and Operating budget planning, preparation and submissions Budget review and approvals In-year financial control and budget adjustments Financial monitoring and variance reporting Year-end financial performance and disposition of year -end surplus or deficit (actual net expenditures less than or in excess of the budgeted City funding). Operating and Capital Budget Planning and Approvals In compliance with the City of Toronto Act , 2006 (COTA), the City must adopt a budget annually which must include estimates of all sums required during that year to pay for all debt falling due during that year, amounts required for sinking or retirement funds and amounts required for City Agencies. COTA sub -section 229(1) permits the City to prepare and adopt a budget covering a period of two to five ye ars. After the 1st year, the budget must be confirmed on an annual basis. The City of Toronto develops its Operating and Capital Budgets on a cash basis. Only revenues that will be received in cash during the budget year are 5.1 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 included in the revenue budge t. Similarly, only payments that will be made during the budget year are included in the expenditure budget. The City prepares a multi -year operating budget, which includes the current year's budget and a two -year outlook. In considering the Operating Budget, Council approves: total gross expenditures required to fund the total cost of providing the services, service levels and staff complement; total revenue as summed by the individual non -tax revenue sources; and the resultant, net expenditures that result in the level of tax -supported (or rate -supported) funding required to balance the Operating Budget. By law, operating expenditures must equal revenues. In other words, the annual operating budget must be balanced. The City maximizes all non -tax funding sources first (Program -specific reserve funds and user fees, Provincial /Federal Transfers and other 3rd party and corporate revenues) to minimize property tax funding, which is the funding source of last resort. Th e City cannot borrow funds (issue debt) to balance the operating budget . If the City experiences a deficit by year -end, the deficit must be budgeted for in the following fiscal year. The City has not had a deficit to -date. Use of one time revenues to fund ongoing expenditures is restricted to extraordinary situations, which must be approved by Council on a case -by-case basis. One - time revenues should be more appropriately used for purposes such as early debt retirement, capi tal expenditures, and one -time expenditures. Any Operating Surplus realized by the City at year -end will be disposed of in accordance with Council's Surplus Management Policy, in the following priority order: Transferred to the Capital Financing Reserve Fund (at least 75% of the surplus); and Fund any under -funded liabilities, and/or reserves/reserve funds at the discretion of the Deputy City Manager & Chief Financial Officer. In addition to the operating budget, the City prepares a 10 -Year Capital Budget and Plan for the management of its assets that support service delivery. 5.1 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 3 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 In considering the 10 -Year Capital Budget and Plan, Council approves: A Capital Budget for the current year consisting of: 1. approved gross expenditures ( cash flow ) and funding for previously approved projects/sub -projects; 2. the total project cost and appropriated gross expenditures ( cash flow) and funding for new and change -in-scope capital projects/sub -projects as well as commitments to future year gross expenditures ( cash flow ) and funding for multi -year projects; and 3. unspent funding carried forward from prior years to complete projects. Planned estimates and funding sources for each capital project/sub - project for the balance of the 10 years. Debt to be issued only for the curr ent budget year and planned debt funding to be issued for each of the remaining 9 years of the Capital Plan. The Capital Plan is prepared based on debt affordability and includes estimates of capital expenditures (capital projects) to keep the City's existing assets in a state of good repair and to improve, expand, acquire and/or construct new capital assets required to meet service demands and support service growth. The Capital Plan will also include financing sources for these expenditures. Capital expenditures represent the costs to acquire, construct, develop or better a City owned or controlled asset. Betterments are considered eligible capital expenditures when they materially increase the physical output or service capacity, lower operating co sts, extend the useful life or improve the quality of output of a capital asset. The City maximizes all non -debt financing sources first (Federal/Provincial Transfers, Program -specific reserve funds, Development Charge funding, capital contribution from the operating budget (Capital from Current) to fund the Capital Program, minimizing both debt funding and ultimately the impact that servicing debt has on the Operating Budget. COTA permits the City to borrow funds (issue debt) to finance capital expenditu res. Debt funding levels are established for each year of the 10 year capital planning period. Debt repayment (principal and interest) is an operating expenditure which must be managed. 5.1 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 4 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 In establishing debt affordability targets, the City restricts its de bt service cost limit to no more than 15% of property tax revenues. In-year Financial Control and Budget Adjustments COTA prohibits City Council from delegating its authority for the approval of its budget or any amendments to it. Council approval is requ ired for any of the following in -year changes to a City Program or Agency Council -approved Capital Budget and Plan and Operating Budget: Any changes to the Approved Capital Budget and Plan as a result of: o over-expenditures ; o accelerations ; o deferrals ; o change in project scope greater than 10% of the project cost or $500,000 ; o the addition of a new project ; and/or o unplanned allocations of funding sources including reserve funds . Changes must result in a permanent reallocation of funding from other projects with like funding sources in the current year (with appropriate adjustments to these projects) and any future year projects in the 10 - Year Capital Plan. Funding must be in place to award contracts. Any changes to the Approved Operating Budget that result in cha nges to any of the following: o gross expenditures ; o total revenue ; o net expen ditures (tax supported funding); o the City's overall staff complement count ; and/or o any proposed changes to services or service levels . Requests to amend the budget are submitted to Committee and Council by way of a staff report that identifies the impacts on services and service levels with emphasis placed on resultant tax funding impacts on the operating budget and debt impacts on the capital budget and plan. Amendments must not re quire that the total property tax levy (operating) or debt financing (capital) be increased during the year as they are fixed with the 5.1 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 5 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 budget. In the absence of contingency accounts, any in -year financial impacts must be offset by a reallocation of like f unding sources. In accordance with the Financial Control By Law, all staff reports for submission to Committee and Council must be reviewed for financial implications and signed off by Financial Planning staff on behalf of the Chief Financial Officer. In formation in the \"Financial Implications\" report must include current and future year costs and funding requirements and impacts of the proposal; staffing impacts, any required budget adjustments, risk, precedent -setting ability as well as whether the reco mmended proposal is consistent with Council's strategic directions and fiscal priorities. Changes to staff report recommendations made at Standing Committee meetings, as well as Notices of Motion submitted by Councillors for Council meetings cannot result in the total property tax levy (operating) or debt financing (capital) being increased during the year. Any proposed amendments should be evaluated by Financial Planning staff on behalf of the Chief Financial Officer for financial implications, in advanc e or during Committee of Council meetings. In the case of Notice of Motions, a fiscal impact statement is submitted to ensure Council has full knowledge of the financial impacts prior to Council's consideration of the matters. Financial Monitoring and Variance Reporting Financial control of both the approved Operating and Capital Budgets is achieved through monitoring of actual expenditures and revenues to ensure compliance with budgetary plans, as well as the City's Financial Control By - law. On a quart erly basis, capital and operating variance reports are presented to Budget Committee, Executive Committee and City Council to provide information on actual spending performance against planned expenditures with projections to year -end, the identification o f emergent financial pressures along with any recommended mitigation strategies, if necessary. Annually, the City prepares audited financial statements based on generally accepted accounting principles. Unlike the annual budgets which are based on cash fl ow, the financial statements are prepared on accrual basis accounting principles. In the covering staff report the financial statement surplus is reconciled to the cash flow based budget surplus. In addition to the external auditors who review the annual financial statements, the City has an Internal Audit Division and an Auditor General that 5.1 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 6 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 monitor the effectiveness of internal controls and report noncompliance to policies and procedures, best practices and principles to Council. The City of Toronto's Budget Process First approved by City Council in 2006, the \"Mature Budget Process\" also led to the establishment of the City's Integrated Planning and Performance Framework. In 2011, Council reaffirmed this approach and adopted the Multi - Year Financial Planning and Budgeting Process that integrates (a) service planning and priority settin g and (b) multi -year service -based budgeting . In accordance with COT A, in election years the incoming Council must approve a budget schedule that facilitates approval and adoption of the 2015 Operating and Capital Budgets, for both Rate and Tax Supported Budgets, in the budget year but no later than April 10, The investment opportunity loss / borrowing costs associated with the delay in issuing the final tax bills range from approximately $247,000 to $350,000 for each day the due date is extended. The 2015 budget process and schedule , to achieve Council approval, must include the Committee review budget activities and should adhere to budget best practices . The process and schedule m ust be approved by the Executive Committee at its first meeting in December through a staff report from the City Manager and D eputy City Manager -Chief Financial Officer. Financial Overview: 2014 - 2023 Capital Budget and Plan The City owns an extensive portfolio o f physical assets comprising roads, expressways, bridges, traffic signal controls, water and wastewater treatment facilities, distribution and collection pipes, reservoirs, pumping stations, subways, streetcars, buses, civic centre s, recreation facilities, public housing buildings, parkland and other lands. This infrastructure, excluding land, is currently estimated to be worth in excess of $72 billion. The City's capital program is driven largely by the costs of maintaining these physical assets in a state of good repair. The City's road network, the majority of which was constructed in the 1950s and 1960s, is in need of repair and rehabilitation. In recognition of the need to reduce the Sta te-of-Good Repair backlog related to the City's transportation infrastructure, 79% of the 2014 -2023 Capital Plan for Transportation Services is dedicated to State -of-Good- 5.1 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 7 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 Repair projects, compared to approximately 60% across all other Programs. Similarly, the City's watermains and pipes are an average of 55 years old and 20% of them are more than 80 years old. Recognizing the need to virtually eliminate the State -of-Good-Repair backlog by 2023, an annual water rate increase of 9% has been in plac e since 2006. While the 10 -Year Capital Program for Toronto Water include s funding to reduce the SOGR backlog, the Plan excludes $766 million in unfunded capital needs, predominately required to advance the Wet Weather Flow Master Plan and the Basement F looding Protection program. To continue to address growing infrastructure requirements for water, waste water and storm water needs following completion of the planned 9% water rate increases in 2014, Council has requested that staff also examine the impac t of a higher water rate increase assumption of 8% for the period 2015 -2017. City Council also requested that staff report back on additional financing options during the 2015 budget process. Major challenges for the capital planning process include: Addressing the increased investment need in SOGR due to aging infrastructure in Transportation Services including the Gardiner Expressway and the TTC; Accommodating Riders hip Growth for the TTC; Addressing TTC unfunded capital projects totaling about $3 bil lion; and Managing debt by ensuring that debt costs remain below the 15% ceiling approved by Council. 10-Year Capital Budget and Plan (Tax and Rate Supported Programs) The 2014 - 2023 Approved Tax and Rate Supported Capital Budget and Plan totals $28.7 billion of which $18.6 billion or 65% is allocated to Tax Supported Programs; and $10.1 billion or 35% is allocated to Rate -Supported Programs (Toronto Parking Authority, Toronto Water and Solid Waste Management Services). As reflected in Chart 2, all elig ible and available non -debt funding sources are fully maximized prior to the application of debt funding for the Capital Budget and Plan's expenditures. 5.1 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 8 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 Chart 2 How Capital Expenditures are Funded Chart 3 identifies how the City utilizes its various funding sources to fund the $28.7 billion 10 -Year Capital Budget and Plan: Chart 3 2014 - 2023 Capital Budget and Plan by Funding Source $Million $28.667 Billion \\ Debt, $10,054, 35% 5.1 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 9 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 Chart 4 provides a breakdown of how the $28.7 billion Capital Program is spent amongst City Programs, Agencies and specific initiatives. It should be noted that Toronto Water Services, Transit and Transportation Services represent 79% or $22.6 billion of the 2014 - 2023 Capital Budget and Plan's overall expenditures, which is reflective of the significant capital requirements of these Programs. Chart 4 2014 - 2023 Capital Budget and Plan ($Million ) $28.667 Billion While $10.6 billion is allocated to Transit related capital expenditures, this level of capital funding does not address all the TTC's capital needs. About $3.0 billion in TTC capital projects over and above the 2014 - 2023 Capital Budget and Plan remain unfunded. 5.1 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 10 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 Despite the City's sizeable investment in transit, there remain s the need for a partnership between the Government of Canada, the Province of Ontario and the City of Toronto for a dedicated, long term, stable funding plan. Chart 5 shows the 2014 - 2023 Capital Budget & Plan Expenditures by the City's five project categories, noting that $16.3 billion or 57% is dedicated to State of Good Repair (SOGR) projects. This reflects the City's commitment to ensuring its assets are able to support service delivery. Chart 5 2014 - 2023 Tax & Rate Supported Capital Budget & Plan by Category $28.667 Billion The 2014 - 2023 Tax Supported Capital Budget and Plan (excludes the Rate Supported Programs) totals $18.6 billion in expenditures, of which $11.1 billion or 60% is for SOGR projects. 5.1 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 11 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 Non-Debt Capital Financing Strategies Capital Financing Strategy for Priority Projects: In 2012, the City established a capital financing strategy. A major funding source of this strategy is the operating surplus. The Surplus Management policy approved by Council in 2004 states that the surplus be applied in priority order to the following: o Capital Financing Reserve (at least 75% of the surplus) ; and o The remainder to fund any underfunded liabilities and/or reserve funds as determined by the Deputy City Manager & Chief Financial Officer. As presented in Table 1: o The non -debt capital financing strategy will fund $2.0 billion in capital projects over the 2012 to 2023 period; o It is anticipated that $2.0 billion in contributions to the Capital Financing Reserve over the 2012 to 2023 period will be achieved predominately from the use of prior year operating surpluses; and o The projects to be funded from the Capital Financing Strategy are primarily Toronto Transit Commission and Transportation Services projects.

Dedicated Property Tax Increase for the Scarborough Subway Extension Project : The total estimated cost for the Scarborough Subway Extension is $3.56 billion (expressed in inflated dollars, or $2.5 billion in 2010 dollars). Current funding commitments received for the construction of the subway extension are as follows: o Provincial g overnment - $1.99 billion (expressed in inflated dollars, or $1.48 billion in 2010 dollars); o Federal government - $660 million (expressed in inflated dollars); o City of Toronto - $910 million (inflated dollars). The City will fund its share of the capital project through a combination of debt funding (serviced through a dedicated 1.6% property tax increase) and development charges funding; and o A dedicated property tax increase 0.5% in 2014, 0.5% in 2015 and 0.6% in 2016 will provide funding to repay the de bt service costs for the project. Maximizing Development Charge Funding : Development Charge funding has been utilized to the extent permissible in the 2014 -2023 Tax -Supported Capital Budget and Plan in order to mitigate the reliance on debt and other funding. Debt Financing: Over the 2014 -2023 capital planning horizon, plann ed debt for the City Programs and Agencies totals $ 3.3 billion. o The City's strategy to increase Capital from Current (\"pay as you go\") contributions by 10% annually will result in $3.8 billion i n Capital from Current funding being available over the 10 year planning period . o It should be noted that debt funding would otherwise increase by an equivalent amount. o The continuation of this strategy will reduce debt funding requirements by 58.2% from previous forecasts . 5.1 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 13 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 Debt Charges as a % of the Property T ax Levy City Council has established a maximum limit of 15% of debt service charges as a percentage of property taxes. This reaffirmed the limit which was established by Council in 2006. As a result of the capital financing strategy and reduced interest rates, the debt service charge ratio resulting from the 2014 - 2023 Capital Budget and Plan will not exceed the approved 15% debt service charge guideline over the 10 year planning period, as shown in Chart 6.

These services range from human and community services, to emergency (police, fire and paramedic) services, planning and infrastructure; transit and roads; cultural; and governance and corporate services. Many of these services are provided on a 24-hour, 7-day basis. In order to maintain the se services and service levels, the City is challenged annually to ensure sufficient funding is available to maintain the quality and level of current services while providing funding for strategic investments in City services to meet public needs and demands. 2014 Operating Budget The 2014 Approved Operating Budget (gross expenditures) of $11.2 billion is composed of: A Tax Supported Operating Budget of $9.7 billion (City Programs and Agencies) A Rate-Supported Operating Budget of $1.5 billion for Toronto Parking Authority, Solid Waste Management Services and Toronto Water Services which are fully funded by user fees or rates.

Salaries and Benefits represent the largest expenditure type totalling almost $5.0 billion and represent 44.7% of total expenditures. In total, City Council approved a complement of 52,672 positions in 2014 (this includes Tax and Rate supported budgets), of which 49,804 positions are required to deliver operating services, and 2,868 positions to deliver the capital program. Chart 9 illustrates the revenues utilized to balance the 2014 Operating Budget, noting that $3.76 billion or 38.9% of the $9.7 billio n in gross expenditures is funded by property taxes. 5.1 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 16 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 Chart 9 How the Tax Supported Budget Operating Expenditures are Funded Chart 10 shows how the $11. 2 billion 2014 Tax and Rate Supported Operating Budget is funded, with $3.76 billion or 33.7% of total funding generated through property taxes.

Table 2 highlights all estimated incremental expenditure changes for 2015 and 2016. The forecasted 2015 Outlook and 2016 Outlook pressure s before revenue increases are approximately $403 million and $373 million, respectively. These include pressures from depletion / use of reserve funds of $30 million in 2015 and $16 million in 2016 .

The Social Housing funding loss is anticipated to be partially offset by revenue increases resulting from: TTC Ridership growth and a forecasted 10 cent fare increase (subject to Commission approval); Uploading of service costs; Toronto Hydro dividend income; User fee revenue increase. Revenue from assessment growth that is anticipated to increase by $30 million for both 2015 and 2016.

The City will be challenged to find efficiencies and other cost savings or r evenue sources to address the anticipated net operating pressures of $3 82 million in 2015 and $ 254 million in 2016. It should be noted that: every 1% Property Total Tax Increase = $37.5 million on the total tax levy However, given the City's policy to tax commercial properties at 1/3 of residential rates: every 1% Property Residential Tax Increase = $24.7 million The estimated property tax increases for the 2 year Outlook are as follows: Forecast Budgetary Property Tax Increase * Residential Property Tax Increase Total Property Tax Increase 2015 15.5% 10.2% 2016 13.2% 6.75% * excludes Scarborough Subway impacts (0.5% residential and 0.3% commercial) and CVA / Tax Policy (est. 0.5% residential and 0%) 5.1 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 21 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 Capital Budget Pressures and Unfunded Projects Major challenges for the 2015 Capital planning process include: 1. Increased investment needed in State of Good Repair projects; 2. Necessity to accommodate the capital impact of TTC Ridership Growth; 3. Unmet capital needs; 4. Need to monitor and keep debt service costs below the 15% guideline; and 5. Uncertainty over future Federal and Provincial Funding programs. State of Good Repair Maintaining the condition of the City's infrastructure is a key priority and one that poses pressing challenges. It is absolute ly essential that the City ensure that the assets are maintained in a state of good repair to provide efficient, reliable, and safe service . The City assesses on a yearly basis the level of capital investment required to attain and maintain a state of goo d repair for each Program and Agency's assets. The SOGR backlog is tracked, managed and addressed in the annual capital budgeting process. Bringing our City's aging infrastructure to a state of good repair, while at the same time planning for and implemen ting needed service expansion is a significant challenge. The City has been, and will continue to be, proactive on this issue by raising awareness throughout the budget process and exploring creative approaches to financing necessary repairs and upgrades for aging assets. The SOGR backlog information has become more meaningful since the approval of a firm 10 -year Capital Plan beginning in 2010. The more recent establishment of asset values arising from compliance with Public Sector Accounting Board (PSAB) guidelines has enabled the City to track SOGR backlog as a percent of asset value, making the accumulated SOGR backlog as a percentage of asset value a key indicator to monitor the backlog. Details of the SOGR Backlog trend and percentage of total asset va lue can be found in the Capital Analyst Notes for each Program and Agency. As noted in Table 4, the top 5 programs wi th accumulated SOGR backlog are: Transportation Services, Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), Facilities 5.1 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 22 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 Management and Real Estate (FM&RE), Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) and Parks, Forestry and Recreation (PF&R) which make up $1.780 billion or 87.3% of the $2.038 billion SOGR backlog. SOGR Backlog by Program - Summary Table 4 With the exception of Transportation Services and TTC, recommended SOGR capital funding will reduce the accumulated SOGR for each of these Programs over the 10 year Capital planning period. Unmet Capital Needs During the 2014 - 2023 budget process, $4.254 billion in unmet capital needs were identified, however due to funding constraints and overall capital prioritization they were not included within the budget. Of the $4.254 billion in unmet needs, Tax supported programs accounted for $3.488 billion and the balance $765.876 million is for Water Services. During the 2013 and 2014 budget processes, significant advancements were made in addressing unmet needs through the development of the capital financing strategy and maximizing the allocation of DC funding following approval of the 2014 DC Bylaw. Continued gains on addressing unmet needs are expected as a result of: Council's request that staff examine the impact of a higher water rate increase assumption of 8% for the period 2015 -2017 to address unfunded Toronto Water capital priorities; Ongoing efforts to prioritize, seek and secure funding from the Provincial and Federal governments for TTC capital requirements; and The review of approved capital projects against program spending capacity, ensuring capital funding that otherwise would not be spent is allocated to other unfunded priorities. $ Million 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Commission 0 30 93 123 148 183 208 243 278 313 338 Facilities Management and Real Estate 334 32 351 341 337 324 308 296 288 279 285 Toronto & Region Conservation Authority 187 18 182 180 177 175 172 169 166 163 158 Parks, Forestry & Recreation 310 29 308 330 335 360 317 305 247 184 120 Other 259 26 255 246 240 231 219 223 216 206 209 TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 23 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 Current Status and Next Step s The City has a financial management and control system in place which is focused on ensuring that its financial resources are protected and utilized to provide the highest priority services efficiently and effectively. The City provides a large and diverse number of services to its citizens; however, it has direct control over services that compr ise only 28% of its total operating budget. To ensure that the 2015 operating and capital budgets are approved on a timely basis, Council must approve a budget process and schedule, along with directions on its priorities, roles and responsibilities of th e Budget and Executive Committees in the budget process at its first meeting in 2015. In preparing the operating budget Council must recognize that while every effort is made to maximize non -tax revenues and minimize service costs, property tax funding pr ovide the City its largest funding source, In creases in property tax rates at or below the rate of inflation will not provide sufficient funding to maintain or enhance services and service levels and sustain the City's fiscal health. Similarly, in prepari ng the capital budget and plan every effort must be made to ensure that scarce/affordable funds are utilized to maintain the existing infrastructure in a state of good repair while investing in new assets to satisfy the growing demand for City services. I t is essential that capital investments to maintain the existing infrastructure and to fund expansion to fulfill growing services demands be balanced against the need to manage debt within affordable limits.

Background The City of Toronto Act (CoTA), sub -section 228 (1) states that \"The City shall in each year prepare and adopt a budget including estimates of all sums required during the year\" for the purpose of continuing the business of the City. The City's Financial Control By -Law (FCB) st ipulates that \"Council shall, before the adoption of the final operating budget for a year, adopt an interim operating budget...prior to the 1st day of January of the year in which the operating budget will be adopted\" . Annually, Council approves Interim Op erating and Capital Budget Est imates based on a percentage of the prior year 's approved Operating and Capital Budget s to provide sufficient funding authority to maintain ongoing operations and to continue work on approved capital projects until the respective Operating and Capital Budget s are approved by Council. In the last term of Council, Interim Operating Estimates were set at 30% of the prior year 's Approved Operating Budget to provide sufficient funding authority and control . Interim Capital E stimates were set at 25% of previously approved capital projects' cash flow commitments . The temporary cashflow measure has no impact on the final budget decisions made by Council, as the interim cashflow funding is replaced by the final approved Budget s. City Council's approval of the 2015 Interim Capital Estimates is required in order to provide requested cashflow funding , spending authority and control to continue work on previously approved capital projects until the 2015 - 2024 Capital Budget and Plan is approved . This will enable staff to take full advantage of time -driven benefits, remove/mitigate health and safety risks 5.2 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 and to proceed with capital activities on previously approved projects that must continue during the first months of 2015.

Background The City of Toronto Act (COTA), sub-section 228 (1) states that \"The City shall in each year prepare and adopt a budget including estimates of all sums required during the year\" for the purpose of continuing the business of the City. COTA also allows Council to adopt a multi -year budget from 2 to 5 years in length provided that it is reviewed and confirmed on an annual basis within the multi -year planning period. The City of Toronto Financial Planning and Budget Process The City of Toronto has adopted a multi -year financial planning a nd budgeting process that also incorporates service planning and performance management. This process is described in detail in the Briefing Note , \"Integrated Planning and Performance Framework\" (Note 5.4, Council Briefing Volume 1). 5.3 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 The approved multi -year financial p lanning and budgeting process ( illustrated in Appendix 1) has two key elements , which are described below. Service Planning and Priority Setting Guided by Council's strategic directions, all Programs and Agencies will develop three to five -year service plans. Standing Committees will review service plans annually to monitor service performance; assess progress against service objectives; targets and priority actions; and develop strategies to address emerging service issues and to recommend service priorities. Service planning will include up -front public engagement on priority setting. Budget Committee will assess Standing Committee's recommended service priorities, associated service objectives and targets and service performance within the City's fiscal circ umstances and financial outlook and recommend service priorities, budget directions and targets to Executive Committee. Executive Committee will set s ervice priorities and objectives to guide the annual operating and capital budget process. Multi-Year Bu dgeting The 10 -Year Capital Budget and Plan and the 3 -Year Operating Budget and Plan will be established. Capital and Operating Budgets will be reaffirmed each year in order to appropriate funds. The City Manager (CM) and Deputy City Manager & Chief Fina ncial Officer (DCM -CFO) will review all Program and Agency Budgets to ensure that resources are allocated to service priorities. The Committee review process will include public deputations. The Tax -Supported Operating and Capital Budgets will be approved early in the new year (i.e. late January or early February in a non - election year ). The Rate -Supported Operating and Capital Budgets are normally approved by December of the previous year (in a non -election year). 5.3 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 3 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 Chart 1 illustrates the City's current budget process . Chart 1 City's Current Budget Process Administrative Review Process Shortly following approval of the budget, Financial Planning staff begin preparation for the following budget process, establishing budgeting strategies, guidelines and instructions. Guidelines, directions and budget targets are issued by the City Manager (CM) and Deputy City Manager & Chief Financial Officer (DCM -CFO) to all City Division and Agency Heads. These guidelines are based on formal or informal directions received by the Mayor and/or Council. City Program and Agency staff prepare a 10 Year Capital Budget and Plan based on available City financing capacity (debt tar gets) for each of the 10 years and an Operating Budget based on affordability (operating targets) and submit them to the Financial Planning Division for analysis and review. The Adm inistrative Review Process has two steps: 1) The Financial Planning Review : The Director, Financial Planning leads the first phase, examining all issues and evaluating all budget requests and strategies to meet budget targets with an aim to resolve issues and recommend budgets that are aligned to Council priorities; 5.3 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 4 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 use resource s efficiently and effectively, in accordance with guidelines, directions, affordability based on budget targets. 2) The City Manager/Chief Financial Officer Review: The Director, Financial Planning refers any unresolved or outstanding major issues such as th ose significantly impacting priorities, balancing strategies or service levels with further recommendation for resolution. The CM/CFO, together with Financial Planning staff, meet with Division and Agency Heads to finalize all outstanding issues. The CM a nd DCM -CFO, together with the other Deputy City Managers , finalize the 10 -Year Capital Budget and Plan and the Operating Budget and establish a Staff Recommended Capital Budget and Plan and a Staff Recommended Operating Budget that is balanced and meets th e priorities of Council. The Staff Recommended Operating Budget and Capital Budget and Plan are presented to the Budget Committee. This meeting launches the beginning of the Co mmittee review process. Committee Review Process The current budget roles and responsibilities of Committee and Council are highlighted below: On behalf of the Executive Committee, the Mayor may provide upfront budget directions to staff. These directions focus on fulfilling Council's strategic policy agenda by aligning resources to priorities and policies that are based on sound financial management principles, and meet budgetary targets. Prior to finalizing the staff recommended budgets for public launch, Budget Committee members are assigned to undertake detailed reviews of indi vidual City Program and Agency budgets with the Program/Agency Head to ensure that Executive Committee's directions were met. The Budget Committee, on behalf of the Executive Committee, holds formal meetings / hearings to receive public deputations and inp ut from Councillors on matters and issues of interest and where necessary, make changes to the staff recommended budget. The Budget Committee recommends a balanced budget to the Executive Committee. This budget should demonstrate strategic alignment of re sources to Council priorities, highlight expected results 5.3 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 5 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 and outcomes, and should incorporate strategies adopted to resolve the structural fiscal problems. The Executive Committee's review of the budget focuses on major fiscal and policy issues and confir ms the budget as a strategic financial plan that will implement Council policies and priorities. On behalf of the Executive Committee, the Budget is presented to Council for final review and approval. The political review process includes the following budget activities: Public Launch o CM, DCM -CFO and Director, Financial Planning present the Staff Recommended Operating Budget and 10 -Year Capital Budget and Plan to Budget Committee. o Budget materials are distributed to Council and the Public. Public Deput ations o Public provides input/ response to staff recommended budgets. As requested by Budget Committee, staff will prepare budget briefing notes in response to information requests. Town Hall Meetings o City Councillors hold Ward Town Hall meetings at any time during the process to inform their constituency on the Staff Recommended 2015 Operating Budget and 10 -Year Capital Budget and Plan and respond to questions and comments. Budget Review Meetings o Budget Committee Hearings are held to receive input from Councillors and the public on the Staff Recommended Budgets. This stage of the process includes the following: Cluster/Agency Head presentations of programs/services and service levels/standards delive red; Challenges / accomplishments; Staff Recommended 2015 Operating Budget and 10 -Year Capital Budget and Plan by Cluster/Agency ; and Public deputations. Committee members may request additional information in the form of Budget Briefing Notes. Budget Committee Wrap -Up 5.3 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 6 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 o Budget Committee is provided Briefing Notes and supplementary Reports to address additional inquiries and to support the decision making process. Budget Committee Final Wrap -Up o Budget Committee reviews Briefing Notes, responses to additional Program/Agency information requests and budget options. o Budget Committee finalizes its review and establishes its Operating Budget and 10 -Year Capital Budget and Plan to be considered by th e Executive Committee. o Financial Planning prepare s and submit s corporate reports on behalf of the Budget Committee, reflecting the Committee's Recommended Operating Budget including an updated 2 year Outlook and the 10 -Year Capital Budget and Plan. Executive Committee Review o Executive Committee receives and reviews the Budget Committee Recommended 2015 Operating Budget and 10 -Year Capital Budget and Plan. o Executive Committee recommends the 2015 Operating Budget and 10 -Year Capital Budget and Plan to Ci ty Council. Council Review and Approval o Council review and approval of the 2015 Operating and Capital Budgets. Budget Process Timing o In non -election years, the Rated Supported 10 -year Capital Plans and Operating Budgets for Solid Waste Management Services, Toronto Water and the Toronto Parking Authority are launched in late October/early November and are approved by mid -December in the year before the budget year, so that the rates charged for these services can be set to be effective on January 1. o In non -election years, the Tax Supported Operating Budget and Capital Budget and Plan approvals launched together at the end of November and are approved by late January/early February as close to the end of the fiscal year as possible to ensure that as much of the fiscal year is available to achieve best pricing from early contract awards and to maximize the construction season and to make service adjustments. o The Tax -Supported Operating Budget must be approved no later than April 10. The investment oppor tunity loss / borrowing costs associated with the delay in issuing the final tax bills range from 5.3 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 7 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 approximately $250,000 to $350,000 for each day the due date is extended. o In an election year, the public launch of all budgets is delayed until the new fisca l year, once Committees have been struck. However, the establishment of budget process approval date must be considered in light of the matters noted above. Consequently, the budget process in an election year is typically modified or accelerated to meet v arious business needs. Implications Council must adopt a budget process and timelines for its term of Council, with a modified version required for 2015 due to the late start resulting from the election. The ability to establish a budget process with timelines for the new term of Council, generally, and for 2015 specifically, will be impacted by the key elements and activities to be included in the City's budget process: Service Planning or Service Level Review to establish service priorities ; Upfront public engagement of priorities or budget directions ; Roles and responsibilities of Council and its committees relative to the budget review and approval process such as upfront Council or Executive Committee Budget directions ; and The timing and duration of the budget process ' Committee review process . Current Status and Next Steps 2015 Budget Schedule The 2015 budget process is underway, actions taken to date and actions required are summarized below. 5.3 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 8 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 In May the City Manager (CM) and Deputy City Manager & Chief Financial Officer (DCM -CFO) developed and distributed budget directions and guidelines for 2015 Operating and Capital Budgets which addressed the City's projected Operating Budget pressures / shortfall. The 2015 Net Operating Budget target for all City Programs and Agencies was set to be the equivalent of the 2014 Approved Net Operating Budget, with the aim to achieve a 0% net expenditure increase over 2014. On May 23, 2014 all City Divisions and Agencies were to submit their Tax Supported Capital Budget and on June 23 their Operating Budget requests to the Financial Planning Division for review and recommendation to the CM and DCM-CFO. In July and August the Director, Financial Planning Division reviewed Budget submissions with Programs and Agenci es. From September to November the CM and DCM -CFO reviewed the Program and Agency Operating and Capital Budget submissions with their respective DCMs and Division Heads and finalized the Staff Recommended 2015 Operating Budget and 2 -Year Outlook and a 10 - Year Capital Budget and Plan. Current Status and Next Steps In accordance with CO TA, in election years the incoming Council must approve a budget schedule that facilitates approval and adoption of the 2015 Operating and Capital Budgets, for both Rate and Tax Supported Budgets, in the budget year.

Council did not undertak e a strategic planning process to establish strategic goals and directions at the outset of its term which would have been necessary to guide the service planning and multi -year budgeting process. Instead, Council's early focus was on eliminating its relia nce on prior year's surplus as a budget revenue source in order to move the City towards fiscal sustainability. Notwithstanding the above, Council did approve key initiatives that were based on strategic priority -setting informed by upfront public consulta tion including : In April 2011, Council approved a Service Review Program and undertook a Core Service Review that included extensive public engagement activities to set the foundation for the City's services and service levels in time for the 2012 Budget process, with implementation that continued through the 2013 Budget process; In July 2013, Council approved and undertook a service level review through its Standing Committees that included public deputations, enabling Standing Committees to review City Programs' service levels and standards and recommended service level priorities for consideration during the 2014 Budget process; In March 2014, Council reaffirmed its Strategic Plan and approved 26 new Strategic Actions to advance its vision, mission and goals for the City and guide the City's service planning, multi -year budgeting, and performance planning processes which complement its current initiatives and Council priorities. City Council also requested the City Manager to bring forward a process in 2015 to update Council's 2002 Strategic Plan including public and stakeholder consultation. During its consideration of the 2014 Budget, Council directed: The DCM -CFO to include in the 2015 Budget process a Standing Committee Service Level Review proces s. The City Manager report to Budget Committee on a potential pilot project for implementing a community participatory budgeting program as part of the 2015 Budget process. 5.4 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 1 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 The Integrated Planning and Performance Framework Issue This briefing note provides an overview of the City's Integrated Planning Multi-Year Budgeting and Performance Framework and addresses four major components of the Framework: strategic planning; service planning; multi - year budgeting; and performance monitoring and reporting. Background The City of Toronto is committed to demonstrating accountability, and has recognized the i mportance of long -term planning and priority -setting. In an effort to provide a strategic approach that support s sound decision -making with meaningful information to assess policy impacts and service performance, and to demonstrate value in how monies have been spent, the City employs an integrated planning and performance framework that incorporates leading practices. Th e framework is built upon an integrated multiyear approach designed on the principles of continuous improvement, priority setting, performance monitoring, evaluation and reporting. The Integrated Planning and Performance Framework connect Council's goals to service objectives and multi -year budgeting priorities. 5.4 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 The Integrated Planning and Performance Framework enables the City to: Take a multi -year view to guide service planning , budgeting and the allocation of resources . Set performance measures and targets to ensure that multi -year budgets meet the goal s and directions set by Council . Provide increased transparency and accountability regarding the services it delivers to the public . Ensure resources are efficiently allocated to services to achieve long - term strategic outcomes . Monitor results and impact of services; thus providing staff and Council with the added capacity to re -allocate resources based on short and long-term g oals. The Integrated Planning and Performance Framework incorporates best practices and proven methodologies in implementing its major components: strategic planning, service planning, multi -year budgeting, and performance monitoring and reporting. Strategic Planning In 2002, City Council approved its Strategic Plan, which sets out the long - term vision and strategic goals for the City. Since then, the City has made great strides in accomplishing most of those goals, which have set a strong foundation f or the future. At its meeting of October 8 -11, 2013, City Council affirmed 26 new strategic actions to guide the City's service planning, multi - year budgeting and performance measurement initiatives for 2013 to 2018 . Service Planning Service planning is a key pillar of the Integrated Planning and Performance Framework as it provides the link between strategies and budgets. It seeks to translate high -level strategies into service objectives that are linked to Council's strategic actions and priorities, and to guide the allocation of resources during the budgeting phase of the process. Planning is essential for effective service delivery and good financial management. A common service planning process: Provides clear accountability for achieving Councils goals and strategic actions ; Provides Committee s and Council with the ability to establish relative service priorities and establish objectives, targets and outcomes ; and 5.4 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 3 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 Guides and informs the budget process by establishing service lev els and multi -year estimates of resources required to achieve service objectives and outcomes. Multi-Year Budgeting In 2006, City Council approved a new budget process that was further refined and reaffirmed by City Council in 2011 (see Appendix 1) based on generally accepted principles: 1. Establish Broad Goals to Guide Decision Making - a government should have broad goals that provide direction and serve as a basis for decision making; 2. Develop Approaches to Achieve Goals - a government should have specific policies, plans, programs and management strategies to define how it will achieve its long -term goals; 3. Develop a Budget Consistent with Approaches to Achieve Goals - a financial plan and budget that moves toward achievement of goals, within the con straints of available resources, should be prepared and adopted; and 4. Evaluate Performance and Make Adjustment - program and financial performance should be continually evaluated and adjustments made to encourage progress toward achieving goals. The key el ements of the City's Multi -year Financial Planning and Budgeting Process: Engages stakeholders in priority -setting thro ugh upfront public consultation, Has a long -term perspective for planning and budgeting that promotes service and fiscal sustainability , Introduces a structured service planning process that links resource allocations to service objectives and targe ts driven by Council priorities, Is service -based and performance -focused: it focuses budget decisions on service objectives, service levels, results and outcomes using performance targets and metrics , Emphasizes the evaluation of service performance so th at planned results are achieved, Establishes roles and responsibilities for Standing Committees, the Budget Committee and Executive Committee. 5.4 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 4 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 The City's multi -year, service -based budgeting process is intended to establish a longer -term focus regarding the allocation of resources required to deliver the programs and services needed by the community, and to accomplish Council's goals and priorit ies for its term of office. Multi -year budgeting enables City Programs and Agencies to set achievable targets within realistic timeframes, and provides a more efficient, systematic and consistent approach to prioritize and allocate resources across all ser vices. Performance Monitoring and Reporting The City is also implementing a performance measurement and reporting process to support the integrated framework. Program maps have identified all services, thus providing a functional model of government serv ices provided by the City. This service inventory will form the basis of reporting to the public on service performance, and will establish linkages between service planning, multi -year budgeting and reporting. The Financial Planning Analysis Reporting S ystem Project The Financial Planning Analysis Reporting System (FPARS) project was established to: Strengthen the foundational elements of sound financial planning, budgeting and performance management; Establish principles and best practices that will support the City's transition towards a service -based and performance focused organization; and Implement Strategic Action #24: Improve Service and Financial Planning . The FPARS Project was approved to deliver: Service inventory for City Programs and Agen cies. Service planning as a formal process. Multi-year service -based planning and budgeting . Processes to organize financial, complement, payroll and performance data in service view. Performance inventory for City Programs and Agencies. Processes and tools to analyze and report on service performance and results. Organizational change management strategy and plan to support business transformation . Implications 5.4 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 5 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 The implementation of the key components and processes of the Integrated Planning and Performance Framework will result in a more unified approach that aligns the various planning efforts across the organization and links strategy to budget with approved p erformance measures. Current Status and Next Steps The current status and next steps of the key components of the Integrated Planning and Performance Framework are set out below: Strategic Planning In March 2014, Council reaffirmed its Strategic Plan and approved 26 new Strategic Actions to advance its vision, mission and goals for the City . The Strategic Actions guide the City's service planning, multi -year budgeting, and performance planning processes and complement current initiatives and Council priorities. Performance planners have also been restructured to align strategic themes and actions to work plans. City Council requested the City Manager to bring forward a process in 2015 to update Council's 2002 Strategic Plan including public and stakeholder consultation. Service Planning Building on current divisional, sectoral, business and service plans, the City will establish a common, multi -year, service -based planning approach to: Establish 5 -year Service Plans that link to the City's Strategic Plan and Actions to Service Based Budgeting. Set service objectives, measures and targets for both service and organizational drivers. Set priorities for Committee and Council to guide the budget process. Multi-Year Service Based Budgeting The City of Toronto has established a multi -year service -based budgeting process and tools for the operating budget. Business processes have been re-engineered to organize financial, complement and payroll data according to the services the City provides. The Public Budget Formulation (PBF) tool, which went live in May 2013, has been designed as a single point -of-entry for all budget information and is now used by City Programs and Agencies to prepare multi-year service -based operating budgets . Specifically: 5.4 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 6 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 Program Maps, Service Inventory and Service Profiles (including service levels) have been established for all City Programs and Agencies. Multi-year, service based budgets were developed and approvedby Council for 155 services beginning in 2014. Tracking of actual expenditures and staff complement based on services began in 2014. The next steps for City Divisions and Agencies is to monitor financial performance within the new service structure and take any necessary actions to manage their operations. Performance Measurement A database of 900 performance measures have been established to monitor and report service performance. The performance measures are being analyzed and refined to ensure that they are suitable for monitoring and reporting key aspects of service performance. Staff are currently developing the (technical) capacity and processes for reporting on service results.

While the 2005 Plan identified strategies that have helped to improve the City's long -term financial position , new issues and changing circumstances necessitate an update to the LTFP in 2015 ( Strategic Action #23). The City risks losing the gains that it has made in addressing its annual structural financial shortfall unless it is successful in advocating for more equitable funding support from the other orders of government for key areas such as social housing and transit. Background The current Plan was approved by Council in April 2005 and provides a framework for guiding the annual budget and financial planning o ver a longer time horizon, and forms a blueprint for long term fiscal health. The Plan identified the financial issues relating to expenditures, reve nues, and assets & liabilities and contained financial strategies to address these issues. The o verarching goal of the Plan is to achieve a fiscally sustainable city through: Securing p redictable a nd sustainable service funding ; Transferring all cost -shared programs to provincial progressive tax funding i.e. Long -Term Care Homes & Services, Employment & Social Services, Public Health, Children's Services, Affordable Housing & EMS Ensuring affordable property taxes and fees ; Maintaining capit al assets in good state of repair ; and Addressing and stabilizing liabilities . 5.5 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 The Plan has contributed to the City's sound financial base: Strong credit ratings from Moody's (AA+), DBRS (AA) and S&P (AA), between 1 -2 levels below the highest possible A AA rating - City's emphasis on long -term financial planning recognized as a key financial strength by DBRS ; and Strong balance sheet - Reserves and Reserve Funds $2.1B, Bond and Money Market Investment Funds $4.7B; Investments in Government Business Enterp rises $1.8B; cash $591M (as at Dec 31, 2013). Progress with Federal and Provincial Governments Federal: 100% (GST/HST) rebate starting in 2004 ($50 M/year) ; Share of Gas Tax (5 \u00a2/litre) ($155M/year) ; Various Economic Infrastructure Stimulus Programs ($460M over 2 years in 2010/2011) ; Funding for Toronto -York Spadina Subway Extension Project ($697M) ; and City pre -approved for $660M in funding for Scarborough Subway Extension Project under new Building Canada Fund . Province: Share of Federal/Provincial Gas Tax (2 \u00a2/litre) permanent (approximately $160M annually), a portion of which ($91.6M) goes to Operating Budget ; Phased upload of Social Assistance and Court Security costs by 2018 ($208 Million saved through 2014) ; Various one -off transit capital funding, e.g. one -time $238M in 200 9 to fund transit debt services costs; Funding for Toronto -York Spadina Subway Extension Project ($870M) ; and Funding for LRT (Eglinton Crosstown, Finch West, Sheppard East) & Scarborough Subway Extension P rojects ($8.7 billion) . 5.5 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 3 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 Progress with Expenditure Control Service Efficiency Savings & Base Budget Reductions (2007 -2010: 371M; 2011 -2014: $753M) ; Labour Settlements (2009 Settlement: Reduced sick pa y liability - $174M and 2012 Settlement: $1 38M over four years) ; and Contract Out Garbage Collection Savings (4 Yrs - Rate Supported Budget: $45M) . Progress with new sources of revenue and financing capital infrastructure programs New revenues: Municipal Land Transfer Tax implemented in 2008 (Reached $35 0M/yr level in 2013 , about 3% of the Operating Budget or just under 10% of tax revenues ; User Fee Policy updated in 2011, resulting in higher user fees ($100M/yr. including TTC Fare increases) ; and Third-Party Sign Tax implemented in 2012 after successful legal challenge (approximately $10 Million/yr) ; Capital Financing Strategies: Debt restructuring ; paid down $600M in debt using funds from proceeds of Toronto Hydro promissory note ; issued some 30 year debt for long -life assets ; Monetization of non -core assets such as Enwave District Energy ($168M) and C orus building ($38M) ; Non-Debt Financing Strategy and Surplus Management Policy - keep debt financing to a minimum by directing future operating surpluses, corporate dividends, anticipated revenue increases from changes in the Development Charge Bylaw & any future year funding for transit/transportation from other orders of government ; and Increasing Capital -from-Current funding by 10% per year (started in 2009 - equivalent to approximately 1% prope rty tax levy increase) . 5.5 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 4 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 Summary of the results of the recommendation s of the Plan Identified in the Long Term Fiscal Plan (2005) Current Status Score Well- Managed (Expenditures) City has higher costs than other municipalities Costs reduced green Demands for growth need to be adequately funded Updated the City's Development Charges Bylaw green Upload of social services and transit partnership Social Services & Court Security upload.

Insufficient funding to keep aging transit and transportation infrastructure in a state of good repair while growing infrastructure to meet future growth needs. While an upload of some provincial social services costs is procee ding, new provincial and federal downloading of social housing costs ($186M in base funding from 2014 -2022) , provincial capping of funding for some social services programs as well as new legislative requirements (i.e. mandatory renewal of long -term care h omes facilities) is causing significant new pressures. New sources of revenues that grow with the economy to fund future growth requirements are needed. No provincial funding to accompany new Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) require ments. While progress has been made, mitigation strategies to reduce long - term employee benefits liabilities will need to continue to develop over time. Implications If current trends continue: State -of-good-repair backlog in capital intensive Programs will continue to grow as more projects need to be deferred Road congestion will continue to worsen as growth projects are delayed due to lack of funding for Capital Plan Annual budget shortfall will grow again and City may eventually need to resort to unsu stainable stop -gap measures such as use of non - recurring revenues City may require significant service adjustments and/or large tax increases unless new sources of revenue are forthcoming (or lost funding from other orders of government is restored) Busine ss competitiveness and credit ratings may be negatively impacted, in turn affecting cost of borrowing . 5.5 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 6 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 Current Status and Next Steps An updated LTFP expected to be brought forward for Council consideration in Q2 2015. Contact Joe Farag Director , Corporate Finance 416-392-8108, jfarag@toronto.ca 5.6 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 1 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 State of Good Repair Backlog Issue This briefing note presents the State of Good Repair (SOGR) Backlog for City Programs and Agencies (Tax and Rate Supported) , and the impact of State of Good Repair Capital as a result of the targeted investment planned for the 2014 to 2023 Capital Budget and Plan. The 2014 Capital Budget and Plan includes $16 billion or 57% devoted to State of Good Repair projects . Additional funding will be required t o meet all SOGR needs. Background The City owns a significant amount of physical assets comprising : roads, expressways, b ridges, traffic signal controls; water and wastewater treatment facilities, distribution and collection pipes, reservoirs, pumping stations; subways, streetcars, buses; and civic centres, recreation facilities, public housing buildings, parkland and other lands. This infrastructure, excluding land, is currently estimated to be worth in excess of $72 billion. The City's capital program is driven largely by the costs of maintaining these physical assets in a state of good repair. City's Physical Infrastructure Estimated Physical Asset Value Transportation Water & Wastewater $10 Billion $28 Billion Public Transit $14 Billion Community Housing Infrastructure $9 Billion Facilities including Parks, Forestry & Recreation, Fleet $7 Billion Other Programs $4 Billion Total $72 Billion 5.6 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 Managing the City's accumulated SOGR backlog is a key capital strategic objective and priority for the City. With growing c apital demands accompanied by renewal needs of an aging infrastructure , the emphasis continues to be protection and preservation of existing infrastructure . However, fun ding all SOGR needs remain an important problem and challenge. The City's infrastructure is aging and bringing it to a state of good repair, while at the same time planning for and implementing needed service expansion , is a significant challenge. The City tries to strike a responsible balance between investing in new capital infrastructure while also preserving and modernizing existing infrastructure , portions of which were built decades ago and continues to serve the public on a daily basis. Through the City's annual infrastructure assessment process , the City tries to balance its SOGR and growth capital needs . These reviews assess the level of capital investment required to attain and maintain a state of good repair for each Program and Agency's assets. The SOGR backlog is then tracked, managed and addressed in the a nnual capital budgeting process. Furthermore, t he SOGR backlog information has become more meaningful since the approval of a firm 10 -year Capital Plan beginning in 2010. The more rec ent establishment of asset values arising from compliance with Public Sector Accounting Board (PSAB) guidelines has enabled the City to track SOGR backlog as a percent of asset value, as a key indicator. Details of the SOGR Backlog trend and percentage of total asset value can be found in the Capital Analyst Notes for each Program and Agency. All of these actions, taken together, reflect Council's strategic commitment to address the SOGR backlog and helps employ better metrics aiding Council to be better st ewards of City assets. It is estimated that over the 2014 to 2023 capital planning period, the City's accumulated SOGR backlog declines from $3.679 billion at the end of 2013 to $3.142 billion in 2018 after 5 years and $2.417 billion in 2023 after 10 years, as indicated in Chart 1: 5.6 TRANSITION TO 2014-2018 TERM PAGE 3 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 With the exception of Transportation Services and TTC, recommended SOGR capital funding will reduce the accumulated SOGR backlog for each of these Programs based on the 2014 - 2023 capital budget and plan. It should be noted that these estimates are being reviewed and will change as part of the 2015 - 2024 capital budget and plan. The main six programs that contribute to the SOGR Backlog are Toronto Water, Transportation Services, Parks, Forestry & Recreation, Facilities Management and Real Estate, Toronto & Region Conservation Authority and Toronto Transit Commission.

PF&R's 2014 projected year end SOGR backlog is expected to reach $295.6 million representing 12.2% of the replacement value of physical assets of $2.4 billion. Through the 2014 Budget pro cess, PF&R's debt target was increased by $165 million over 10 years for the sole purpose of reducing the SOGR backlog, allocated to four specific asset categories: Trails, Pathways and Bridges, Arenas, Community Centres and Pools which were trending toward high backlog balances. As a result, the accumulated backlog for PF&R is trending downward over the next 10 years and is expected to drop to $119.8 million by 2023. Toronto Water Toronto Water is the only Rate Program that has a SOGR backlog. Similarly to PF&R, the primary focus of Toronto Water 's Capital Plan is to reduce SOGR backlog s, by targeting state of good repair projects for linear infrastructure renewal . This ensures the replacement or rehabilitation of aging watermains and sewers and investment in the City's aging wastewater treatment facilities. If SOGR funding is maintained at planned levels over the 10 year period, SOGR funding trends ensure th at Toronto Water's infrastructure renewal backlog will decline from $1.641 billion in 2013 to $91.923 million by 2023, virtually eliminating the SOGR backlog on Toronto Water's linear assets. Transportation Services Transportation Services' 10 -Year Capital Plan dedicates $2.4 billion to fund SOGR projects that include maintenance and rehabilitation work on bridges ($396 million), expressways (F.G. Gardiner and Don Valley Parkway) ($565 million), major road rehabilitation ($678 million) and local road rehabilitation projects ($542 million) and sidewalk repairs ($133 mill ion). Transportation has made concerted efforts to chip away at their SOGR backlog. Despite efforts to reduce the SOGR backlog, it continues to increase, as Transportation Services' implement asset management best practices and improve their ability to con duct more detailed and accurate needs assessments. Their reported data reveals a more fine grained analysis of asset replacement needs and their costs. While an additional $620 million in SOGR funding was added to the Transportation Services' Capital Prog ram as part of the 2013 Budget process, for the Gardiner Expressway and Major Roads, it is anticipated that Transportation Services' SOGR backlog will continue to increase over the current 10 -year planning period based on newly completed field 5.6 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 5 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 assessments as a result of the upcoming wave of aging infrastructure. By 2023, the current SOGR backlog of $949 million will increase to $1.215 billion, but as a percentage of asset value, it remains constant at approximately 9.6%. Toronto Community Housing SOGR Back log Toronto Community housing is not funded through the City's Capital budget, but they too have a backlog of Capital repair work valued at $2.6 billion. More than 1,000 of the buildings (half of the portfolio) are more than 50 years old and will require s ignificant repairs over the next 10 years as a large number of buildings age out at the same time. The cost of maintaining the buildings in a state of good repair is $2.6 billion over the next decade. The City has secure d one third of the $2.6 billion (or $864 million the City's share ) that is needed over 10 years to pay for capital repairs. Both t he Province and Federal government are being asked to contribute one third each towards the investment . Unmet Need projects Unmet Need projects are a category of required capital projects but, due to funding constraints and prioritization are not included within the budget. During the 2014 - 2023 budget process Unmet Need projects totaled $4.254 billion, Tax supported programs accounted for $3.488 billion and th e balance $765.876 million for Water Services , the majority of which are SOGR related projects. Capital Investment While sustaining the City's infrastructure is a high priority there is increasing pressure sparked by growth to invest more and most specifically in transit . Major investments include a ccommodating Ridership Growth for the TTC : $3.437 billion for the new Scarborough Subway extension. $676.3 million for 195 low floor, accessible light rail vehicles to replace the existing streetcar fleet . $262 million for the purchase of TTC fleet, 90 new subway cars to increase capacity by 9% and 60 new subway cars for ridership growth. $237.2 million for new articulated buses and 165 new forty foot diesel buses to improve services and ridership growth. Funding of $665.268 million to deliver the for the ATC Resignalling project that will improve the Yonge -University -Spadina (YUS) and Bloor-Danforth (BD) Subway signaling system. 5.6 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 6 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 The total shortfall for unfunded capital needs within the TTC's capital Progra m is approximately $3 billion, of which $338 million reflects SOGR backlog needs and the remaining $2.6 billion is for other unfunded projects. Similarly, the 10 -Year Capital Program for Toronto Water excludes $766 million in unfunded capital needs, predom inately required for advancements on the Wet Weather Flow Master Plan and the Basement Flooding Protection program. Implications Maintaining and preserving the City's asset s is critical to ensuring they can support the delivery of City services and meet future needs of the public . Reductions in service and service quality are consequences should t he SOGR backlog continue to grow . However the targeted investments made in recent yea rs to address the SOGR backlog problem simply do not match the depth o f the infrastructure deficit overall, which has built up over decades of under investment. Current Status and Next Steps In setting the 2015 Capital Budget and Plan, the key objective is to ensure that available resources are utilized to mitigate the State of Good Repair backlog to minimize risks associated with delayed maintenance of the City's aging infrastructure.

These notes discuss the following five major revenue sources : 1. Property T ax the largest source of the City's revenues ($3.8 billion or 39% of the 2014 tax-supported operating budget ). 2. User Fees a) Tax-supported operations : $1.6 billion , of which t he largest item is TTC passenger fares at $1.1 billion . b) Rate-supported operations : there are 3 rate -supported programs Toronto Water, Solid Waste and Toronto Parking Authority, which are predominantly funded by user fees of about $1.4 billion . 3. Provincial and Federal Transfer Payments funding both Operating ($2.0 billion or 21%) & Capital Budgets ($0.5 billion or 24%) for tax - and rate -supported programs . 4. Municipal Land Transfer Tax (MLTT) approximately $350 million or 4% of the 2014 tax-supported Operating Budget . 5. Development Charges (DCs) these development levies fund eligible growth related capital costs, estimated at $92 million for the 2014 tax - supported programs (4%) and $30 million for the rate -supported programs (5%) . They are an important capital -funding tool for the provision of municipal services and infrastructure required to accommodate growth and intensification . The following charts depict the sources and the relative importance of the tax- and rate -supported operating and capital revenues covered in this briefing.

The municipal tax levy is based on the Current Value Assessment (CVA) of a property (as determined by the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation - MPAC), and the municipal tax rate set by City Council each year for each of the property classes to fund it s annual operating budget requirements. In accordance with City policy, the municipal business property tax rates are being reduced to 2.5 times the residential tax rate within a 15 -year period (by 2020) as part of the City's \"Enhancing Toronto's Business Climate\" initiative, an economic development and business competitiveness strategy. The provincial education tax is based on the CVA of a property and the education tax rate set by the Province of Ontario for residential a nd non - residential classes. Residential education tax rate is the same Province - wide, but business education tax rates vary by municipality across the Province. Provincial education taxes are collected by the municipality and remitted to the Province. An overview of property assessment and taxation, including information on: how the taxes are calculated, the Current Value Assessment system, City's tax rates for various property classes, the City's property tax rebate, cancellation and deferral programs ar e available at: http://goo.gl/CM6UOr Municipal taxes (Property taxes used by the municipality to fund municipal services and programs) Provincial education taxes (Property taxes used by the Province to fund education requirements on a province - wide basis) + = Total Taxes 5.7.1 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 Implications In 2014, the City levied approximately $3.8 billion for municipal purposes and a further $2.0 billion on behalf of the Province of Ontario for education purposes. The average assessed value of a residential property in Toronto in 2014 is approximately $500,000. The municipal and education taxes payable on this property, including the Special Scarborough Subway levy is summarised in the following table: Current Status and Next Steps Tax rates for all property classes are set annually, by bylaw . Tax rates for the municipal portion of taxes are determined by Council, following the adoption of the annual operating budget, so as to raise the amount needed to meet the City's approved budget for that year. Tax rates for the education portion of taxes are set by the Province each year by regulation. Additionally, Council must authorize an interim property tax levy and enact an interim levy bylaw in December of each year, to permit the City to raise the property tax revenues needed to fund its early to mid -year operations for the following year until such time as the Operating Budget and final tax levy are approved by Council. The interim levy is bas ed on 50% of the previous year's total property taxes payable. Interim property tax bills are mailed in January, with instal ment due dates of March 1st, April 1st and May 1st, unless property owners have enrolled in one of the City's pre -authorized proper ty tax payment plans. The interim levy bylaw for 2015 was adopted by City Council at its meeting of July 8 , 9 and 10, 2014, and the report EX43.25 is available at: http://goo.gl/J4HCAi 2014 Total Property Tax paid on a residential property assessed at $500,000 Tax Rate Tax $ City tax 0.5174652% $ 2,587.33 Education tax 0.2030000% $ 1,015.00 Transit tax $ 12.72 Total property tax 0.7230085% $ 3,615.04 5.7.1 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 3 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 Contacts Joe Farag Director, Corporate Finance Corporate Finance 416-392-8108, jfarag@toronto.ca Rob Hatton Director, Strategic initiati ves & Intergovernmental Finance Corporate Finance 416-392-9149, rhatton@toronto.ca 5.7.2 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 1 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 User Fees Background The City of Toronto Act , 2006 enables the City and its Local Boards to charge user fees to recover the cost of services. At its special meeting of September 26 and 27, 2011 Council approved a User Fee Policy, which provides the framework for managing the City's user fee program. This policy applies to all City Programs and Local Boards. The fundamental principle s of the User Fee Policy adopted by Council are: i. That they should be applied to those City services and products that provide a direct benefit to specific users , and; ii. That user fees should be set to recover the full cost of those products and/or services, to the extent that there is no conflict with City polic y objectives or other legislative requirements. City Council must authorize new fees and changes to existing user fees for services provided to the general public by all City Programs and Local Boards . The exception s to this rule are annual inflationary increases, TTC fares and certain market -based fees charged by Local Boards such as arena user charges . Annual in flationary adjustments are automatic and effective January 1 each year as determined by the Deputy City Manager and Chief Financial Officer. The inflationary adjustment for each fee is set based on market prices and/or changes to the cost of providing the related services . TTC fares are typically set annually by the Commission to fund operating expenditures net of City and provincial subsidies, with due regard for impact on customers and ridership. There are various fees that are market -based and not subject to inflationary increases. For example, several City agencies have a set public fee but are authorized to adjust them without City Council approval, as these fees may need to change throughout t he year to respond to market conditions. The chart below shows the total projected user fee revenue for 2014 of almost $3 billion, broken down by tax -supported City programs of $1 .6 billion; and rate-supported programs Toronto Water, Solid Waste and Parking Authority of $1.4 billion. 5.7.2 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 Implications Tax-Supported Programs In 2014, the City levie d approximately $1.6 billion from user fees, which accounts for 17% of the tax -supported operating budget. T he largest component is TTC passenger fares of $1.1 billion, which generates about 70% of TTC's operating funding . Rate-Supported Programs Toronto Water, Solid Waste and Toronto Parking Authority raise most of their revenues through user rates . The three rate -supported programs generate between 76% -97% of their revenues from user fees and rates. In total the rate -supported program s are projected to generate about $1.366 billion in 2014, comprising $980 million from water rates, $252 million fro m solid waste volume based fees, and $134 million from parking fees. Toronto Water consumption rate s were increased by 9% in 2014, and are projected to generate an additional $59 million. Increases of 8% for the following three years were adopted in principle, subject to budget approval. Solid Waste volume based rates were increase d by 3% in 2014 and are projected to generate additional revenue of $7.7 million . The projected 2014 incrementa l revenue for Toronto Parking Authority is $3.04 million, representing a 2.2% increase over 2013. TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 3 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 Current Status and Next Steps As part of the 2015 budget process, all user fees will be reviewed and amended as necessary . Those that are subject to inflation will be adjusted as of January 2015, and any new user fees will be presented to Council for approval. Each rate-supported program will present a separate report on their 2015 budget requirements and necessary rate increases , if any, fo r Council's consideration .

Examples include Provincial subsidies for cost-shared services (such as Ontario Works, court services, EMS, and Public Health), permanent Federal and Provincial Gas Tax Funds, and infrastructure funding available through the Canada Strategic Infrastructure Fund (CSIF), Building Canada Fund (BCF). Areas where the City is facing the most funding pressures which require new/additional Federal and Provincial assistance include transit operating and capital, and social housing. Province In 1998, the Province introduced Local Services Realignment wher eby certain program costs have been downloaded to the City in exchange for uploaded programs and increased property tax room. Downloaded programs included, drug benefit program costs, disability support payments, social housing, public health, and emergen cy medical services. As well, the Province cancelled its support for 50% of the transit -operating subsidy and 75% of eligible transit capital cost s grants . These changes significantly increased Toronto's fiscal responsibilities. Since 1998, progress has been made in several programs where subsidies have been increased or municipal funding responsibility reduced. Most notably, the annual Provincial gas tax sharing initiated in 2004 restores about $160 million of the transit funding losses. The P rovince also created Metrolinx in 2006, through which it has funded and continues to fund significant investments in major transit infrastructure in the GTHA, without requiring co -payments from municipalities. Also, in 2008, the Provincial Municipa l Fiscal and Service Delivery Review (PMFSDR) resulted in uploading of social assistance costs, drug and disability benefits and court security costs over phase -in periods ending 2018. In concert with PMSFDR implementation, the City had also received an annual Toronto Pooling Compensation payment from the Province as GTA equalization was phased -out and uploading phased -in. However, in June 5.7.3 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 2013, the Province reversed much of the PMSFDR gains by eliminating the Toronto Pooling Compensation support to the City of $149.4 M over three years, a loss of $35M for social services and $115M for social housing. The City has c ontinued to seek to engage the P rovince in restoring funding for social housing , including the pooling compensation payment, and transit operations and capital , programs with a disproportionally high cost in urban centres such as Toronto. Federal Canada is the only G7 country without a national transit strategy or a national affordable housing strategy. The gradual expiry of Federal/CMHC housing subsidy for social housing will result in a reduction of $17 0 million in federal transfers to the City by 2033. The government does provide annual Federal gas tax transfers of approx imately $152 million /year for municipal infrastructure, which the City applies exclusively to fund transit requirements. Implications Toronto's fiscal imbalance and annual budget challenges are partly the result of revenue and cost -sharing arrangements established in response to short- term deficit reduction actions by the Provincial and Federal governments. Despite the improvements made to-date, the City's revenue base remains inadequate to provide for the service and investment requirements of a major city. The City has identified 10 -year unfunded capital requirements of $5.2 billion in both Housing ($2.6 billion) and Transit ($2.7 bil lion), before consideration of growth -related requirements. Current Status and Next Steps Toronto Pooling Compensation (TPC) The City has asked the Province to rescind its decision to eliminate the TPC which has a negative impact of $149.4 million . The property tax impact of the expected $86 million grant reduction for 2015 is approximately a 3.6% increase . 5.7.3 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 3 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 Transit A Special Transit Task Force has been created (comprising TTC Chair, TTC CEO, TTC's CFAO, City Manager and DCM&CFO) to seek and secure Provincial transit funding as follows: o Request the Province to restore 50% transit operating funding from the Province o Request for 1/3 Provincial contribution and support for TTC's priority projects to be submitted under the Provincial Territorial Infrastructure Component (PTIC) of the New Building Canada Fund o Application for infrastructure funding allocations from P3 Canada Fund for transit capital (Scarborough Subway) o Request the Province to dedicate a share of the new $15 billion dedicated GTHA p ublic transit and transportation infrastructure fund (announced in 2014 Ontario Budget) toward local transportation The City continues to urge the Federal Government to implement a National Transit Strategy . Housing The City requests th at: o the Federal and Provincial governments to maintain existing social housing funding and match the City of Toronto's commitment to invest $864 million over ten years for Toronto Community housing (TCH) capital repairs requirements o the Provincial government p rovide equity on rent subsidies.

(Personal Vehicle Tax was also implemented effective Sep 1, 2008 under the Act but was terminated effective Jan 1, 2011) The City entered into a 15-year agreement wit h Teranet Inc. with r espect to the collection of MLTT for all electronically -registered transactions . Teranet is a private company that runs the Provincial electronic land registry system . Almost all revenue is collected through its on -line registration and payment system, with less than 0.5% done manually at designated provincial offices or the North York Civic Centre. Council adopted a tiered MLTT rate structure similar to that in use by the Province based on the value of consideration for the conveyance . For properties containing at least one, and not more than two, single family residences the rates are as follows : Residential Properties containing at least one, & not more than two, single family residences Value of Consideration MLTT Rate Up to and including $55,000.00 0.5% plus $55,000.01 to $400,000.00 1.0% plus Over $400,000.00 2.0% For all other properties the rates are : Value of Consideration MLTT Rate Up to and including $55,000.00 0.5% 5.7.4 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 In addition, under the City bylaw there are two types of rebates: A. Grand -Fathering The tax is fully rebated if the Agreement of Purchase and Sale was executed on or before December 31, 2007 and the closing date is on or after February 1, 2008. The transitional provision is now very rarely invoked. B. First-Time Purchaser A first -time purchaser of residential property is eligible for a rebate up to a maximum of $3,725, or the equivalent to the tax on a property with a consideration value of $400,000. Implications As an illustration, the MLTT payable by a purchaser (who is not a first -timer) on a residential property with a value of consideration of $500,000 is $5,725 (or effective tax rate of 1.145% ), calculated as follows : There has been considerable revenue growth since MLTT's 2008 inception as a result of sales volume and price growth, although the rate of growth has slowed down in the last two years. In 2014, the revenue is forecast to be $365.0 million as compared with the budget of $349.6 million.

Development charges, imposed under the Development Charges Act , are used help fund growth -related capital costs. DCs ensure that growth partially pays for itself so that new development (growth) does not place an undue financial burden on existing taxpaye rs. The City's current development charges bylaw (no. 1347 -2013) was adopted by Council on October 8, 2013 and came into effect on November 1, 2013. The by -law included significant increases in charges, particularly for residential development. The incre ases are being phased -in at 6-month intervals over a two-year period, with the final increase February 1, 2016. The bylaw replaced the previous bylaw (no. 275 -2009) and implements uniform citywide development charges on new residential and limited non- residential development and redevelopment. Industrial development and commercial development (above first floor) are exempted from DCs. The charges are calculated, payable and collected at the time a building permit is issued. Residential charges are differ entiated by type of unit and non-residential charges are based on the non -residential floor area located on the ground floor. Implications In 201 4, the City is forecast to collect $180 million in development charges revenues , including $140 million for tax-based programs and $ 40 million for rate-based programs. Development charges can only be used to fund growth -related capital costs and cannot be used to pay operating costs. Current Status and Next Steps Provincial Development Charges Act Review In October 2013, the Province announced a consultation on the Development Charges Act (DCA) reform and invited comments by January 10, 2014. This 5.7.5 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL .1 review is a welcome d initiative. The DCA is based on the principle that \"growth pays for growth\" , but its current form sets out limitations on achieving this funding principle. Council, at its meeting on October 8, 2013, requested specific amendments be made, including: a) Remove or amend the historical service level restrictions b) Eliminate the statutory 10% discount that applies to specified services (including transit) c) Eliminate ineligible municipal services (e.g. Solid waste, administrative facilities, tourism and cultural facilities) d) Extend the Toronto -York Spadina Subway Extension DCA amendments to the Sc arborough Subway Extension (e.g. eliminate 10% discount) The first three of these were also endorsed by the Mayors and Regional Chairs of Ontario (MARCO) in their submission to the province (January 9, 2014). Provincial support for some of these changes is considered likely, particularly for the Scarborough Subway. In addition, an amended DCA could help address long standing inequities relating to municipal contributions to GO Transit expansion, by facilitating, as an alternative, a new GTHA -wide Metro linx development charge. Such a charge would be consistent with Council's decision at its May 7, 2013 meeting, when it adopted \"Metrolinx Dedicated Revenues Options\" (EX31.3), and the principle that \"New taxes and user fees imposed in the GTHA should be assessed at the same rates across the GTHA .\" Scarborough Subway and Port Lands At its meetings on July 16, 2013 and October 8, 2013, during consideration of the Scarborough Rapid Transit Options (CC37.17 and EX39.5), Council directed staff to prepare a development charges by-law to recover the City's share of capital costs related to the Scarborough Subway Extension. It is expected that a proposed bylaw would be available in 2015 for consideration at a statutory public meeting and by Council. At its meeting on July 8, 2014, during consideration of the \"Port Lands Acceleration Initiative Phase 2 - Progress Report ,\" Council directed staff to report on introducing a new area -specific development charges by law to recover certain flood protection infrast ructure costs in the Port Lands .

The size of the City of Toronto's capital expenditures necessitates the use of debt to assist in the financing of the projects contained in the capital budget. Appendix 1 shows the City's 2014 debt charge forecast and the financing requirements (including the Scarborough Subway) . Debt can provide the City with more affordable financing by matching the repayment term to the economic useful life of the project instead of funding the entire cost from current revenues . Otherwise, current taxpayers would be paying for the entire cost of a project that will be oper ating for many years and provid ing a benefit for future residents. Background The City is governed by the City of Toronto Act 2006 which has specific debt regulations that apply to the City. The City, as well as other Ontario municipalities, may issue long -term debt only for capi tal purposes to a maximum term -to-maturity of 40 years . The City has only issued debt with maturities up to 30 years . By law, the City cannot borrow for current operations except through the issuance of promissory notes which must be repaid when the current year's tax levy is received. At the beginning of a term of Council, a bylaw is adopted that provides the Mayor and the Deputy City Manager and Chief Financial Officer with t he delegated authority to negotiate a debenture issue up to a n annual dollar limit as approved by Council. The limit approved by the previous Council was up to $900 million per year. The size of a debenture issue is primarily determined by the financing requirements contained in the Capital Budget. Previously, the City has found that debt issues in the $200 to $300 million have been very attractive 5.8 TRANSITION TO 2014 -2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 to investors while providing funds in the size needed to fulfill the City's requirements for efficient debt financing. However, before the debt can be issued, the Debenture Committee must authorize the details of the issue and adopt a debenture bylaw. The Debenture Committee, consisting of the Mayor, Deputy Mayor, Budget Chair, the City Manager and the Deputy City Manager and Chief Financial Officer, was provided with delegated authority by Council to a pprove debt issuance since the financial markets require the City to be able to act quick ly when issuing debt whic h often cannot be accommodated by the Council meeting schedule. Under the City of Toronto Act , debt can only be issued for capital projects that are approved by Council in an amount that is within the City's capital financing policies and limits as approved by Council. Council policy states that tax -supported debt charges, consisting of principal and interest and funded from the operating budget, cannot exceed 15% of the City's property tax levy. Currently, debt repayments ( principal and intere st) are 11% of the tax levy and will peak at 13.6% in 2020 . Municipalities differ from other orders of government since the principal borrowed must be amortized over the term of the debenture. The Federal and Provincial governments are allowed to refin ance their debt when it matures instead of repaying the principal from their own resources. In other words, the City must pay both principal and interest while the other orders of government can pay only the interest on their debt. Division s, Agencies and Corporations The Corporate Finance Division issu es debt for all of the City's divisions as well as most of its agencies . Corporate finance does not issue debt for the City's corporations (ie. Toronto Hydro and the TCHC) who have separate borrowing pow ers contained in their enabling legislation. Implications The following chart shows the City's gross debt along with offsetting amounts in its own debt repayment (\"sinking\") funds and the resulting net debt owed to bond holders. 5.8 TRANSITION TO 2014 -2018 TERM PAGE 3 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 Gross Debt as of December 31, 2013 $5.7 Billion Less: Sinking Fund Investments (1.9) Net Debt as of December 31, 2013 $3.8 Billion Net debt is defined as the City's gross debt less the amount in the Sinking Fund that has been accumulated for the future repayment of debt when it matures. The $3.8 Billion excludes the Toronto Community Housing Company (TCHC) mortgages which amount to an additional $641 million. The City contributes annually to the Sinking Fund so that these amounts, plus investmen t income, will be sufficient to repay the investors who hold City debt when it matures. For example, instead of the City having to provide $100 million when the debt matures in 10 years, it makes annual payments of $8.4 million for 10 years and earns interest income to retire the original $100 million debt. Current Status and Next Steps Credit Ratings Currently, the City of Toronto's credit ratings are: AA with a stable outlook from the Dominion Bond Rating Service (2 levels below AAA) AA with a positive outlook from Standard and Poor's Canada (2 levels below AAA) Aa1 with a stable outlook from Moody's Investor Service (1 level below Aaa) The credit rating agencies generally consid er the following strengths as credit positive for the City : City's debt is low in comparison with other Canadian and international municipalities Progress in eliminating the use of one -time revenues to balance the operating budget High levels of liquidity to provide flexibility in the event of having the ability to survive and operate within volatile financial markets A very strong and diversified local economy 5.8 TRANSITION TO 2014 -2018 TERM PAGE 4 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 The City's credit ratings are reviewed annually by the respective credit rating agencies and more frequently if warranted by external economic and/or political events. Divisions /Agencies Involved The Corporate Finance Division issu es debt for all of the City's divisions as well as most of its agencies . The Division does not issue debt for the City's corporations (ie. Toronto Hydro and the TCHC) who have separate borrowing powers contained in their enabling legislation.

TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 1 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 Investment Management Issue The Corporate Finance Division invests the City's reserves and reserve funds, working capital, sinking , trust funds and certain legacy pension funds . Portfolio Average Balance ($millions) as of June 30, 2014 1. City of Toronto General Group of Funds (include cash assets of working capital, Reserves and Reserve Funds) $4,791 2. Sinking Funds (for the use of retiring City's sinking fund debt as it becomes due) $1,649 3. Trust Funds (City does not own these assets) $7 4. Long-Term Home Care & Services (City does not own these assets) $4 5. Pension Funds and Police Benefit Funds (City does not own these assets; for cash management purposes only) $18 Total $6,469 Background The Corporate Finance Division is responsible for the internal management of the City investment portfolios which total about $6.5 billion . Fund management must incorporate both the legislative constraints and the risk profile of each portfolio. The City of Toronto's Investment Policy and Procedures approved by Council are the governing guidelines for the portfolios under management. 5.9 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 The primary objectives, in priority order, for all City investment activities are: i. Ensure safety of principal ii. Maintain adequate liquidity, i.e. funds are available when needed iii. Maximize return rate while conforming to the objectives above and legislative constraints The investment returns from the City's General Group of Funds have had a long track record in meeting City's liquidity needs and generating revenue to meet the City's operating budget requirement as well as contributing to the City's reserve funds. The following graph depicts the 5 -year comparison between the long-term market rate of investment returns generated from the City's General Group of Funds and the industry benchmark . The City's Central Group of Funds has outperformed the benchmark index in each of the past six years. Implications Sustainable investment management must include sound investment polic ies and procedures, a well-diversified portfolio asset mix with good credit quality, strategic plans for different time horizons , and diligent cash flow management as well as robust risk management . Investment portfolios under sustainable investment management allow the City to meet short - term and long -term debt repayments, as well as operating and capital funding req uirements .

Current Status and Next Steps Based on the 2013 annual external audit result s, the portfolios under the City's management were in compliance with the Investment Policy and Procedures. The Investment Policy and Procedures are reviewed annually by investment staff and the Independent Investment Advisory Committee . The Advisory Committee provides advice on investment matters relating to the management of the city's money market and fixed -income investment portfolios. Recommendations for changes are then submitted to Council for its consideration . In addition, an investment report that provides a review of the City of Toronto's investment returns for portfolios invested in respect of the City's reserve funds and operating budget is submitted to Council on an annual basis.

Some reserves are currently insufficient to protect the City from the event for which the funds are being set aside. For example, t hese include reserves for employee benefits , extreme weather, tax stabilization and capital infrastructure. Other reserves risk depletion in the short run because programs are proposing large draws from them in the absence of traditional funding from other orders of government or a sustainable revenue stream. For example, t hese include reserves for social assistance stabilization, social housing stabilizati on and child care expansion. Background The funding and use of reserves and reserve funds are an essential component of sound finan cial planning and management. Reserves and reserve funds are established by municipalities for a variety of reasons including statutory regulations to keep certain funds separate ; as a source of \"rainy day\" funding for unexpected or unusual events ; to smooth cash flows related to major purchases ; or to accumula te funds for future capital requirements or liabilities. Reserves and reserve funds should be funded to the level appropriate for the purpose for which they were established, or for the level of risk being mitigated. While the reserve account balances app ear quite large, it should be noted that the majority of these funds are committed for specific purposes. The City's reserve s and reserve funds stood at $3.4B as of December 31, 2013 made up of $1.4B in Obligatory Funds earmarked for special purposes by way of legislation or contracts that are not fully available to use at Council's discretion and $2.0B in Council -directed funds to protect the City against certain financial risks or known future expenditures or liabilities (see Appendix A) . The majority o f the funds have been set aside for current capital purposes. 5.10 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 Implications On a comparative basis, the City's overall reserve fund balance on a per capita basis is much lower than those in other Ontario jurisdictions. Toronto's 2012 reserve per capita of $1,083 was considerably less than the rest of the GTA ($2,408), and 67% of the provincial average ($1,615). The low per capita figure can be explained by a combination of a high population in comparison to other municipalities, as well as the re lative age differences in their respective infrastructure. Many of the municipalities with high reserve per capita levels have newer infrastructure relative to the City of Toronto. Since most of their infrastructure is not due for replacement for many year s to come, this allows these municipalities to build up reserves for eventual replacement of these assets further into the future. Adequacy of Accounts Employee Benefits Reserve Fund \u2014 Although there is $212M in the reserve, the actuarial liability for the City as at Dec 31, 2013 is estimated at $2.4B, resulting in an unfunded liability of close to $2.1B. A plan is in place to stabilize the liability and improve emp loyee benefits reserve levels . This plan includes: o Agencies/Boards making sick pay co ntributions to match budgeted withdrawals. o Reducing benefit costs where feasible such as changes already implemented with respect to medical benefits to retirees and the sick pay grant . o Including the full cost of employee benefits in the annual benefit rate calculations, including post -employment benefit City London City Toronto City Ottawa City Waterloo R.M.

Stabilization Reserve Accounts ($183M) o Social Assistance Stabilization - Balance of $22M is at risk of being depleted as funds are transferred out to offset cost pressures associated with the increase in the welfare caseload. o Social Housing Stabilization - Balance of $37M is expected to be depleted as funds are transferred out to offset operating pressures due to the withdrawal of federal funding. o Extreme Weather - Balance of $30M includes funding for snow removal, flooding and other consequences of extreme weather events - this amount would have been inadequate to cover the City's 2014 weather losses if the Province had not agreed to provide funding for the 2013 i ce storm. o Tax Rate Stabilization - Balance of $40M is less than a 2% increase in the property tax levy ($50 Million) which is a reasonable target. Capital / State of Good Repair \u2014 The City has total physical assets estimated at a current replacement level of more than $72B. Funding for the repair or replacement of these assets is provided from debt, capital from current revenues (ie. taxes), and reserves including Council directed state of good repair reserves funds, obligato ry state of good repair reserve funds, the Capital Financing Reserve Fund, Vehicle & Equipment Reserves and the Water/Wastewater Capital Reserve Funds. Most of the funds held by the City in reserve accounts support the capital program - $2B of $3.4B aggre gate balance. Child Care Expansion - Balance of $49M is inadequate and likely to be depleted by 2016 given the operating pressures within the child care system, the need for additional child care subsidies, and the fact that the Province has capped its co ntribution at 2006 levels. Historical Trend The following chart shows the historical trend of reserve balances since 2001. The largest increase lies with Obligatory Funds which have specific purposes and are fully committed to projects in the Capital Plan. Likewise, Council -directed Reserves and Res erve Funds are largely fully committed to 5.10 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 4 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL. 1 known projects or liabilities. For example, the Vehicles and Equipment Replacement Reserves are made up of funds being set aside by the Programs to replace these assets at the end of their expected useful life. The Capital Financing Reserve is an important source of funding for the City's priority capital projects that cannot be debt -financed and have no other source of funding. These funds have been earmarked for specific projects over the next five years. It is ex pected that the balances in Reserves and Reserve Funds will drop over the next five years as funds held for major capital initiatives like transit and water/wastewater infrastructure are used up, unless new sources of funds are provided by other orders of government. Current Status and Next Steps Due to the Surplus Management Policy adopted by Council (2004) , annual surpluses are now being used to augment capital funding and fund inadequate reserves rather than provide one -time only funding to the Operating Budget. However, this source of funding is not guaranteed, nor is it sustainable. Current funding const raints are still impacting reserve/reserve fund adequacy in some areas and there are essentially no uncommitted funds available to support any general emergency.

The Reserve and Reserve Fund requirements associated with the 2015 Operating Budget and 2015 -2024 Capital Budget and Plan will be addressed as the budget process progr esses. It will be increasingly difficult to replenish reserves/reserve funds and provide funding for necessary investments while maintaining tax rate increases at or below inflation.

Background Procurement The City's Purchasing By -law (Chapter 195 of the Toronto Municipal Code), in combination with the Financial Control By -law (Chapter 71 of the Toronto Municipal Code), provides the overall framework for fair, open and effective procurement processes that meet divisional operational needs cost - effectively and effi ciently, while ensuring effective financial controls and accountability. There are also a number of policies in place which provide further detail regarding the City's procurement processes. The City's Purchasing By -Law, policies, procedures and processe s (including the delegated authorities) are in place to: support effective, objective, fair, open, transparent, accountable and efficient procurement processes through the solicitation of multiple bids, proposals and direct negotiation; and, protect the i nterests of the City, the public and persons participating in the procurement process. To reinforce the fairness, openness, transparency and integrity of procurement processes, consistent and standard approaches have been established for: selecting the appropriate type of procurement process to be used; communicating with vendors throughout the process; identifying and dealing with common irregularities in bids; evaluating bids/ award contracts in accordance with City Policies & Procedures; dealing with vendor complaints; providing unsuccessful vendors with feedback; and maintaining records on vendor performance under contracts. 5.11 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 Finance The City's Financial Control Bylaw (Chapter 71 of the Toronto Municipal Code), establishes the framework for the fina ncial controls of the City, including spending authorities, funds control and procedures for the payment of accounts. The City of Toronto Act does not provide delegated authority to adopt or amend the budget of the City. However, the Financial Control By -law (Chapter 71 of the Toronto Municipal Code) provides authorities for reallocations and transfers of funding within a Program's operating services and capital project budgets, the write off of outstanding debt and other related matters under certain cond itions. The operating and capital budgets approved by Council establish the spending authority for each City Program and City Agency . Real Estate At its meeting on May 11 & 12, 2010, Council approved the delegation of authority to approve c ertain real estate transactions to senior staff. In order to increase efficiency, the proposed delegation is spread across four existing staff positions based on stepped financial ceilings. Council has delegated authority to senior staff to approve certain real esta te matters where funding has been made available in an approved budget and subject to certain conditions being met. Implications It is in the City's best interest for all respective parties to follow the delegated authorities indicated in the Purchasing and Financial Control By - laws in order to ensure that proper authorities are being executed. Failure to follow the delegated authorities , as set out in the By -laws, may result in financial losses and damage to the City's reputation. The result of the delegation of authority for real estate matters is that Committee and Council agendas are freed up of frequently routine real estate reports and staff can facilitate situations involving critical deadlines by reacting more quickly in the real estat e marketplace , improving how the City conducts its real estate transactions. Further , once a transaction is approved, staff are in a position to process and execute the necessary documentation far more expedit iously. The delegation also co ordinate s, consolidate s and harmonize s various delegations that were previously approved by Council. 5.11 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 3 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 Current Status and Next Steps The last major update to Chapter 195, Purchasing By -law, was approved by Council on October 27, 2009. The last update to Chapter 71, Financial Control By -law, was approved by Council on June 10, 2014. This update was specific to revisions related to the list of common expenses (such as utilities, TTC tokens, payment for conferences and other general expenses) that can be pa id without a purchase order or sole source approval. In 2015, Chapters 71 (Financial Control) and 195 (Purchasing) of the Toronto Municipal Code will each undergo an overall review, and should any changes be recommended, a report recommending those changes will be brought forward to Council for approval. The Director of Real Estate Services report s annually, through the Government Management Committee, on all real estate matters that have been processed by way of th e real estate delegated authority. Additional Information Appendix A provides a list of specific delegated authorities with respect to procurement, finance and real estate.

Non-Competitive Procurement (Sole Source) Authority Division Heads City Manager Can enter into a contract up to $50,000 for goods or services in accordance with the Divisional Purchase Order Procedure and the Sole Source Procedure. This process allows Divisions to obtain goods and services without having to come to the Chief Purchasing Official. 5.11 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 7 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 Non-Competitive Procurement (Sole Source) Authority Chief Purchasing Official Division Heads City Manager Can enter into a non -competitive contract up to $500,000 with a contract term of 5 years or less in accordance with Chapter 195, Purchasing By -law and the non -competitive procureme nt procedure. Reasons for the use of non -competitive procurements include: Monopoly; Existence of proprietary rights (patents, trademarks, copyright); Need to avoid violating warranties; Where the competitive process has failed; The goods or services can only be supplied by a vendor with specialized knowledge which cannot be provided by another vendor; Where it is not in the interest of the City to conduct a public competition, such as in the case of confidentiality matters; and Emergencies. In cases where the City Manager, Division Head or Delegate determines that an emergency exists (threat to public health, the maintenance of essential city services, the welfare of persons or of public property or the security of the City's int erests and immediate delivery of goods and services are required), the Chief Purchasing Official may enter into a non-competitive contract greater than $500,000 without the issuance of a competitive call, however the commitment must be reported to Council through the Government Management Committee no later than the second regular meeting of Council after entering into the commitment.

Operating Budget: Reallocations; transfer between programs and services Authority Chief Financial Officer and City Manager Can approve the transfer of approved budgets of not more than $500,000 in respect of each reallocation between services within a program which do not affect the net operating budget for the program. Any reallocation shall be reported to Council not later than the second regular Council meeting following the reallocation. Chief Financial Officer, City Manager and City Council Can approve th e transfer of approved budgets of more than $500,000 between programs or services or between programs and services affecting the net operating budget for a program. Audit Committee, Chief Financial Officer and City Council Transfer of approved budgets between services within the office of the Auditor General affecting the net operating budget of the office of the Auditor General requires the approval of the Audit Committee, the Chief Financial Officer and Council.

The Debenture Committee shall consist of four members composed of: The Mayor; the Budget Chair, the Ci ty Manager and the Deputy City Manager and Chief Financial Officer. Real Estate Some of the basic concepts with respect to delegated authority for real estate include: All financial commitments are subject to all amounts being available in an approved budget. The basic threshold premise is that City Council retains decision - making control over real estate transactions exceeding $10 million dollars. Staff have delegated decision -making authority for acquisitions, expropriations, limiting distance agre ements, disposals (including leases of 21 years or more), leases/licenses, easements, within a series of \"stepped\" financial ceilings as follows: Acquisitions, Expropriations, Limited Distance Agreements, Disposals (including leases of 21 years or more), Leases/Licenses, Easements Authority Director of Real Estate Services $1 million Chief Corporate Officer $3 million Deputy City Manager and Chief Financial Officer $5 million City Manager $10 million Any proposed exercise of delegation must meet the requirements of the set of General Conditions approved by City Council May 11 & 12, 2010: http://goo.gl/fNVvSh 5.11 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 14 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 Any transactions falling outside of the parameters of the General Conditions will continue to be reported through the appropriate Standing Committee to Council. In addition to the series of delegated \"approving\" authorities, a series of delegated \"signing\" authorities provides that the positions having approving authority also have authority to execute documents on behalf of the City required to implement the approval. Also, the Manager of Acquisitions and Expropriations has delegated signing authority to sign Expropriation Applications and Notices for Council - approved expropriations. If, in any partic ular circumstance, a matter otherwise having been delegated to staff for approval is of such special interest that same should receive the consideration of Committee and ultimately be decided by Council, a determination may be made by the Chief Corporate O fficer, in consultation with the applicable Deputy City Manager or the City Manager, to return such item to the Committee/Council process for consideration and decision -making by Council. The delegation does not affect sales, acquisitions and leases over which the Affordable Housing Committee has responsibility. 5.12 TRANSITION TO 2014 -2018 TERM PAGE 1 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 Benefits Plans for Toronto Public Service, Elected Officials & Accountability Officers Issue Toronto Public Service Benefit Plans are part of the total compensation package provided by the City of Toronto used to attract and retain staff. It is important that these plans are reviewed periodically to remain competitive while still being fiscally responsible and incorpor ating industry standards . Background Benefit plans are provided to employees and retirees based on collective agreements and City policies. The City of Toronto provides benefit plans to approximately 35,000 employees and 8,000 retirees. The benefit plans have been designed to incorporate the following principles: Comprehensive and competitive plan designs ; Ensure s fairness and equity amongst all employee groups ; Incorporate s industry standards and best practices ; and Control s exposures to li abilities Changes to benefit plans for unionized staff, including any enhancements or cost containment measures, must be negotiated with the respective union / association. Changes to benefit plans for non -union staff, elected officials and the City's ac countability officer s are approved by City Council, through the Employee and Labour Relations Committee . The City of Toronto's extended health care, dental and long -term disability plans are provided through an Administrative Services Only (ASO) arrangeme nt with a benefit carrier and the life insurance plans are provided through an insurance contract. The City of Toronto provides the following benefit plans: Sick Leave Plan (through a sick pay plan, short -term disability plan or illness or injury plan); Life Insurance ; Accidental Death & Dismemberment ; Line of Duty Death (FIRE) ; Long Term Disability ; Extended Health Care ; and Dental . 5.12 TRANSITION TO 2014 -2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 The a ttached Appendix outlines the level of coverage provided to each employee group . Implications Increasing employee benefit costs is a concern for the City of Toronto. Industry standards in Canada reflects that on average , health care costs increase at a rate of 12% (2013) annually and dental costs increase at a rate of 8% (2013) annually . In 2013, the City of Toronto fell well below this range , with its health costs for active employees decreasing by 5.9% and its dental costs for active employees decreasing by 2.4% . Comparison to the Industry Average Table 1 below illustrates that in comparison to the industry trend in 2013 for both health and dental costs, the City is doing extremely well in terms of containing its benefit plan costs. Table 1 2012 - 2013 Health & Dental Benefit Costs (Active Employees) Comparison City of Toronto vs. Industry Average** 2012 vs. 2013 Percentage (Decrease) / Increase in Costs City of Toronto vs. Industry Average City of Toronto Industry Average Health Benefit (5.9%) 11.8% (17.7%) Dental Benefit (2.4%) 8.3% (10.6%) **2012 vs. 2013 Industry average percentage increase in costs: Canadian Health Care Trend Survey Results 2013/Buck Consultants City Benefit Costs The employee benefit costs have been driven by an aging demographic, increased utilization of the plan, incre ased cost of drugs and services and de-regulation of government sponsored benefits which are transferred to private benefit plans. These cost drivers have been offset by the City's recent efforts to implement cost containment initiatives that have resulted in decreasing costs over the last two (2) years. 5.12 TRANSITION TO 2014 -2018 TERM PAGE 3 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 Including the costs for retirees, the City achieved an overall decrease in its total benefit costs (including Health, Dental, Long Term Disability (LTD), Life Insurance) of $4.0 million (or -1.9%). Table 2, below, compares the City's benefit costs from 2011 to 2013. Overall, the City has reduced its benefit costs for active employees by $7.4 million (or -4.1%) since 2011 Table 2 Benefits Costs for Active Employees and Retirees (after administration fees & taxes) By Benefit Type: 2011 to 2013 2011 2013 Change 2011 -2013 Percentage Change ($ millions) Life Insurance (GLI), Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D), Line of Duty of Death (LODD) Staff have implemented many measures to control costs which include the following: Caps on all private duty nursing coverage ; Generic Drug Pla n; Elimination of Post -65 Benefit Coverage (grand -parenting provisions in place) ; Elimination of Sick Pay Plan for Management/Non -Union employees (replaced with a short -term disability plan) ; Elimination of Sick Pay Plan for CUPE Local 79 and TCEU Local 41 6 employees hired after July 30, 2009 and one -time option for 5.12 TRANSITION TO 2014 -2018 TERM PAGE 4 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 employees to switch to this plan which resulted in a 40% take -up of the plan ; Switch from 6 -month to 9 -month dental recall for all unionized , management/non -union employees and Elected Officials ; Benefit containments: dispensing fee cap of $9.00; changes to paramedical benefits; one year lag on the Ontario Dental Fee Guide; $2,000 cap for physiotherapy expenses ; Reduced administrative fees to a new benefits contract with the insurance carrier ; and Elimination of the grand -parented post -65 lifetime retiree benefit plans for the former City of North York and former City of Toronto fire fighters a nd the introduction of a new 10 -year health care spending account. The net cost savings from all these measures is $58.1 million (including savings to be achieved for 2014 to 2016) and $343.1 million in liability reductions. Staff will continue to monitor the trends and issues and recommend proposals to manage benefit costs as appropriate . Changes in ben efit plans must be negotiated through the collective bargaining process. These efforts must continue in order to ensure the long -term sustainability of the benefit plans. Current Status and Next Steps In 2013, the City of Toronto spent approximately $ 203 million providing this coverage to its employees, retirees and eligible dependants. In addition, the Public Sector Accounting Board (PSAB) handbook requires that a municipality report liabilities that relate to its post -employment benefits which inclu des: post-retirement benefits, sick leave benefits, income benefits , continuation of benefits to disabled employees and WSIB benefits. The liability associated with these benefits, as at December 31, 2013 is $1.7 billion (excluding the City's agencies and corporations ). The total benefit liabilities including the Toronto Police Service and other agencies (i.e., Exhibition Place, Toronto Zoo, Toronto Public Library, Sony Centre, Yonge & Dundas Square, Association of Community Centres and Arena Boards of Management) is $2.4 billion. Staff are currently working with the City's benefits carrier and the City's Legal Division to develop a framework for a Preferred Provider Network (PPN) to retain pharmacists who are interested in agreeing to a set of terms and conditions when dispensing drugs for City employees. A PPN is a 5.12 TRANSITION TO 2014 -2018 TERM PAGE 5 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 network of pharmacies for which employees/retirees could voluntarily go to for the dispensing of drugs and where the pharmacies agree to conditions that would assist the City in containing it s drug costs. Since this PPN would be voluntary, there would be no negative impact to employees in utilizing the PPN. It is anticipated the PPN will be implemented towards the end of 2014 or early 2015. In addition, City staff will continue to monitor the City's drug costs and utilization trends, and work with the City's benefit carrier and industry experts to monitor trends to help identify further areas of improvement and emerging best practices to be considered for the City's benefit plans. Staff will report back through the Employee & Labour Relations Committee by Q3 2015 with the results of this review. Staff will continue to implement measures to contain the growth in benefit plan costs through employee education initiatives and negotiations with each of the unions/associations.

In response to significant job losses in the City between 1990 and 2004, Counci l approved a public consultation process with regard to City and Provincial property tax policies in June 2004 . The consultations resulted in the Enhancing Toronto's Business Climate Strategy, a comprehensive action plan , consisting of initiatives intended to enhance the City's com petitiveness over the long term. This has resulted in a positive effect with businesses returning to Toronto and new investment attraction. Background Key elements of the City's initiatives have include d: A phased plan for the reduction in business tax ratios from the then existing ratio of 3.8 to 4.3 times the residential rate, to 3.0 times by 2015 and 2.5 by 2020 ; An accelerated reduction in small business tax ratios to 2.5 times by 2015; Limiting business tax increases ; Eliminating property tax inequities caused by the capping/clawback system by accelerating properties to their fair full -CVA ( Current Value Assessment) level of taxation ; From the Province, a reduction in Toronto's business education tax rates phased in by 2014 ; A financial incentives program to attract key employment sectors (Tax Increment Equivalent Grants - \"TIEGs\") ; A 30% discount on the water rate to assist industrial competitiveness ; Development Charges (DC) exemption for industries and minimal DC charge only on ground floor of commercial buildings , which are the lowest DCs in the GTA ; Gold Star Service through the City's Buildings and Planning Divisions to streamline the development approvals process ; and Enterprise Toronto to support small business start -up and development . 5.13 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 Implications Although there are many factors influencing business competitiveness, reducing business taxes and providing development incentives has made a positive influence. Since 2005, the following positive impacts to Toronto's economy have occurred: Jobs The total net number of jobs in the City of Toronto has increased by approximately 101,000, which includes approximately 20,000 jobs lost due to the 2008 recession. This is in compariso n to the 100,000 jobs lost between 1989 and 2004. Construction Over 1 million sq. ft of downtown office space has recently been completed, including Bay -Adelaide Centre West, MaRS Centre Phase II, and Coca Cola - 333 King Street E; Five new internationa l hotels , representing close to $2 billion in investment , have been completed or are close to completion, including Trump International Hotel, Bay St., Four Seasons Hotel, Bay St., Shang ri-La Hotel, University Ave., Ritz Carlton Hotel, Wellington St., and Delta Hotel, Bremner Blvd; 5.1 million sq. ft of downtown office space is under construction, including Bremner Tower, RBC Waterpark III, Bay -Adelaide Centre East, Sun Life Tower, The Globe and Mail Centre, and the Ernst and Young Tower; and Industrial dev elopment with an estimated investment of $500 million is underway, as well as commercial development with an estimated investment of $1.2 billion. Strategic Employment The Tax Increment Equivalent Grant (TIEG) initiative incents development in key strategic industry sectors . This includes: Biomedical, Computer Systems Design and Services, Creative Industries, Food and Beverage Wholesaling, Financial and Business Services, Information Services and Data Processing, Manufacturing, Office, Scientific Re search and Development, and Software Development ; A Brownfield Remediation Tax Assistance Grant (BRTA) that provides for a cancellation of property taxes for a period of up to 3 -years after development of contaminated lands; this grant may be in addition to the TIEG ; 5.13 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 3 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 A number of new developments have been attracted to Toronto as a result of the Tax Increment Equivalent Grant program. There are currently 24 Projects with signed TIEG Agreements with a total estimated investment of $1.7 billion ; and A numbe r of developments are completed and are receiving TIEGs, notably including: o Pinewood Studios (formerly Filmport) - a $27 million major sound and film studio to establish Toronto as 'Hollywood North' ; o Corus - a $180 million media complex on the Waterfron t; o 18 York street - a $340 million office development ; and o Apollo Health and Beauty - $77 million for manufacturing, research and development of health and beauty products and head office . Current Status and Next Steps Reduction in Municipal Business Taxes and Tax Ratios As a result of the Enhancing Toronto's Business Climate property tax initiatives, Toronto's businesses are paying $432 million less in taxes than they would have otherwise paid since 2006. The following two charts show the municipal tax reductions and/or savings between 2006 -2010 and 2011 - 2014, respectively: Chart 1 : 2006 -2010 Year 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Council's Enhancing Toronto's Business Climate Policy for one -third of increase to non-residential Council Policy Accelerated Small Business Tax Reduction Policy Residential Tax Increase 3.00% 3.80% $36.7 27.7 $242.7 5.13 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 4 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 Chart 2: 2011 -2014 Year 2011 2012 2013 2014 Residential Tax Increase 0% 2.0% 2.23% Business Tax Business Tax Relief increase revenue) - $24.0 $124.6 $189.5 The chart below shows the progress in reducing tax ratios , compared with the residential property tax rate, since the start of the \"Enhancing Toronto's Business Climate\" policy in 2006. A small business tax class was established in January 2008 in order to accelerate the tax reduction for neighborhood retail and this class is expected to reac h the targeted 2.5 ratio in 2015 .

This resulted in a reduction in education property taxes for Toronto's businesses by a total of $262 million between 1998 and 2002. The Province reinstituted this business education tax reduction initiative in 2007, res ulting in a further $21.1 million reduction 5.13 TRANSITION TO 201 4-2018 TERM PAGE 5 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 between 2008 and 2014, for a total BET reduction for Toronto's businesses of $283 million between 1998 and 2014. Reaching Current Value Assessment (CVA) In 2009, the province legislated changes that provide mun icipalities with tools to increase progress towards CVA . As a result, 61% of commercial properties (22,522), of industrial (2,191) and 72% multi -residential properties (2,818) are now at their full CVA -level of taxation (as of 2014) . It is projected t hat most properties will reach their full CVA -level of taxation by 2020.

Mission Statement BIA Boards of Management contribute to the improvement, beautification and maintenance of business areas by coordinating local businesses and managing partnerships with the City to : enhance and promote commercial areas as safe, vibrant places to do busines s, unique destinations for tourists, and focal points for neighbourhood activity ; contribute to Toronto's image as culturally diverse, cosmopolitan and progressive ; and to undertake projects to improve business areas . 7.2 TRANSITION TO 2014 -2018 TERM PAGE 2 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 Structure BIAs are established by the City and managed by volunteer boards of management elected by the businesses in the designated area and appointed by City Council . BIAs are City boards under the City of Toronto Act, and the City has the authority to establish, wind -up or change the boards and determine their operating principles and policies. Composition The City currently has 7 8 geographically dispersed BIAs involving over 35,000 small businesses, the most BIAs worldwide. The number of business members and City Councillors on BIA board s is set out in the City of Toronto Municipal Code, Chapter 19, Business Improvement Areas . The Toronto Association of Business Improvement Areas (TA BIA) is a separate organization and is not a C ity board . TABIA coordinates communication, issues management and advocacy on matters of interest to all BIAs. 2014 Service Overview The BIA Office in the Economic Development & Culture Division provides professional operational and administrative support to BIAs ensuring compliance with the Municipal Code and other relevant City policies . The BIA Office develops and manages the BIA capital cost -share program. These result in approximately 100 streetscape improvement projects per year with an annual value of a pproximately $5 million. These revitalization and street beautification initiatives are implemented at half the cost to the City through the 50% cost -share formula with BIAs, and are maintained by BIAs. The BIA Office also administers the Commercial Fa\u00e7ad e Improvement Program. The City provides approximately $500,000 per year in grants to commercial property owners within BIAs across the City to upgrade the physical appearance of their buildings, each to a maximum of $10,000. These funds are matched by the BIAs. This grants program is administered to meet City priorities such as City beautification, accessibility standards and environmental sustainability. 7.2 TRANSITION TO 2014 -2018 TERM PAGE 3 COUNCIL BRIEFING VOL.1 2014 Operating Budget The City collects levies from business owners in the designated business improvement area to cover BIA operating and capital budgets. These funds are collected by the City through the property tax billing process and all funds collected are remitted to the BIA, with 50% being remitted early in the year, prior to the City collecting the funds. This ensures necessary operating funds for the BIA at the beginning of the year. BIAs collectively levy approximately 35 million per year for commercial area improveme nts, marketing and promotion, and other economic development initiatives BIA budgets vary depending on the size of the BIA, the types of programs offered, and the types of streetscape improvement projects undertaken. Also, some BIAs can function with a t eam of volunteers while other BIAs require paid staff to run day -to-day operations, and sometimes it is necessary for BIAs to contract skilled services for specific projects. The size of the BIA budget is largely a function of the assessment base in the ar ea i.e. BIAs with large assessment bases are often able to levy more funds from its members at the same tax rate as a smaller BIA with smaller assessment base. The City does not contribute funds to BIA operating budgets.
