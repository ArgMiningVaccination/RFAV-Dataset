You may have to pay a copayment, premium, or cost of care for MaineCare services depending on what coverage group you have. Copayments You may need to pay for part of the cost of some MaineCare services. What you pay is called a copayment, or copay. Members do not have a copay for the following: - Services provided in Indian Health Service Centers - Family Planning services and supplies - Emergency Department services - Hospice services - All oxygen and oxygen equipment services - Tobacco cessation services and products For details about services that may require a copay and members who are responsible for copays, see the [MaineCare Member Handbook (PDF)](/dhhs/sites/maine.gov.dhhs/files/inline-files/mainecare-member-handbook.pdf). To see what you may pay for a copay for services and prescription drugs, see the [MaineCare Member Copayments (PDF)](https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/sites/maine.gov.dhhs/files/inline-files/MaineCare-Member-Copayments.pdf). Premiums A premium is a fee that some members pay to have MaineCare coverage. For some MaineCare programs, if you are over the income level for MaineCare, you may have the option to pay a premium for MaineCare coverage. You will know if you must pay a premium for coverage because you will get a letter. An example of a program with members who are responsible for premiums is the Katie Beckett program. Postpartum Coverage Effective August 1, 2022, MaineCare extended postpartum coverage to 12 months after the pregnancy ends. This coverage is automatically applied to current MaineCare members and ensures that no one loses access to care during the postpartum period. For more detail, see the [Postpartum Coverage Flyer (PDF)](https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/sites/maine.gov.dhhs/files/inline-files/Perinatal%20Forum%20Flier_0.pdf). Cost of Care If you live in a medical facility, you may have to pay for a portion of your care. The Cost of Care is the amount you pay towards your care at the medical facility. Members who pay a cost of care usually live in a nursing facility, residential care facility, cost-reimbursed boarding home, or an adult family care home. What is a Prior Authorization? Before you can get some services or equipment, MaineCare must approve it. This approval is called Prior Authorization (PA). Your provider sends a form to MaineCare and we will send you and your provider a letter to let you know if the service or medical equipment is approved. If you get the service or the medical equipment without MaineCare's approval, you may have to pay the bill. Examples of services and medical equipment that need PA: - Some prescription drugs - Some mental health services - Some surgeries - Most medical supplies and medical equipment that cost over $699.99 - Hearing aids - Most out-of-state services - Some eye care services - Some dental services, especially for adults - All services to straighten teeth - Some physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy - Inpatient treatment at an in-state psychiatric hospital - Out-of-state and some in-state transportation services - Some home care services - Some ambulance services For questions about a PA for a prescription drug, call the Pharmacy Help Desk at Pharmacy Help Desk at 1-866-796-2463.
