Understandably, that's still generating a lot of attention. Here's what you should know about COVID-19 vaccines and heart problems. The heart issues in question are called myocarditis and pericarditis Those refer, respectively, to inflammation of the heart and the lining around it. While they sound scary, both tend to clear up on their own or with minimal treatment, particularly if caught early. They can come with symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue and abnormal heart rhythms, and can be caused by viruses and bacteria. They are a very rare vaccine side effect Since April, about 1,000 cases have been reported among people who got vaccinated with mRNA-based shots, the [CDC says](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html). That might sound like a lot, but, for context, more than 300 million mRNA vaccine doses [have been ](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations) [administered](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations) so far in the U.S. A [statement](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/06/23/statement-following-cdc-acip-meeting-nations-leading-doctors-nurses-public-health-leaders-benefits-vaccination.html) signed by influential physicians including CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky notes that myocarditis and pericarditis are far more common among people who catch COVID-19 than among people who get the vaccine. Certain groups seem to be at higher risk Adolescent boys and young men seem to develop [these side effects](https://time.com/5957222/covid-vaccine-side-effects/) more often than other groups, according to the CDC, and it is more common after a second shot. [In general](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/myocarditis/)\u2014that is, separate from COVID-19 side effects\u2014men are more likely than women to develop heart inflammation, and it is commonly diagnosed among younger adults. Experts still recommend vaccination Given the known benefits of COVID-19 vaccination, physicians still recommend the shots for people of all ages. \"It is the best way to protect yourself, your loved ones, your community, and to return to a more normal lifestyle safely and quickly,\" the group of physicians urged in their joint statement.
