The legislature finds that: (1) Health care information is personal and sensitive information that if improperly used or released may do significant harm to a patient's interests in privacy, health care, or other interests. (2) Patients need access to their own health care information as a matter of fairness to enable them to make informed decisions about their health care and correct inaccurate or incomplete information about themselves. (3) In order to retain the full trust and confidence of patients, health care providers have an interest in assuring that health care information is not improperly disclosed and in having clear and certain rules for the disclosure of health care information. (4) Persons other than health care providers obtain, use, and disclose health record information in many different contexts and for many different purposes. It is the public policy of this state that a patient's interest in the proper use and disclosure of the patient's health care information survives even when the information is held by persons other than health care providers. \u00b7 (5) The movement of patients and their health care information across state lines, access to and exchange of health care information from automated data banks, and the emergence of multistate health care providers creates a compelling need for uniform law, rules, and procedures governing the use and disclosure of health care information. [1991 c 335 \u00a7 101.] 70.02.010 Def\"mitions. As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires: (1) \"Audit\" means an assessment, evaluation, determina\u00ad tion, or investigation of a health care provider by a person not employed by or affiliated with the provider to determine compliance with: (a) Statutory, regulatory, fiscal, medical, or scientific standards; (b) A private or public program of payments to a health care provider; or (c) Requirements for licensing, accreditation, or certifi\u00ad cation. (2) \"Directory information\" means information disclos\u00ad ing the presenc e and the general health condition of a particular patient who is a patient in a health care facility or who is currently receiving emergency health care in a health care facility. (3) \"General health condition\" means the patieJ;tt's health status described in of \"critical,\" \"poor,\" \"fair,\" \"excellent,\" \"Health care\" means ariy care, service, or procedure provided by a health care provider: (a) To diagnose, treat, or maintain a patient's physical or mental condition; or (b) That affects the structure or any function of the human body. (1992 Ed.) (5) \"Health care facility\" means a hospital, clinic, nursing home, laboratory, office, or similar place where a health care provider provides health care to patients. (6) \"Health care information\" means any information, whether oral or recorded in any form or medium, that identifies or c readily be associated with the identity of a patient and directly relates to the patient's health care. The term includes any record of disclosures of health care information. (7) \"Health care provider\" means a person who is licensed, certified, registered, or otherwise authorized by the law of this state to provide health care in the ordinary course of business or practice of a profession. \u00b7 (8) \"Institutional review board\" means any board, committee, or other group formally design ated by an iQstitution, or authorized under federal or state law, to review, approve the initiation of, or conduct periodic review of research programs to assure the protection of the rights and welfare of human research subjects. (9) \"Maintain,\" as related to health care information, means to hold, possess, preserve, retain, store, or control that information. \u00b7 (10) \"Patient\" means an individual who receives or has received health care. The term includes a deceased individu\u00ad al who has received health care. (11) \"Person\" means an individual, corporation, business trust, estate, trust, partnership, association, joint venture, government, governmental subdivision or agency, or any other legal or commercial entity. (12) \"Reasonable fee\" means the charges for duplicating or searching the record specified in RCW 36.18.020 (8) or (16), respectively. However, where editing of records by a health car provider is required by statute and is done by the provider personally, the fee may be the usual and customary charge for a basic office visit. [1991 c 335 \u00a7 1'02.] \u00b7 70.02.020 Disclosure by health care provider. Except as authorized in RCW 70.02.050, a health care provider, an individual who assists a health care provider in the delivery of health care, or an agent and employe e of a health care provider may not disClose health care information about a patient to any other person without the patient's written authorization. A disclosure made under a patient's written authorization must conform to the authorization. Health care providers or facilities shall chart all disclo\u00ad sures, except to\u00b7 third-party pealth care payors, of health care information, such chartings to become part of the health care information. [1991 c 335 \u00a7 201.] 70.02.030 Patient authorization of disclosure. ( 1) A patient may authorize a health care provider to disclose the patient's health care information. A health care provider shall honor an authorization and, if requested, provide a copy of the recorded health care information unless the health care provider denies the patient access to health care information under RCW 70.02.090. (2) A health care provider may charge a reasonable fee, not to exced the health care provider's actual cost for providing the health care information, and is not required to honor an authorization until the fee is paid.

(4) Except as provided by this chapter, the signing of an authorization by a patient is not a waiver of any rights a patient has under other statutes, the rules of evidence, or common law. (5) A health care provider shall retain each authorization or revocation in conjunction with any health care information from which disclosures are made. This requirement shall not apply to disclosures to third-party health care payors. (6) Except for authorizations to provide infonnation to third-party health care payors, an authorization may not permit the release of health care information relating to future health care that the patient receives more than ninety days after the authorization was signed. Patients shall be advised of the period of validity of their authorization on the disclosure authorization form. (7) Except for authorizations to provide infonnation to third-party health payors, an authorization in effect on July 28, 1991, remains valid for six months after July 28, 1991, unless an earlier date is specified or it is revoked under RCW 70.02.040. Health care information disclosed under such an authorization is otherwise subject to this chapter. An authorization written after July 28, 1991, becomes invalid after the expiration date contained in the authorization, which may not exceed ninety days. If the authorization does not contain an expiration date, it expires ninety days after it is signed. [1991 c 335 \u00a7 202.) 70.02.040 Patient's revocation of authorization for disclosure. A patient may revoke in writing a disclosure authorization to a health care provider at any time unless disclosure is required to effectuate payments for health care that has been provided or other substantial action has been taken in reliance on the authorization. A patient may not maintain an action against the health care provider for disclosures made in good-faith reliance on an authorization if the health care provider had no actual notice of the revocation of the authorization. [1991 c 335 \u00a7 203.) 70.02.050 Disclosure without patient's authoriza\u00ad tion. (1) A health care provider may disclose health care information about a patient without the patient's authoriza\u00ad tion to the extent a recipient needs to know the information, if the disclosure is: (a) To a person who the provider reasonably believes is providing health care to the patient; (b) To any other person who requires health care information for health care education, or to provide planning, quality assurance, peer review, or administr ative, legal, financial, or actuarial services to the health care provider; or for assisting the health care provider in the delivery of health [Title 70 RCW-page 4] care and the health care provider reasonably believes that the person: (i) Will not use or disclose the health care information for any other purpose; and (ii) Will take appropriate steps to protect the health care information; (c) To any other health care provid er reasonably believed to have previously provided health care to the patient, to the extent necessary to provide health care to the patient, unless the patient has instructed the health care provider in writing not to make the disclosure; (d) To any person if the health care provider reasonably believes that disclosure will avoid or minimize an imminent danger to the health or safety of the patient or any other individual, however there is no obligation under this chapter on the part of the provider to so disclose; (e) Oral, and made to immediate family members of the patient, or any other individual with whom the patient is known to have a close personal relationship, if made in accordance with good medical or other professional practice, unless the patient has instructed the health care provider in writing not to make the disclosure; (f) To a health care provider who is the successor in interest to the health care provider maintaining the health care information; (g) For use in a research project that an institutional review board has determined: (i) Is of sufficient importance to outweigh the intrusion into the privacy of the patient that would result from the disclosure; (ii) Is impracticable without the use or disclosure of the health care information in individually identifiable form; (iii) Contains reasonable safeguards to protect the information from redisclosure; (iv) Contains reasonable safeguards to protect against identifying, directly or indirectly, any patient in any report of the research project; and (v) Contains procedures to remove or destroy at the earliest opportunity, consistent with the purposes of the project, information that would enable the patient to be identified, unless an institutional review board authorizes retention of identifying information for purposes of another research project; (h) To a person who obtains information for purposes of an audit, if that person agrees in writing to: (i) Remove or destroy , at the earliest opportunity consistent with the purpose of the audit, information that would enable the patient to be identified; and (ii) Not to disclose the information further, except to accomplish the audit or report unlawful or improper conduct involving fraud in payment for health care by a health care provider or patient, or other unlawful conduct by the health care provider; (i) To an official of a penal or other custodial institution in which the patient is detained; G) To provide directory information, unless the patient has instructed the health care provider not to make the disclosure. (2) A health care provider shall disclose health care informa tion about a patient without the patient's authoriza\u00ad tion if the disclosure is: (1992 Ed.)

(3) All state or local agencies obtaining patient health care information pursuant to this section shall adopt rules establishing their record acquisition, retention, and security policies that are consistent with this chapter. [1991 c 335 \u00a7 204.] 70.02.060 Discovery request or compulsory process. (1) Before service of a discovery request or compulsory process on a health care provider for health care information, an attorney shall provide advance notice to the health care provider and the patient or the patient's attorney involved through service of process or first class mail, indicating the health care provider from whom the information is sought, what health care information is sought, and the date by which a protective order must be obtained to prevent the health care provider from complying. Such date shall give the patient and the health care provider adequate time to seek a protective order, but in no event be less than fourteen days since the date of service or delivery to the patient and the health care provider of the foregoing. Thereafter the request for discovery or compulsory process shall be served on the health care provider. (2) Without the written consent of the patient, the health care provider may not disclose the health care information sought under subsection (1) of this section if the requestor has not complied with the requirements of subsection (1) of this section. In the absence of a protective order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction forbidding compliance, the health care provider shall disclose the information in accordance with this chapter. In the case of compliance, the request for discovery or compulsory process shall be made a part of the patient record. (3) Production of health care information under this section, in and of itself, does not constitute a waiver of any privilege, objection, or defense existing under other law or rule of evidence or procedure. [1991 c 335 \u00a7 205.] 70.02.070 Certification of record. Upon the request of the person requesting the record, the health care provider or facility shall certify the record furnished and may charge for such certification in accordance with RCW 36.18.020(9).

(2) Upon request, the health care provider shall provide an explanation of any code or abbreviation used in the health care information. If a record of the particular health care information requested is not maintained by the health care provider in the requested form, the health care provider is not required to create a new record or reformulate an existing record to make the health care information available in the requested form. The health care provider may charge a reasonable fee, not to exceed the health care provider's actual cost, for providing the health care information and is not required to permit examination or copying until the fee is paid.

The health care provider denying the request shall inform the patient of the patient's right to select another health care provider under this subsection. The patient shall be responsible for arrang\u00ad ing for compensation of the other health care provider so selected. [1991 c 335 \u00a7 302.] 70.02.100 Correction or amendment of record. (1) For purposes of accuracy or completeness, a patient may request in writing that a health care provider correct or amend its record of the patient's health care informat ion to which a patient has access under RCW 70.02.080.

The legislature declares that sexually transmitted diseases constitute a serious and sometimes fatal threat to the public and individu\u00ad al health and welfare of the people of the state. The legislature finds that the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases is rising at an alarming rate and that these diseases result in significant social, health, and economic costs, including infant and maternal mortality, temporary and lifelong disability, and premature death. The legislature furtl:ter finds that sexually transmitted diseases, by their nature, involve sensitive issues of privacy, and it is the intent [Title 70 RCW-page 18] of the legislature that all programs designed to deal with these diseases afford patients privacy, confidentiality, and dignity. The legislature also finds that medical knowledge and information about sexually transmitted diseases are rapidly changing. It is therefore the intent of the legislature to provide a program that is sufficiently flexible to meet emerging needs, deals efficiently and effectively with reducing the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases, and provides patients with a secure knowledge that information they provide will remain private and confidential .

(1) The legislature recognizes that in this state ethnic minorities currently use nursing home care at a lower rate than the general popula\u00ad tion. The legislature also recognizes and supports the federal mandate that nursing homes receiving federal funds provide residents with a homelike environment. The legislature finds that certain ethnic minorities have special cultural, language, dietary, and other needs not generally met by existing nursing homes which are intended to serve the general population. Accordingly, the legislature further finds that there is a need to foster the development of nursing homes designed to serve the special cultural, language, dietary, and other needs of ethnic minorities.

Title 70 RCW: Public Health and Safety 70.38.220 (2) The department shall establish a separate pool of no more than two hundred fifty beds for nursing homes de\u00ad signed to serve the special needs of ethnic minorities. The pool shall be made up of nursing home beds that become available on or after March 15, 1991, due to: . (a) Loss of license or reduction in licensed bed capacity If the beds are not otherwise obligated for replacemen t; or (b) Expiration of a certificate of need. (3) The department shall develop procedures for the fair and efficient award of beds from the special pool. In making its decisions regarding the award of beds from the pool, the department shall consider at least the following: (a) The relative degree to which the long-term care needs of an ethnic minority are not otherwise being met; (b) The percentage of low-income persons who would be served by the proposed nursing home; (c) The financial feasibility of the proposed nursing home; and (d) The impact of the proposal on the area's total need for nursing home beds. (4) To be eligible to apply for or receive an award of beds from the special pool, an application must be to build a new nursing home, or add beds to a nursing home, that: . (a) Will be owned and operated by a nonprofit corpora\u00ad bon, and at least fifty percent of the board of directors of the corporation are members of the ethnic minority the nursing home is intended to serve; (b) Will be designed, managed, and administered to serve the special cultural, language , dietary, and other needs of an ethnic minority ; and (c) Will not discriminate in admissions against persons who are not members of the ethnic minority whose special needs the nursing home is designed to serve. . 5) If a nursing home or portion of a nursing home that IS bmlt as a result of an award from the special pool is sold or leased within ten years to a party not eligible under subsection (4) of this section: (a) The purchaser or lessee may not operate those beds as nursing home beds without first obtaining a certifica te of need for new beds under this chapter; and (b) The beds that had been awarded from the special pool shall be returned to the special pool. (6) The department shall initially award up to one hundred beds before that number of beds are actually in the special pool, provided that the number of beds so awarded are subtracted from the total of two hundred fifty beds that can be awarded from the special pool.

(1) The legislature finds that: (a) A significant percentage of the population of this state does not have reasonably available insurance or other coverage of the costs of necessary basic health care services; (b) This lack of basic health care coverage is detrimen\u00ad tal to the health of the individuals lacking coverage and to the public welfare, and results in substantial expenditures for emergency and remedial health care, often at the expense of health care providers, health care facilities, and all purchas\u00ad ers of health care, including the state; and (c) The use of managed health care systems has signifi\u00ad cant potential to reduce the growth of health care costs incurred by the people of this state generally, and by low\u00ad income pregnant women who are an especially vulnerable population, along with their children, and who need greater access to managed health care. (2) The purpose of this chapter is to provide necessary basic health care services in an appropriate setting to working persons and others who lack coverage, at a cost to these persons that does not create barriers to the utilization of necessary health care services. To that end, this chapter establishes a program to be made available to those residents under sixty-five years of age not otherwise eligible for medicare with gross family income at or below two hundred (1992 Ed.) Title 70 RCW: Public Health and Safety 70.47.010 percent of the federal poverty guidelines who share in the cost of receiving basic health care serv ices from a managed health care system. (3) It is not the intent of this chapter to provide health care services for those persons who are presently covered through private employer-based health plans, nor to replace employer-based health plans. Further, it is the intent of the legislature to expand, wherever possible, the availability of private health care coverage and to discourage the decline of employer-based coverage. (4) The program authorized under this chapter is strictly limited in respect to the total number of individ uals who may be allowed to participate and the specific areas within the state where it may be established. All such restrictions or limitations shall remain in full force and effect until quantifiable evidence based upon the actual operation of the program , including detailed cost benefit analysis, has been presented to the legislature and the legislature, by specific act at that time, may then modify such limitatio ns.

(1) The Washington basic health plan is created as an independent agency of the state. The administrative head and appointing authority of the plan shall be the administrator who shall be appointed by the governor, with the consent of the senate, and shall serve at the pleasure of the governor . The salary for this office shall be set by the governor pursuant to RCW 43.03.040. The administrator shall appoint a medical director. The adm inistrator, medical director, and up to five other employees shall be exempt from the civil service law, chapter 41.06 RCW. (2) The administrator shall employ such other staff as are necessary to fulfill the responsibilities and duties of the administrator, such staff to be subject to the civil service law, chapter 41.06 RCW. In addition, the administrator may contract with third parties for services necessary to carry out its activities where this will promote economy, avoid duplication of effort, and make best use of available exper\u00ad tise. Any such contractor or consultant shall be prohibited from releasing, publishing, or otherwise using any informa\u00ad tion made available to it under its contractual responsibility without specific permission of the plan. The administrator may call upon other agencies of the state to provide avail\u00ad able information as necessary to assist the administrator in meeting its responsibilities under this chapter, which infor\u00ad mation shall be supplied as promptly as circumstances permit. (3) The administ rator may appoint such technical or advisory committees as he or she deems necessary. The administ rator shall appoint a standing technica 1 advisory committee that is representative of health care professionals, health care providers, and those directly involved in the purchase, provision, or delivery of health care services, as [Title 70 RCW---page 67] 70.47.040 Title 70 RCW: Public Health and Safety well as consumers and those knowledgeable of the ethical issues involved with health care public policy. Individuals appointed to any technical or other advisory committee shall serve without compensation for their services as members, but may be reimbursed for their travel expenses pursuant to RCW 43.03.050 and 43.03.060. (4) The adminis trator may apply for, receive, and accept grants, gifts, and other payments, including property and service, from any governmental or other public or private entity or person, and may make arrangements as to the use of these receipts, including the underta king of special studies and other projects relating to health care costs and access to health care. (5) In the design, organizati on, and admini stration of the plan under this chapter, the administr ator shall consider the report of the Washington health care project commission established under chapter 303, Laws of 1986. Nothing in this chapter requires the admini strator to follow any specific recommendation contained in that report except as it may also be included in this chapter or other law. [1987 1st ex.s. c 5 \u00a7 6.] Sunset Act application: See note following chapter digest. 70.47.050 Rules. The admini strator may promulgate and adopt rules consistent with this chapter to carry out the purposes of this chapter. All rules shall be adopted in accordance with chapter 34.05 RCW. [1987 1st ex.s. c 5 \u00a7 7.] Sunset Act application: See note following chapter digest. 70.47.060 Powers and duties of admini strator. The administr ator has the following powers and duties: (1) To design and from time to time revise a schedule of covered basic health care services, including physician service s, inpatient and outpatient hospital services, and other services that may be necessary for basic health care, which enrollees in any participating managed health care system under the Washington basic health plan shall be entitled to receive in return for premium payments to the plan. The schedule of services shall emphasize proven preventive and primary health care and shall include all services necessary for prenatal, postnatal, and well-child care. However, for the period ending June 30, 1993, with respect to coverage for groups of subsidized enrollees, the administr ator shall not contract for prenatal or postnatal services that are provided under the medical assistance program under chapter 74.09 RCW except to the extent that such services are necessary over not more than a one-month period in order to maintain continu ity of care after diagnosis of pregnancy by the managed care provider, or except to provide any such services associated with pregnancies diagnosed by the managed care provider before July 1, 1992. The schedule of services shall also include a separate schedule of basic health care services for children, eighteen years of age and younger, for those enrollees who choose to secure basic coverage through the plan only for their dependent childre n. In designing and revising the schedule of services, the adminis\u00ad trator shall consider the guidelines for assessing health services under the mandated benefits act of 1984, RCW 48.42.080, and such other factors as approp riate. [Title 70 RCW--page 68] (2) To design and implement a structure of periodic premiums due the administ rator from enrollees that is based upon gross family income, giving appropriate consideration to family size as well as the ages of all family members . The enrollment of children shall not require the enrollment of their parent or parents who are eligible for the plan. (3) To design and implement a structure of nominal copayments due a managed health care system from enrollees. The structure shall discourage inapprop riate enrollee utilization of health care services, but shall not be so costly to enrollees as to constitute a barrier to appropriate utilization of necessary health care services. (4) To design and implement, in concert with a suffi\u00ad cient number of potential providers in a discrete area, an enrollee financial participation structure, separate from that otherw ise established under this chapter, that has the follow\u00ad ing characte ristics: (a) Nomina l premiums that are based upon ability to pay, but not set at a level that would discourage enrollment; (b) A modified fee-for- services payment schedule for providers; (c) Coinsurance rates that are established based on specific service and procedure costs and the enrollee's ability to pay for the care. However, coinsurance rates for families with incomes below one hundred twenty percent of the federal poverty level shall be nominal. No coinsurance shall be required for specific proven prevention programs, such as prenatal care. The coinsurance rate levels shall not have a measurable negative effect upon the enrollee's health status; and (d) A case management system that fosters a provider\u00ad enrollee relationship whereby, in an effort to control cost, maintain or improve the health status of the enrollee, and maximize patient involvement in her or his health care decision-making process, every effort is made by the provider to inform the enrollee of the cost of the specific services and procedures and related health benefits. The potential financial liability of the plan to any such providers shall not exceed in the aggregate an amount greater than that which might otherwise have been incurred by the plan on the basis of the number of enrollees multi\u00ad plied by the average of the prepaid capitated rates negotiated with participating managed health care systems under RCW 70.47.100 and reduced by any sums charged enrollees on the basis of the coinsurance rates that are established under this subsection. (5) To limit enrollment of persons who qualify for subsidies so as to prevent an overexpenditure of appropria\u00ad tions for such purpos es. Whenever the administrator finds that there is danger of such an overexpenditure, the adminis\u00ad trator shall close enrollment until the administr ator finds the danger no longer exists. (6) To adopt a schedule for the orderly development of the delivery of services and availability of the plan to residents of the state, subject to the limitations contained in RCW 70.47.080. In the selection of any area of the state for the initial operation of the plan, the admini strator shall take into account the levels and rates of unemployment in different areas of the state, the need to provide basic health care coverage to a population reasonably representative of the portion of the state's population that lacks such coverage, (1992 Ed.) Title 70 RCW: Public Health and Safety 70.47.060 and the need for geographic, demogra phic, and economic diversity . Before July 1, 1988, the administrator shall endeavor to secure participation contracts with managed health care systems in discrete geographic areas within at least five congressional districts. (7) To solicit and accept applications from managed health care systems, as defined in this chapter, for inclusion as eligible basic health care providers under the plan. The administ rator shall endeavor to assure that covered basic health care services are available to any enrollee of the plan from among a selection of two or more participati ng man\u00ad aged health care systems. In adopting any rules or proce\u00ad dures applicable to managed health care systems and in its dealings with such systems, the administrator shall consider and make suitable allowance for the need for health care services and the differences in local availability of health care resources, along with other resources, within and among the several areas of the state. (8) To receive periodic premiums from enrollees, deposit them in the basic health plan operating account, keep records of enrollee status, and authorize periodic payments to managed health care systems on the basis of the number of enrollees participating in the respective managed health care systems. (9) To accept applications from individuals residing in areas served by the plan, on behalf of themselves and their spouses and dependent children, for enrollment in the Washington basic health plan, to establish appropriate minimum-enr ollment periods for enrollees as may be necessary, and to determine, upon application and at least annually thereafter, or at the request of any enrollee, eligibil\u00ad ity due to current gross family income for sliding scale premiums. An enrollee who remains current in payment of the sliding-scale premium, as determined under subsection (2) of this section, and whose gross family income has risen above twice the federal poverty level, may continue enroll\u00ad ment unless and until the enrollee's gross family income has remained above twice the poverty level for six consecutive months, by making payment at the unsubsidized rate required for the managed health care system in which he or she may be enrolled. No subsidy may be paid with respect to any enrollee whose current gross family income exceeds twice the federal poverty level or, subject to RCW 70.47.110, who is a recipient of medical assistance or medical care services under chapter 74.09 RCW. If a number of enrollees drop their enrollment for no apparent good cause, the administra\u00ad tor may establish appropriate rules or requirements that are applicable to such individuals before they will be allowed to re-enroll in the plan. (10) To determine the rate to be paid to each participat\u00ad ing managed health care system in return for the provision of covered basic health care services to enrollees in the system. Although the schedule of covered basic health care services will be the same for similar enrollees, the rates negotiated with participating managed health care systems may vary among the systems. In negotiating rates with participating systems, the administ rator shall consider the characteri stics of the populations served by the respe ctive systems, economic circumstances of the local area, the need to conserve the resources of the basic health plan trust account, and other factors the administrator finds relevant. (1992 Ed.) (11) To monitor the provision of covered services to enrollees by participating managed health care systems in order to assure enrollee access to good quality basic health care, to require periodic data reports concerning the utiliza\u00ad tion of health care services rendered to enrollees in order to provide adequate information for evaluation, and to inspect the books and records of participati ng managed health care systems to assure compliance with the purposes of this chapter. In requiring reports from participating managed health care systems, including data on services rendered enrollees, the administrator shall endeavor to minimize costs, both to the managed health care systems and to the adminis\u00ad trator. The administrator shall coordina te any such reporting requirements with other state agencies, such as the insurance commissioner and the departm ent of health, to minimize duplication of effort. (12) To monitor the access that state residents have to adequate and necessary health care serv ices, determine the extent of any unmet needs for such services or lack of access that may exist from time to time, and make such reports and recommendations to the legislature as the administrator deems appropriate. (13) To evaluate the effects this chapter has on private employer-based health care coverage and to take appropriate measures consistent with state and federal statutes that will discourage the reduction of such coverage in the state. (14) To develop a program of proven preventive health measures and to integrate it into the plan wherever possible and consistent with this chapter. (15) To provide, consistent with available resources, technical assistance for rural health activities that endeavor to develop needed health care services in rural parts of the state.

The benefits available under the plan shall be subject to RCW 48.21.200 and shall be excess to the benefits payable under the terms of any insurance policy issued to or on the behalf of an enrollee that provides payments toward medical expenses without a determination of liability for the injury. [1987 1st ex.s. c 5 \u00a7 9.] Sunset Act application: See note following chapter digest. 70.47.080 Enrollment of applicants-Limit ations. On and after July 1, 1988, the administr ator shall accept for enrollment applicants eligible to receive covered basic health care services from the respective managed health care systems which are then participating in the plan. The administrator shall not allow the total enrollment of those eligible for subsidies to exceed thirty thousand. Thereafter, total enrollment shall not exceed the number established by the legislature in any act appropri ating funds to the plan. Before July 1, 1988, the administrator shall endeavor to secure participation contracts from managed health care systems in discrete geographic areas within at least five congressional districts of the state and in such manner as to [Title 70 RCW-page 691 70.47.080 Title 70 RCW: Public Health and Safety allow residents of both urban and rural areas access to enrollment in the plan. The administ rator shall make a special effort to secure agreements with health care providers in one such area that meets the requirements set forth in RCW 70.47.060(4). The administ rator shall at all times closely monitor growth patterns of enrollment so as not to exceed that consistent with the orderly development of the plan as a whole, in any area of the state or in any participating managed health care system. [1987 1st ex.s. c 5 \u00a7 10.] Sunset Act application: See note following chapter digest. 70.47.090 Removal of enrollees. Any enrollee whose premium payments to the plan are delinquent or who moves his or her residence out of an area served by the plan may be dropped from enrollment status. An enrollee whose premium is the responsibility of the department of social and health services under RCW 70.47.110 may not be dropped solely because of nonpayment by the department. The administrator shall provide delinquent enrollees with advance written notice of their removal from the plan and shall provide for a hearing under chapters 34.05 and 34.12 RCW for any enrollee who contests the decision to drop the enrollee from the plan. Upon removal of an enrollee from the plan, the administrator shall promptly notify the managed health care system in which the enrollee has been enrolled, and shall not be responsible for payment for health care services provided to the enrollee (including, if applicable, members of the enrollee's family) after the date of notifica\u00ad tion. A managed health care system may contest the denial of payment for coverage of an enrollee through a hearing under chapters 34.05 and 34.12 RCW. 1st ex.s. c application: See note following chapter\u00b7 digest. 70.47.100 Participation by managed health care systems. Managed health care systems participating in the plan shall do so by contract with the administrator and shall provide, directly or by contract with other health care providers, covered basic health care services to each enrollee as long as payments from the administrator on behalf of the enrollee are current. A participating managed health care system may offer, without additional cost, health care benefits or services not included in the schedule of covered services under the plan. A participating managed health care system shall not give preference in enrollment to enrollees who accept such additional health care benefits or services. Managed health care systems participating in the plan shall not discrimi nate against any potential or current enrollee based upon health status, sex, race, ethnicity, or religion. The administrator may receive and act upon complaints from enrollees regarding failure to provide covered services or efforts to obtain payment, other than authorized copayments, for covered services directly from enrollees, but nothing in this hapter empwers the administrator to impose any sanctions under Tttle 18 RCW or any other professional or facility licensing statute. The plan shall allow, at least annually, an opportunity for enrollees to transfer their enrollments among participating managed health care systems serving their respective areas. The administrator shall establish a period of at least twenty [Title 70 RCW-page 70] days in a given year when this opportu nity is afforded enrollees, and in those areas served by more than one participating managed health care system the administrator shall endeavor to establish a uniform period for such opportunity. The plan shall allow enrollees to transfer their enrollment to another participating managed health care system at any time upon a showing of good cause for the transfer. Any contract between a hospital and a participating managed health care system under this chapter is subject to the requirements of *RCW 70.39.140(1) regarding negotiated rates. Prior to negotiating with any managed health care system, the administrator shall determine, on an actuarially sound basis, the reasonable cost of providing the schedule of basic health care services, expressed in terms of upper and lower limits, and recognizing variations in the cost of providing the services through the various systems and in different areas of the state. In negotiating with managed health care systems for participation in the plan, the adminis\u00ad trator shall adopt a unif orm procedure that includes at least the following: (1) The administrator shall issue a request for proposals, including standards regarding the quality of services to be provided; financial integrity of the responding systems; and responsiveness to the unmet health care needs of the local communities or populations that may be served; (2) The administ rator shall then review responsive proposals and may negotiate with respondents to the extent necessary to refine any proposals; (3) The administ rator may then select one or more systems to provide the covered services within a local area; and (4) The administ rator may adopt a policy that gives preference to respondents, such as nonprofit community health clinics, that have a history of providing quality health care services to low-income persons. [1987 1st 70.39.140 was repealed by 1982 c 223 \u00a7 10, effective June 30, 1990. Sunset Act application: See note following chapter digest. 70.47.110 Enrollment of medical assistance recipi\u00b7 ents. The departm ent of social and health services may make payments to the adminis trator or to participating managed health care systems on behalf of any enrollee who is a recipient of medical care under chapter 74.09 RCW, at the maximum rate allowable for federal matching purposes under Title XIX of the social security act. Any enrollee on whose behalf the department of social and health services makes such payments may continue as an enrollee, making premium payments based on the enrollee's own income as determined under the sliding scale, after eligibility for coverage under chapter 74.09 RCW has ended, as long as the enrollee remains eligible under this chapter. Nothing in this section affects the right of any person eligible for coverage under chapter 74.09 RCW to receive the services offered to other persons under that chapter but not included in the schedule of basic health care services covered by the plan. The administrator shall seek to determine which enrollees or prospective enrollees may be eligible for (1992 Ed.) Title 70 RCW: Public Health and Safety 70.47.110 medical care under chapter 74.09 RCW and may require these individuals to complete the eligibilit y determination process under chapter 74.09 RCW prior to enrollment or continued participati on in the plan. The administrator and the department of social and health services shall coopera\u00ad tively adopt procedures to facilitate the transition of plan enrollees and payments on their behalf between the plan and the programs established under chapter 74.09 RCW.

Patients from minority groups are therefore less likely to find matching, unrelated donors. .

[1987 \u00a7 6.] Legislative findings- 1987 c 351: \"The legislature finds that children are society 's most valuable resource and that child abuse and neglect is a threat to the physical, mental, and emotional health of children. The legislature further finds that assisting community-based private nonprofit and public organizations, agencies, or school districts in identif ying and establishing needed primary prevention programs will reduce the incidence of child abuse and neglect, and the necessity for costly subsequent intervention in family life by the state. Child abuse and neglect prevention programs can be most effectively and econom ically administered through the use of trained volunteers and the cooperative efforts of the communities, citizens, and the state. The legislature finds that the Washington council for prevention of child abuse is an effective counsel for reducing child abuse but limited resources have prevented the council from funding promising prevention concepts state-wide. It is the intent of the legislature to establish a cost-neutral revenue system for the children's trust fund which is designed to fund primary prevention programs and innovative prevention related activities such as research or public awareness campaigns. The fund shall be supported through revenue created by the sale of heirloom birth certificates. This concept has proven to be a cost-effective approach to funding child abuse prevention in the state of Oregon. The legislature believes that this is an innovative way of using private dollars to supplement our public dollars to reduce child abuse and neglect.\" [1987 c 351 \u00a7 1.] (1992 Ed.) birth-Legit imation, paternity-Substitution for origin al-Inspection of original, when-When delayed registration required.

Transfer of powers, duties, and functions with respect to air pollution under chapter 70.94 RCW to department of ecology: RCW air act: Chapter 70.160 RCW. 70.94.011 Declaration of public policies and pur\u00ad pose. It is declared to be the public policy to preserve, protect, and enhance the air quality for current and future generations. Air is an essential resource that must be protected from harmful levels of pollution. Improving air quality is a matter of state-wide concern and is in the public interest. It is the intent of this chapter to secure and maintain levels of air quality that protect human health and safety, including the most sensitive members of the popula\u00ad tion, to comply with the requirements of the federal clean air act, to prevent injury to plant, animal life, and property, to foster the comfort and convenience of Washington 's inhabit\u00ad ants, to promote the economic and social development of the state, and to facilitate the enjoyment of the natural attra ctions of the state. It is further the intent of this chapter to protect the public welfare, to preserve visibility, to protect scenic, aesthetic, historic, and cultural values, and to prevent air pollution problems that interfere with the enjoyment of life, property, or natural attractions. Because of the extent of the air pollution problem the legislature finds it necessa ry to return areas with poor air quality to levels adequate to protect health and the environ\u00ad ment as expeditiously as possible but no later than December 31, 1995. Further, it is the intent of this chapter to prevent any areas of the state with acceptable air quality from reaching air contami nant levels that are not protective of human health and the environment. \u00b7 The legislature recognizes that air pollution control projects may affect other environmental media. In selecting air pollution control strategies state and local agencies shall support those strategies that lessen the negative environmen\u00ad tal impact of the project on all environmen tal media, including air, water, and land. (1992 Ed.) The legislature further recognizes that energy efficiency and energy conservation can help to reduce air pollution and shall therefore be considered when making decisions on air pollution control strategies and projects. It is the policy of the state that the costs of protecting the air resource and operating state and local air pollution control program s shall be shared as equitably as possible among all sources whose emissions cause air pollution. It is also declared as public policy that regional air pollution control programs are to be encouraged and support\u00ad ed to the extent practicable as essential instruments for the securing and maintenance of appropriate levels of air quality. To these ends it is the purpose of this chapter to safeguard the public interest through an intensive, progres\u00ad sive, and coordinated state-wide program of air pollution prevention and control, to provide for an appropriate distri\u00ad bution of responsibilities, and to encourage coordinati on and cooperati on between the state, regional, and local units of government, to improve cooperation between state and federal government, public and private organizations, and the concerned individual , as well as to provide for the use of all known, available, and reasonable methods to reduce, prevent, and control air pollution. The legislature recognizes that the problems and effects of air pollution cross political boundaries, are frequently regional or interjurisdictional in nature, and are dependent upon the existence of human activit y in areas having common topography and weather conditions conducive to the buildup of air contaminants. In addition, the legislature recognizes that air pollution levels are aggravated and compounded by increased population, and its consequences. These changes often result in increasingly serious problems for the public and the environment. The legisla ture further recognizes that air emissions from thousands of small individua l sources are major contributors to air pollution in many regions of the state. As the population of a region grows, small sources may contrib\u00ad ute an increasing proportion of that region's total air emis\u00ad sions. It is declared to be the policy of the state to achieve significant reductions in emissions from those small sou ces whose aggregate emissions constitute a significant contnbu\u00ad tion to air pollution in a particular region. It is the intent of the legislature that air pollution goals be incorporated in the missions and actions of state agencies.

[1991 c 199 \u00a7 of emissions-B ubble concept\u00ad Schedules of compliance. (1) As used in subsection (3) of this section, the term \"bubble\" means ail air pollution control system which permits aggregate measurements of allowable emissions, for a single category of pollutant, for emissions points from a specified emissions-gen erating facility or facilities. Individual point source emissions levels from such specified facility or facilities may be modified provided that the aggregate limit for the specified sources is not exceeded . (2) Wheneve r any regulation relating to emission standards or other requirements for the control of emissions is adopted which provides for compliance with such stan\u00ad dards or requirements no later than a specified time after the date of adoption of the regulation, the appropriate activated air pollution control authority or, if there be none, the department of ecology shall, by permit or regulatory order, issue to air contaminant sources subject to the standards or requirements, schedules of compliance setting forth timeta\u00ad bles for the achievement of compliance as expeditiously as praccable, but in no case later than the time specified in the regulatio n. Interim dates in such schedules for the comple\u00ad tion of steps of progress toward compliance shall be as enforceable as the final date for full compliance therein. (3) Wherever requirements necessary for the attainment of air quality standards or, where such standards are not exceeded, for the maintenance of air quality can be achieved through the use of a control program involving the bubble concept, such program may be authorized by a regulatory order or orders or permit issued to the air contaminant source or sources involved. Such order or permit shall only be authorized after the control program involving the bubble concept is accepted by [the] United States environmental protection agency as part of an approved state implementa\u00ad tion plan. Any such order or permit provision shall restrict total emissions within the bubble to no more than would otherwise be allowed in the aggregate for all emitting processes covered. The orders or permits provided for by this subsection shall be issued by the department or the authority with jurisdiction. If the bubble involves interjurisdictional approval, concurrence in the total program must be secured from each regulatory entity concerned.

Use of emission credits to be consistent with bubble program: RCW 70.94.850. 70.94.157 Preemption of uniform building and fire codes. The department and local air pollution control authorities shall preempt the application of chapter 9 of the uniform building code and article 80 of the uniform fire code by other state agencies and local governments for the purposes of controlling outdoor air pollution from industrial and commercial sources, except where authorized by *this act. Actions by other state agencies and local governments under article 80 of the uniform fire code to take immediate [Title 70 RCW-page 146] action in response to an emission that presents a physical hazard or imminent health hazard are not preempted. [1991 c 199 \u00a7 315.] see Codification Tables, Volume 0. 991 c 199: See note following RCW 70.94.011. 70.94.161 Operating permits for air contaminant sources-Generally-Fees, report to legislature. The department of ecology, or board of an authority, shall require renewable permits for the operation of air contaminant sources subject to the following conditions and limitations: (1) Unless a different meaning is plainly required by the context, the following words and phrases shall have the following meanings: (a) \"Lowest achievable emission rate\" (LAER) means for any source that rate of emissions which reflects: (i) The most stringent emission limitation that is contained in the implementation plan of any state for such class or category of source, unless the owner or operator of the proposed new or modified source demonstrates that such limitations are not achievable; or (ii) The most stringent emission limitation that is achieved in practice by such class or category of source, whichever is more stringent. In no event shall the application of this term permit a proposed new or modified source to emit any pollutant in excess of the amount allowable under applicable new source performance standards. (b) \"Best available control technology\" (BACT) means technology that will result in an emission limitation, includ\u00ad ing a visible emission standard, based on the maximum degree of reduction for each air pollutant subject to this regulation that would be emitted from any proposed new or modified source that the permitting authority, on a case-by\u00ad case basis, taking into account energy, environmental , and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for such sources or modification through application of production processes, available methods, systems , and techniques, including fuel cleaning or treatment or innovative fuel combustion techniques for control of such air pollutant. In no event shall application of the best available technology result in emissions of any air pollutant that would exceed the emissions allowed by any applicable standard under 40 C.F.R. Part 60 and Part 61. If the reviewi ng agency determines that technological or economic limitations on the application of measurement methodology to a particular class of sources would make the imposition of an emission standard infeasible, it may instead prescribe a design, equipment, work practice, or operational standard, or combina tion thereof , to meet the requirem ent of best available control technology. Such standard shall, to the degree possible, set forth the emission reduction achievable by implementation of such design, equipment, work practice, or operation and shall provide for compliance by means that achieve equivalent results. The term \"all known available and reasonable methods of emission control\" is interpreted to mean the same as best available control technology. (c) \"Reasonably available control technology\" (RACT) means the lowest emission limit that a particular source or source category is capable of meeting by the application of (1992 Ed.) Title 70 RCW: Public Health and Safety 70.94.161 control technology that is reasonably available considering technological and economic feasibility. RACT is determined on a case-by-case basis for an individual source or source category taking into account the impact of the source upon air quality, the availability of additional controls, the emission reduction to be achieved by additional controls, the impact of additional controls on air quality, and the capital and operating costs of the additiona l controls. RACT requirements for any source or source category shall be adopted only after notice and opportunity for comment are afforded. (d) \"Source\" means all of the emissions units including quantifia ble fugitive emissions, that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties, and are under the control of the same person, or persons under common control, whose activities are ancillary to the production of a single product or functionally related group of products. (e) \"New source\" means (i) the construction or modifi\u00ad cation of a stationary source that increases the amount of any air contaminant emitted by such source or that results in the emission of any air contaminant not previously emitted, and (ii) any other project that constitutes a new source under the federal clean air act. (f) \"Stationary source\" means any building, structure, facility, or installation that emits or may emit any air contaminant. (g) \"Modificat ion\" means any physical change in, or change in the method of operation of, a stationa ry source that increases the amount of any air contaminant emitted by such source or that results in the emission of any air contam\u00ad inant not previously emitted. The term modification shall be construed consistent with the definition of modification in Section 7411, Title 42, United States Code, and with rules implementing that sect ion. (2) Permits shall be issued for a term of five years. A permit may be modified or amended during its term at the request of the permittee , or for any reason allowed by the federal clean air act. The rules adopted pursuant to subsec\u00ad tion (3) of this section shall include rules for permit amend\u00ad ments and modificat ions. (3)(a) Rules establishing the elements for a state-wide operating permit program and the process for permit applica\u00ad tion and renewal consistent with federal requirements shall be established by the department by January 1, 1993. The rules shall provide that every proposed permit must be reviewed prior to issuance by a professional engineer or staff under the direct supervision of a professional engineer in the employ of the permitting authority. The permit program established by these rules shall be administered by the department and delegated local air authorities. Rules developed under this subsection shall not preclude a delegat\u00ad ed local air authority from including in a permit its own more stringent emission standards and operating restrictions. (b) The board of any local air pollution control authority may apply to the department of ecology for a delegation order authori zing the local authority to administer the operating permit program for sources under that authority's jurisdiction. The departm ent shall, by order, approve such delegation, if the departme nt finds that the local authority has the technical and financial resources , to discharge the responsibilities of a permitting authority under the federal clean air act. A delegation request shall include adequate (1992 Ed.) information about the local authority's resources to enable the department to make the findings required by this subsec\u00ad tion; provided, any delegation order issued under this subsection shall take effect ninety days after the environmen\u00ad tal protection agency authorizes the local authority to issue operating permits under the federal clean air act. (c) Except for the authority granted the energy facility site evaluation council to issue permits for the new construc\u00ad tion, reconstruction, or enlargement or operation of new energy facilities under chapter 80.50 RCW, the departm ent may exercise the authority, as delegated by the environmen\u00ad tal protection agency, to administer Title IV of the federal clean air act as amended and to delegate such administration to local authorities as applicable pursuant to (b) of this subsection. (4) \"Best available control technol ogy\" (BACT) is required for new sources except where LAER is required. Until July 1, 1993, \"lowest achievable emission rate\" (LAER) is required solely for those sources required by the federal clean air act. By December 1, 1992, the department shall recommend control technology requirements for new sources to the appropriate standing committees of the legislature. Except as otherwise provided in RCW 70.94.331(9), \"reasonably available control technology\" (RACT) is required for existing sources. In establishing technical standards, defined in *subsec\u00ad tion (2) of this section, the permitting authority shall consid\u00ad er and, if found to be appropriate, give credit for waste reduction within the process. (5) Operating permits shall apply to all sources (a) where required by the federal clean air act, and (b) for any source that may cause or contribute to air pollution in such quantity as to create a threat to the public health or welfare. Subsection (b) of this subsection is not intended to apply to small businesses except when both of the following limita\u00ad tions are satisfied: (i) The source is in an area exceeding or threatening to exceed federal or state air quality standards; and (ii) the department provides a reasonable justifica tion that requiring a source to have a permit is necessary to meet a federal or state air quality standard, or to prevent exceed\u00ad ing a standard in an area threatening to exceed the standard . For purposes of this subsection \"areas threatening to exceed air quality standards\" shall mean areas projected by the department to exceed such standards within five years. Prior to identifying threatened areas the department shall hold a public hearing or hearings within the proposed areas. (6) Sources operated by government agencies are not exempt under this section. (7) By October 1, 1993, or ninety days after the United States environmental protection agency approves the state operating permit program , whichever is later, any person required to have a permit shall submit to the permitting agency a compliance plan and permit application, signed by a responsible official, certifying the accuracy of the informa\u00ad tion submitted. Until permits are issued, existing sources shall be allowed to operate under presently applicable standards and conditions provided that such sources submit complete and timely permit applications. (8) All proposed permits shall be subject to public notice and comment. The rules adopted pursuant to subsec\u00ad tion (3) of this section shall specify procedures for public [Title 70 RCW-page 147] 70.94.161 Title 70 RCW: Public Health and Safety notice and comment. Such procedures shall provide the permitting agency with an opportunity to respond to com\u00ad ments received from interested parties prior to the time that the proposed permit is submitted to the environmental protection agency for review pursuant to section 505(a) of the federal clean air act. In the event that the environmental protection agency objects to a proposed permit pursuant to section 505(b) of the federal clean air act, the permitti ng authority shall not issue the permit, unless the permittee consents to the changes required by the environmental protection agency. (9) The procedures contained in chapter 43.21B RCW shall apply to permit appeals. The pollution control hearings board may stay the effectiveness of any permit issued under this section during the pendency of an appeal filed by the permittee, if the permittee demonstrates that compliance with the permit during the pendency of the appeal would require significant expenditures that would not be necessary in the event that the permittee prevailed on the merits of the appeal. (10) After the effective date of any permit program promulgated under this section, it shall be unlawful for any person to: (a) Operate a permitted source in violation of any requirement of a permit issued under this section; or (b) fail to submit a permit application at the time required by rules adopted under subsection (3) of this section. (11) Each air operating permit shall state the origin of and specific legal authority for each requirement included therein. Every requirement in an operating permit shall be based upon the most stringent of the following requireme nts: (a) The federal clean air act and rules implementing that act, including provision of the approved state implementation plan; (b) This chapter and rules adopted thereunder; and (c) In permits issued by a local air pollution control authority, the requirements of any order or regulation adopted by that authority. ( 12) Consistent with the provisions of the federal clean air act, the permitting authority may issue general permits covering categories of permitted sources, and temporary permits authorizing emissions from similar operations at multiple temporary locations. (13) Permitted sources within the territorial jurisdiction of an authority delegated the operating permit program shall file their permit applications with that authority, except that permit applications for sources regulated on a state-wide basis pursuant to RCW 70.94.395 shall be filed with the department. Permitted sources outside the territorial jurisdic\u00ad tion of a delegated authority shall file their applications with the department. (14) When issuing operating permits to coal fired electtic generating plants, the permitting authority shall give consideration to the federal time lines for the implementation of required control technology. (15)(a) Each source emitting one hundred tons or more per year of a regulated pollutant shall pay an interim assessment of ten dollars per ton multiplied by the annual process-related emissions of each regulated pollutant emitted during calendar years 1990 and 1991. \"Regulated pollutant\" shall have the same meaning as defined in section 502(b) of the federal clean air act amendments of 1990. [Title 70 RCW-page 148] (b) Fees collected under (a) of this subsection shall be distributed as follows: Eighty percent to the department and twenty percent to local air authoriti es. (c) The fees assessed to a source under (a) of this subsection and any fees enacted under subsection (16) of this section shall be limited to the first seven thousand five hundred tons for each regulated pollutant per year. (16) On or before November 1, 1992, the department, in consultation with the department of revenue, shall report to the appropriate standing committees of the legislature recommenda tions on air operating permit fees. The depart\u00ad ment shall recommend a level of fees to cover the direct and indirect costs of implementing the operati ng permit program required under the 1990 federal clean air act. In making such recommendat ions, the department shall address: (a) The costs of the permit program elements as identified in regulations promulgated by the United States environmental protection agency, including, as applicable: (i) Oversight of a delegated local air authority ; (ii) Ambient air monitoring, modeling, and reporting; (iii) Training; (iv) Data management and quality assurance; (v) Development of state implementation plans; (vi) Emission inventor ies; (vii) Technical assistance; (viii) Rule making and guidelines; and (ix) Any other activities, consistent with the federal clean air act, that may be identified by the department; (b) The appropriate division of fees with delegated local air authorities; and (c) A methodology for tracking revenues and expendi\u00ad tures from fees paid under this chapter. ( 17) The department shall determine the persons liable for the fee imposed by subsection (15) of this section, compute the fee, and provide by November 1 of 1991 and 1992, the identity of the fee payer with the computation of the fee to the department of revenue for collection. The department of revenue shall collect the fee computed by the department from the fee payers identified by the department. The administ rative, collection, and penalty provisions of chapter 82.32 RCW shall apply to the collection of the fee by the department of revenue. The department shall provide technical assistance to the department of revenue for deci\u00ad sions made by the department of revenue pursuant to RCW 82.32.160 and 82.32.170. All fees collected shall be deposited in the air operating permit account. All fees identified in this section shall be due and payable on March 1 of 1992 and 1993. (18) For sources or source categories not required to obtain permits under subsection (5) of this section, the department or local authority may establish by rule control technology requireme nts. If control technology rule revi\u00ad sions are made by the departm ent or local authority under this subsection, the department or local authority shall consider the remaining useful life of control equipment previously installed on existing sources before requiring technology changes. The department or any local air authority may issue a general permit, as authorized under the federal clean air act, for such sources. (19) RCW 70.94.151 shall not apply to any source for which a permit under this section has been issued. [1991 c 199 \u00a7 301.] (1992 Ed.)

The application shall be accompanied by such information and data as the departm ent of ecology or board may require. The department of ecology or board may grant such variance, provided that variances to state rules shall require the departmen t's approval prior to being issued by a local authority board. The total time period for a variance and renewal of such variance shall not exceed one year. Variances may be issued by either the departm ent or a local board but only after public hearing or due notice, if the department or board finds that: (a) The emissions occurring or proposed to occur do not endanger public health or safety or the environment; and (b) Compliance with the rules or regulations from which variance is sought would produce serious hardship without equal or greater benefits to the public. (2) No variance shall be granted pursuant to this section until the department of ecology or board has considered the relative interests of the applicant, other owners of property likely to be affected by the discharges, and the general public. (3) Any variance or renewal thereof shall be granted within the requirements of subsection ( 1) of this section and (1992 Ed.) under conditions consistent with the reasons therefor, and within the following limitations: (a) If the variance is granted on the ground that there is no practicable means known or available for the adequate prevention, abatement or control of the pollution involved, it shall be only until the necessary means for prevention, abatement or control become known and available, and subject to the taking of any substitute or alternate measures that the departm ent of ecology or board may prescribe. (b) If the variance is granted on the ground that compli\u00ad ance with the particular requirement or requirements from which variance is sought will require the taking of measures which, because of their extent or cost, must be spread over a considerable period of time, it shall be for a period not to exceed such reasonable time as, in the view of the depart\u00ad ment of ecology or board is requisite for the taking of the necessa ry measures. A variance granted on the ground specified herein shall contain a timetable for the taking of action in an expeditious manner and shall be conditioned on adherence to such timetable. (c) If the variance is granted on the ground that it is justified to relieve or prevent hardship of a kind other than that provided for in (a) and (b) of this subsection, it shall be for not more than one year. (4) Any variance granted pursuant to this section may be renewed on terms and conditions and for periods which would be appropriate on initial granting of a variance. If complaint is made to the department of ecology or board on account of the variance, no renewal thereof shall be granted unless following a public hearing on the complaint on due notice the department or board finds that renewal is justified. No renewal shall be granted except on application therefor. Any such application shall be made at least sixty days prior to the expiration of the variance. Immediately upon receipt of an application for renewal, the department of ecology or board shall give public notice of such application in accor\u00ad dance with rules of the department of ecology or board. (5) A variance or renewal shall not be a right of the applicant or holder thereof but shall be granted at the discretion of the department of ecology or board. However, any applicant adversely affected by the denial or the terms and conditions of the granting of an application for a variance or renewal of a variance by the department of ecology or board may obtain judicial review thereof under the provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW as now or hereafter amended. (6) Nothing in this section and no variance or renewal granted pursuant hereto shall be construed to prevent or limit the application of the emergency provisions and procedures of RCW 70.94.710 through 70.94.730 to any person or his or her property. (7) An application for a variance, or for the renewal thereof, submitted to the department of ecology or board pursuant to this section shall be approved or disapproved by the department or board within sixty-five days of receipt unless the applicant and the department of ecology or board agree to a continuance. (8) Variances approved under this section shall not be included in orders or permits provide d for in RCW 70.94.161 or 70.94.152 until such time as the variance has been accepted by the United States environmental protection agency as part of an approved state impleme ntation plan.

See RCW 43.21A.060. 70.94.331 Powers and duties of department. (1) The department shall have all the powers as provided in RCW 70.94.141. (2) The department, in addition to any other powers vested in it by law after consideration at a public hearing held in accordance with chapters 42.30 and 34.05 RCW shall: (a) Adopt rules establishing air quality objectives and air quality standards ; (b) Adopt emission standards which shall constitute minimum emission standards throughout the state. An authority may enact more stringent emission standards, except for emission perform ance standards for new wood stoves and opacity levels for residential solid fuel burning devices which shall be state-wide, but in no event may less stringent standards be enacted by an authority without the prior approval of the department after public hearing and due _ notice to interested parties; [Title 70 RCW-page 151] 70.94.33 1 Title 70 RCW: Public Health and Safety (c) Adopt by rule air quality standards and emission standards for the control or prohibition of emissions to the outdoor atmosphere of radionuclides, dust, fumes, mist, smoke, other particulate matter, vapor, gas, odorous sub\u00ad stances, or any combination thereof. Such requirements may be based upon a system of classification by types of emis\u00ad sions or types of sources of emissions, or combinations thereof, which it determines most feasible for the purposes of this chapter. However, an industry, or the air pollution control authority having jurisdiction, can choose, subject to the submittal of appropriate data that the industry has quantified, to have any limit on the opacity of emissions from a source whose emission standard is stated in terms of a weight of particulate per unit volume of air (e.g., grains per dry standard cubic foot) be based on the applicable particulate emission standard for that source, such that any violation of the opacity limit accurately indicates a violation of the applicable particulate emission standard . Any alterna\u00ad tive opacity limit provided by this section that would result in increasing air contaminants emissio ns in any nonattainment area shall only be granted if equal or greater emission reductions are provided for by the same source obtaining the revised opacity limit. A reasonable fee may be assessed to the industry to which the alternate opacity standard would apply. The fee shall cover only those costs to the air pollution control authority which are directly related to the determination on the acceptability of the alternate opacity standard, including testing, oversight and review of data. (3) The air quality standards and emission standards may be for the state as a whole or may vary from area to area or source to source, except that emission performance standards for new wood stoves and opacity levels for residential solid fuel burning devices shall be state-wide, as may be appropriate to facilitate the accomplishment of the objectives of this chapter and to take necessary or desirable account of varying local conditions of population concentra\u00ad tion, the existence of actual or reasonably foreseeable air pollution, topographic and meteorologic conditions and other pertinent variables. ( 4) The department is directed to cooperate with the appropriate agencies of the United States or other states or any interstate agencies or international agencies with respect to the control of air pollution and air contamination, or for the formulation for the submission to the legislature of interstate air pollution control compacts or agreements. (5) The department is directed to conduct or cause to be conducted a continuous surveillance program to monitor the quality of the ambient atmosphere as to concentr ations and movements of air contaminants and conduct or cause to be conducted a program to determine the quantity of emissions to the atmosphere. (6) The department shall enforce the air quality stan\u00ad dards and emission standards throughout the state except where a local authority is enforcing the state regulations or its own regulations which are more stringent than those of the state. (7) The department shall encourage local units of government to handle air pollution problems within their respective jurisdictions; and, on a cooperative basis provide technical and consultative assistance therefor. [Title 70 RCW-page 152] (8) The department shall have the power to require the addition to or deletion of a county or counties from an existing authority in order to carry out the purposes of this chapter. No such addition or deletion shall be made without the concurrence of any existing authority involved. Such action shall only be taken after a public hearing held pursuant to the provisions of chapter 34.05 RCW. (9) The department shall establish rules requiring sources or source categories to apply reasonable and avail\u00ad able control methods. Such rules shall apply to those sources or source categories that individually or collectively contribute the majority of state-wide air emissions of each regulated pollutant. The department shall review, and if necessa ry, update its rules every five years to ensure consistency with current reasonable and available control methods. The department shall have adopted rules required under this subsection for all sources by July 1, 1996.

(1) Every activated authority operating an air pollution control program shall have requirements for the control of emissions which are no less stringent than those adopted by the department of ecology for the geographic area in which such air pollution control program is located. Less stringent requirements than compelled by this section may be included in a local or regional air pollution control program only after approval by the departm ent of ecology following demonst ration to the satisfaction of the department of ecology that the proposed requirements are consistent with the purposes of this chapter: PROVIDED , That such approval shall be preceded by public hearing, of which notice has been given in accordance with chapter 42.30 RCW. The department of ecology, upon receiving evidence that conditions have changed or that additional information is relevant to a decision with respect to the requirements for emission control, may, after public hearing on due notice, withdraw any approval previously given to a less stringent local or regional requirement. [(2)] Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent a local or regional air pollution control authority from adopting and enforcing more stringent emission control requirements than those adopted by the department of ecology and applicable within the jurisdict ion of the local or regional air pollution control authority, except that the emission performance standards for new wood stoves and the opacity levels for residential solid fuel burning devices shall be state-wide.

(2) To take all action necessary to secure to the state the benefits of the federal clean air act. [1987 c 109 \u00a7 70.94.521 Transportation demand management\u00ad Findings. The legislature finds that automotive traffic in Washingt on's metropolitan areas is the major source of emissions of air contaminants. This air pollution causes significant harm to public health, causes damage to trees, plants, structures, and materials and degrades the quality of the environment. Increasing automotive traffic is also aggravating traffic congestion in Washington 's metropolitan areas. This traffic [Title 70 RCW-page 159] 70.94.521 Title 70 RCW: Public Health and Safety congestion imposes significant costs on Washingto n's businesses, governmental agencies, and individuals in terms of lost working hours and delays in the delivery of goods and services. Traffic congestion worsens automobile-related air pollution, increases the consumption of fuel, and degrades the habitability of many of Washingt on's cities and suburban areas. The capital and environmental costs of fully accom\u00ad modating the existing and projected automobile traffic on roads and highways are prohibitive. Decreasing the demand for vehicle trips is significantly less costly and at least as effective in reducing traffic congestion and its impacts as constructing new transportation facilities such as roads and bridges, to accommodate increased traffic volumes. The legislature also finds that increasing automotive transportation is a major factor in increasing consumption of gasoline and, thereby, increasing reliance on imported sources of petroleum. Moderati ng the growth in automotive travel is essential to stabilizing and reducing dependence on imported petroleum and improving the nation's energy security. The legislature further finds that reducing the number of commute trips to work made via single-occupant cars and light trucks is an effective way of reducing automobile\u00ad related air pollution, traffic congestion, and energy use. Major employers have significant opportunities to encourage and facilitate reducing single-occupant vehicle commuting by employees. The intent of this chapter is to require local govern\u00ad ments in those counties experiencing the greatest automobile\u00ad related air pollution and traffic congestion to develop and implement plans to reduce single-occupant vehicle commute trips. Such plans shall require major employers and employ\u00ad ers at major worksites to implement programs to reduce single-occupant vehicle commuting by employees at major worksites.

(2) \"Major worksite\" means a building or group of buildings that are on physically contiguous parcels of land or on parcels separated solely by private or public roadways or rights of way, and at which there are one hundred or more full-time employees of one or more employers , who begin their regular work day between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. on weekday s, for at least twelve continuous months. (3) \"Commute trip reduction zones\" mean areas, such as census tracts or combinations of census tracts, within a jurisdiction that are characterized by similar employment density, population density, level of transit service, parking [Title 70 RCW--page 160] availability, access to high occupancy vehicle facilities, and other factors that are determined to affect the level of single occupancy vehicle commuting . (4) \"Commute trip\" means trips made from a worker's home to a worksite during the peak period of 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. on weekday s.

The legislature finds: (1) Continuing technological changes in methods of manufacture, packagi ng, and marketing of consumer prod\u00ad ucts, together with the economic and population growth of this state, the rising affluence of its citizens, and its expand\u00ad ing industrial activity have created new and ever- mounting problems involving disposal of garbage, refuse, and solid waste material s resulting from domestic, agricultural , and industrial activities. (2) Traditional methods of disposing of solid wastes in this state are no longer adequate to meet the ever-incr easing problem. Improper methods and practices of handling and disposal of solid wastes pollute our land, air and water resources, blight our countryside, adversely affect land values, and damage the overall quality of our environment. (3) Considerations of natural resource limitations, energy shortages, economics and the environment make necessary the development and implementation of solid waste recovery and/or recycling plans and program s. (4) Waste reduction must become a fundamental strategy of solid waste management. It is therefore neces\u00ad sary to change manufacturing and purchasing practices and waste generation behaviors to reduce the amount of waste that becomes a governmental responsibility. (5) Source separation of waste must become a funda\u00ad mental strategy of solid waste management. Collection and handling strategies should have, as an ultimate goal, the source separation of all materials with resource value or environmental hazard. (6)(a) It is the responsibility of every person to mini\u00ad mize his or her production of wastes and to separate recycla\u00ad ble or hazardous materials from mixed waste. (b) It is the responsibility of state, county, and city governments to provide for a waste management infrastruc\u00ad ture to fully implement waste reduction and source separa\u00ad tion strategies and to process and dispose of remaining wastes in a manner that is environmentally safe and econom\u00ad ically sound. It is further the responsibility of state, county, and city governments to monitor the cost-effectiveness and environment al safety of com busting separated waste, processing mixed waste, and recycling programs. [Title 70 RCW-page 173] 70.95.010 Title 70 RCW: Public Health and Safety (c) It is the responsibility of county and city govern\u00ad ments to assume primary responsibility for solid waste management and to develop and implement aggressive and effective waste reduction and source separation strategies. (d) It is the responsibility of state government to ensure that local governments are providing adequate source reduction and separation opportun ities and incentives to all, including persons in both rural and urban areas, and nonresi\u00ad dential waste generators such as commercial, industrial, and institutional entities, recognizing the need to provide flexibil\u00ad ity to accommodate differing population densities, distances to and availability of recycling markets, and collection and disposal costs in each community; and to provide county and city governments with adequate technical resources to accomplish this responsibility. (7) Environme ntal and economic conside rations in solving the state's solid waste management problems requires strong consideration by local governments of regional solutions and intergovernmental cooperation. (8) The following priorities for the collection, handling, and management of solid waste are necessary and should be followed in descending order as applicable: (a) Waste reduction; (b) Recycling, with source separation of recyclable materials as the preferred method; (c) Energy recovery, incineration, or landfill of separat\u00ad ed waste; (d) Energy recovery, incineration, or landfilling of mixed wastes. (9) It is the state's goal to achieve a fifty percent recycling rate by 1995. (10) Steps should be taken to make recycling at least as affordable and convenient to the ratepayer as mixed waste disposal. ( 11) It is necessary to compile and maintain adequate data on the types and quantities of solid waste that are being generated and to monitor how the various types of solid waste are being managed. (12) Vehicle batteries should be recycled and the disposal of vehicle batteries into landfills or incinerators should be discontinued. (13) Excessive and nonrecyclable packaging of products should be avoided. ( 14) Comprehensive education should be conducted throughout the state so that people are informed of the need to reduce, source separate, and recycle solid waste. (15) All governmental entities in the state should set an example by implementing aggressive waste reduction and recycling programs at their workplaces and by purchasing products that are made from recycled materials and are recyclable. (16) To ensure the safe and efficient operations of solid waste disposal facilities, it is necessary for operators and regulators of landfills and incinerators to receive training and certification. ( 17) It is necessary to provide adequate funding to all levels of government so that successful waste reduction and recycling programs can be implemented. (18) The development of stable and expanding markets for recyclable materials is critical to the long-term success of the state's recycling goals. Market development must be encouraged on a state, regiona l, and national basis to [Title 70 RCW-page 174) maximize its effectiveness. The state shall assume primary responsibility for the development of a multifaceted market development program to carry out the purposes of *this act. (19) There is an imperative need to anticipate, plan for, and accomplish effective storage, control, recovery, and recycling of discarded tires and other problem wastes with the subsequent conservation of resources and energy. [1989 c 431 \u00a7 1; 1985 431), see Codification Tables, Volume 0. 70.95.020 Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a comprehensive state-wide program for solid waste handling, and solid waste recovery and/or recycling which will prevent land, air, and water pollution and conserve the natural, economic, and energy resources of this state. To this end it is the purpose of this chapter: (1) To assign primary responsibility for adequate solid waste handling to local government, reserving to the state, however, those functions necessary to assure effective programs throughout the state; (2) To provide for adequate planning for solid waste handling by local government; (3) To provide for the adoption and enforcement of basic minimum performance standards for solid waste handling; (4) To provide technical and financial assistance to local governments in the planning, development, and conduct of solid waste handling program s; (5) To encourage storage, proper disposal, and recycling of discarded vehicle tires and to stimulate private recycling programs throughout the state. It is the intent of the legislature that local governments be encouraged to use the expertise of private industry and to contract with private industry to the fullest extent possible to carry out solid waste recovery and/or recycling programs.

The legislature finds that land disposal and incineration of solid and hazardous waste can be both harmful to the environment and costly to those who must dispose of the waste. In order to address this problem in the most cost-effective and environmentally sound manner, and to implement the highest waste manage\u00ad ment priority as articulated in RCW 70.95.010 and 70.105.150, public and private efforts should focus on reducing the generati on of waste. Waste reduction can be achieved by encouraging voluntary efforts to redesign industrial, commer cial, produc tion, and other processes to result in the reduction or elimination of waste byproducts and to maximize the in-process reuse or reclamation of valuable spent material. In the interest of protecting the public health, safety, and the environment, the legislature declares that it is the policy of the state of Washington to encourage reduction in the use of hazardous substances and reduction in the generation of hazardous waste whenever economically and technically practicable. The legislature finds that hazardous wastes are generated by numerous different sources including, but not limited to, large and small business, households, and state and local governme nt. The legislature further finds that a goal against which efforts at waste reduction may be measured is essential for an effective hazardous waste reduction program. The Pacific Northwest hazardous waste advisory council has endorsed a goal of reducing, through hazardous substance use reduction and waste reduction techniques, the generat ion of hazardous waste by fifty percent by 1995. The legislature adopts this as a policy goal for the state of Washington. The legislature recognizes that many individual businesses have already reduced the generation of hazardous waste through appropriate hazardo us waste reduction techniques. The legislature also recognizes that there are some basic industri\u00ad al processes which by their nature have limited potential for significantly reducing the use of certain raw materials or substantially reducing the generation of hazardous wastes. Therefore, the goal of reducing hazardous waste generat ion by fifty percent cannot be applied as a regulatory require\u00ad ment. [1990 c 114 \u00a7 1; RCW 70.95E.900. 70.95C.020 Definitions.

Reviser's note: Throughout this chapter \"this act\" has been translated to \"this chapter. \" This act [1972 ex.s. c 122] consists of chapter 70.96A RCW, the amendment of RCW and support act: Chapter 74.50 RCW. 70.96A.010 Declaration of policy. It is the policy of this state that alcoholics and intoxicated persons may not be subjected to criminal prosecution solely because of their consumption of alcoholic beverages but rather should, within available funds, be afforded a continuum of treatment in order that they may lead normal lives as productive members of society. Within available funds, treatment should also be provided for drug addicts.

The legi slature finds that the use of alcohol and other drugs has become a serious threat to the health of the citizens of the state of Washingt on. The use of psychoactive chemicals has been found to be a prime factor in the current AIDS epidemic. Therefore, a comprehe nsive statute to deal with alcoholism and other drug addiction is necessary. The legislature agrees with the 1987 resolution of the American Medical Association that endorses the proposition that all chemical depende ncies, including alcoholism, are diseases. It is the intent of the legislature to end the sharp distinctions between alcoholism services and other drug addiction services, to recognize that chemical dependency is a disease, and to insure that prevention and treatment services are available and are of high quality. It is the purpose of this chapter to provide the financial assistance [Title 70 RCW--page 212] necessa ry to enable the department of social and health services to provide a discrete program of alcoholism and other drug addiction services.

[1991 c 364 \u00a7 8; 1990 c 151 \u00a7 2. \u00a7 305; 1989 2.] Findings-1991 c 364: \"The legislature finds that the use of alcohol and illicit drugs continues to be a primary crippler of our youth. This translates into incredible costs to individuals, families, and society in terms of traffic fatalities, suicides, criminal activity including homicides , sexual promiscuity, familial incorrigibility, and conduct disorders, and educational fallout. Among children of all socioeconomic groups lower expectations for the future, low motivation and self-estee m, alienati on, and depression are associated with alcohol and drug abuse. Studies reveal that deaths from alcohol and other drug-related injuries rise sharply through adolescence, peaking in the early twenties. But second peak occurs in later life, where it accounts for three times as many deaths from chronic diseases. A young victim's life expectancy is likely to be reduced by an average of twenty-six years. Yet the cost of treating alcohol and drug addicts can be recouped in the first three years of abstinence in health care savings alone. Public money spent on treatment saves not only the life of the chemical abuser, it makes us safer as individuals, and in the long-run costs less. The legislature further fmds that many children who abuse alcohol and other drugs may not require involun tary treatment, but still are not adequately served. These children remain at risk for future chemical dependency, and may become mentally ill or a juvenile offender or need out-of-home placement. Children placed at risk because of chemical abuse may be better served by the creation of a compreh ensive integrated system for children in crisis. The legislature declares that an emphasis on the treatment of youth will pay the largest dividend in terms of preventable costs to individuals themselves, their families, and to society. The provision of augmented involuntary alcohol treatment services to youths, as well as involuntary treatment for youths addicted by other drugs, is in the interest of the public health and saf ety.\" [1991 \"The purpose of sections 7 through 12 of this act is solely to provide authority for the involun tary commitment of minors addicted by drugs within available funds and current programs and facilities. Nothing in sections 7 through 12 of this act shall be construed to require the addition of new facilities nor affect the (1992 Ed.) departm ent's authority for the uses of existing programs and facilities authorized by law. Nothing in sections 7 through 12 of this act shall prevent a parent or guardian from requesting the involuntary commitment of a minor through a county designated chemical dependency specialist on an ability to pay basis.\" [1991 c 364 \u00a7 13.] Conflict with federal requirements- 1991 c 364: \"If any part of this act is found to be in conflict with federal requirements that are a prescribed condition to the allocation of federal funds to the state, the conflicting part of this act is inopera tive solely to the extent of the conflict and with respect to the agencies directly affected, and this finding does not affect the operation of the remainder of this act in its applica tion to the agencies concerned. The rules under this act shall meet federal require\u00ad ments that are a necessary condition to the receipt of federal funds by the state.\" [1991 c 364 9.94A.310. 70.96A.030 Chemical dependency program. A discrete program of chemical dependency is establ ished within the department of social and health services, to be administered by a qualified person who has training and experience in handling alcoholism and other drug addiction problems or the organization or administration of treatment services for persons suffering from alcoholism or other drug addiction problems.

The secretary shall adopt and may amend and repeal rules for acceptance of persons into the appro ved treatment program, considering available treatment resources and facilities, for the purpose of early and effective treatment of alcoholics and other drug addicts, persons incapacitated by alcohol or other psychoactive chemicals, and intoxica ted persons. In establishing the rules, the secretary shall be guided by the following standards: (1) If possible a patient shall be treated on a voluntary rather than an involunt ary basis. (2) A patient shall be initially assigned or transferred to outpatient treatment, unless he or she is found to require residential treatment. (3) A person shall not be denied treatment solely because he or she has withdrawn from treatment against medical advice on a prior occasion or because he or she has relapsed after earlier treatment. ( 4) An individualized treatment plan shall be prepared and maintained on a current basis for each patient. (5) Provision shall be made for a continuum of coordi\u00ad nated treatment services, so that a person who leaves a facility or a form of treatment will have available and use other appropriate treatment.

( 1) An alcoholic or other drug addict may apply for voluntary treatment directly to an approved treatment program . If the proposed patient is a minor or an incompetent person, he or she, a parent, a legal guardian, or other legal representative may make the application. (2) Subject to rules adopted by the secretary, the administr ator in charge of an approved treatment program may determine who shall be admitted for treatment. If a person is refused admission to an approved treatment program, the administr ator, subject to rules adopted by the secretary, shall refer the person to another approved treat\u00ad ment program for trea tment if possible and appropriate. (3) If a patient receiving inpatient care leaves an approved treatment program, he or she shall be encouraged to consent to appropriate outpatient treatment. If it appears (1992 Ed.) Title 70 RCW: Publ ic Health and Safety 70.96A.ll0 to the administrator in charge of the treatment program that the patient is an alcoholic or other drug addict who requires help, the department may arrange for assistance in obtaining supporti ve services and residential programs. (4) If a patient leaves an approved public treatment program, with or against the advice of the administrator in charge of the program, the department may make reasonable provisions for his or her transportation to another program or to his or her home. If the patient has no home he or she should be assisted in obtaining shelter. If the patient is less than fourteen years of age or an incompetent person the request for discharge from an inpatient program shall be made by a parent, legal guardian, or other legal representa\u00ad tive or by the minor or incompetent if he or she was the original applicant.

A person who appears to be intoxicated in a public place and to be in need of help, if he or she consents to the proffered help, may be assisted to his or her home, an approved treatment program or other health facility. (2) Except for a person who may be apprehended for possible violation of laws not relating to alcoholism, drug addiction, or intoxication and except for a person who may be apprehended for possible violation of laws relating to driving or being in physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug and except for a person who may wish to avail himself or herself of the provisions of RCW 46.20.308, a person who appears to be incapacitated or gravely disabled by alcohol or other drugs and who is in a public place or who has threatened, attempt\u00ad ed, or inflicted physical harm on himself, herself, or another, shall be taken into protective custody by a peace officer or staff designated by the county and as soon as practicable, but in no event beyond eight hours brought to an approved treatment program for treatment. If no approved treatment program is readily available he or she shall be taken to an emergency medical service customarily used for incapacitat\u00ad ed persons. The peace officer or staff designated by the county, in detaining the person and in taking him or her to an approved treatment program, is taking him or her into protective custody and shall make every reasonable effort to protect his or her health and safety. In taking the person into protective custody, the detaining peace officer or staff designated by the county may take reasonable steps includ\u00ad ing reasonable force if necessary to protect himself or herself or effect the custody. A taking into protective custody under this section is not an arrest. No entry or other record shall be made to indicate that the person has been arrested or charged with a crime. (3) A person who comes voluntarily or is brought to an approved treatment program shall be examined by a qualified person. He or she may then be admitted as a patient or referred to another health facility, which provides emergency medical treatment, where it appears that such treatment may be necessary. The referring approved treatment program shall arrange for his or her transporta tion. (1992 Ed.) ( 4) A person who is found to be incapacitated or gravely disabled by alcohol or other drugs at the time of his or her admission or to have become incapacitated or gravely disabled at any time after his or her admission, may not be detained at the program for more than seventy-two hours after admission as a patient, unless a petition is filed under RCW 70.96A.l40, as now or hereafter amended: PROVID\u00ad ED, That the treatment personnel at an approved treatment program are authorized to use such reasonable physical restraint as may be necessary to retain an incapacitated or gravely disabled person for up to seventy-two hours from the time of admission.

A person may consent to remain in the program as long as the physician in charge believes appropriate. (5) A person who is not admitted to an approved treatment program, is not referred to another health facility, and has no funds, may be taken to his or her home, if any. If he or she has no home, the approved treatment program shall provide him or her with information and assistance to access available community shelter resources. (6) If a patient is admitted to an approved treatment program, his or her family or next of kin shall be notified as promptly as possible by the treatment program. If an adult patient who is not incapacitated requests that there be no notification, his or her request shall be respected. (7) The peace officer, staff designated by the county, or treatment facility personnel, who act in compliance with this chapter and are performing in the course of their official duty are not criminally or civilly liable therefor. (8) If the person in charge of the approved treatment program determines that appropri ate treatment is available, the patient shall be encouraged to agree to further diagnosis and appropriate voluntary treatment.

( 1) When a designated chemical dependency specialist receives information alleging that a person is incapacitated as a result of alcoho lism, or in the case of a minor incapaci\u00ad tated by alcoholism and/or other drug addiction, the designat\u00ad ed chemical dependency specialist, after investigation and evaluation of the specific facts alleged and of the reliability and credibility of the informat ion, may file a petition for commitment of such person with the superior court or district court. If the designated chemical dependency specialist finds that the initial needs of such person would be better served by placement within the mental health system, the person shall be referred to an evaluation and treatment facility as defined in RCW 71.05.020 or 71.34.020. If placement in an alcohol treatment program is available and deemed appropriate, the petition shall allege that: The person is an alcoholic who is incapacitated by alcohol, or in the case of a minor incapacitated by alcoholism and/or other drug addiction, or that the person has twice before in the preceding twelve months been admitted for detoxification or treatment for alcoholism pursuant to RCW 70.96A.110, or in [Title 70 RCW-page 217] 70.96A.140 Title 70 RCW: Public Health and Safety the case of a minor, detoxification or treatment for alcohol or drug addiction, and is in need of a more sustained treatment program, or that the person is an alcoholic, or in the case of a minor, an alcoholic or other drug addict, who has threatened, attempted, or inflicted physical harm on another and is likely to inflict physical harm on another unless committed. A refusal to undergo treatment, by itself, does not constitute evidence of lack of judgment as to the need for treatment. The petition shall be accompanied by a certificate of a licensed physician who has examined the person within five days before submission of the petition, unless the person whose commitment is sought has refused to submit to a medical examination, in which case the fact of refusal shall be alleged in the petition. The certificate shall set forth the licensed physician 's findings in support of the allegations of the petition. A physician employed by the petitioning program or the department is eligible to be the certifying physician. (2) Upon filing the petition, the court shall fix a date for a hearing no less than two and no more than seven days after the date the petition was filed unless the person petitioned against is presently being detained in a program , pursuant to RCW 70.96A.120, 71.05.210, or 71.34.050, as now or hereafter amended, in which case the hearing shall be held within seventy-two hours of the filing of the petition: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That the above specified seventy\u00ad two hours shall be computed by excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays: PROVIDED FURTHER, That, the court may, upon motion of the person whose commitment is sought, or upon motion of petitioner with written permission of the person whose commitment is sought, or his or her counsel and, upon good cause shown, extend the date for the hearing. A copy of the petition and of the notice of the hearing, including the date fixed by the court, shall be served by the designated chemical dependency specialist on the person whose commitment is sought, his or her next of kin, a parent or his or her legal guardian if he or she is a minor, and any other person the court believes advisable. A copy of the petition and certificate shall be delivered to each person notified. (3) At the hearing the court shall hear all relevant testimony, including, if possible, the testimony, which may be telephonic, of at least one licensed physician who has examined the person whose commitment is sought. Commu\u00ad nications otherwise deemed privileged under the laws of this state are deemed to be waived in proceedings under this chapter when a court of competent jurisdiction in its discre\u00ad tion determines that the waiver is necessary to protect either the detained person or the public. The waiver of a privilege under this section is limited to records or testimony relevant to evaluation of the detained person for purposes of a proceeding under this chapter. Upon motion by the detained person, or on its own motion, the court shall examine a record or testimony sought by a petitioner to determine whether it is within the scope of the waiver. The record maker shall not be required to testify in order to introduce medical, nursing, or psychological records of detained persons so long as the requirements of RCW 5.45.020 are met, except that portions of the record that contain opinions as to whether the detained person is an alcoholic, or in the case of a minor incapacitated by alcohol\u00ad ism and/or other drug addiction, must be deleted from the [Title 70 RCW-page 218] records unless the person offering the opinions is available for cross-examination. The person shall be present unless the court believes that his or her presence is likely to be injurious to him or her; in this event the court may deem it appropriate to appoint a guardian ad litem to represent him or her throughout the proceedi ng. If deemed advisable, the court may examine the person out of courtroom. If the person has refused to be examined by a licensed physician, he or she shall be given an opportunity to be examined by a court appointed licensed physician. If he or she refuses and there is sufficient evidence to believe that the allegations of the petition are true, or if the court believes that more medical evidence is necessa ry, the court may make a temporary order committing him or her to the department for a period of not more than five days for purposes of a diagnostic examinat ion. (4) If after hearing all relevant evidence, including the results of any diagnostic examination, the court finds that grounds for involuntary commitment have been established by clear, cogent, and convincing proof, it shall make an order of commitment to an approved treatment program. It shall not order commitment of a person unless it determines that an approved treatment program is available and able to provide adequate and appropriate treatment for him or her. (5) A person committed under this section shall remain in the program for treatment for a period of sixty days unless sooner discharged. At the end of the sixty-day period, he or she shall be discharged automatically unless the program, before expiration of the period, files a petition for his or her recommitment upon the grounds set forth in subsection (1) of this section for a further period of ninety days unless sooner discharged. If a person has been committed because he or she is an alcoholic, or, in the case of a minor, an alcoholic or other drug addict, likely to inflict physical harm on another, the program shall apply for recommitment if after examination it is determined that the likelihood still exists. (6) Upon the filing of a petition for recommitment under subsection (5) of this section, the court shall fix a date for hearing no less than two and no more than seven days after the date the petition was filed: PROVIDED, That, the court may, upon motion of the person whose commitment is sought and upon good cause shown, extend the date for the hearing. A copy of the petition and of the notice of hearing, including the date fixed by the court, shall be served by the treatment program on the person whose commitment is sought, his or her next of kin, the original petitioner under subsection (1) of this section if different from the petitioner for recommitment, one of his or her parents or his or her legal guardian if he or she is a minor, and his or her attorney and any other person the court believes advisable. At the hearing the court shall proceed as provided in subsection (3) of this section. (7) The approved treatment program shall provide for adequate and appropriate treatment of a person committed to its custody. A person committed under this section may be transferred from one approved public treatment program to another if transfer is medically advisable. (8) A person committed to the custody of a program for treatment shall be discharged at any time before the end of the period for which he or she has been committed and he (1992 Ed.) Title 70 RCW: Public Health and Safety 70.96A.140 or she shall be discharged by order of the court if either of the following conditions are met: (a) In case of an alcoholic committed on the grounds of likelihood of infliction of physical harm upon himself, herself, or another, or, in the case of a minor, an alcoholic or other drug addict, the likelihood no longer exists; or further treatment will not be likely to bring about significant improvement in the person's condition, or treatment is no longer adequate or appropriate. (b) In case of an alcoholic committed on the grounds of the need of treatment and incapacity or, in the case of a minor, incapacitated by alcoholism and/or other drug addiction, that the incapacity no longer exists. (9) The court shall inform the person whose commit\u00ad ment or recommitment is sought of his or her right to contest the application, be represented by counsel at every stage of any proceedings relating to his or her commitment and recommitment, and have counsel appointed by the court or provided by the court, if he or she wants the assistance of counsel and is unable to obtain counsel. If the court believes that the person needs the assistance of counsel, the court shall require, by appointment if necessary, counsel for him or her regardless of his or her wishes. The person shall, if he or she is financially able, bear the costs of such legal service; otherwise such legal service shall be at public expense. The person whose commitment or recommitment is sought shall be informed of his or her right to be exam\u00ad ined by a licensed physician of his or her choice. If the person is unable to obtain a licensed physician and requests examin ation by a physician, the court shall employ a licensed physician. (1 0) A person committed under this chapter may at any time seek to be discharged from commitment by writ of habeas corpus in a court of competent jurisdiction. ( 11) The venue for proceedings under this section is the county in which person to be committed resides or is present. (12) When in the opinion of the professional person in charge of the program providing involuntary treatment under this chapter, the committed patient can be appropriately served by less restrictive treatment before expiration of the period of commitment, then the less restrictive care may be required as a condition for early release for a period which, when added to the initial treatment period, does not exceed the period of commitment. If the program designated to provide the less restrictive treatment is other than the program providing the initial involuntary treatment, the program so designated must agree in writing to assume such responsibility. A copy of the conditions for early release shall be given to the patient, the designated chemica l dependency specialist of original commitment, and the court of original commitment. The program designated to provide less restrictive care may modify the conditions for continued release when the modifications are in the best interests of the patient. If the program providing less restrictive care and the designated chemical dependency specialist determine that a conditionally released patient is failing to adhere to the terms and conditions of his or her release, or that substantial deterioration in the patient's functioning has occurr ed, then the designated chemical dependency specialist shall notify the court of original commitment and request a hearing to be held no less than two and no more than seven days after the (1992 Ed.) date of the request to determine whether or not the person should be returned to more restrictive care. The designated chemical dependency specialist shall file a petition with the court stating the facts substantiating the need for the hearing along with the treatment recommendat ions. The patient shall have the same rights with respect to notice, hearing, and counsel as for the original involuntary treatment proceedings. The issues to be determined at the hearing are whether the conditionally released patient did or did not adhere to the terms and conditions of his or her release to less restrictive care or that substantial deterioration of the patient's function\u00ad ing has occurred and whether the conditions of release should be modified or the person should be returned to a more restrictive program. The hearing may be waived by the patient and his or her counsel and his or her guardian or conservator, if any, but may not be waived unless all such persons agree to the waiver. Upon waiver, the person may be returned for involunt ary treatment or continued on conditional release on the same or modified conditions.

Uranium and Chapter 70.121 RCW. 70.99.010 Finding. The people of the state of Washington find that: (1) Radioactive wastes are highly dangerous, in that releases of radioactive materials and emissions to the environment are inimical to the health and welfare of the people of the state of Washington, and contribute to the occurrences of harmful diseases, including excessive cancer and leukemia. The dangers posed by the transportati on and presence of radioactive wastes are increased further by the long time periods that the wastes remain radioactive and highly dangerous; (2) Transporting, handling, storing, or otherwise caring for radioactive waste presents a hazard to the health, safety, and welfare of the individual citizens of the state of Wash\u00ad ington because of the ever-present risk that an accident or incident will occur while the wastes are being cared for; [Title 70 RCW-page 227] 70.99.010 Title 70 RCW: Public Health and Safety (3) The likelihood that an accident will occur in this state involving the release of radioactive wastes to the environment becomes greater as the volume of wastes transported, handled, stored, or otherw ise cared for in this state increase s; (4) The effects of unplanned releases of radioactive wastes into the environment, especially into the air and water of the state, are potentially both widespread and harmful to the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of this state. The burdens and hazards posed by increasing the volume of radioactive wastes transported, handled, stored, or otherwise cared for in this state by the importation of such wastes from outside this state is not a hazard the state government may reasonably ask its citizens to bear. The people of the state of Washington believe that the principles of federalism do not require the sacrifice of the health, safety, and welfare of the people of one state for the conven ience of other states or nations.

Transport of hazardous materials, state patrol authority over: Chapter 46.48 RCW. 70.105.005 Legislative declaration. The legislature hereby finds and declares: ( 1) The health and welfare of the people of the state depend on clean and pure environmental resources unaffect\u00ad ed by hazardous waste contamination. At the same time, the quality of life of the people of the state is in part based upon a large variety of goods produced by the economy of the state. The complex industrial processes that produce these goods also generate waste byproducts, some of which are hazard ous to the public health and the environment if improperly managed . (2) Safe and responsible management of hazardous waste is necessary to prevent adverse effects on the environ\u00ad ment and to protect public health and safety. (3) The availability of safe, effective, economical , and environmentally sound facilities for the management of hazardous waste is essential to protect public health and the environment and to preserve the economic strength of the state. (4) Strong and effective enforcement of federal and state hazardous waste laws and regulations is essential to protect [Title 70 RCW-page 234] the public health and the environment and to meet the public's concerns regarding the acceptance of needed new hazardous waste management facilities. (5) Negotiat ion, mediation, and similar conflict resolu\u00ad tion techniques are useful in resolving concerns over the l?cal impacts of siting hazardous waste management facili\u00ad ties. (6) Safe and respon sible management of hazardous waste requires an effective planning process that involves local and state governments , the public, and industry. (7) Public acceptance and successf ul siting of needed new hazardous waste management facilities depends on several factors, including: (a) Public confidence in the safety of the facilities; (b) Assurance that the hazardous waste management priorities established in this chapter are being carried out to the maximum degree practical; (c) Recognition that all state citizens benefit from certain products whose manufacture results in the generation of hazardo us byproducts, and that all state citizens must, therefore, share in the responsibility for finding safe and effective means to manage this hazardous waste; and (d) Provision of adequate opportu nities for citizens to meet with facility operators and resolve concerns about local hazardous waste management facilities. \u00b7 (8) Due to the controversial and regional nature of facilities for the disposal and incineration of hazardous waste, the facilities have had difficulty in obtaining neces\u00ad sary local approv als. The legislature finds that there is a state-wide interest in assuring that such facilities can be sited. It is therefore the intent of the legislature to preempt local governm ent's authority to approve, deny, or othe rwise regulate disposal and incineration facilities, and to vest in the depart ment of ecology the sole authority among state, regional , and local agencies to approve, deny, and regulate preempted facilities, as defined in this chapter. In addition, it is the intent of the legislature that such complete preemptive authority also be vested in the depart\u00ad ment for treatment and storage facilities, in addition to diposal and incineration facilities, if a local government falls to carry out its responsibilities established in RCW 70.105.225. It is further the intent of the legislature that no local ordinance, permit requirement, other requirement, or decision shall prohibit on the basis of land use considerations the construction of a hazardous waste management facility within any zone designated and approved in accordance with this chapter, provided that the proposed site for the facility is consistent with applicable state siting criteria. (9) With the exception of the disposal site authorized for acquisition under this chapter, the private sector has had the primary role in providing hazardous waste management facilities and services in the state. It is the intent of the legislature that this role be encouraged and continue into the future to the extent feasible. Whether privately or publicly owned and operated, hazardo us waste management facilities and services should be subject to strict governmental regulation as provided under this chapter. (1 0) Wastes that are exempt or excluded from full regulation under this chapter due to their small quantity or household origin have the potential to pose significant risk (1992 Ed.) Title 70 RCW: Public Health and Safety 70.105.005 to public health and the environment if not properly man\u00ad aged. It is the intent of the legislature that the specific risks posed by such waste be investigated and assessed and that programs be carried out as necessary to manage the waste appropriate ly. In addition, the legislature finds that, because local conditions vary substantially in regard to the quantities, risks, and management opportu nities available for such wastes, local government is the appropriate level of govern\u00ad ment to plan for and carry out programs to manage moder\u00ad ate-risk waste, with assistance and coordination provided by the [1985 c 448 \u00a7 2.] Severability-1985 c 448: \"If any provision of this act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other persons or circumstances is not affected.\" [1985 c 448 \u00a7 19.] 70.105.007 Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a comprehensive state-wide framework for the planning, regulation, control, and management of hazardous waste which will prevent land, air, and water pollution and conserve the natural, economic, and energy resources of the state. To this end it is the purpose of this chapter: ( 1) To provide broad powers of regulation to the department of ecology relating to management of hazardous wastes and releases of hazardous substances; (2) To promote waste reduction and to encourage other improvements in waste management practices; (3) To promote cooperation between state and local governments by assigning responsibilities for planning for hazardous wastes to the state and planning for moderate-risk waste to local government;. (4) To provide for prevention of problems related to improper management of hazardous substanc es before such problems occur; and (5) To assure that needed hazardous waste management facilities may be sited in the state, and to ensure the safe operation of the facilities.

(1) Each person has a fundamental and inalienable right to a healthful environment, and each person has a responsibilit y to pre\u00ad serve and enhance that right. The beneficial stewardship of the land, air, and waters of the state is a solemn obligation of the present generation for the benefit of future genera\u00ad tions. (2) A healthful environment is now threatened by the irresponsible use and disposal of hazardous substances. There are hundreds of hazardous waste sites in this state, and [Title 70 RCW-page 244] more will be created if current waste practices continue. Hazardous waste sites threaten the state's water resource s, including those used for public drinking water. Many of our municipal landfills are current or potential hazardous waste sites and present serious threats to human health and environment. The costs of eliminating these threats in many cases are beyond the financial means of our local govern\u00ad ments and ratepayers. The main purpose of *this act is to raise sufficient funds to clean up all hazardous waste sites and to prevent the creation of future hazards due to improper disposal of toxic wastes into the state's land and waters. (3) Many farmers and small business owners who have followed the law with respect to their uses of pesticides and other chemicals nonetheless may face devastating economic consequences because their uses have contamina ted the environment or the water supplies of their neighbors. With a source of funds, the state may assist these farmers and business owners, as well as those persons who sustain damages, such as the loss of their drinking water supplies, as a result of the contaminati on. ( 4) Because it is often difficult or impossible to allocate responsibility among persons liable for hazardous waste sites and because it is essential that sites be cleaned up well and expeditiously, each responsible person should be liable jointly and severally.

Short title. 70.107.010 Purpose. The legislature finds that inadequately controlled noise adversely affects the health, safety ad welfare of the people, the value of property, and the quality of the environment.

The legislature hereby finds that an adequate supply of potable water for domestic, commercial, and industrial use is vital to the health and well-being of the people of the state . Readily available water for use in public water systems is limited and should [Title 70 RCW-page 258] be developed and used efficiently with a minimum of loss or waste. In order to maximize efficient and effective develop \u00ad ment of the state's public water supply systems, the depart\u00ad ment of health shall assist water purveyors by providing a procedure to coordinate the planning of the public water supply systems. [1991 c 3 \u00a7 365; 1977 ex.s. c 142 \u00a7 1.] 70.116.020 Declaration of purpose. The purposes of this chapter are: (1) To provide for the establishment of critical water supply service areas related to water utility planning and development; (2) To provide for the development of minimum planning and design standards for critical water supply service areas to insure that water systems developed in these areas are consistent with regional needs; (3) To assist in the orderly and efficient administration of state financial assistance programs for public water systems; and (4) To assist public water systems to meet reasonable standards of quality, quantity and pressure. [1977 ex.s. c 142 \u00a7 2.] 70.116.030 Definitions. Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the following terms when used in this chapter shall be defined as follows: (1) \"Coordinated water system plan\" means a plan for public water systems within a critical water supply service area which identifies the present and future needs of the systems and sets forth means for meeting those needs in the most efficient manner possible. Such a plan shall include provisions for subsequently updating the plan. In areas where more than one water system exists, a coordinated plan may consist of either: (a) A new plan developed for the area following its designation as a critical water supply service area; or (b) a compilation of compatible water system plans existing at the time of such designation and containing such supplement ary provisions as are necessary to satisfy the requirements of this chapter. Any such coordinated plan must include provisions regarding: Future service area designat ions; assessment of the feasibility of shared source, transmission, and storage facilities; emergency inter-ties; design standards; and other concerns related to the construc\u00ad tion and operation of the water system facilities. (2) \"Critical water supply service area\" means a geo\u00ad graphical area which is characterized by a proliferation of small, inadequate water systems, or by water supply prob\u00ad lems which threaten the present or future water quality or reliability of service in such a manner that efficient and orderly development may best be achieved through coordi\u00ad nated planning by the water utilities in the area. (3) \"Public water system\" means any system providing water intended for, or used for, human consumption or other domestic uses. It includes, but is not limited to, the source, treatment for purifying purposes only, storage, transmission, pumping, and distribution facilities where water is furnished to any community, or number of individuals, or is made available to the public for human consumption or domestic use, but excluding water systems serving one single family residence. However, systems existing on September 21, (1992 Ed.) Title 70 RCW: Public Health and Safety 70.116.030 1977 which are owner operated and serve less than ten single family residences or which serve only one industrial plant shall be excluded from this definition and the provi\u00ad sions of this chapter. (4) \"Purveyor\" means any agency or subdivision of the state or any municipal corporation, firm, company, mutual or cooperative association, institution, partnership, or person or any other entity, that owns or operates for wholesale or retail service a public water system. It also means the authorized agents of any such entities. (5) \"Secretary\" means the secretary of the department of health or the secretary's authorized representative. (6) \"Service area\" means a specific geographical area serviced or for which service is planned by a purveyor. [1991 c 3 \u00a7 366; 1977 ex.s. c amendment of external bounda ries-Procedures. ( 1) The secretary and the appropriate local planning agencies and purveyors, shall study geographical areas where water supply problems related to uncoordinated planning, inadequate water quality or unreliable service appear to exist. If the results of the study indicate that such water supply problems do exist, the secretary or the county legislative authority shall designa te the area involved as being a critical water supply service area, consult with the appropriate local planning agencies and purveyors, and appoint a commit tee of not less than three representatives therefro m solely for the purpose of establishing the proposed external boundaries of the critical water supply service area. The committee shall include a representative from each purveyor serving more than fifty customers, the county legislative authority, county planning agency, and health agencies. Such proposed boundaries shall be established within six months of the appointment of the committee. \u00b7 During the six month period following the establishment of the proposed external boundaries of the critical water supply services areas, the county legislative authority shall conduct public hearings on the proposed boundaries and shall modify or ratify the proposed boundaries in accordance with the findings of the public hearings. The boundaries shall reflect the existing land usage, and permitted densities in county plans, ordinances, and/or growth policies. If the proposed boundaries are not modified during the six month period, the proposed boundaries shall be automa tically ratified and be the critical water supply service area. After establishment of the external boundaries of the critical water supply service area, no new public water systems may be approved within the boundary area unless an existing water purveyor is unable to provide water service. (2) At the time a critical water supply service area is established, the external boundar ies for such area shall not include any fractional part of a purveyo r's existing contigu\u00ad ous service area. (3) The external boundaries of the critical water supply service area may be amended in accordance with procedures prescribed in subsection (I) of this section for the establish\u00ad ment of the critical water supply service areas when such amendment is necessary to accomp lish the purposes of this chapter.

(c) Incorporate e fire protection standards developed pursuant to RCW 70.116.080. (d) Identif y the future service area boundaries of the public water system or systems included in the plan within the critical water supply service area. (e) Identify feasible emergency inter-ties between adjacent purveyors . (5) If a \"water general plan\" for a critical water supply service area or portion thereof has been prepared pursuant to chapter 36.94 RCW and such a plan meets the require ments of subsections (1) and (4) of this section, such a plan shall [Title 70 RCW-page 259] 70.116.050 Title 70 RCW: Public Health and Safety constitute the coordinated water system plan for the applica\u00ad ble geographical area. (6) Prior to the submission of a coordina ted water system plan to the secretary for approval of the design of the proposed facilities pursuant to RCW 70.116.060, the plan shall be reviewed for consistency with subsection (4) of this section by the legislative authorities of the counties in which the critical water supply service area is located. If within sixty days of receipt of the plan, the legislative authorities find any segment of a proposed service area of a purveyor' s plan or any segment of the coordinated water system plan to be inconsistent with any current land use plans, shoreline master programs, and/or developmental policies of the general purpose local government or governments whose jurisdiction the water system plan affects, the secretary shall not approve that portion of the plan until the inconsistency is resolved between the local government and the purveyor. If no comments have been received from the legislative authorities within sixty days of receipt of the plan, the secretary may consider the plan for approval. [1977 ex.s. c 142 \u00a7 5.] 70.116.060 Approval of coordinated water system plan-Limitations following approval. (1) A coordinated water system plan shall be submitted to the secretary for design approval within two years of the establishment of the boundaries of a critical water supply service area. (2) The secretary shall not approve those portions of a coordin ated water system plan which fail to meet the requirements for future service area boundaries as set forth in RCW 70.116.070. (3) Following the approval of a coordin ated water system plan by the secretary : (a) All purveyors constructing or proposing to construct public water system facilities within the area covered by the plan shall comply with the plan. (b) No other purveyor shall establish a public water system within the area covered by the plan, unless the secretary determines that existing purveyors are unable to provide the service. If such a determination is made, the secretary may require the new public water system to be constructed in accordance with the construction standards and specifications embodied in the coordinated water system plan approved for the area. ( 4) The secretary may deny proposals to establish or to expand any public water system within a critical water supply service area for which there is not an approved coordinated water system plan at any time after two years of the establishment of the critical water supply service area: PROVIDED, That service connections shall not be consid\u00ad ered expansion s.

( 1) The service area boundaries of public water systems within the critical water supply service area shall be determined by written agreement among the purveyors and with the approval of the appropriate legisla\u00ad tive authority . Failure of the legislative authority to file with the secretary objections to the proposed service area bound\u00ad aries within sixty days of receipt of the proposed boundary agreement may be construed as approval of the agreement. [Title 70 RCW-page 260] (2) If no service area boundary agreement has been established within a reasonable period of time, or if the legislative authority has filed with the secretary objections in writing as provided in subsection (1) of this section, the secretary shall hold a public hearing thereon. The secretary shall provide notice of the hearing by certified mail to each purveyor providing service in the critical water supply service area, to each county legislative authority having jurisdiction in the area and to the public. The secretary shall provide public notice pursuant to the provisions of chapter 65.16 RCW. Such notice shall be given at least twenty days prior to the hearing. The hearing may be continued from time to time and, at the termination thereof, the secretary may restrict the expansion of service of any purveyor within the area if the secretary finds such restriction is necessary to provide the greatest protection of the public health and well\u00ad being. [1977 ex.s. c 142 \u00a7 7.] 70.116.080 Performance standards relating to fire protection. The secretary shall adopt performance standards relating to fire protection to be incorporated into the design and construction of public water systems. The standard s shall be consistent with recognized national standards. The secretary shall adopt regulations pertaining to the application and enforcement of the standards: PROVID ED, That the regulations shall require the application of the standards for new and expanding systems only. The standards shall apply in critical water supply service areas unless the approved coordinated plan provides for nonfrre flow systems. [1977 ex.s. c 142 \u00a7 8.] 70.116.090 Assumption of jurisdiction or control of public water system by city, town, or code city.

See RCW 43.70.060. 70.118.010 Legislative declaration. The legislature finds that over one million, two hundred thousand persons in the state are not served by sanitary sewers and that they must rely on septic tank systems.

The legislature further finds that failure of such systems could be reduced by utilization of nonwat er-carried sewage disposal systems, or other alternative methods of effluent disposal, as a correctional measure. Waste water volume diminution and disposal of most of the high bacterial waste through composting or other alternative methods of effluent disposal would result in restorative improvement or correction of existing substandard systems.

The director: (1992 Ed.) Title 70 RCW: Public Health and Safety 70.120.150 (I) Shall adopt motor vehicle emission and equipment standards to: Ensure that no less than seventy percent of the vehicles tested comply with the standards on the first inspection conducted, meet federal clean air act require\u00ad ments, and protect human health and the environment. (2) Shall adopt rules implementing the smoke opacity testing requirement for diesel vehicles that ensure that such test is objective and repeatable and that properly maintained engines that otherwise would meet the applicable federal emission standards, as measured by the new engine certifica\u00ad tion test, would not fail the smoke opacity test. (3) Shall designate a geographic area as being a \"non\u00ad compliance area\" for motor vehicle emissions if (a) the department's analysis of emission and ambient air quality data, covering a period of no less than one year, indicates that the standard has or will probably be exceeded, and (b) the department determines that the primary source of the air contaminant is motor vehicle emissions. (4) Shall reevaluate noncompliance areas if the United States environmental protection agency modifies the relevant air quality standards, and shall discontinue the program if compliance is indicated and if the department determines that the area would continue to be in complia nce after the program is discontinued. The director shall notify persons residing in noncompliance areas of the reevaluat ion. (5) Shall analyze information regarding the motor vehicle traffic in a noncompliance area to determine the smallest land area within whose bounda ries are present registered motor vehicles that contribute significantly to the violation of motor vehicle-related air quality standards in the noncompliance area. The director shall declare the area to be an \"emission contributing area.\" An emission contribut\u00ad ing area established for a carbon monoxide or oxides of nitrogen noncompliance area must contain the noncompli\u00ad ance area within its boundar ies. An emission contributing area established for an ozone noncompliance area located in this state need not contain the ozone noncompliance area within its boundaries if it can be proven that vehicles registered in the area contribute significantly to violations of the ozone air quality standard in the noncompliance area. An emission contributing area may be established in this state for violations of federal air quality standards for ozone in an adjacent state if (a) the United States environmental protection agency designates an area to be a \"nonattainment area for ozone\" under the provisions of the federal Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et. seq.), and (b) it can be proven that vehicles registered in this state contribute significantly to the violation of the federal air quality standards for ozone in the adjacent state's nonattainment area. (6) Shall, after consultation with the appropriate local government entities, designate areas as being noncompliance areas or emission contributi ng areas, and shall establish the boundaries of such areas by rule. The director may also modify boundaries. In establishing the external boundaries of an emission contributing area, the director shall use the boundaries established for ZIP code service areas by the United States postal service. (7) May make grants to units of government in support of planning efforts to reduce motor vehicle emissions. [1991 c 199 \u00a7 207; 1989 c 240 c following Noncompliance areas-Annual review.

The legislature finds that adult persons have the fundamental right to control the decisions relating to the rendering of their own health care, including the decision to have life-sustaining treatment withheld or withdrawn in instances of a terminal condition or permanent unconscious condition. The legislature further finds that modern medical technology has made possible the artificial prolongation of human life beyond natural limits. The legislature further finds that, in the interest of protecting individual autonomy, such prolongation of the process of dying for persons with a terminal condition or permanent unconscious condition may cause loss of patient dignity, and unnecessary pain and suffering, while providing nothing medically necessary or beneficial to the patient. The legislature further believes that physicians and nurses should not withhold or unreasonably diminish pain medication for patients in a terminal condition where the primary intent of providing such medication is to alleviate pain and maintain or increase the patient 's comfort. The legislature further finds that there exists consider\u00ad able uncertainty in the medical and legal professions as to the legality of terminating the use or application of life\u00ad sustaining treatment where the patient having the capacity to make health care decisions has voluntarily evidenced a desire that such treatment be withheld or withdrawn. In recognition of the dignity and privacy which patients have a right to expect, the legislature hereby declares that the laws of the state of Washington shall recognize the right of an adult person to make a written directive instructing such person's physician to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment in the event of a terminal condition or permanent unconscious condition. The legislature also recognizes that {1992 Ed.) Title 70 RCW: Public Health and Safety 70.122.010 a person's right to control his or her health care may be exercised by an authorized representative who validly holds the person's durable power of attorney for health care.

(5) \"Life-sustaining treatment\" means any medical or surgical intervention that uses mechanical or other artificial means, including artificially provided nutrition and hydration, to sustain, restore, or replace a vital function, which, when applied to a qualified patient, would serve only to prolong the process of dying. \"Lif e-sustaining treatment\" shall not include the administration of medication or the performance of any medical or surgical intervention deemed necessary solely to alleviate pain.

Domestic Health and Safety 70.123.010 Legislative fmdings. The legislature finds that domestic violence is an issue of growing concern at all levels of government and that there is a present and growing need to develop innovative strategies and services which will ameliorate and reduce the trauma of domestic violence. Research findings show that domestic violence constitutes a significant percentage of homicides, aggravated assaults, and assaults and batteries in the United States. Domestic violence is a disruptive influence on personal and community life and is often interrelated with a number of other family problems and stresses. Shelters for victims of domestic violence are essential to provide protection to victims from further abuse and physical harm and to help the victim find long-range alternative living situations, if requested. Shelters provide safety, refuge, advocacy, and helping resources to victims who may not have access to such things if they remain in abusive situations. The legislature therefore recognizes the need for the state-wide development and expansion of shelters for victims of domestic violence. [1979 ex.s. c 245 \u00a7 1.] 70.123.020 Definitions. Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.

(6) \"Community advocate \" means a person employed by a local domestic violence program to provide ongoing assistance to victims of domestic violence in assessing safety needs, documenting the incidents and the extent of violence for possible use in the legal system, making appropriate social service referrals, and develop ing protocols and maintaining ongoing contacts necessary for local systems coordinat ion. (7) \"Domestic violence program\" means an agency that provides shelter, advocacy, and counseling for domestic violence victims in a supportive environment. (8) \"Legal advocate\" means a person employed by a domestic violence program or court system to advocate for victims of domestic violence, within the criminal and civil justice systems, by attending court proceedings, assisting in document and case preparation, and ensuring linkage with the community advocate.

The legislature finds that the availability of home health, hospice, and home care services has improved the quality of life for Washingt on's (1992 Ed.) citizens. However, the deli very of these services bring risks because the in-home location of services makes their actual delivery virtually invisible. Also, the complexit y of prod\u00ad ucts, services, and delivery systems in today's health care delivery system challenges even informed and healthy individua ls. The fact that these services are delivered to the state's most vulnerable population, the ill or disabled who are frequently also elderly, adds to these risks. It is the intent of the legislature to protect the citizens of Washington state by licensing home health, hospice, and home care agencies. This legislation is not intended to unreasonably restrict entry into the in-home service market\u00ad place. Standards established are intended to be the minimum necessary to ensure safe and competent care, and should be demonstrabl y related to patient safety and welfare.

Application of chapter to certain incinerators. Short title. Severabi lity-1987 c 528. 70.138.010 Legislative findings. The legislature finds: (1) Solid wastes generated in the state are to be man\u00ad aged in the following order of descending priority: (a) [Title 70 RCW-page 299] 70.138.010 Title 70 RCW: Safety Waste reduction; (b) recycling; (c) treatme nt; (d) energy recovery or incineration; (e) solidifica tion/stab ilization; and (f) landfill. (2) Special incinera tor ash residues from the incineration of municipal solid waste that would otherwise be regulated as hazardous wastes need a separate regulatory scheme in order to (a) ease the permitti ng and reporting requirements of chapter 70.105 RCW, the state hazardous waste manage\u00ad ment act, and (b) supplement the environmental protection provisions of chapter 70.95 RCW, the state solid waste management act. (3) Raw garbage poses significant environm ental and public health risks. Municipal solid waste incineration constitutes a higher waste management priority than the land disposal of untreated municipal solid waste due to its reduction of waste volumes and environmental health risks. It is therefore the purpose of this chapter to establish management requirements for special incinerator ash that otherwise would be regulated as hazardous waste under chapter 70.105 RCW, the hazardous waste management act.

(1) The legislature finds that: (a) Final regulations adopted by the United States environmental protection agency (EPA) require owners and operators of underground petroleum storage tanks to demon\u00ad strate financial responsibility for accidental releases of petroleum as a precondition to continued ownership and operation ofsuch tanks; (b) Financial responsibility is demonstrated through the purchase of pollution liability insurance or an acceptable alternative such as coverage under a state financial responsi\u00ad bility program, in the amount of at least five hundred thousand dollars per occurrence and one million dollars annual aggregate depending upon the nature, use, and number of tanks owned or operated; (c) Many owners and operators of underground petro\u00ad leum storage tanks cannot purchase pollution liability insurance either because private insurance is unavailable at any price or because owners and operators cannot meet the rigid underwriting standards of existing insurers, nor can many owners and operators meet the strict regulatory standards imposed for alternatives to the purchase of insurance; and (d) Without a state financial responsibility program for owners and operators of underground petroleum storage tanks, many tank owners and operators will be forced to discontinue the ownership and operation of these tanks. (2) The purpose of this chapter is to create a state financial responsibility program meeting EPA standards for owners and operators of underground petroleum storage tanks in a manner that: (a) Minimizes state involvement in pollution liability claims management and insurance administ ration; (b) Protects the state of Washington from unwanted and unanticipated liability for accidental release claims; (1992 Ed.) (c) Creates incentives for private insurers to provide needed liability insura nce; and (d) Parallels generally accepted principles of insurance and risk management. To that end, this chapter establishes a temporary program to provide pollution liability reinsurance at a price that will encourage a private insurance company or risk retention group to sell pollution liability insurance in accordance with the requirements of this chapter to owners and operators of underground petroleum storage tanks, thereby allowing the owners and operators to comply with the financial responsibility regulations of the EPA. (3) It is not the intent of this chapter to permit owners and operators of undergro und petroleum storage tanks to obtain pollution liability insurance without regard to the quality or condition of their storage tanks or without regard to the risk management practices of tank owners and operators, nor is it the intent of this chapter to provide coverage or funding for past or existing petroleum releases. Further, it is the intent of the legislature that the program follow generally accepted insurance underwriting and actuarial principles and to deviate from those principles only to the extent necessary and within the tax revenue limits provided, to make pollution liability insurance reasonably affordable and available to owners and operators who meet the requirements of this chapter, particularly to those owners and operators whose underground storage tanks meet a vital economic need within the affected community .

[1989 c 383 \u00a7 12.] 70.148.120 Financial assistance for corrective actions in small communities-Intent. The legislature recognizes as a fundamental government purpose the need to protect the environment and human health and safety. To that end the state has enacted laws designed to limit and prevent environmental damage and risk to public health and safety caused by underground petroleum storage tank leaks. Because of the costs associated with compliance with such laws and the high costs associated with correcting past environmental damage, many owners and operators of underground petroleum storage tanks have discontinued the use of or have planned to discontinue the use of such tanks. As a consequence, isolated communities face the loss of their source of motor vehicle fuel and face the risk that the owner or operator will have insufficient funds to take corrective action for pollution caused by past leaks from the tanks. In particular, rural communities face the risk that essential emergency, medical, fire and police services may be disrupted through the diminution or elimination of local sellers of petroleum products and by the closure of under\u00ad ground storage tanks owned by local government entities serving these communities. The legislature also recognizes as a fundamental government purpose the need to preserve a minimum level of economic viability in rural communities so that public revenues generated from economic activity are sufficient to sustain necessary governmental functions. The closing of local service stations adversely affects local economies by reducing or eliminating reasonable access to fuel for agricul\u00ad tural, commerc ial, and transportation needs. The legislature intends to assist small communities within this state by authorizi ng: [Title 70 RCW-page 309] 70.148.120 Title 70 RCW: Public Health and Safety (1) Cities, towns, and counties to certify that a local private owner or operator of an underground petroleum storage tank meets a vital local government, public health or safety need thereby qualifying the owner or operator for state financial assistance in complying with environmental regulations and assistance in taking needed corrective action for existing tank leaks; and (2) Local government entities to obtain state financial assistance to bring local government underground petroleum storage tanks into compliance with environmental regulations and to take needed corrective action for existing tank leaks.

The legislature finds that many Washington residents spend a significant amount of their time working indoors and that exposure to indoor air pollutants may occur in public buildings, schools, work places, and other indoor environments. Scientific studies indicate that pollutants common in the indoor air may include radon, asbesto s, volatile organic chemicals including formaldehyde and benzene, combustion byproducts including [Title 70 RCW-page 315] 70.162.005 Title 70 RCW: Public Health and Safety carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon dioxide, metals and gases including lead, chlorine, and ozone, respirable particles, tobacco smoke, biological contaminants, micro-or ganisms, and other contaminants. In some circum\u00ad stances, exposure to these substances may cause adverse health effects, including respiratory illnesses, multiple chemical sensitivities, skin and eye irritations, headaches, and other related symptoms. There is inadequate informa\u00ad tion about indoor air quality within the state of Washington, including the sources and nature of indoor air pollution. The intent of the legislature is to develop a control strategy that will improve indoor air quality, provide for the evaluation of indoor air quality in public buildings, and encourage voluntary measures to improve indoor air quality .

The legislature finds and declares that weatherizati on of the residences of low\u00ad income households will help conserve energy resources in this state and can reduce the need to obtain energy from more costly conventional energy resources. The legislature also finds that rising energy costs have made it difficult for low-income citizens of the state to afford adequate fuel for residential space heat. Weatherization of residences will lower energy consumption, making space heat more afford\u00ad able for persons in low-income househo lds. It will also reduce the uncollectible accounts of fuel suppliers resulting from low-income customers not being able to pay fuel bills. The program implementing the policy of this chapter is necessary to support the poor and infirm and also to benefit the health, safety, and general welfare of all citizens of the state.

The legislature finds and declares that: (1) Trauma is a severe health problem in the state of Washington and a major cause of death; (2) Presently, trauma care is very limited in many parts of the state, and health care in rural areas is in transition with the danger that some communities will be without emergency medical care; (3) It is in the best interest of the citizens of Washing\u00ad ton state to establish an efficient and well-coordina ted state\u00ad wide emergency medical services and trauma care system to reduce costs and incidence of inappropriate and inadequate trauma care and emergency medical service and minimize the human suffering and costs associated with preventable mortality and morbidity; (4) The goals and objectives of an emergency medical services and trauma care system are to: (a) Pursue trauma prevention activities to decrease the incidence of trauma; (b) provide optimal care for the trauma victim; (c) prevent unnecessary death and disability from trauma and emergen cy illness; and (d) contain costs of trauma care and trauma system implementati on; and (5) In other parts of the United States where trauma care systems have failed and trauma care centers have closed, there is a direct relationship between such failures and closures and a lack of commitment to fair and equitable reimbursement for trauma care participating providers and system overhead costs.

(1) The legislature finds and declares that there is a need for health care information that helps the general public understand health care issues and how they can be better consumers and that is useful to purchasers, payers, and providers in making health care choices and negotiating payments. It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to establish a hospital data collection, storage, and retrieval system which supports these data needs and which also provides public officials and others engaged in the development of state health policy the information necessary for the analysis of health care issues. (2) The legislature finds that rising health care costs and access to health care services are of vital concern to the people of this state. It is, therefore, essential that strategies be explored that moderate health care costs and promote access to health care services. (3) The legislature further finds that access to health care is among the state's goals and the provision of such care should be among the purposes of health care providers and facilities. Therefore , the legislature intends that charity care requirements and related enforcement provisions for hospitals be explicitly established. (4) The lack of reliable statistical information about the delivery of charity care is a particular concern that should be addressed. It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to require hospitals to provide, and report to the state, charity care to persons with acute care needs, and to have a state agency both monitor and report on the relative commi tment of hospitals to the delivery of charity care services, as well as the relative commitment of public and private purchasers or payers to charity care funding.

(4) The state-wide hospital data system shall be uniform in its identification of reporting requirements for hospitals across the state to the extent that such uniformity is neces\u00ad sary to fulfill the purposes of this chapter. Data reporting requirements may reflect differences in hospital size; urban or rural location; scope, type, and method of providing service; financial structure; or other pertinent distinguishing factors. So far as possible, the data system shall be coordi\u00ad nated with any requirements of the trauma care data registry as authorized in RCW 70.168.090, the federal department of health and human services in its administration of the medicare program, and the state in its role of gathering public health statistics, so as to minimize any unduly burdensome reporting requirements imposed on hospitals. [Title 70 RCW-page 328] (5) In identifying financial reporting requirements under the state-wide hospital data system, the department may require both annual reports and condensed quarterly reports, so as to achieve both accuracy and timeliness in reporting. (6) In designing the initial state-wide hospital data system as published in the departm ent's first data plan, the department shall review all existing systems of hospital financial and utilization reporting used in this state to determine their usefulness for the purposes of this chapter, including their potential usefulness as revised or simplified.

(1) The legislature declares that availability of health services to rural citizens is an issue on which a state policy is needed. The legislature finds that changes in the demand for health care, in reimbursement polices of public and private purchasers , [and] in the economic and demographic condi\u00ad tions in rural areas threaten the availability of care services. In addition, many factors inhibit needed changes in the delivery of health care services to rural areas which include inappropriate and outdated regulatory laws, aging and inefficient health care facilities, the absence of local planning and coordination of rural health care services, the lack of community understanding of the real costs and benefits of supporting rural hospitals, the lack of regional systems to assure access to care that cannot be provided in every community, and the absence of state health care policy objectives. The legislature further finds that the creation of effective health care delivery systems that assure access to health care services provided in an affordable manner will depend on active local community involvement. It further finds that it is the duty of the state to create a regulatory environment and health care payment policy that promotes innovation at the local level to provide such care. It further declares that it is the responsibility of the state to develop policy that provides direction to local communi\u00ad ties with regard to such factors as a definition of health care services, identification of state-wide health status outcomes, clarification of state, regional, [and] community responsibili\u00ad ties and interrelat ionships for assuring access to affordable health care and continued assurances that quality health care services are provided. (1992 Ed.) (2) The legislature further finds that many rural commu\u00ad nities do not operate hospitals in a cost-efficient manner. The cost of operating the rural hospital often exceeds the revenues generate d. Some of these hospitals face closure, which may result in the loss of health care services for the community. Many communities are struggling to retain health care services by operating a cost-effici ent facility located in the community . Current regulatory laws do not provide for the facilities licensure option that is appropriate for rural areas. A major barrier to the development of an appropriate rural licensure model is federal medicare approval to guarantee reimburs ement for the costs of providing care and operating the facility. Medicare certifica\u00ad tion typically elaborates upon state licensure requirements. Medicare approval of reimbursement is more likely if the state has developed legal criteria for a rural-appropriate health facility. Medicare has begun negotiations with other states facing similar problems to develop exceptions with the goal of allowing reimbursement of rural alternative health care facilities. It is in the best interests of rural citizens for Washington state to begin negotiations with the federal government with the objective of designing a medicare eligible rural health care facility structured to meet the health care needs of rural Washington and be eligible for federal and state financial support for its development and operation.

Rural health hospital districts: RCW 70.44.450. 70.180.005 Finding-Health care professionals. The legislature finds that a health care access problem exists in rural areas of the state because rural health care providers are unable to leave the community for short-term periods of time to attend required continuing education training or for personal matters because their absence would leave the community without adequate medical care coverage. The lack of adequate medical coverage in geographically remote rural communities constitutes a threat to the health and safety of the people in those communit ies. The legislature declares that it is in the public interest to recruit and maintain a pool of physicians, physician assistants, pharmacists, and advanced registered nurse practitioners willing and able on short notice to practice in rural communities on a short-term basis to meet the medical needs of the community .

The legislature finds that a shortage of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and physician assistants exists in rural areas of the state. In addition, many education programs to train these health care providers do not include options for practical training experience in rural settings. As a result, many health care providers find their current training does not prepare them for the unique demands of rural practice. The legislature declares that the availability of rural trl!iJJil1g opportu nities as a part of professional medical, nursing, pharmacist, and physician assistant education would provide needed practical experience, serve to attract provid\u00ad ers to rural areas, and help address the current shortage of these providers in rural Washington.

Definition s. Consolidate efforts of existing entities. Proposals to facilitate services at the community level. Report to legislature. Severabi lity-1992 c 198. Effective date-1992 c 198. 70.190.005 Purpose. The legislature finds that a primary goal of public involvement in the lives of children has been to strengthen the family unit. However, the legislature recognizes that tradi tional two\u00ad parent families with one parent routinely at home are now in the minority. In addition, extended family and natural community supports have eroded drastically. The legislature recognizes that public policy assumptions must be altered to account for this new social reality. Public effort must be redirected to expand, support, strengthen, and help refashion family and community association s to care for children. The legislature finds that a broad variety of services for children and families has been independently designed over the years and that the coordinati on and cost-effectiveness of these services will be enhanced through the adoption of a common approach to their delivery . The legislature further finds that the most successful programs for reaching and working with at-risk families and children treat individua ls' problems in the context of the family, offer a broad spectrum of services, are flexible in the use of program resources, and use staff who are trained in crossing traditional program categories in order to broker services necessary to fully meet a family's needs. The legislature further finds that eligibility criteria, expenditure restrictions, and reporting requirements of state and federal categorical programs often create barriers toward the effective use of resources for addressing the multiple problems of at-risk families and children. The purposes of this chapter are (1) to modify public policy and programs to empower communities to support and respond to the needs of individual families and children and (2) to improve the responsiveness of services for children and families at risk by facilitating greater coordination and flexibility in the use of funds by state and local service agencies. [ 1992 c 198 \u00a7 1.] 70.190.010 Definitions. Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.

(3) \"Family policy council\" or \"council\" means the superintendent of public instruction, the secretary of social and health services, the secretary of health, the commissioner of the employment security departm ent, and the director of the department of communit y develo pment or their designees, one legislator from each caucus of the senate and house of representati ves, and one representative of the governor. (4) \"Outcome based\" means defined and measurable outcomes and indicators that make it possible for communi\u00ad ties to evaluate progress in meeting their goals and whether systems are fulfilling their responsibilities . (5) \"Matching funds\" means an amount no less than twenty-five percent of the amount budgeted for a consortium's project. Up to half of the consort ium's matching funds may be in-kind goods and services.

This shall include authority to consolidate similar councils or activities in a manner consistent with the goals of chapter 198, Laws of 1992.

The legislature finds, however, that the use of civil commitment procedures under chapter 71.05 RCW to effect state control over dangerous develop\u00ad mentally disabled persons has resulted in their commitment to institutions for the mentally ill. The legislature finds that existing programs in mental institutions may be inappropriate for persons who are developmentally disabled because the services provided in mental institutions are oriented to persons with mental illness, a condition not necessarily associated with developmental disabilities. Therefore, the legislature believes that, where appropriate, and subject to available funds, persons with developmental disabilities who [Title 71 RCW-page 4] have been charged with felony crimes and have been found incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity should receive state services addressing their needs, that such services must be provided in conformance with an individual habilitation plan, and that their initial treatment should be separate and discrete from treatment for persons involved in any other treatment or habilitation program in a manner consistent with the needs of public safety.

( 1) A person found to be gravely disabled or presents a likelihood of serious harm as a result of a mental disorder has a right to refuse antipsychotic medication unless it is determined that the failure to medicate may result in a likelihood of serious harm or substantial deterior ation or substantially prolong the length of involuntary commitment and there is no less intrusive course of treatment than medication in the best interest of that person. (2) The departm ent shall adopt rules to carry out the purposes of this chapter. These rules shall include: {a) An attempt to obtain the informed consent of the person prior to administration of antipsychotic medicatio n. (b) For short-term treatment up to thirty days, the right to refuse antipsychotic medications unless there is an additional concurring medical opinion approving medication. (c) For continued treatment beyond thirty days through the hearing on any petition filed under RCW 71.05.370(7), the right to periodic review of the decision to medicate by the medical director or designee. (d) Administr ation of antipsychotic medication in an emergency and review of this decision within twenty-four hours. An emergency exists if the person presents an imminent likelihood of serious harm to self or others, and medically acceptable alternati ves to administration of antipsychotic medications are not available or are unlikely to be successf ul; and in the opinion of the physician, the person's condition con stitutes an emergency requiring the treatment be instituted prior to obtaining a second medical opinion.

The legislature finds that a small but extremely dangerous group of sexually violent predators exist who do not have a mental disease or defect that renders them appropriate for the existing involuntary treatment act, chapter 71.05 RCW, which is intended to be a short-term civil commitment system that is primarily designed to provide short-term treatment to individuals with serious mental disorders and then return them to the community. In contrast to persons appropriate for civil commitment under chapter 71.05 RCW, sexually violent predators generally have antisocial personality features which are unamenable to existing mental illness treatment modalities and those features render them likely to engage in sexually violent behavior. The legislature further finds that sex offenders' likelihood of engaging in repeat acts of predatory sexual violence is high. The existing involuntary commitment act, chapter 71.05 RCW, is inadequa te to address the risk to reoffend because during confinement these offenders do not have access to potential victims and therefore they will not engage in an overt act during confinement as required by the involuntary treatment act for continued confinement. The legislature further finds that the prognosis for curing sexually violent offenders is poor, the treatment needs of this popula\u00ad tion are very long term, and the treatment modalities for this population are very different than the traditional treatment modalities for people appropri ate for commitment under the involuntary treatment act.

Within forty-five days after the filing of a petition pursuant to RCW 71.09.030, the court shall conduct a trial to determine whether the person is a sexually violent predator. At all stages of the proceedings under this chapter, any person subject to this chapter shall be entitled to the assistance of counsel, and if the person is indigent, the court shall appoint counsel to assist him or her. Whenever any person is subjected to an examina tion under this chapter, he or she may retain experts or professional persons to perform an examination on their behalf. When the person wishes to be examined by a qualified expert or professional person of his or her own choice, such examiner shall be permitted to have reasonable access to the person for the purpose of such examinat ion, as well as to all relevant medical and psycho\u00ad logical records and reports. In the case of a person who is indigent, the court shall, upon the person's request, assist the person in obtaining an expert or professional person to perform an examination or participate in the trial on the person's behalf. The person, the prosecuting attorney or attorney general, or the judge shall have the right to demand that the trial be before a jury. If no demand is made, the trial shall be before the court. [1990 c 3 \u00a7 1005.] 71.09.060 Trial-Determination-Commitment procedures. (1) The court or jury shall determine whether, beyond a reasonable doubt, the person is a sexually violent predator. If the state alleges that the prior sexually violent offense that forms the basis for the petition for commitment was an act that was sexually motivated as provided in RCW 71.09.020(4)(c), the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the alleged sexually violent act was sexually motivated as defined in RCW 9.94A.030. If the court or jury determines that the person is a sexually violent predator, the person shall be committed to the custody of the depart\u00ad ment of social and health services in a secure facility for control, care, and treatment until such time as the person's mental abnormality or personality disorder has so changed that the person is safe to be at large. Such control, care, and treatment shall be provided at a facility operated by the department of social and health services. If the court or jury is not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the person is a sexually violent predator, the court shall direct the person's release. (2) If the person charged with a sexually violent offense has been found incompetent to stand trial, and is about to or has been released pursuant to RCW 10.77.090(3), and his or her commitment is sought pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the court shall first hear evidence and determine whether the person did commit the act or acts charged if the court did not enter a finding prior to dismissal under RCW 10.77.090(3) that the person committed the act or acts charged. The hearing on this issue must comply with all the procedures specified in this section. In addition, the rules of evidence applicable in criminal cases shall apply, and all constitutional rights available to defendants at criminal trials, [Title 71 RCW-page 26] other than the right not to be tried while incompetent, shall apply. After hearing evidence on this issue, the court shall make specific findings on whether the person did commit the act or acts charged, the extent to which the person's incom\u00ad petence or developmental disability affected the outcome of the hearing, including its effect on the person's ability to consult with and assist counsel and to testify on his or her own behalf, the extent to which the evidence could be reconstructed without the assistance of the person, and the strength of the prosecution's case. If, after the conclusion of the hearing on this issue, the court finds, beyond a reason\u00ad able doubt, that the person did commit the act or acts charged, it shall enter a final order, appealable by the person, on that issue, and may proceed to consider whether the person should be committed pursuant to this section. (3) The state shall comply with RCW 10.77.220 while confining the person pursuant to this chapter. The facility shall not be located on the grounds of any state mental facility or regional habilitation center because these institu\u00ad tions are insufficiently secure for this population.

(1) If the secretary of the department of social and health services determines that the person's mental abnormality or personali\u00ad ty disorder has so changed that the person is not likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence if released, the secretary shall authorize the person to petition the court for release. The petition shall be served upon the court and the prosecuting attorney. The court, upon receipt of the petition for release, shall within forty-five days order a hearing. The prosecuting attorney or the attorney general, if requested by the county, shall represent the state, and shall have the right to have the petitioner examined by an expert or professional person of his or her choice. The hearing shall be before a jury if demanded by either the petitioner or the prosecuting attorney or attorney general.

Title 71 RCW: Mental lllness 71.09.090 (2) Nothing contained in this chapter shall prohibit the person from otherwise petitioning the court for discharge without the secretary 's approval. The secretary shall provide the committed person with an annual written notice of the person's right to petition the court for release over the secretary's objection. The notice shall contain a waiver of rights. The secretary shall forward the notice and waiver form to the court with the annual report. If the person does not affirmati vely waive the right to petition, the court shall set a show cause hearing to determine whether facts exist that warrant a hearing on whether the person's condition has so changed that he or she is safe to be at large. The committed person shall have a right to have an attorney represent him or her at the show cause hearing but the person is not entitled to be present at the show cause hearing. If the court at the show cause hearing determines that probable cause exists to believe that the person's mental abnormality or personality disorder has so changed that the person is safe to be at large and is not likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence if discharged, then the court shall set a hearing on the issue. At the hearing, the committed person shall be entitled to be present and to the benefit of all constitutional protections that were afforded to the person at the initial commitment proceeding. The prosecuting attorney or the attorney general if requested by the county shall represent the state and shall have a right to a jury trial and to have the committed person evaluated by experts chosen by the state. The committed person shall also have the right to have experts evaluate him or her on his or her behalf and the court shall appoint an expert if the person is indigent and requests an appointment. The burden of proof at the hearing shall be upon the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the committed person's mental abnormality or personality disorder remains such that the person is not safe to be at large and if released is likely to engage in predatory acts of sexual violence.

However, if a person has previously filed a petition for discharge without the secretary 's approval and the court determined, either upon review of the petition or following a hearing, that the petitioner' s petition was frivolous or that the petitioner 's condition had not so changed that he or she was safe to be at large, then the court shall deny the subsequ ent petition unless the petition contains facts upon which a court could find that the condition of the petitioner had so changed that a hearing was warr anted. Upon receipt of a first or subse\u00ad quent petition from committed pe rsons without the secretary 's approval, the court shall endeavor whenever possible to review the petition and determine if the petition is based upon frivolous grounds and if so shall deny the petition without a hearing.

This care should improve home, school, and community functioning, maintain children in a safe and nurturing home environment, and should enable treatment decisions to be made in response to clinical needs in accordance with sound professional judgment while also recognizing parents' rights to participate in treatment decisions for their children; (2) Accountability of services through state-wide standards for monitoring and reporting of information; (3) Minimum service delivery standards; (4) Priorities for the use of available resources for the care of the mentally ill; (5) Coordination of services within the department, including those divisions within the department that provide services to children, between the department and the office of the superintendent of public instruction, and among state mental hospitals, county authoritie s, community mental health services, and other support services, which shall to the maximum extent feasible also include the families of the mentally ill, and other service providers; and (6) Coordination of services aimed at reducing duplica\u00ad tion in service delivery and promoting complemen tary services among all entities that provide mental health services to adults and children. It is the policy of the state to encourage the provision of a full range of treatment and rehabilitation services in the state for mental disorders. The legislature intends to encourage the development of county-b ased and county\u00ad managed mental health services with adequate local flexibili\u00ad ty to assure eligible people in need of care access to the least-restrictive treatment alternative appropriate to their needs, and the availability of treatment components to assure continuity of care. To this end, counties are encouraged to enter into joint operating agreements with other counties to form regional systems of care which integrate planning, administration, and service delivery duties assigned to (1992 Ed.) counties under chapters 71.05 and 71.24 RCW to consolidate administration, reduce administ rative layering, and reduce administrative costs. It is further the intent of the legislature to integrate the provision of services to provide continuity of care through all phases of treatment. To this end the legislature intends to promote active engagement with mentally ill persons and collaboration between families and service providers.

A county authority or a group of county authorities whose combined population is no less than forty thousand may enter into a joint operating agreement to form a regional support network. The roles and responsibilities of county authorities shall be determined by the terms of that agree\u00ad ment and the provisions of law. The state mental health authority may not determine the roles and responsibilities of county authorities as to each other under regional support networks by rule, except to assure that all duties required of regional support networks are assigned and that a single authority has final responsibility for all available resources and performance under the regional support network's contract with the secretary . (1) Regional support networks shall within three months of recognition submit an overall six-year operating and capital plan, timeline, and budget and submit progress reports and an updated two-year plan biennially thereafter, to assume within available resources all of the following duties by July 1, 1995, instead of those presently assigned to counties under RCW 71.24.045( 1): (a) Administer and provide for the availability of all resource management services, residential services, and community support services. (b) Administ er and provide for the availability of all investigation, transporta tion, court-rel ated, and other services provided by the state or counties pursuant to chapter 71.05 RCW. (c) By July 1, 1993, provide within the boundaries of each regional support network evaluation and treatment services for at least eighty-five percent of persons detained or committed for periods up to seventeen days according to chapter 71.05 RCW.

Insofar as the original intent of serving persons in the community is maintained, the secretary is authorized to approve exceptions on a case-by-case basis to the requirement to provide evaluation and treatment services within the boundaries of each regional support network. Such exceptions are limited to contracts with neighboring or contiguous regions. For regional support networks that are created after June 30, 1991, the requirements of (c) of this subsection must be met by July 1, 1995. (d) By July 1, 1993, administer a portion of funds appropriated by the legislature to house mentally ill persons in state institutions from counties within the boundaries of any regional support network, with the exception of mentally ill offenders, and provide for the care of all persons needing evaluation and treatment services for periods up to seventeen (1992 Ed.)

The regional support networks shall reimburse the state for use of state institutions at a rate equal to that assumed by the legislature when appropriating funds for such care at state institutions during the biennium when reimbursement occurs. The duty of a state hospital to accept persons for evaluation and treatment under chapter 71.05 RCW is limited by the responsibilities assigned to regional support networks under this section. For regional support networks that are created after June 30, 1991, the requirements of (d) of this subsec\u00ad tion must be met by July 1, 1995. (e) Administer and provide for the availability of all other mental health services, which shall include patient counseling, day treatme nt, consultation, education services, employment services as defined in RCW 71.24.035, and mental health services to children as provided in this chapter.

(3) A regional support network may request that any state-owned land, building, facility, or other capital asset which was ever purchased, deeded, given, or placed in trust for the care of the mentally ill and which is within the boundaries of a regional support network be made available to support the operati ons of the regional support network. State agencies managing such capital assets shall give first priority to requests for their use pursuant to this chapter. (4) Each regional support network shall appoint a mental health advisory board which shall review and provide comments on plans and policies developed under this chapter. The composition of the board shall be broadly representative of the demographic character of the region and the mentally ill persons served therein. Length of terms of board members shall be determined by the regional support network. (5) Regional support networks shall assume all duties specified in their plans and joint operating agreements through biennial contractual agreements with the secretary. Such contracts may include agreements to provide periods of stable community living and work or other day activities for specific chronically mentally ill persons who have completed commitments at state hospitals on ninety-day or one hundred eighty-day civil commitments or who have been residents at state hospitals for no less than one hundred eighty days within the previous year. Periods of stable community living may involve acute care in local evaluation and treatment facilities but may not involve use of state hospital s. (6) Counties or groups of counties participating in a regional support netwo rk are not subject to *RCW 71.24.045(7). The office of financial management shall consid er information gathered in studies required in this chapter and information about the experience of other states to propose a mental health services administrative cost lid to the 1993 legislature which shall include administrative costs of licensed service providers, the state psychiatric hospitals and the department. (7) By November 1, 1991, and as part of each biennial plan thereafter, each regional support network shall establish (1992 Ed.) and submit to the state, procedures and agreements to assure access to sufficient additional local evaluation and treatment facilities to meet the requirements of this chapter while reducing short-term admissions to state hospitals. These shall be commitments to construct and operate , or contract for the operation of, freestanding evaluation and treatment facilities or agreements with local evaluation and treatment facilities which shall include (a) required admiss ion and treatment for short-term inpatient care for any person enrolled in community support or residential services, (b) discharge planning procedures, (c) limitations on admissions or transfers to state hospitals, (d) adequate psychiatric supervision, (e) prospective payment methods, and (f) contractual assurances regarding referrals to local evaluation and treatment facilities from regional support network s. (8) Regional support networks may receive technical assistance from the housing trust fund and may identify and submit projects for housing and housing support services to the housing trust fund established under chapter 43.185 RCW. Projects identified or submitted under this subsection must be fully integrated with the regional support network six-year operating and capital plan, timeline, and budget required by subsection (1) of this section.

It is the intent of the legislature to establish a compreh ensive system of correc\u00ad tions for convicted law violators within the state of Washing\u00ad ton to accomplish the following objectives. (1) The system should ensure the public safety. The system should be designed and managed to provide the maximum feasible safety for the persons and property of the general public, the staff, and the inmates. (2) The system should punish the offender for violating the laws of the state of Washington. This punishment should generally be limited to the denial of liberty of the offender. (3) The system should treat all offenders fairly and equitably without regard to race, religion, sex, national origin, residence, or social condition. (4) The system, as much as possible, should reflect the values of the community including: (a) Avoiding idlen ess. Idleness is not only wasteful but destructive to the individual\u00b7 and to the community. (b) Adoption of the work ethic. It is the community expectation that all citizens should work and through thei.i\" efforts benefit both themselves and the community. (c) Providing opportunities for self improvem ent. All individuals should.have opportunities to grow and expand their skills arid abilities so as to fulfill their role in the community. (d) Providing tangible rewards for accomplishment. The individual who works to improve himself or herself and the community should be rewarded for these efforts. As a corollary, there should be no rewards for no effort. (e) Sharing in the obligations of the communi ty. All citizens, the public and inmates alike, have a personal and fiscal obligation in the corrections system. All communities must share in the responsibility of the corrections system. (5) The system should provide for prudent management of resources. The human and fiscal resources of the commu\u00ad nity are limited. The management and use of these resourc\u00ad es can be enhanced by wise invesment, productive pro\u00ad grams, the reduction of duplication and wast e, and the joining together of all involved parties in a common endellv\u00ad or. Since virtually all offenders return to the community, it is wise for the state and the communities to make an investment in effective rehabilitation programs for offenders and the wise use of resources. (6) The system should provide for restitution. Those who have damaged others, persons or property, have a responsibility to make restitution for these dll!!lages. (7) The system should be accountable to the citizens of the state. In return, the individual citizens and local units of government must meet their responsibilities to make the corrections system effective. (8) The system should meet those national standards which the state determines to be appropriate. [1981 c 136 \u00a7 2.] [Title 72 RCW-page 16] 72.09.015 Defmitions.

It is the intent of the legislature to vest in the department the power to provide for a comprehensive inmate work program and to remove statutory and other restrictions which have limited work programs in the past. For purposes of establishing such a comprehe nsive program, the legisla\u00ad ture recommends that the department consider adopting any or all, or any variation of, the following classes of work program s: (1) CLASS I: FREE VENTURE INDUSTRIES. The employer model industries in this class shall be operated and managed in total or in part by any profit or nonprofit organization pursuant to an agreement between the organiza\u00ad tion and the department.

Inmates who work in free venture industries shall do so at their own choice. They shall be paid a wage comparable to the wage paid for work of a similar nature in the locality in which the industry is located, as determined by the director of correctional industries. If the director cannot reasonably determine the comparable wage, then the pay shall not be less than the federal minimum wage. (2) CLASS II: TAX REDUCTION INDUSTRIES. Industries in this class shall be state-owned and operated enterprises designe d to reduce the costs for goods and services for tax-supported agencies and for nonprofit organizations. The industries selected for development within this class shall, as much as possible, match the available pool of inmate work skills and aptitudes with the work opportu nities in the free community. The industries shall be closely patterned after private sector industries but with the objective of reducing public support costs rather than making a profit. The products and services of this industry, including purchased products and services neces- [Title 72 RCW--page 18] sary for a complete product line, may be sold to public agencies, to nonprofit organizati ons, and to private contrac\u00ad tors when the goods purchased will be ultimately used by a public agency or a nonprofit organiza tion. Clothing manu\u00ad factured by an industry in this class may be donated to nonprofit organizat ions that provide clothing free of charge to low-income persons. Correctional industries products and services shall be reviewed by the correctional industries board of directors before offering such products and services for sale to private contractors . The board of directors shall conduct a yearly marketing review of the products and services offered under this subsection. Such review shall include an analysis of the potential impact of the proposed products and services on the Washington state business community. To avoid waste or spoilage and consequent loss to the state, when there is no public sector market for such goods, byproducts and surpluses of timber, agricultural, and animal husbandry enterprises may be sold to private persons, at private sale. Surplus byproducts and surpluses of timber, agricultural and animal husbandry enterprises that cannot be sold to public agencies or to private persons may be donated to nonprofit organizations. All sales of surplus products shall be carried out in accordance with rules prescribed by the secretary . Security and custody services shall be provided without charge by the department of corrections. Inmates working in this class of industries shall do so at their own choice and shall be paid for their work on a gratuity scale which shall not exceed the wage paid for work of a similar nature in the locality in which the industry is located and which is approved by the director of correctional industries. (3) CLASS ill: INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT INDUS\u00ad TRIES. Industries in this class shall be operated by the department of corrections. They shall be designed and managed to accomplish the following objectives: (a) Whenever possible, to provide basic work training and experience so that the inmate will be able to qualify for better work both within correctional industries and the free community . It is not intended that an inmate's work within this class of industries should be his or her final and total work experience as an inmate. (b) Whenever possible, to provide forty hours of work or work training per week. (c) Whenever possible, to offset tax and other public support costs. Supervising, management, and custody staff shall be employees of the department. All able and eligible inmates who are assigned work and who are not working in other classes of industries shall work in this class. Except for inmates who work in work training pro\u00ad grams, inmates in this class shall be paid for their work in accordance with an inmate gratuity scale. The scale shall be adopted by the secretary of corrections. (4) CLASS IV: COMMUNITY WORK INDUSTRIES. Industries in this class shall be operated by the department of correcti ons.

Inmates who work in this class of industries shall do so at their own choice and shall receive a gratuity which shall not exceed the wage paid for work of a similar nature in the locality in which the industry is located. (5) CLASS V: COMMUNITY SERVICE PRO\u00ad GRAMS . Programs in this class shall be subject to supervi\u00ad sion by the department of corrections. The purpose of this class of industries is to enable an offender, placed on community supervision, to work off all or part of a commu\u00ad nity service order as ordered by the sentencing court. Employment shall be in a community service program operated by the state, local units of government, or a nonprofit agency. To the extent that funds are specifically made available for such purposes, the department of corrections shall reimburse nonprofit agencies for workers compensation insurance costs.

To this end, a children 's health program is established based on the following principles: (1) Access to preventive and other health care services should be made more readily available for children in poverty . (2) Unnecessary barriers to health care for children in poverty should be removed. (3) The status of children's health and their access to health care provid ers should be evaluated at appropriate intervals to determine program effectiveness and need for modificat ion. (4) Health care services should be delivered in a cost\u00ad effective manner. (5) The program should be sensitive to cultural and ethnic differences among children in poverty.

However, the legis\u00ad lature recognizes the cost and complexit y associa ted with such assessment. The legislature accepts the effectiveness of prenatal and maternity care at improving birth outcomes when these services are received by eligible persons. Therefore, the legislature intends to focus scarce assessment resources to determine the extent to which support services such as child care, psychosocial and nutritional assessment and counseling, case management, transpo rtation, and other support services authorized by *this act result in receipt of prenatal and maternity care by eligible persons. The University of Washington shall conduct a study, based on a statistically significant state-wide sampling of data, to evaluate the effectiveness of the maternity care access program set forth in RCW 74.09.76 0 through 74.09.820 based on the principles set forth in RCW 74.09.770. The University of Washington shall develop a plan and budget for the study in consul tation with the legislative budget committee. The legislative budget committee shall also monitor the progress of the study. The department of social and health services shall make data and other information available as needed to the University of Washington as required to conduct this study. The study shall determine: (a) The characteri stics of women receiving services, including health risk factors; (b) The extent to which access to maternity care and support services have improved in this state as a result of this program; (c) The utilization of services and birth outcomes for women and infants served by this program by type of practiti oner; (d) The extent to which birth outcomes for women receiving services under this program have improved in comparison to birth outcomes of nonmedicaid mothers; (e) The impact of increased medicaid reimbursement to physicians on provider participati on; [Title 74 RCW-page 23] 74.09.415 Title 74 RCW: Public Assistance (f) The difference between costs for services provided under this program and medicaid reimbursement for the services; (g) The gaps in services, if any, that may still exist for women and their infants as defined by RCW 74.09.790 (1) and (4) served by this program , excluding pregnant sub\u00ad stance abusers, and women covered by private health insurance; and (h) The number and mix of services provided to eligible women as defined by subsection (2)(g) of this section and the effect on birth outcomes as compared to nonmedicaid birth outcomes.

( 1) The legislature finds that Washington state and the nation as a whole have a high rate of infant illness and death compared with other industrialized nations. This is especial- (1992 Ed.) Title 74 RCW: Public Assistance 74.09.770 ly true for minority and low-income populations. Premature and low weight births have been directly linked to infant illness and death. The availability of adequate maternity care throughout the course of pregnancy has been identified as a major factor in reducing infant illness and death. Further, the investment in preventive health care programs, such as maternity care, contributes to the growth of a healthy and productive society and is a sound approach to health care cost containment. The legislature further finds that access to maternity care for low-income women in the state of Washington has declined significantly in recent years and has reached a crisis level. (2) It is the purpose of this chapter [subchapter] to provide, consistent with appropri ated funds, maternity care necessary to ensure healthy birth outcomes for low-income families. To this end, a maternity care access system is established based on the following principles: (a) The family is the fundamental unit in our society and should be supported through public policy. (b) Access to maternity care for eligible persons to ensure healthy birth outcomes should be made readily available in an expeditious manner through a single service entry point. (c) Unnecessary barriers to maternity care for eligible persons should be removed. (d) Access to preventive and other health care services should be available for low-income children. (e) Each woman should be encouraged to and assisted in making her own inf ormed decisions about her maternity care. (f) Unnecessary barriers to the provision of maternity care by qualified health professionals should be removed. (g) The system should be sensitive to cultural differ\u00ad ences among eligible persons. (h) To the extent possible, decisions about the scope, content, and delivery of services should be made at the local level involving a broad representation of community inter\u00ad ests. (i) The maternity care access system should be evalu\u00ad ated at appropriate intervals to determine effectiveness and need for modification. G) Maternity care services should be delivered in a cost\u00ad effective manner. [1989 1st ex.s. c 10 \u00a7 2.] 74.09.780 Reservation of legislative power.

It is the policy of this state to enable the secretary to charge fees for certain services to adoptive parents who are able to pay for such services. It is, however, also the policy of this state that the secretary of the departm ent of social and health services shall be liberal in waiving, reducing, or deferring payment of any such fee to the end that adoptions shall be encouraged in cases where prospective adoptive parents lack means. It is the policy of this state to encourage, within the limits of available funds, the adoption of certain hard to place children in order to make it possible for children living in, or likely to be placed in, foster homes or institutions to benefit from the stability and security of permanent homes in which such children can receive continuous parental care, guidance, protection, and love and to reduce the number of such children who must be placed or remain in foster homes or institutions until they become adults. It is also the policy of this state to try, by means of the program of adoption support authorized in RCW 26.33.32 0 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145, to reduce the total cost to the state of foster home and institutional care.

When a child proposed for adoption is placed with a prospecti ve adoptive parent the department may charge such parent a fee in payment or part payment of such adoptive parent's part of the cost of the adoption services rendered and to be rendered by the department. In charging such fees the department shall treat a husband and wife as a single prospective adoptive parent. Each such fee shall be fixed according to a sliding scale based on the ability to pay of the prospect ive adoptive parent or parents. Such fee scale shall be annually fixed by the secretary after considering the recommendations of the committee designated by the secretary to advise him on child welfare and pursuant to the regulations to be issued by the secretary in accordance with the provisions of Title 34 RCW. The secretary may waive, defer, or provide for payment in installments without interest of, any such fee whenever in (1992 Ed.) his judgment payment or immediate payment would cause economic hardship to such adoptive parent or parents. Nothing in this section shall require the payment of a fee to the state of Washington in a case in which an adop\u00ad tion results from independent placement or placement by a licensed child-placing agency. [1971 ex.s. c 63 \u00a7 2.] 74.13.106 Disposition of Fees-Use-Federal funds-Gifts and grants. All fees paid for adoption services pursuant to RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145 shall be credited to the general fund. Expenses incurred in connection with supporting the adoption of hard to place children shall be paid by warrants drawn against such appropriations as may be available. The secretary may for such purposes, contract with any public agency or licensed child placing agency and/or adoptive parent and is authorized to accept funds from other sources including federal, private, and other public funding sources to carry out such purposes. The secretary shall actively seek, where consistent with the policies and programs of the department, and shall make maximum use of, such federal funds as are or may be made available to the department for the purpose of supporting the adoption of hard to place children. The secretary may, if permitted by federal law, deposit federal funds for adoption support, aid to adoptions, or subsidized adoption in the general fund and may use such funds, subject to such limitations as may be imposed by federal or state law, to carry out the program of adoption support authorized by RCW 26.33.32 0 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145. Rules and regulations-Agreements for disbursements from appropriations available from the general fund, criteria. The secretary shall issue rules and regulations to assist in the administration of the program of adoption support authorized by RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145. Disbursements from the appropriat ions available from the general fund shall be made pursuant to such rules and regulations and pursuant to agreements conforming thereto to be made by the secretary with parents for the purpose of supporti ng the adoption of children in, or likely to be placed in, foster homes or child caring institutions who are found by the secretary to be difficult to place in adoption because of physical or other reasons; including, but not limited to, physical or mental handicap, emotional disturbance, ethnic background, language, race, color, age, or sibling grouping. Such agreements shall meet the following criteria: (1) The child whose adoption is to be supported pursuant to such agreement shall be or have been a child hard to place in adoption. (2) Such agreement must relate to a child who was or is residing in a foster home or child-caring institution or a child who, in the judgment of the secretary, is both eligible for, and likely to be placed in, either a foster home or a child-caring institution. (3) Such agreement shall provide that adoption support shall not continue beyond the time that the adopted child [Title 74 RCW-page 41] 74.13.109 Title 74 RCW: Public Assistance reaches eighteen years of age, becomes emancipated, dies, or otherwise ceases to need support, provided that if the secretary shall find that continuing dependency of such child after such child reaches eighteen years of age warrants the continuation of support pursuant to RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145 the secretary may do so, subject to all the provisions of RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145, including annual review of the amount of such support. (4) Any prospective parent who is to be a party to such agreement shall be a person who has the character, judg\u00ad ment, sense of responsibility, and disposition which make him or her suitable as an adoptive parent of such child. [1990 c 285 \u00a7 7; 1985 c 7 \u00a7 135; 1979 Factors determining payments or ad\u00ad justment in standards. The factors to be considered by the secretary in setting the amount of any payment or payments to be made pursuant to RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145 and in adjusting standards hereunder shall include: The size of the family including the adoptive child, the usual living expenses of the family, the special needs of any family member including education needs, the family income, the family resources and plan for savings, the medical and hospitalization needs of the family, the family's means of purchasing or otherwise receiving such care, and any other expenses likely to be needed by the child to be adopted. The amounts paid for the support of a child pursuant to RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145 may vary from family to family and from year to year. Due to changes in economic circumstances or the needs of the child such payments may be discontinued and later resumed. Payments under RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145 may be continued by the secretary subject to review as provided for herein, if such parent or parents having such child in their custody establish their residence in another state or a foreign jurisdiction. In fixing the standards to govern the amount and character of payments to be made for the support of adopted children pursuant to RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145 and before issuing rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145, the secretary shall consider the comments and recommendations of the commit tee designa ted by the secretary to advise him with respect to child welfare.

To carry out the program authorized by RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145, the secretary may make continuing payments or lump sum payments of adoption support. In lieu of continuing pay\u00ad ments, or in addition to them, the secretary may make one or more specific lump sum payments for or on behalf of a hard to place child either to the adoptive parents or directly [Title 74 RCW-page 42] to other persons to assist in correcting any condition causing such child to be hard to place for adoption. After determination by the secretary of the amount of a payment or the initial amount of continuing payments, the prospective parent or parents who desire such support shall sign an agreement with the secretary providing for the payment, in the manner and at the time or times prescribed in regulations to be issued by him subject to the provisions ofRCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145, of the amount or amounts of support so determined.

At least annually the secretary shall review the need of any adoptive parent or parents receiving continuing support pursuant to RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145, or the need of any parent who is to receive more than one lump sum payment where such payments are to be spaced more than one year apart. Such review shall be made not later than the anniversary date of the adoption support agreement. At the time of such annual review and at other times during the year when changed conditions, including varia\u00ad tions in medical opinions, prognosis and costs, are deemed by the secretary to warrant such action, appropriate adjust\u00ad ments in payments shall be made based upon changes in the needs of the child, in the adoptive parents' income, resourc\u00ad es, and expenses for the care of such child or other members of the family, including medical and/or hospitalization expense not otherwise covered by or subject to reimburs e\u00ad ment from insurance or other sources of financial assistance . Any parent who is a party to such an agreement may at any time in writing request, for reasons set forth in such request, a review of the amount of any payment or the level of continuing payments. Such review shall be begun not later than thirty days from the receipt of such request. Any adjustment may be made retroactive to the date such request was received by the secretary . If such request is not acted on within thirty days after it has been received by the secretary, such parent may invoke his rights under the hearing provisions set forth in RCW 74.13.127.

For that reason once such an agreeme nt has been made any review of and adjustment under such agreement shall as to the standards used by the secretary , be made only subject to the provisions of RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145 and such rules and regulations relating thereto as they exist on the date of the initial determination in connec\u00ad tion with such agreement or such more generous standard or parts of such standard as may hereafter be provided for by law or regulation. Once made such an agreement shall constitute a solemn undertaking by the state of Washington with such adoptive parent or parents. The termination of the effective period of RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145 or a decision by the state or federal government to discontinue or reduce general appropr iations made available for the purposes to be served by RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 74.13.145, shall not affect the state's specific continuing obligations to support such adoptions, subject to such annual review and adjustment for all such agreements as have theretofore been entered into by the state. The purpose of this section is to assure any such parent that, upon his consenting to assume the burdens of adopting a hard to place child, the state will not in future so act by way of general reduction of appropri ations for the program authorized by RCW 26.33.320 and 74.13.100 through 7 4.13.145 or ratable reductions, to impair the trust and confidence necessarily reposed by such parent in the state as (1992 Ed.) a condition of such parent taking upon himself the obliga\u00ad tions of parenthood of a difficult to place child. Should the secretary and any such adoptive parent differ as to whether any standard or part of a standard adopted by the secretary after the date of an initial agreement, which standard or part is used by the secretary in making any review and adjustment, is more generous than the standard in effect as of the date of the initial determination with respect to such agreement such adoptive parent may invoke his rights, including all rights of appeal under the fair hearing provisions, available to him under RCW 74.13.127.

(1) Preservice training is recognized as a valuable tool to reduce placement disrup\u00ad tions, the length of time children are in care, and foster parent turnover rates. Preservice training also assists potential foster parents in making their final decisions about foster parenting and assists social service agencies in obtaining inf ormation about whether to approve potential foster parents. (2) Foster parent preservice training shall include information about the potential impact of placement on foster children; social service agency administrative processes; the requirements, responsibilities, expectations, and skills needed to be a foster parent; attachment, separation, and loss issues faced by birth parents, foster children, and foster parents; child management and discipline; birth family relationships ; and helping children leave foster care . Preservi ce training shall assist applicants in making informed decisions about whether they want to be foster parents. Preservice training shall be designed to enable the agency to assess the ability, readiness, and appropri ateness of families to be foster parents. As a decision tool, effective preservice training provides potential foster parents with enough information to make an appropriate decision, affords potential foster parents an opportunity to discuss their decision with others and consider its implications for their family, clarifies foster family expectat ions, presents a realistic picture of what foster parenting involves, and allows potential foster parents to consider and explore the different types of children they might serve. (3) Preservice training shall be completed prior to the issuance of a foster care license, except that the department may, on a case by case basis, issue a written waiver that allows the foster parent to complete the training after licensure , so long as the training is completed within ninety days following licensure.

For purposes of this section, respite care means appropriate, temporary, short-term care for these foster children placed with licensed foster parents. The purpose of this care is to give the foster parents temporary relief from the stresses associated with the care of these foster children. The department shall design a program of respite care that will minimize disrupt ions to the child and will serve foster parents within these priorities, based on input from foster parents, foster parent associations, and reliable research if available. [1990 c 284 \u00a7 8.] following RCW Client information. (1) Except as provided in RCW 70.24.105, whenever a child is placed in out-of\u00ad home care by the department or a child-placi ng agency, the department or agency may share information about the child and the child's family with the care provider and may consult with the care provider regarding the child's case plan. If the child is dependent pursuant to a proceeding under chapter 13.34 RCW, the department or agency shall keep the care provider informed regarding the dates and location of dependency review hearings pertaining to the child. (2) Any person who receives information about a child or a child's family pursuant to this section shall keep the information confidential and shall not further disclose or dissemina te the information except as authorized by law.

Adequate foster parent traini.g has been identified as directly associated with increasing ihe length of time foster parents are willing to provide foster care and reducing the number of placement disruptions for children. Placement disruptions can be harmful to children by denying them consistent and nurturing support. Foster parents have expressed the desire to receive training in addition to the foster parent SCOPE training currently offered. Foster parents who care for more demand\u00ad ing children, such as children with severe emotional, mental, or physical handicaps, would especially benefit from addi\u00ad tional training.

The project shall consist of one state-wide administrator of recruitment programs, and one or more licensed foster care or adoption agency contracts in each of the six depart\u00ad mental regions. These contracts shall enhance currently provided services and may not replace services ,currently funded by the agencies. No more than sixty thousand dollars may be spent annually to fund the administrator position. .

Aid to dependent children: Chapter 74.12 RCW. Purpose- Legislative intent-Chapter to be liberally construed.

The failure of parents to provide adequate financial support and care for their children is a major cause of financial dependency and a contr ibuting cause of social delinquency. The purpose of this chapter is to provide the state of Washington, through the department of social and health services, a more effective and efficient way to effect the support of dependent children by the person or persons who, under the law, are primarily responsible for such support and to lighten the heavy burden of the taxpayer, who in many instances is paying toward the support of dependent children while those persons primarily responsible are avoi ding their obligations. It is the intention of the legislature that the powers delegated to the said department in this chapter be liberally construed to the end that persons legally responsible for the care and support of children within the state be required to assume their legal obligations in order to reduce the financial cost to the state of Washington in providing public assistance funds for the care of children. It is the intention of the legislature that the department provide sufficient staff to carry out the purposes of this chapter, chapter 74.20A RCW, the abandonment and nonsupport statutes, and any applicable federal support enforcement statute administered by the department. It is also the intent of the legislature that the staff responsible for support enforcement be encouraged to conduct their support enforce\u00ad ment duties with fairness, courtesy, and the highest profes\u00ad sional standard s.

Com\u00ad mon law and statutory procedures governing the remedies for enforcement of support for financially dependent minor children by responsible parents have not proven sufficiently effective or efficient to cope with the increasing incidence of financial dependen cy. The increasing workload of courts, prosecuting attorneys, and the attorney general has made such remedies uncertain, slow and inadequate, thereby resulting in a growing burden on the financial resources of the state, which is constrained to provide public assistance grants for basic maintenance requirements when parents fail to meet their primary obligations. The state of Washington, therefore , exercising its police and sovereign power, declares that the common law and statutory remedies pertaining to family desertion and nonsupport of minor dependent children shall be augmented by additional remedies directed to the real and personal property resources of the responsible parents. In order to render resources more immediately (1992 Ed.)

(a) If the responsible parent files the application within twenty days, the department shall schedule an adjudicative proceedi ng to hear the parent 's objection and determine the parents' support obligation for the entire period covered by the notice and finding of financial responsibility. The filing of the application stays collection action pending the entry of a final administrative order; (b) If the responsible parent fails to file an application within twenty days, the notice and finding shall become a final adminis trative order.

The filing of the application does not stay further collection action, pending the entry of a final administrative order, and does not affect any prior collection action; (d) If the responsible parent files the application more than one year after the date of service, the department shall schedule an adjudicative proceeding at which the responsible parent must show good cause for failure to file a timely application. The filing of the application does not stay future collection action and does not affect prior collection action: (i) If the presiding officer finds that good cause exists, the presiding officer shall proceed to hear the parent's objection to the notice and determine the parent's support obligation; (ii) If the presiding officer finds that good cause does not exist, the presiding officer shall treat the application as a petition for prospective modification of the amount for current and future support established under the notice and finding. In the modification proceeding, the presiding officer shall set current and future support under chapter 26.19 RCW. The responsible parent need show neither good cause nor a substantial change of circumstances to justify modifica\u00ad tion of current and future support; (e) The department shall retain and/or shall not refund support money collected more than twenty days after the date of service of the notice. Money withheld as the result of collection action shall be delivered to the departme nt. (1992 Ed.} The department shall distribute such money, as provided in published rules.

If deviating from the child support schedule in making these deter\u00ad minations, the presiding or reviewing officer shall apply the standards contained in the child support schedule and enter written findings of fact supporting the deviation. (6) If the responsible parent fails to attend or participate in the hearing or other stage of an adjudicative proceeding, upon a showing of valid service, the presiding officer shall enter an administrative order declaring the support debt and payment provisions stated in the notice and finding of financial responsibility to be assessed and determined and subject to collection action.

Service of the notice shall be in the same manner as a summons in a civil action or by certified mail, return receipt requested. The notice shall have attached to it a copy of the affidavit and shall state that: (a) The alleged father may file an application for an adjudicative proceeding at which he will be required to appear and show cause why the amount stated in the finding of financial responsibility as to support is incorrect and should not be ordered; (b) An alleged father may request that a blood test be administered to determine whether such test would exclude him from being a natural parent and, if not excluded, may subsequently request that the office of support enforcement [Title 74 RCW-page 67] 74.20A.056 Title 74 RCW: Public Assistance initiate an action in superior court to determine the existence of the parent-child relationship; and (c) If the alleged father does not request that a blood test be administered or file an application for an adjudicative proceedi ng, the amount of support stated in the notice and finding of parental responsibility shall become final, subject only to a subsequent determination under RCW 26.26.060 that the parent-c hild relationship does not exist. (2) An alleged father who objects to the amount of support requested in the notice may file an application for an adjudicative proceeding up to twenty days after the date the notice was served. An application for an adjudicative proceeding may be filed within one year of service of the notice and finding of parental responsibility without the necessity for a showing of good cause or upon a showing of good cause thereafter. An adjudicative proceeding under this section shall be pursuant to RCW 74.20A.05 5. The only issues shall be the amount of the accrued debt, the amount of the current and future support obligation, and the reim\u00ad bursement of the costs of blood tests if advanced by the department. (3) If the application for an adjudicative proceeding is filed within twenty days of service of the notice, collection action shall be stayed pending a final decision by the department. If no application is filed within twenty days: (a) The amounts in the notice shall become final and the debt created therein shall be subject to collection action; and (b) Any amounts so collected shall neither be refunded nor returned if the parent is later found not to be the father. (4) An alleged father who denies being a responsible parent may request that a blood test be admini stered at any time. The request for testing shall be in writing and served on the office of support enforcement personally or by registered or certified mail. If a request for testing is made, the department shall arrange for the test and, pursuant to rules adopted by the department, may advance the cost of such testing. The department shall mail a copy of the test results by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the alleged father's last known address. (5) If the test excludes the alleged father from being a natural parent, the office of support enforcement shall file a copy of the results with the state office of vital statistics and shall dismiss any pending administrative collection proceed\u00ad ings based upon the affidavit in issue. The state office of vital statistics shall remove the alleged father's name from the birth certificate. (6) The alleged father may, within twenty days after the date of receipt of the test results, request the office of support enforcement to initiate an action under RCW 26.26.060 to determine the existence of the parent-child relationship. If the office of support enforcement initiates a superior court action at the request of the alleged father and the decision of the court is that the alleged father is a natural parent, the alleged father shall be liable for court costs incurred. (7) If the alleged father does not request the office of support enforcement to initiate a superior court action, or if the alleged father fails to appear and cooperate with blood testing, the notice of parental responsibil ity shall become final for all intents and purposes and may be overturned only by a subsequent superior court order entered under RCW 26.26.060.

A support obligation arising under the statutes or common law of this state binds the responsi ble parent, present in this state, regardless of the presence or residence of the custodian or children. The obligor is presumed to have been present in the state of Washington during the period for which support is sought until otherwise shown. The department may establish an administ rative order pursuant to RCW 74.20A.055 that is based upon any support obligation imposed or imposable under the statutes or common law of any state in which the obligor was present during the period for which support is sought.

(2) An order of child support may be modified one year or more after it has been entered without showing a substan\u00ad tial change of circumstan ces: (a) If the order in practice works a severe economic hardship on either party or the child; or (b) If a party requests an adjustment in an order for child support that was based on guidelines which determined the amount of support according to the child's age, and the child is no longer in the age category on which the current support amount was based; or (c) If a child is a full-time student and reasonably expected to complete secondary school or the equivalent level of vocational or technical training before the child becomes nineteen years of age upon a finding that there is a need to extend support beyond the eighteenth birthday.

(b) If, pursuant to subsection (4) of this section or (a) of this subsection, the order modifies a child support obligation by more than thirty percent and the change would cause significant hardship, the change may be implemented in two equal increments , one at the time of the entry of the order and the second six months from the entry of the order. Twenty-f our months must pass following the second change before a petition for modification under subsection (4) of this section may be filed. (6) An increase in the wage or salary of the parent or custodian who is receiving the support transf er payments as defined in *section 24 of this act is not a substantial change in circumstances for purposes of modification under subsec\u00ad tion (1)(b) of this section . An obligor's voluntary unemploy\u00ad ment or voluntary underem ployment, by itself, is not a substantial change of circumstanc es. (7) The departm ent shall file the petition and a sup\u00ad porting affidavit with the secretary or the secreta ry's designee when the department petitions for modificati on. (8) The respon sible parent or the physical custodian shall follow the procedures in this chapter for filing an application for an adjudicative proceedi ng to petition for modificat ion.

[1987 c 434 \u00a7 1.] 74.21.020 Intent. The legislature hereby establishes as state policy the goal of economic independence for employable adults receiving public assistance, through employment, training, and education. The legislature finds that children living in families with incomes below the needs standard have reduced opportunities for physical and intellectual development. A family's economic future is frequently not improved by the current program. Therefore, in order to break the cycle of poverty and depende nce, a family independence program is established. Participating families are to receive benefits under this [Title 74 RCW-page 76] program at no less than they would otherwise have been entitled to receive. The legislature intends that the family independence program is operated as a demonstration, which shall be periodically reviewed and modified by the executive com\u00ad mittee to further state policy and to manage the program within resources. The legislature finds that the state has a vital interest in ensuring that citizens who are in economic need are provided appropriate financial assistance. It is the intent of the legislature to maintain the existing partnership between state and federal government and that this program remain part of the federal welfare entitlement program . The legislature seeks federal authority for a five-year demonstration project and recognizes that waivers and congressional action may be required to achieve our purpose. The legislature does not seek a block grant approach to welfare. The legislature recognizes that any program intended to assist new and current public assistance recipients wiJI be more likely to succeed when the state, private sector, and recipients work together. The legislature also recognizes the value of building on successful programs that utilize the development of network\u00ad ing and mentoring strategies to assist public assistance recipients to gain self-sufficiency. The legislature further encourages public-private coopera tion in the areas of job readiness training, education, job training, and work opportu\u00ad nities, including communi ty-based organizations as service providers in these areas through contractual relationships. The legislature finds that the goal of economic inde\u00ad pendence requires increased efforts to assist parents in exercising their children's right to economic support from absent parents. The legislature recognizes the substantial participation in the workforce of women with preschool children , and the difficulty in reentering employment after long absences. The legislature further recognizes that public assistance recipients can play a major role in setting their own goals. The objectives of this chapter are to assure that: The maximum number of recipients of public assistance become independent and self-sufficient through employment, training, and education; caseloads be correspondingly reduced on a long-term basis; financial incentives be available to recipi\u00ad ents participating in job readiness, education, training, and work programs; the number of children growing up in poverty be substanti ally reduced; and unemployable recipi\u00ad ents be afforded a basic level of financial and medical assistance consistent with the state's financial capabilities.

(5) Prior to the determination that a mandatory enrollee has refused to cooperate, efforts must be made at concilia\u00ad tion of the dispute consistent with 45 C.P.R. Sec. 224.63. (6) The agencies shall adopt rules setting forth criteria that provide good cause for an enrollee 's refusal to partici\u00ad pate in or accept a specific assignment of proposed work, educatio n, or training activities. The criteria shall include, but need not be limited to, the following: (a) No suitable child care is available without cost to the enrollee; (b) The assignment is not within the scope of the enrollee's employability plan; (c) The assignment would have an adverse effect on the physical or mental health of the enrollee; (d) The distance of the assignment from the enrollee's home makes participation impractica ble; (e) The assignment would result in a loss of income to the enrollee's family; (f) Exigent personal or family circumstances would interfere with successful participation in the assignm ent; (g) The assignment involves conditions which are in violation of applicable health and safety regulations; (h) The assignment would interrupt a program in process at the undergrad uate or vocational level which is reasona bly expected to result in economic self-suf ficiency; or (i) The best interests of a child or children in the family would be served by the parent providing full or part-time car in the home due to the particular personal or family circumstances of the enrollee's family.

Severability. 74.25.010 State policy-Legislative findings. The legislature establishes as state policy the goal of economic self-sufficiency for employable recipients of public assis\u00ad tance, through employment, training, and education. In fu:therance o this policy, the legislature intends to comply with the reqmrements of the federal social security act, as amended, by creating a job opportu nities and basic skills training program for applicants and recipients of aid to families with dependent children. The purpose of this program is to provide recipients of aid to families with dependent children the opportunity to obtain a full range of necessary education, training, skills, and supportive services including child care, consistent with their needs, that wili hel t?em enter or reenter gainful employment, thereby avmdmg long-term welfare dependence and achieving economic self-sufficiency. The program shall be operated by the department of social and health services in conformance with federal law and consistent with the following legislative findings: (1) The legislature finds that the well-being of children depends not only on meeting their material needs, but also on the ability of parents to become economically self- (1992 Ed.) sufficient. The job opportunities and basic skills training program is specifically directed at increasing the household earnings of aid to families with dependent children recipi\u00ad ents, through the removal of barriers preventing them from achieving self-sufficiency. These barriers include, but are not limited to, the lack of supportive services such as affordable and reliable child care, adequate transportation, appopriate counseling, and necessa ry job-related tools, eqmpment, books, clothing, and supplies, the absence of basic literacy skills, the lack of educational attainment sufficient to meet labor market demands for career employ\u00ad ees, and the nonavailability of useful labor market assess\u00ad ments. (2) The legislature also recognizes that aid to families with dependent children recipients must be acknowledged as active participants in self-sufficiency planning under the program. The legislature finds that the department of social and health services should communicate concepts of personal empowerment, self-moti vation, and self-esteem to program participants. The legislature further recognizes that informed choice is consist ent with individual responsibility, and that parents should be given a range of options for available child care while participating in the program. (3) The legislature finds that education, including, but not limited to, literacy, high school equivalency, vocational, secondary, and postsecondary, is one of the most important tools an individual needs to achieve full independe nce, and that this should be an important component of the program. (4) The legislature further finds that the objectives of this program are to assure that aid to families with dependent children recipients achieve financial stability and an adequate standard of living at wages that will meet family needs.

No contracting entity shall have the authority to review, change, or disapprove any administrative decision, or otherwise substitute its judgment for that of the department of social and health services as to the application of policies and rules adopted by the department of social and health service s. (2) To the extent feasible under federal law, the de\u00ad partment of social and health services and all entities contracting with it shall give first priority of service to individuals volunteering for program participation: PRO\u00ad VIDED, That the department shall require nonexempt parents under age twenty-f our to actively participate in orientation, assessment, and either educati on, vocational training, or employment program s. At least one nonexempt parent in the aid to families with dependent children-employ\u00ad able program shall actively participate in orientation, assessment, and either job search, educatio n, training, or [Title 74 RCW-page 85] 74.25.020 Title 74 RCW: Public Assistance employment. Social services shall be offered to participants in accordance with federal law. The department shall adopt appropriate sanctions to ensure compliance with the require\u00ad ments and policies of this chapter. (3) The department of social and health services shall adopt rules under chapter 34.05 RCW establishing criteria constituting circumstances of good cause for an individual failing or refusing to participate in an assigned program component, or failing or refusing to accept or retain em\u00ad ployment. These criteria shall include, but not be limited to, the following circumstance s: (a) If the individual is a parent or other relative personally providing care for a child under age six years, and the employment would require the individual to work more than twenty hours per week; (b) if child care, or day care for an incapacitated individual living in the same home as a dependent child, is necessary for an individual to participate or continue participation in the program or accept employment, and such care is not avail\u00ad able, and the department of social and health services fails to provide such care; (c) the employment would result in the family of the participant experiencing a net loss of cash income; or (d) circumstances that are beyond the control of the individua l's household, either on a short-term or on an ongoing basis.

The condition of the mentally retarded, severely hand\u00ad icapped and disadvantaged is such that after laborious training in the schools and other wise, they reach the point in their lives where they can and should, under proper and continued guidance, engage in sheltered employment and/or supervised work to help them become contributing members of society instead of being dependent. For such persons, (1992 Ed.) retention in sheltered employment or superv ised work may constitute satisfactory placement. Such training and place\u00ad ment is often a suitable alternative to institutionalization or idleness and its consequences. By keeping these individuals within their communities and in touch with their families, a worthwhile dimension is added to their lives and they are thus spared the anxieties naturally attached to separation. All of these factors have also been shown to reflect tangible benefits upon the mentally retarded, severely handicapped or disadva ntaged person by improving his overall well-being.

Community options program entry system-Waiver\u00ad Respite services. Long-term care commission-Gener ally. Severability- 1989 c 427. 74.39.001 Finding. The legislature finds that: Washington 's chronically functionally disabled popu\u00ad lation is growing at a rapid pace. This growth, along with economic and social changes and the coming age wave, presents opportunities for the development of long-term care communit y services networks and enhanced volunteer participation in those networks, and creates a need for different approaches to currently fragmented long-term care program s. The legislature further recognizes that persons with functional disabilities should receive long-term care services that encourage individual dignity, autonomy, and development of their fullest human potential . [1989 c 427 \u00a7 1.] 74.39.005 Purpose. The pwpose of this chapter is to: (1) Establish a balanced range of community-based health, social, and supportive services that deliver long-t erm care services to chronically, functionally disabled persons of all ages; (2) Ensure that functional disability shall be the deter\u00ad mining factor in defining long-term care service needs and that these needs will be determined by a uniform system for comprehensively assessing functional disability ; (3) Ensure that services are provided in the most independent living situation consistent with individual needs; (4) Ensure that long-term care service options shall be developed and made available that enable functionally disabled persons to continue to live in their homes or other community residential facilities while in the care of their families or other volunteer support persons; [Title 74 RCW-page 96] (5) Ensure that long-term care services are coordinated in a way that minimizes administrative cost, eliminates unnecessarily complex organiza tion, minimizes program and service duplication, and maximizes the use of financial resources in directly meeting the needs of persons with functional limitations; (6) Develop a systematic plan for the coordination, planning, budgeting, and administration of long-term care services now fragmented between the division of develop\u00ad mental disabilities, division of mental health, aging and adult services administration, division of children and family services, division of vocational rehabilitation, office on AIDS, division of health, and bureau of alcohol and sub\u00ad stance abuse; (7) Encourage the development of a state-wide long\u00ad term care case management system that effectively coordi\u00ad nates the plan of care and services provided to eligible clients; (8) Ensure that individuals and organizations affected by or interested in long-term care programs have an opportunity to participate in identification of needs and priorities, policy development, planning, and development, implementation, and monitori ng of state supported long-term care program s; (9) Support educational institutions in Washington state to assist in the procurement of federal support for expanded research and training in long-term care; and (10) Facilitate the development of a coordina ted system of long-term care education that is clearly articulated between all levels of higher education and reflective of both in-home care needs and institutional care needs of function\u00ad ally disabled persons. [1989 c 427 \u00a7 2.] 74.39.010 Option-Flexibility-Title XIX of the federal social security act. A valuable option available to Washington state to achieve the goals of RCW 74.39.001 and 74.39.005 is the flexibilit y in personal care and other long-term care services encouraged by the federal govern\u00ad ment under Title XIX of the federal social security act. These services include options to expand community-based long-term care services, such as adult family homes, congre\u00ad gate care facilities, respite, chore services, hospice, and case manageme nt. [1989 c Opportunities-Increase of federal funds- Title XIX of the federal social security act. Title XIX of the federal social security act offers valuable opportunities to increase federal funds available to provide community-based long-term care services to functionally disabled persons in their homes, and in noninstitutional residential facilities, such as adult family homes and con\u00ad gregate care facilities. [1989 c nity options program entry system-Waiver-Respite services.

The legislature recognizes that: ( 1) Most care provided for functionally disabled adults is delivered by family members or friends who are not [Title 74 RCW-page 97] 74.41.010 Title 74 RCW: Public Assistance compensated for their services. Family involvement is a crucial element for avoiding or postponing institutionalization of the disabled adult. (2) Family or other caregivers who provide continuous care in the home are frequently under substantial stress, physical, psychological, and financial. The stress, if unre\u00ad lieved by family or community support to the caregiver, may lead to premature or unnecessary nursing home placement. (3) Respite care and other community-based supportive services for the caregiver and for the disabled adult could relieve some of the stresses, maintain and strengthen the family structure, and postpone or prevent institutionalizatio n. (4) With family and friends providing the primary care for the disabled adult, supplemented by community health and social services, long-term care may be less costly than if the individual were institutionalized. [1984 c 158 \u00a7 1.] 74.41.020 Intent. It is the intent of the legislature to provide for both in-home and out-of-home respite care services which are provided by a range of service providers. The respite care services shall: (1) Provide relief and support to family or other unpaid caregivers of disabled adults; (2) Encourage individuals to provide care for disabled adults at home, and thus offer a viable alternative to insti\u00ad tutionalizat ion; (3) Ensure that respite care is made generally available on a sliding-f ee basis to eligible participants in the program according to priorities established by the department; (4) Be provided in the least restrictive setting available consistent with the individually assessed needs of the functionally disabled adult; and (5) Include services appropriate to the needs of persons caring for individuals with dementing illnesses .

(1) \"Respite care services\" means relief care for families or other caregivers of disabled adults, eligibility for which shall be determined by the department by rule. The services provide temporary care or supervision of disabled adults in substitution for the caregiver. The term includes social day care. (2) \"Eligible participant\" means an adult (a) who needs substantially continuous care or supervision by reason of his or her functional disability, and (b) who is assessed as requiring institutionalization in the absence of a caregiver assisted by home and community support services, including respite care. (3) \"Caregiver\" means a spouse, relative, or friend who has primary responsibility for the care of a functionally disabled adult, who does not receive financial compensation for the care, and who is assessed as being at risk of placing the eligible participant in a long-term care facility if respite care is not available.

The depart\u00ad ment shall not require the development of plans of care or discharge plans by nursing homes providing respite care service under this chapter. The department shall develop standards for the respite program in conjunction with the selected area agencies on aging. The program standards shall serve as the basis for soliciting bids, entering into subcontracts, and developing sliding fee scales to be used in determining the ability of eligible participants to participate in paying for respite care.

The department shall contract with area agencies on aging or other appro\u00ad priate agencies to conduct respite care projects to the extent of available funding. The responsibilities of the agencies shall include but not be limited to: Negotiating rates of payment, administering sliding-f ee scales to enable eligible participants to participate in paying for respite care, and arranging for respite care services. Rates of payment to respite care service providers shall not exceed, and may be less than, rates paid by the department to providers for the same level of service. In evaluating the need for respite services, consideration shall be given to the men tal and physical ability of the caregiver to perform necessary caregiver functions. [1989 c 427 \u00a7 8; 1987 care program-Criteria. The department shall insure that the respite care program is designed to meet the following criteria: (1) Make maximum use of services which provide care to the greatest number of eligible participants with the fewest number of staff consistent with adequate care; (2) Provide for use of one-on-one care when necessary ; (3) Provide for both day care and overnight care; ( 4) Provide personal care to continue at the same level which the caregiver ordinarily provides to the eligible participant; and (5) Provide for the utilization of family home settings.

(2) The department shall provide a progress report to the legislature on the respite care programs authorized in this (1992 Ed.) Title 74 RCW: Public Assistance 74.41.070 chapter. The report shall at least include a comparison of the relative cost-effecti veness of the services provided under this chapter with all other programs and services which are intended to forestall institutional ization. In addition, the report shall include a similar compari son between in-home and out-of-home respite care services. The department shall make recommendations on the inclusion of respite care services under the senior citizens act for delivery and funding of respite care services described in this chapter. The report shall be provided to the legislature not later than thirty days prior to the 1989 legislative session.

Tangible assets of the following types in which a contractor has an interest through ownership or leasing are subject to depreciat ion: (1) Building -the basic structure or shell and additions thereto; (2) Building fixed equipment -attachments to buildings, including, but not limited to, wiring, electrical fixtures, plumbing, elevators, heating system, and air conditioning system. The general characteristics of this equipment are: (a) Affixed to the building and not subject to transfer; and (b) A fairly long life, but shorter than the life of the building to which affixed; (3) Major movable equipment including, but not limited to, beds, wheelchairs, desks, and x-ray machines. The general characteri stics of this equipment are: (a) A relatively fixed location in the building; (b) Capable of being moved as distinguished from building equipment; (c) A unit cost sufficient to justify ledger control; (d) Sufficient size and identity to make control feasible by means of identification tags; and (e) A minimum life greater than one year; (4) Minor equipment including, but not limited to, waste baskets, bed pans, syringes, catheters, silverware, mops, and buckets which are properly capitalized.

[1980 c 177 \u00a7 34.] 74.46.350 Methods of depreciatio n. (1) Buildings, land improvements, and fixed equipment shall be depreciated using the straight-line method of depreciation. Major-minor equipment shall be depreciated using either the straight- line method, the sum-of-the-years' digits method, or declining balance method not to exceed one hundred fifty percent of the straight line rate. Contractors who have elected to take either the sum-of-the-years ' digits method or the declining balance method of depreciation on major-minor equipment may change to the straight-line method without permission of the department. (2) The annual provision for depreciation shall be reduced by the portion allocable to use of the asset for purposes which are neither necessary nor related to patient care. (3) No further depreciation shall be claimed after an asset has been fully depreciated unless a new depreciation base is established pursuant to RCW 74.46.360. [1980 c 177 \u00a7 35.] 74.46.360 Cost basis of land and depreciation base of depreciable assets. (1) For all partial or whole rate periods after December 31, 1984, the cost basis of l?Dd nd depreciation base of depreciable assets shall be the histoncal cost of the contractor or lessor, when the assets are leased by the contractor, in acquiring the asset in an arm's-length transaction and preparing it for use, less goodwill, and less accumulated depreciati on, if applicable, which has been incurred during periods that the assets have been used in or as a facility by any contractor, such accumulated deprecia\u00ad tion to be measured in accordance with subsections (2), (3), and (4) of this section and RCW 74.46.350 and 74.46.370. If the departm ent challenges the historical cost of an asset, or if the contractor cannot or will not provide the historical costs, the department will have the department of general administration, through an appraisal procedure, determine the fair market value of the assets at the time of purchase . The cost basis of land and depreciation base of depreciable assets will not exceed such fair market value. (2) The historical cost of depreciable and nondeprec iable donated assets, or of depreciable and nondepreciable assets received through testate or intestate distribution, shall be the lesser of: (a) Fair market value at the date of donation or death; or (b) The historical cost base of the owner last contracting with the department, if any. (3) Estimated salvage value of acquired, donated, or inherited assets shall be deducted from historical cost where (1992 Ed.) the straight-line or sum-of-the-years' digits method of depreciation is used. (4)(a) Where land or depreciable assets are acquired that were used in the medical care program subsequent to January 1, 1980, the cost basis or depreciation base of the assets will not exceed the net book value which did exist or would have existed had the assets continued in use under the previous contract with the department; except that deprecia\u00ad tion shall not be assumed to accumulate during periods when the assets were not in use in or as a facility. (b) The provisions of (a) of this subsection shall not apply to the most recent arm's-length acquisition if it occurs at least ten years after the ownership of the assets has been previously transferred in an arm's-length transaction nor to the first arm's-length acquisition that occurs after January 1, 1980, for facilities participating in the medical care program prior to January 1, 1980. The new cost basis or dereciation base for such acquisitions shall not exceed the fair market value of the assets as determined by the department of general administration through an appraisal procedure. A determination by the department of general administration of fair market value shall be final unless the procedure used to make such determination is shown to be arbitrary and capricious. For all partial or whole rate periods after July 17, 1984, this subsection is inoperative for any transfer of ownership of any asset, depreciable or nondepreciable, occurring on or after July 18, 1984, leaving (a) of this subsection to apply alone to such transfers: PROVIDED, HOWEVER, That this subsection shall apply to transfers of ownership of assets occurring prior to January 1, 1985, if the costs of such assets have never been reimbursed under medicaid cost reimbursement on an owner-op erated basis or as a related-party lease: PROVIDED FURTHER, That for any contractor that can document in writing an enforceable agreement for the purchase of a nursing home dated por to July 18, 1984, and submitted to the department pnor to January 1, 1988, the cost basis of allowable land an? the depreciation base of the nursing home, for rates established after July 18, 1984, shall not exceed the fair market value of the assets at the date of purchase as determined by the department of general administration through an appraisal procedure. For medicaid cost reimbursement purposes, an agreement to purchase a nursing home dated prior to July 18, 1984, is enforceable, even though such agreement contains no legal description of the real property involved, notwithstanding the statute of frauds or any other provision of law. (c) In the case of land or depreciab le assets leased by the same contractor since January 1, 1980, in an arm's\u00ad length lease, and purchased by the lessee/contra ctor, the lessee/contractor shall have the option: (i) To have the provisions of subsection (b) of this section apply to the purchase; or (ii) To have the reimbursement for property and return on investment continue to be calculated pursuant to the provisions contained in RCW 74.46.530( 1) (e) and (f) based upon the provisions of the lease in existence on the date of the purchase , but only if the purchase date meets one of the following criteria: (A) The purchase date is after the lessor has declared bankruptcy or has defaulted in any loan or mortgage held against the leased property ; [Title 74 RCW-page 115] 74.46.360 Title 74 RCW: Public Assistance (B) The purchase date is within one year of the lease expiration or renewal date contained in the lease; (C) The purchase date is after a rate setting for the facility in which the reimbursement rate set pursuant to this chapter no longer is equal to or greater than the actual cost of the lease; or (D) The purchase date is within one year of any purchase option in existence on January 1, 1988. (d) For all rate periods past or future where land or depreciable assets are acquired from a related organization, the contractor's cost basis and depreciation base shall not exceed the base the related org anization had or would have had under a contract with the departm ent. (e) Where the land or depreciable asset is a donation or distribution between related organizations, the cost basis or depreciation base shall be the lesser of (i) fair market value, less salvage value, or (ii) the cost basis or depreciation base the related organization had or would have had for the asset under a contract with the department.

(1) Except for new buildings, the contractor shall use lives which reflect the estimated actual useful life of the asset and which shall be no shorter than guideline lives as established by the de\u00ad partment. The shortest life which may be used for new buildings is thirty years. Lives shall be measured from the date on which the assets were first used in the medical care program or from the date of the most recent arm's-length acquisition of the asset, whichever is more recent. In cases where RCW 74.46.36 0(4)(a) does apply, the shortest life that may be used for buildings is the remaining useful life under the prior contract. In all cases, lives shall be extended to reflect periods, if any, when assets were not used in or as a facility. (2) Building improvements shall be depreciated over the remaining useful life of the building, as modified by the improvement. (3) Improvements to leased property which are the responsibility of the contractor under the terms of the lease shall be depreciated over the useful life of the improvement.

(1) Where depreciable assets are disposed of through sale, trade-in, scrapping, exchange, theft, wrecking, or fire or other casualty, depreciation shall no longer be taken on the assets. No further depreciation shall be taken on permanently abandoned assets. (2) Where an asset has been retired from active use but is being held for stand-by or emergency service, and the department has determined that it is needed and can be effectively used in the future, depreciation may be taken. (3) If there is a sale of a nursing facility on or after July 1, 1991, that results in a gain on sale, the actual reimburse- [Title 74 RCW-page 116] ment for depreciation paid to the selling contractor through the medicaid reimbursement program shall be recovered by the department to the extent of any gain on sale. The purchaser is obligated to reimburse the departm ent, whether or not the purchaser is a medicaid contractor. If the depart\u00ad ment is unable to collect from the purchaser, then the seller is responsible for reimbursing the department. The depart\u00ad ment may establish an appropriate repayment schedule to recover depreciation. If the purchaser is a medicaid contrac\u00ad tor and the contractor does not comply with the repayment schedule established by the department, the department may deduct the recovery from the contractor's monthly medicaid payments. The department may adopt rules, as appropriate, to insure that the principles of this section are implemented with respect to leased assets, or with respect to sales of intangibles or specific assets only.

The following principles are inherent in RCW 74.46.430 through 74.46.590: (1) Reimbursement rates will be set prospectively on a per patient day basis; and (2) The rates so established will be adjusted for eco\u00ad nomic conditions and trends in accordance with appropria\u00ad tions made by the legislature as consistent with federal requirements for the period to be covered by such rates. [1985 c 361 \u00a7 18; 1983 1st note following RCW 74.46.020. 74.46.430 Prospective reimbursement rates\u00ad Minimum hourly wages. ( 1) The department, as provided by this chapter, will determine prospective cost-rel ated reimbursement rates for services provided to medical care recipients. Each rate so determined shall represent the contracto r's maximum compensation within each cost center for each patient day for such medical care recipient. (2) As required, the departm ent may mod ify such maximum per patient day rates pursuant to the administrative review provisions of RCW 74.46.780. (3) Until the effective date of RCW 74.46.5 10 and 74.46.530, the maximum prospective reimbursement rates for the adminis tration and operations and the property cost centers shall be established based upon a minimum facility occupancy level of eighty-five percent. (4) On and after the effective date of RCW 74.46.510 and 74.46.530, the maximum prospective reimbursement rates for the administration and operations and the property cost centers and the return on investment allowance shall be established based upon a minimum facility occupancy level of eighty-five percent. (5) All contractors shall be required to adjust and maintain wages for all employees to a minimum hourly wage established by the legislature in the biennial appropriations act, if the legislature appropriates moneys to fund prospec\u00ad tively the portion of the minimum wage attributab le to services to medicaid patients. Prospective rate revisions to fund any minimum wage increases shall be made only on the dates authorized in the appropriation act. The department shall by regulation limit reimbursement to the amount appropriated for legislatively authorized enhancement for nonadmini strative wages and benefits above the moneys necessary to fund minimum wages specified in this section. The department in considering reimbursement for legislative\u00ad ly authorized wage enhancements will take into consideration facility wage history over the past three cost report periods.

(1) Prospective reimbursement rates for a new contractor will be established within sixty days following receipt by the departm ent of the properly completed projected budget required by RCW 74.46.670. Such reimbursement rates will become effective as of the effective date of the contract and shall remain in effect until rates can be established under RCW 74.46.460 based on a contractor 's cost report including at least six months of cost data. (2) Such reimbursement rates will be based on the contracto r's projected cost of operations and on costs and [Title 74 RCW-page 118] payment rates of the prior contractor, if any, or of other contractors in comparab le circumstances. (3) If a properly completed budget is not received at least sixty days prior to the effective date of the contract, the department will establish preliminary rates based on the other factors specified in subsection (2) of this section. These preliminary rates will remain in effect until a deter\u00ad mination is made pursuant to RCW 74.46.460. [1983 Rate determination or adjustment\u00ad When-Basis. (1) Each contracto r's reimbursement rates will be determined prospectively at least once each calendar year, to be effective July 1st. (2) Rates may be adjusted as determined by the de\u00ad partment to take into account variations in the distribution of patient classifications or changes in patient characteri stics from the prior reporting year, program changes required by the department, or changes in staffing levels at a facility required by the department. Rates shall be adjusted by the amount of legislatively authorized enhancements in accor\u00ad dance with RCW 74.46.430(5) and 74.46.470(2). Rates may also be adjusted to cover costs associated with placing a nursing home in receivership which costs are not covered by the rate of the former contractor, including: Compensation of the receiver, reasonable expenses of receivership and transition of control, and costs incurred by the receiver in carrying out court instructions or rectifying deficiencies found. Rates shall be adjusted for any capitalized additions or replacements made as a condition for licensure or certifi\u00ad cation. Rates shall be adjusted for capitalized improvements done under RCW 74.46.465. (3) Where the contractor participated in the provisions of prospective cost-related reimbursement in effect prior to July 1, 1983, such contractor 's prospective rate effective July 1, 1983, will be determined utilizing the contracto r's desk\u00ad reviewed allowable costs for calendar year 1982. (4) All prospective reimbursement rates for 1984 and thereafter shall be determined utilizing the prior year's desk\u00ad reviewed cost reports. [1987 c 476 \u00a7 3; 1985 following RCW 18.51.010. 74.46.465 Rate adjustment for physical plant capital improvements. (1) The departm ent, in consultation with interested parties, shall adopt rules to establish criteria the department will use in reviewing any request by a contractor for a prospective rate adjustment for a physical plant capital improvement. The rules shall also specify the time periods for submission and review of proposed physical plant capital improvements. In establishing the criteria, the departme nt may consider, but is not limited to, the following: (a) The remaining functional life of the facility and the length of time since the facility's last significant improve\u00ad ment; (b) The amount and scope of renovation or remodel to the facility and whether the facility will be able to serve better the needs of its residents ; (1992 Ed.) Title 74 RCW: Public Assistance 74.46.465 (c) Whether the proposed improvement improves the quality of the living condition s of the residents; (d) Whether the proposed improvement might eliminate life safety, building code, or construction standard waivers; (e) The percentage of public-pay residents in the facility. (2) Rate adjustments under this section may be provided only if funds are appropriated for this purpose. [1987 c 476 \u00a7 8.] 74.46.470 Cost centers. (1) A contractor's reim\u00ad bursement rates for medical care recipients will be deter\u00ad mined utilizing desk-reviewed cost report data within the following cost centers: (a) Nursing services; (b) Food; (c) Administration and operations; and (d) Property. (2) There shall be an enhancement cost center estab\u00ad lished to reimburse contractors for specific legislatively authorized enhancements for nonadministrative wages and benefits to ensure that such enhancements are used exclu\u00ad sively for the legislatively authorized purposes. For pur\u00ad poses of settlement, funds appropriated to this cost center shall only be used for expenditures for which the legislative authorization is granted. Such funds may be used only in the following circumstan ces: (a) The contractor has increased expenditures for which legislative authorization is granted to at least the highest level paid in any of the last three cost years, plus, beginning July 1, 1987, any percentage inflation adjustment granted each year under RCW 74.46.495; and (b) All funds shifted from the enhancement cost center are shown to have been expended for legislatively authorized enhancements . (3) If the contractor does not spend the amount appro\u00ad priated to this cost center in the legislatively authorized manner, then the amounts not appropriately spent shall be recouped at preliminary or final settlement pursuant to RCW 74.46.160. (4) For purposes of this section, \"nonadmin istrative wages and benefits\" means wages and payroll taxes paid with respect to, and the employer share of the cost of benefits provided to, employees in job classes specified in an appropriation, which may not include administrators, assistant administrators, or administr ators in training. (5) Amounts expended in the enhancement cost center in excess of the minimum wage established under RCW 74.46.430 are subject to all provisions contained in this chapter.

(1) The department sha11 analyze the submitted cost report of each contractor to determine if the information is correct, complete, and reported in conformance with generally accepted accounting principles, the requirements of this chapter and such rules and regulations as the secretary may adopt. If the analysis finds that the cost report is incorrect or incomplete, the department may make adjustments to the reported informa\u00ad tion for purposes of establishing reimbursement rates. A (1992 Ed.) schedule of such adjustments shall be provided to contractors and shall include an explanation for the adjustment and the dollar amount of the adjustment. Adjustments shall be subject to review and appeal as provided in this chapter. (2) The department shall accumulate data from properly completed cost reports for use in: (a) Exception profiling; and (b) Establishing rates. (3) The department may further utilize such accumulated data for analytical, statistical, or informational purposes as necessary. [1985 c 361 \u00a7 13; See RCW 74.46.020. 74.46.481 Nursing services cost center reimburse\u00ad ment rate. (1) The nursing services cost center shall include all costs related to the direct provision of nursing and related care, including fringe benefits and payroll taxes for the nursing and related care personnel. For rates effective for state fiscal year 1984, the department shaH adopt by administrative rule a definition of \"related care\" which shall incorporate, but not exceed services reimbursab le as of June 30, 1983. For rates effective for state fiscal year 1985, the definition of related care shaH include ancillary care. For rates effective after June 30, 1991, nursing services costs, as reimbursed within this chapter and as tested for reasonab leness within this section, shall not include costs of any purchased nursing care services, including registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, and nurse assistant services, obtained through service contract arrange\u00ad ment in excess of the amount of compensation paid for such hours of nursing care service had they been paid at the average hourly wage, including related taxes and benefits, for in-house nursing care staff of like classification at the same nursing facility, as reported in the most recent cost report period. (2) The departm ent shall adopt by administrative rules a method for establishing a nursing services cost center rate consistent with the principles stated in this section. (3) Utilizing regression or other statistical technique, the department shall determine a reasona ble limit on facility nursing staff taking into account facility patient charac\u00ad teristics. For purposes of this section, facility nursing staff refers to registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and nursing assistants employed by the facility or obtained through temporary labor contract arrangements. Effective January 1, 1988, the hours associated with the training of nursing assistants and the supervision of that training for nursing assistants shall not be included in the calculation of facility nursing staff. In selecting a measure of patient characteri stics, the departm ent shall take into account: (a) The correlation between alternative measures and facility nursing staff; and (b) The cost of collecting information for and compu\u00ad tation of a measure. If regression is used, the limit shall be set at predicted nursing staff plus 1.75 regression standard errors. If another statistical method is utilized, the limit shall be set at a level corresponding to 1. 75 standard errors above predicted staffing computed according to a regression procedure . (4) No facility shall receive reimbursement for nursing staff levels in excess of the limit, except that, if a facility [Title 74 RCW-page 1191 74.46.481 Title 74 RCW: Public Assistance was reimbursed for a nursing staff level in excess of the limit as of June 30, 1983, the facility may chose [choose] to continue to receive its June, 1983 nursing services rate plus any adjustments in rates, such as adjustments for economic trends, made available to all facilities. However, nursing staff levels established under subsection (3) of this section shall not apply to the nursing services cost center reimburse\u00ad ment rate for the pilot facility especially designed to meet the needs of persons living with AIDS as defined by RCW 70.24.017 and specifically authorized for this purpose under the 1989 amendment to the Washington state health plan. The reasonableness limit established pursuant to this subsec\u00ad tion shall remain in effect for the period July 1, 1983 through June 30, 1985. At that time the department may revise the measure of patient characteri stics or method used to establish the limit. (5) The department shall select an index of cost increase relevant to the nursing and related services cost area. In the absence of a more representative index, the department shall use the medical care component index as maintained by the United States bureau of labor statistics. (6) If a facility's nursing staff level is below the limit specified in subsection (3) of this section, the departm ent shall determine the percentage increase for all items included in the nursing services cost center between the facility's most recent cost reporting period and the next prior cost reporting period. (a) If the percentage cost increase for a facility is below the increase in the selected index for the same time period, the facility's reimbursement rate in the nursing services cost center shall equal the facility's cost from the most recent cost reporting period plus any allowance for inflation provided by legislative appropri ation. (b) If the percentage cost increase for a facility exceeds the increase in the selected index, the department shall limit the cost used for setting the facil ity's rate in the nursing services cost area to a level reflecting the increase in the selected index. (7) If the facility's nursing staff level exceeds the reasonableness limit established in subsection (3) of this section, the department shall determine the increase for all items included in the nursing services cost center between the facility's most recent cost reporting period and the next prior cost reporting period. (a) If the percentage cost increase for a facility is below the increase in the index selected pursuant to subsection (5) of this section, the facility's reimbursement rate in the nursing cost center shall equal the facility's cost from the most recent cost reporting period adjusted downward to reflect the limit on nursing staff, plus any allowance for inflation provided by legislative appropri ation subject to the provisions of subsection (4) of this section. (b) If the percentage cost increase for a facility exceeds the increase in the selected index, the department shall limit the cost used for setting the facility's rate in the nursing services cost center to a level reflecting the nursing staff limit and the cost increase limit, subject to the provisions of subsection (4) of this section, plus any allowance for inflation provided by legislative appropri ation. (8) Prospective rates for the nursing services cost center, for state fiscal year 1992 only, shall not be subject to the cost growth index lid in subsections (5), (6), and (7) of this [Title 74 RCW-page 120] section. The lid shall apply for state fiscal year 1991 rate setting and all state fiscal years subsequent to fiscal year 1992. (9) The department is authorized to determine on a systematic basis facilities with unmet patient care service needs. The department may increase the nursing services cost center prospective rate for a facility beyond the level determined in accordance with subsection (6) of this section if the facility's actual and reported nursing staffing is one standard error or more below predicted staffing as deter\u00ad mined according to the method selected pursuant to subsec\u00ad tion (3) of this section and the facility has unmet patient care service needs: PROVIDED, That prospective rate increases authorized by this subsection shall be funded only from legislative appropri ations made for this purpose and the increases shall be conditioned on specified improvements in patient care at such facilities. ( 1 0) The department shall establish a method for identifying patients with exceptional care requirements and a method for establishing or negotiating on a consistent basis rates for such patients. (11) The departm ent, in consultation with interested parties, shall adopt rules to establish the criteria the de\u00ad partment will use in reviewing any requests by a contractor for a prospective rate adjustment to be used to increase the number of nursing staff. These rules shall also specify the time period for submission and review of staffing req uests: PROVIDED, That a decision on a staffing request shall not take longer than sixty days from the date the department receives such a complete request. In establishing the criteria, the department may consider, but is not limited to, the following: (a) Increases in acuity levels of contractors ' residents ; (b) Staffing patterns for similar facilities; (c) Physical plant of contractor; and (d) Survey, inspection of care, and department consul\u00ad tation results.

(ii) The department shall then compute the variable return allowance by multiplying the appropriate percentage amounts, which shall not be less than one percent and not greater than four percent, by the total prospective rate for each facility, as determined in RCW 74.46.450 through 7 4.46.51 0. The percentage amounts will be based on groupings of facilities according to the rankings as estab\u00ad lished in (i) of this subsection (l)(c). Those groups of facilities with lower per diem costs shall receive higher percentage amounts than those with higher per diem costs. (d) The sum of the financing allowance and the variable return allowance shall be the return on investment for each facility, and shall be added to the prospective rates of each contractor as determined in RCW 74.46.450 through 74.46.510. (e) In the case of a facility which was leased by the contractor as of January I, 1980, in an arm's-length agree- [Title 74 RCW-page 121] 74.46.530 Title 74 RCW: Public Assistance ment, which continues to be leased under the same lease agreement, and for which the annualized lease payment, plus any interest and depreciation expenses associated with contractor-owned assets, for the period covered by the prospective rates, divided by the contract or's total patient days, minus the property cost center determined according to RCW 74.46.510, is more than the return on investment allowance determined according to subsection (1)(d) of this section, the following shall apply: (i) The financing allowance shall be recomputed substituting the fair market value of the assets as of January 1, 1982, as determined by the department of gene ral admin\u00ad istration through an appraisal procedure, less accumulated depreciation on the lessor's assets since January 1, 1982, for the net book value of the assets in determining net invested funds for the facility. A determination by the department of general administration of fair market value shall be final unless the procedure used to make such determination is shown to be arbitrary and capricious. (ii) The sum of the financing allowance computed under subsection (1)(e)(i) of this section and the variable allowance shall be compared to the annualized lease payment, plus any interest and depreciation expenses associated with contractor\u00ad owned assets, for the period covered by the prospective rates, divided by the contracto r's total patient days, minus the property cost center rate determined according to RCW 74.46.510. The lesser of the two amounts shall be called the alternate return on investment allowance. (iii) The return on investment allowance determined according to subsection (l)(d) of this section or the alternate return on investment allowance, whichever is greater, shall be the return on investment allowance for the facility and shall be added to the prospective rates of the contractor as determined in RCW 74.46.450 through 74.46.510. (f) In the case of a facility which was leased by the contractor as of January 1, 1980, in an arm's-length agree\u00ad ment, if the lease is renewed or extended pursuant to a provision of the lease, the treatment provided in subsection (l)(e) of this section shall be applied except that in the case of renewals or extensions made subsequent to April 1, 1985, reimbursement for the annualized lease payment shall be no greater than the reimbursement for the annualized lease payment for the last year prior to the renewal or extension of the lease. (2) In the event that the department of health and human services disallows the application of the return on investment allowances to nonprofit facilities, the department shall modify the measurements of net invested funds used for computing individual facility return on investme nt allowanc\u00ad es as follows: Net invested funds for each nonprofit facility shall be multiplied by one minus the ratio of equity funds to the net invested funds of all nonprofit facilities. (3) Each biennium, beginning in 1985, the secretary shall review the adequacy of return on investment allow\u00ad ances in relation to anticipated requirements for maintaining, reducing, or expanding nursing care capacity. The secretary shall report the results of such review to the legislature and make recommendations for adjustments in the return on investment rates utilized in this section, if appropriate.

Treatment services-Eligib ility. Shelter assistance program. County multipurpose diagnostic center or detention center. Rules-Discontinuance of service. Short title. Alcoholism, intoxication, and drug addiction treatment: Chapters 70.96 and f\"mdings. The legislature finds: (1) There is a need for reevaluation of state policies and programs regarding indigent alcoholics and drug addicts; (2) The practice of providing a cash grant may be causing rapid caseload growth and attracting transients to the state; (3) Many chronic public inebriates have been recycled through county detoxification centers repeatedly without apparent improvement; (4) The assumption that all individuals will recover through treatment has not been substantiated; (5) The state must modify its policies and programs for alcoholics and drug addicts and redirect its resources in the interests of these individuals, the community, and the taxpayers ; and (6) Treatment resources should be focused on persons willing to commit to rehabilitation; and (7) It is the intent of the legislature that, to the extent possible, shelter services be developed under this chapter that do not result in the displacement of existing emergency shelter beds. To the extent that shelter operators do not object, it is the intent of the legislature that any vacant shelter beds contracted for under this chapter be made available to provide emergency temporary shelter to home\u00ad less individua ls. [1988 c 163 \u00a7 1; 1987 c 406 \u00a7 2.] 74.50.011 Additional legislative findings. The legislature recognizes that alcoholism and drug addiction are treatable diseases and that most persons with this illness can recover. For this reason, this chapter provides a range of {1992 Ed.) substance abuse treatment services. In addition, the legisla\u00ad ture recognizes that when these diseases have progressed to the stage where a person's alcoholism or drug addiction has resulted in physiological or organic damage or cognitive impairment, shelter services may be appropriate. The legislature further recognizes that distinguishing alcoholics and drug addicts from persons incapacitated due to physical disability or mental illness is necessary in order to provide an incentive for alcoholics and drug addicts to seek appropri\u00ad ate treatm ent and in order to avoid use of programs that are not oriented toward their conditions.
