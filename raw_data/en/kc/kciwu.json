The conference brought together some eighty philos o- phers of religion and researchers from related disciplines, most of them co m- ing from one of the four founding regions of the ESPR, viz. the English spea k- ing region , the North -European region, the German speaking and the Dutch speaking region. Because of the excellent reputation of these conferences over the years, scholars from Eastern and Southern Europe, and even from some non -European countries also participated, thereby enlivening and broa dening the discussions about the conference theme . As usual at ESPR conferences, the 2012 conference theme was so chosen that it lent itself to both analytical and continental ap proaches and to the conversation between the two. Moreover, the study of 'emb odied religion ' - for this was the theme - cannot take place in isolation, but needs the input from various other disc i- plines. This is reflected in the current volume. The study of religion is often marred by a mentalistic bias. Religion is then interprete d as primarily belonging to the sphere of the spiritual. While it is true that for most religious traditions (Christian as well as non -Christian) God is a spiritual and disembodied being, even the presence of God is always 2 PETER JONKERS & MARCEL SAROT a mediated presence, and it may w ell be argued that this mediation is always material in character.1 It is one -sided to approach religion through the study of convictions, concepts, values and arguments only. Religions are also typ i- cally very down to earth, dealing with issues of sexualit y, reproduction and family, with practices about food, offering and sacrifice, questions of birth and death etc. Hence the human body is always involved in the concepts and practices of religions. Furthermore religions also express themselves in var i- ous ma terial ways, such as in icons and (other) works of art, in prayers, songs and the liturgy, which all have a strong physical component, in the inscri p- tion of the religious in the human body (e.g. the sacraments, the ritual of ci r- cumcision, and stigmata), an d last but not least in a religiously inspired di s- ciplining of the human body. Thus, even spirituality is often embodied.2 The idea that religion is something purely spiritual is challenged in a di f- ferent way as well, namely by recent developments in neuro science. The fin d- ings of neuroscience challenge philosophy of religion to rethink those chara c- teristics of human nature that are vital for religion, such as free will, altruism, morality, and last but not least the human person as a 'self .' Some of the more extreme forms of neuroscience go as far as to suggest that a complete material explanation of human nature is in sight, thus annihilating, together with the spiritual dimension of the human person, the spiritual dimension of religion. In order to have a fruitful discussion between philosophy of religion and ne u- roscience it is imperative to avoid such a reductionism. But, at the same time, it is clear that neuroscientific research sheds an intriguing light on the que s- tion what it means when people call themselves religious. This gives ample support for the two underlying theses of the contrib u- tions to this conference volume. First, that religion is always embodied in va r- ious ways: on the level of God's presence in humans, on that of the mul titude of ways in which people express their religiosity, and on that of the neurolog i- cal processes that accompany religious feelings and attitudes. Second, that major changes in the basic anthropological concepts regarding the human body inevitably have a n impact upon religion, and thus also challenge philo s- ophy of religion to rethink how religions are embodied in the human person. 1 See, e.g., Birgit Meyer, Mediation and the Genesis of Presence: Towards a Material Approach to Religion (Utrecht: Utrecht University, 2012), 8 -9. 2 See, e.g., Willem Marie Speelman, God Franciscus en Clara (Leeuwarden: Discovery Books, 2012). INTRODUCTION 3 The papers included in this volume highlight the complexity of the co n- ference -theme as well as the variety of philosophical p erspectives that are taken in order to understand the phenomenon of embodied religion. They differ in style, method and in their ways to relate to culture and science. To give an example, i t was in the wake of the rise of phenomenology and its co n- cept of the 'body as subject' that theological anthropology and (continental) philosophy of religion started to pay systematic attention to the impact of r e- ligion on the human body in general and to various shapes of religious e m- bodiment in particular. Similarly, analytic philosophy has always been strong in examining the effects of scientific discoveries on the traditional idea of the human person as a free, morally responsible, spiritual being. One of the goals of the conference was to foster a dialogue between t hese approaches, resulting in a better view of the promising perspectives, concepts and arguments that philosophy of religion can use in order answer the questions raised by the new developments in our understanding of human nature. This volume starts wit h the keynote address by Ola Sigurdson, in which he discusses different perspectives on (religious) embodiment, particularly stemming from (the history of) culture and modern medicine. Sigurdson e x- plains that, because of the current hegemony of medicine (i ncluding neuro - science), the personal as well as the social dimension of religious embodiment is lost out of sight. Hence, he stresses the need of a non -reductive approach of religious embodiment, which is exactly what the contributions to this volume, taken together, try to achieve. In order to structure the great variety of perspectives on embodied reli g- ion somewhat of the conference, we divided the general conference theme into four subthemes and asked the main speakers to comment on it. Their contributi ons to this volume are arranged accordingly. The first subtheme is embodied religion: a philosophical reflection on mystical experiences and rel i- gious disciplining. In all religious traditions there are numerous examples of how religion does not only chang e the human mind (e.g. through conversion), but also affects the human body directly (e.g. various mystical experiences, including the so -called stigmata as an extreme example) and indirectly (e.g. through the moral and doctrinal teachings of religions, ph ysical disciplining etc.). Can philosophy of religion offer (new) anthropological concepts to u n- derstand the corporeal impact of religion? Moreover, do these insights enable philosophy of religion to criticise problematic aspects of religious embod i- ment? I n their papers, Jonna Bornemark and Petruschka Schaafsma comment on these questions. Bornemark takes a Christian mystic text as her point of 4 PETER JONKERS & MARCEL SAROT departure in order to present a phenomenological analysis of sensibility as the meeting place between the soul and God. Schaafsma treats the same question as Bornemark by turning to the book of Hosea, investigating different motives of embodiment in the text. In particular, she explores the body -related n o- tions of 'dependence' and 'discernment .' The second subtheme dea ls with rituals and sacraments as embodiments of God, and asks if this takes us beyond a purely symbolic religion. In all reli g- ions rituals play a crucial role in making the presence of God or the Divine felt by humans. In the (Catholic) theology of the Eu charist the real presence of God is expressed through the doctrine of the transubstantiation. But other sacraments and rituals can also be considered as material expressions of a spiritual reality. Can philosophy of religion make sense of these embodiments of God and does it influence our view of magical practices? In his paper, Mark Wynn starts his answer to these questions by noting some of the ways in which human beings can be attuned in bodily terms to place -relative 'existe n- tial meanings .' He then exte nds this case to the religious domain, by exami n- ing the nature of sacred sites and the role of religious concepts in aesthetic experience. In his reply to Wynn, Roderich Barth reconstructs religious exp e- rience in the context of a symbol theory that incorpo rates insights of phil o- sophical anthropology and the contemporary theory of emotion. The third subtheme focuses on the issue of neuroscience and free will, and asks whether we still can say that we are called to be free. It is aimed at various ways to rethink free will in light of recent empirical research that seems to imply that decisions are made in the brain before we are aware of them. Do these scientific insights present an adequate understanding of the philosoph i- cal concept of the free will, and, if so, can we still say with Paul that we are called to be free (Gal. 5:13)? In his contribution to this subtheme, Marcel Sarot evaluates neuroscientific experiments on free will, especially Benjamin Libet's experiments. He argues that Libet's experiments do not decide the debate b e- tween compatibilist and incompatibilist conceptions of free will, nor do they count against the libertarian conception of free will. In his response paper, Aku Visala first argues that the nature of our freedom and what is requi red for are outside the sciences. He then shows that the positive function of neurosc i- ence in this context is to highlight the fact that some of our actions are driven by causal factors which we have not previously recognised and which we have no control o ver. The final subtheme deals with another aspect of the relation between a scientific outlook on the body and its implications for religion. Its title was: INTRODUCTION 5 Religion, Morality and Being Human: What about 'Thy will be done'? It is about psychobiological and etiological research, suggesting that certain degrees of moral consciousness and behaviour are found not only among human beings, but also among animals, especially primates. This seems to suggest that m o- rality is not specifically human. If this insight i s true, it obviously challenges the idea of human's unique dignity, which is supported by the religious co n- viction that humans are children of God par excellence. Furthermore, does the religious commandment that humans are called upon to do the will of God then still make sense? In his paper, Dalferth addresses these questions by f o- cusing on the concept of human dignity, a controversial concept in contemp o- rary philosophy and policy. F rom a Kantian and Christian perspective, 'dign i- ty' is best understood as a n orienting term which which calls attention to the humane vs. inhumane way of life to which we commit ourselves when we a s- cribe dignity to others and ourselves. From a Christian point of view, this h u- mane way of life is a consequence of acknowledging the basic passivity of h u- man life with respect to what is made possible in and for us through the gift of the love of God. In his response, Cottingham argues that the inalienable di g- nity of all human beings is independent of circumstances, capacities, or qual i- fications. Kantian autonomy (construed as the rational will, or the ability to exercise it) cannot ground such a notion. The roots of universal human di g- nity are more plausibly traced to the Judaeo -Christian worldview in which God loves all his children eq ually, despite their vulnerability and weakness. To mature morally is to come to realize that we gain nothing by insisting on our status, or 'standing on our dignity'; we should recognize instead the depen d- ency we share with all our neighbours. The final p art of this volume consists of a selected number of short - papers that were presented during the conference by junior as well as senior researchers. Besides quality, the main selection criterion was whether the p a- pers connected to one of the four subthemes. 6 PETER JONKERS & MARCEL SAROT 7 1 Religious Embodiment between Medicine and Modernity OLA SIGURDSON University of Gothenburg ABSTRACT In this essay, I discuss how religious embodiment has been and is conceived in relation to other perspectives on embodiment such as the role of medicin e in modernity. My focus is on the cultural repr e- sentation of embodiment, and the theoretical perspective is ph e- nomenological and hermeneutical. I start out from an account of the dissection of the abbess Chiara of Montefalco's body in 1308 to show how even such a practice as the cutting open of bodies takes on meaning in relation to its context, from the religious search for ind i- cations of sancti ty to medical autopsies. This is an example of a hi s- torical displacement of the meaning of embodiment, an d to talk r e- sponsibly about embodiment in a philosophical context also means to take into account the historicity of embodiment. For a philosophy of religion, then, it is a challenge to talk about religious embodiment in a modern context where medicine h as become hegemonic in the cu l- tural representation of the body, turning the body into, in essence, a manipulable object. For religion, defined as the subjective, this means that the personal as well as the social embodiment of faith is lost sight of in a pro cess of 'excarnation .' For the religious body to occur today in any meaningful sense, there is a need of a refiguration of the understanding of embodiment as such, which can be achieved through phenomenological accounts of embodiment . I end the article with some suggestions how this might look. 8 OLA SIGURDSON KEYWORDS embodiment, the body and history, medicine and modernity, med i- cine and embodiment, religion and the body, excarnation INTRODUCTION In August 1308, the abbess Chiara of Montefalco died in her monastery. As she was considered to be both a renowned ascetic and a visionary, her fe l- low nuns decided to embalm her so as to preserve her body on account of her holiness. On the Italian peninsula at this time, embalmment by evisceration was coming into practice, and to perform this, Chiara's body was to be opened. She was consequently cut open by one of her sisters and both her viscera and her heart were taken out to be buried on separately . The follo w- ing day, her fellow nuns continued their explorations of her innar ds, event u- ally finding a cross in he r opened heart. A further examin ation of her heart showed even further symbols of the crucifixion, and in her gallbladder three small stones, referring to the trinity, w ere discovered. The miraculous wor k- ings of the hear t were considered to be further proof of Chiara's holiness. The reason we know anything about this death and consequent disse c- tion is because of the testimony given by her fellow sister Francesca of Mo n- tefalco. In her account, Francesca gives two reasons f or opening Chiara's body: preserving her body by embalming it but also hoping to find something 'wonderful' in her heart. Embalmment was seen as a short -term measure, stabilizing the corpse for a couple of days , so that it could be laid on display. The hop e was, of course, that Chiara's body would prove to be a miracle - working relic, and this hope catered, to put it in modern terms, not only to religious but also to civic interests, since this could enhance the reputation of the city in question, attracting pilgrims. Further, the cutting open of Chiara's body took place in accordance with contemporary medicine; Sister Francesca was the daughter of a physician. There seem to be at least three contexts i n- volved in the dissection of Chiara of Montefalco, then: religious, civic and medical. As Katharine Park amply has demons trated, in an account from which I took this example, this period in the Middle Ages was no stranger to human dissection.1 Through 'Holy Anatomy ,' evidence for a person's sanctity could hopefully be produced. These dissections were, if not common, then at 1 This example is from Katharine Park, Secrets of Women: Gender, Generation, and the Origins of Human Dissection (New York 2010), 39 -47. RELIGIOUS EMBODIMENT BETWEEN M EDICINE AND M ODERNITY 9 least uncontroversial. Far from being some kind of religious taboo, dissection was practised for a number of purposes, some of them religious. Tha t the church at that time was hostile towards dissection is a misconception, wid e- spread despite the work of many medievalists.2 Bodies, especially women's bodies, were cut open for several reasons: authenticating sanctity, establis h- ing evidence in a crimin al case, Caesarean section and, increasingly, to gain anatomical knowledge. These practices were often associated, conceptually as well as practically. Dissection of the body was, at that time, not primarily seen as a medical procedure. Except for the (rar e) public dissection of bodies for medical research exclusively, which was performed on executed foreign criminals and was considered dishon ouring, opening up the body was most commonly a practice for the cultural and social elite. Medical expertise was, however, called upon to establish evidence, not only in juridical processes but also, and perhaps foremost, in processes of canonization. From the case of Chiara of Montefalco and onwards, medical examinations, including a u- topsy, came to be a part of the sy stematic inquiry into the authenticity of someone's sanctity. RELIGIOUS EMBODIMENT The topic for this article is religious embodiment or, perhaps more pr e- cisely, how religious embodiment has been and is conceived in relation to other perspectives on embodiment, especially the changing role of medicine in modernity. My own theoretical perspective will be phenomenological and hermeneutical, in a broad sense, and will focus upon questions regarding the cultural representation of embodiment rather than, a s is also traditional within the phenomenological movement, the subjective experience of e m- bodiment, or, as is common to the natural sciences, the biological or physical body. I am convinced that the cultural representation of embodiment plays an essential role in any understanding of the body, including a biological u n- derstanding.3 From this follows, among other things, that the body has a hi s- tory. It is not an unproblematic given, neither in the form of its represent a- tion nor as embodiment as such. This a lso means, presumably, that the e x- 2 Except for the work of Park , see also Michel Foucault, The Birth of the Clinic: An Archeology of Medical Perception , transl.: A. M. Sheridan (London/New York 2010), 153 f. 3 For a more extensive discussion of these matters, see my Himmelska kroppar: 8; En glish translation forthcoming with Eerdmans as Heavenly Bodies . 10 OLA SIGURDSON perience of being embodied varies with time. However, one could object that any talk of cultural representations, subjective experiences and biological evidence is an abstract way of speaking about phenomena that perhaps a re not so distinct from each other; that this introduces precisely those distin c- tions that this article wants to overcome. Nevertheless, I think it might be prudent, for reasons of exposition if nothing else, to go along with such cat e- gories for a while ju st to show in a preliminary way that there are many ways to talk about embodiment. The reason that I began with Katharine Park's account of the dissection of Chiara of Montefalco here is somewhat different from Park's original i n- tent; I think it shows quit e clearly how both the dissection of bodies as well as the bodies themselves acquire meaning in a particular context. Even such a practice as the cutting open of bodies, for our part most ly associated with medical autopsies, does not have an established me aning but can take on different meanings depending upon the relevant context of interpretation. The interest that her fellow sisters took in her opened body had little to do with what we would call an autopsy, and even if a medical authority was called upo n to establish the facts that would lead to her sanctification, such an authority was never independent of the framing religious interest in Chiara's embodiment. As I hinted at in the beginning, it might be that co n- cepts such as 'religious ,' 'civic' or 'me dical ,' even though they surely would have some kind of referent in the beginning of the fourteenth century, are slightly misleading if we take them to refer to some kind of easily disti n- guishable spheres of meaning. The differentiation between the 'religi ous,' 'civic' and 'scientific' spheres of meaning take on contemporary meaning only through modernity. From the account of the dissection of Chiara of Mont e- falco, it is quite clear that there was no way of distinguishing the religious and the civic spheres , as if they were independent of each other. Also, med i- cine was understood in a religious context. Park explicitly warns against the anachronistic supposition that just because the understanding of embod i- ment in our time is dominated by medical paradigms, the same was true in pre-modern times.4 And of course this does not only refer to the practice of dissection but to embodiment as such. It is not the case that the history of embodiment is the history of anatomy and physiology at the core, to which all oth er 'cultural meanings' is added: 'the inhabitants of northern Italian ci t- ies from the mid -thirteenth to the mid -sixteenth century, understood their 4 Park, Secrets of Women , 21-22. RELIGIOUS EMBODIMENT BETWEEN M EDICINE AND M ODERNITY 11 bodies primarily in terms of family and kinship, on the one hand, and reli g- ion, on the other,' says Park.5 Medicine comes third. Through relating religious embodiment to the interest that medicine has had and still has for human embodiment, I think we can get a notion of how religious embodiment has changed through history. Of course I will only give the barest of outlines of this history, but if I am successful in giving at least a preliminary account of this history and what this means today, I will have fulfilled my purposes. Thus, in the next section I will return to a historical account of the changing role of religion and medicine for embodiment, en d- ing in a more principled discussion of how to understand embodiment from a philosophical perspective informed by this history. Then I will take a look upon how embodiment has been medicalized in modernity and wh ere that leaves religious embodiment. Finally, I will present some thoughts on how embodiment can be conceived of differently with the help of a phenomeno l- ogical perspective, and how also the role of religious embodiment can be r e- conceived thereby. EMBO DIMENT AT THE DAWN OF MODERNITY The human body, in pre - or (very) early modern times was seen as a nexus between the created and the divine spheres. As God was incarnated in Christ, meaning that God became palpable human flesh, the body took on a particula r prominence as a conduit for divine grace. Caroline Walker Bynum is one of the foremost medievalists who have emphasized how very somatic the religious culture at this era was; the human body, and even the female body became a symbol for humanity as such.6 Since woman, in the Middle Ages, was associated in a particular way with embodiment, by analogy she performed the more perfect imitatio Christi through her very physicality. In this way, woman could be the representative also of the male embodiment. The gendered aspects aside, embodiment was seen as the human form of r e- lationality, not only extending to the relations between human bodies but also between the immanent and the transcendent. Even the sense of vision was often understood as a reciprocal and mimetic relation rather than as a 5 Park, Secrets of Women , 23. 6 Caroline Walker Bynum, Holy Feast and Holy Fast: The Religious Significance of Food to Medi e- val Women (Berkeley 1987), 263. 12 OLA SIGURDSON relation of domination and subordination, as later became the case.7 As such, human bodies were not only vulnera ble to physical trauma, but also to spir i- tual possession by the Holy Spirit as well as the devil, both of whom could be presumed to leave bodily marks, a reason as good as any to examine the depths of human embodiment in extraordinary persons. The reason P ark gives for the surprising fact that 'Holy Anatomy' was performed almost excl u- sively on women - the first known autopsy of a man (Ignatius of Loyola in 1556) took place two hundred and fifty years after the autopsy of Chiara of Montefalco - is both the a ssociation of women with corporeality and the (li t- eral) inwardness of their devotion.8 In the last two decades of the fifteenth century, according to Park, a new enthusiasm for dissection in the direct service of medical knowledge began to establish itself . Partly inspired by Galen's endorsement of dissection as esse n- tial to health care, physicians began to appreciate the practice as a way of gaining essential information about diseases and causes of death. This enth u- siasm trickled down to their well -off cl ients, who required autopsies as a part of their family health care. Even if medical examination in the form of disse c- tion was driven by particular interests founded in conceptions of human e m- bodiment that went beyond medicine, it was also a part of a proc ess of an increasing significance of medical learning as such, in cases of establishing lineage as well as canonicity . Medical authors began publish ing anatomical works, with Andreas Vesalius' On the Fabric of the Human Body from 1543 as a landmark. The fo rmal dissections held by medical faculties began to attract more interest, both audience -wise and as a sign for the achievements of the city. Consequently, it became more frequent. Medicine also laid claim to a greater authority to read corporeal signs in a truthful way, as these signs were just too complex or ambiguous for anyone to interpret without the correct experience, erudition and judgement. With the growth of medical dissections follows a claim to greater expertise on human embodiment. The body b e- came a stage for the performance of signs and symptoms that only could be made to produce evidence through interpretation by a particular comp e- tence. The physicist is the expert and the body the object of his expertise. This growing prominence of medical an atomy did not mean, however, that anatomy now was somehow independent of theological or religious co n- cerns. Vesalius' book is a case in point, relying for its visual presentation of 7 Park, Secrets of Women , 73. Cf. Marti n Jay, Downcast Eyes: The Denigration of Vision in Twe n- tieth -Century French Thought (Berkeley/Los Angeles/London 1993). 8 Park, Secrets of Women , 35. RELIGIOUS EMBODIMENT BETWEEN M EDICINE AND M ODERNITY 13 the human body on available iconographic traditions such as Saint Anthony and the miser's heart and the extraction of Julius Caesar from his mother's womb. Anatomical illustrations could also be part of devotional images, so as to suggest that the border between the two were not entirely stable. At the same time, Vesalius' work was, as Park points out, a step in the direction of the 'desacralization' of anatomy; even when using iconographic traditions, more obviously religious elements have been left out. His book was informed by his strategy to obtain imperial patronage from the head of the Holy R o- man Empire, but also of integrating physica (which corresponds with what we call internal medicine) and surgery through the medium of anatomy. This new conception of medicine was celebrated by Vesalius as a return to Greek medicine. In fact, he staged his own 'revival' as a 'Caesarean' birth, in a sim i- lar way to that of the emperor being seen as a new and from his immediate successors independent beginning of an imperial lineage: 'Vesalius has snatched anatomy from the jaws of death, jus t as Charles resuscitated the Roman Empire, just as the midwife saved the infant Caesar, and just as Apollo rescued Asclepius from Coronis' womb.'9 The bodies depicted in his exposition were often women, signalling a gendered figuration of the rel a- tionship between subject (physician) and object (woman). The physician was someone who investigated the 'secrets of women ,' revealing them to the i n- terested onlooker. The distance between subject and object has now i n- creased, both in terms of epistemology and affe ction, compared to earlier centuries, and the element of reciprocity has been all but lost. What can we learn from Park's book Secrets of Women that treats, in some detail, the praxis of dissection between the fourteenth and the si x- teenth century in northe rn Italy? As she herself points out, this story 'is part of a larger story in which anatomical knowledge gained by exploring the di s- sected body became a way to think about the self .'10 As the body is never given as such but only through some particular conf iguration of interpret a- tive power, there is a need if one wishes to speak about embodied religion to specify which body one is talking about. Park's analysis helps us with two things: first, the insight that to speak of embodied religion or the religious body always is an abstraction in a certain sense, namely that what is seen as the domain of the religious is always a part of a larger configuration of other domains such as the political, the cultural , the scientific (including medicine) et cetera. As we u nderstand from Park's account, there is a vast difference 9 Park, Secrets of Women , 247. 10 Park, Secrets of Women , 261. 14 OLA SIGURDSON between a domain of the religious in pre -modern times, where it in a sense to a large extent overlapped (or perhaps better: never was distinct from) the scientific domain. But, secondly, Park's anal ysis also helps us to understand at least part of the story that has led to the configuration of these domains today, where I presume that it is not very controversial to suggest that med i- cine often defines what is taken to be the fundamental understanding of em- bodiment, namely (a version of) the physical or biological body. This pe r- spective has, of course, been naturalized for us up to the point that we find it hard to understand how anyone can understand embodiment in another way; as Park points out, it i s indeed difficult 'to think of this understanding of the body as having had a beginning' saturated as our culture is with such conce p- tualizations and visualizations of our embodiment.11 But none of these co n- ceptualizations or visualizations of the body tha t are part of our daily life are neutral or innocent. The body is never distinct as such from the cultural, p o- litical and social intersections that both produce it and uphold it, making it appear as given. A PHILOSOPHY OF EMBODIMENT Now let us turn brief ly to the philosophical position on embodiment that I invoke here. It is inspired by, among others, Judith Butler, although she, of course, puts more emphasis on the gendered form of our understan d- ing of embodiment.12 Butler has, not surprisingly, been crit icized for her pe r- spective in Gender Trouble as advocating a remarkably weightless unde r- standing of embodiment, as if the materiality of the body is dissolved in li n- guistic constructions.13 Thus, her philosophical perspective would contribute to the typically modern alienation from nature. This is a criticism that b e- longs to a more general class of critiques of social constructivism that disa p- proves of its claims in that they seem to champio n the presumably nonsens i- cal idea that the body is a social construct, therefore denying its materiality. However, I belong to those who think that this is a misinterpretation of Bu t- ler's position: far from the counterintuitive claim that there is nothing before 11 Park, Secrets of Women , 262. 12 Judith Butler, Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity (New York/London 1999). 13 Carol Bigwood, \"Renaturalizing the Body (with the Help of Merleau -Ponty)\", Donn Welton (ed.), Body and 1998 ), 99 -114. RELIGIOUS EMBODIMENT BETWEEN M EDICINE AND M ODERNITY 15 discourse, denying the materiality of the body, a more constructive unde r- standing of Butler's argument would be that the 'pre-discursive ' materiality of the body is never possible to conceptualize or visualize in any other way than through discourse .14 What it is that is 'matter ' or 'body ' is thus not an abs o- lute fundament for philosophical or political arguments, but is itself a co n- tested notion that is part of the argument. This does not mean, then, that the body is just a matter of linguistic conve ntion, but that everything that is, is always already symbolically mediated, so that there is no object independent of the discourse. This, it seems to me, is a position beyond at least crude ve r- sions of both essentialism and social constructivism, suggest ing instead that we need more nuanced (and historical) accounts of the intertwining of the linguistic and the material that do not construct these as binary oppositions. Among those advocating such a perspective belongs the Polish medical doctor and biolog ist Ludwik Fleck whose reflections on the social conditions of a scientific fact are highly pertinent to the question of a cultural unde r- standing of embodiment. Fleck wrote a small book, Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact , where he argued against the prevailing scientific opinion that facts are independent of cultural and social conditioning.15 In it, he is polemical against those who refuse to see how even present -day science is dependent upon a particular thought collective and style and by way o f this refusal think that there is a complete discontinuity between present -day knowledge and past prejudice. To say that what we today believe is true 'is ipso facto true,' is making the same mistake as an Eighteenth -century French philologist who declare d that 'pain, sitos, bread, Brot, panis were arbitrary, different descriptions of the same thing. ' The difference between the French language and all other languages is 'that what is called bread in French really was bread .'16 There is, in other words, no w ay of stepping out of one's own intellectual context, and the privileging of one's own context as the sole sta n- dard for truth -claims is just a case of petitio principii or begging the question, as this claim can only be validated by principles internal to the context. Against the supposedly customary view of a fact - and we might want to add of embodiment - as 'something definite, permanent, and independent of any 14 See her Bodies that Matter: On the Discursive Limits of \"Sex\" .

Trenn (Chicago/London 1981). Annemarie Mol has in her The Body Multiple: Ontology in Medical Practice (Durham/London 2002) spelt out some of the implications for a philosophy of embodiment. 16 Fleck, Genesis and Development , 50. 16 OLA SIGURDSON subjective interpretation by the scientist, ' Fleck suggests that facts (and also bodies) are t heory -dependent and theories are in turn dependent upon cu l- tural and social circumstances.17 In a simile, we could compare the linguistic dependence of the study of human embodiment with the dependence on o p- tic lenses or radio telescopes for the study of he avenly bodies that are not visible to the naked eye. All human knowledge is in some way contextually mediated, including, as the example suggests, a reliance on various practices and technologies. Along with the French philosopher Maurice Merleau -Ponty, th is su g- gests an understanding of the function of language as primarily a way of ori- enting human beings in their life -world, not to create a correspondence b e- tween words and things.18 Language constitutes the world in which human beings understand their exist ence, and thus Merleau -Ponty can suggest that speech and gesture transfigures the human body, at the same time that it is the human body that talks and gestures.19 Physical reality is not left intact by language, and thus, in a sense, one could say that a h uman body is a lingui s- tic body (even the cadaver, of course, exists in a discursive field, as the exa m- ple of Chiara of Montefalco shows). Language creates all sorts of possibilities for bodily existence, even though language always exists through and b e- tween bodies. This, in turn, implies that the world is not primarily the object of human subjectivity, but something we live in and through; our subjectivity is not something that we can place outside of the body but instead it is through our bodies that we a re subjects that also can reach out for something else. The body is always already a part of the world, and neither the body nor the world could be explored independent of how the subject of the explor a- tion bodily experiences the world. This mode of embodi ment is a presuppos i- tion of the possibility of experiencing the body as an object to our gaze and therefore a more fundamental dimension of our embodiment. That we still tend to think of the body as an object is in part dependent upon the fact that we beco me aware of our own body through our interaction with other bodies in the world - but also, I might add, because our contemporary culture teaches us to understand the body as an object. Merleau -Ponty insists, along with the phenomenological tradition, that the subjective experience of being embodied and the biological body belong together, or even are two abstract aspects of some more primordial embodiment. 17 Fleck, Genesis and Development , xxvii. 18 Maurice Merleau -Ponty, of Perception 193. 19 Merleau -Ponty, Phenomenology of Perception , 197. RELIGIOUS EMBODIMENT BETWEEN M EDICINE AND M ODERNITY 17 What I wish to critically suggest to such a phenomenological perspective on embodiment is the emphat ic need to supplement it with the importance of the cultural representation of embodiment for the understanding of both. In the example of the dissection of Chiara of Montefalco above, it has become clear, I hope, how our experience of being embodied is dependent upon the cultural framework within which our bodies are thematised and become meaningful. The cultural representation of embodiment is not static; it is hi s- torically given and therefore any talk of religious embodiment or embodied religion stands in need of a critical historical account. This brings me back from this more abstract elaboration of how I understand embodiment to the question of how the medical body and the religious body are con ceived of today. RE-IMAGINING RELIGIOUS EMBODIMENT When I broke off my historical account above, I had just explained how medicine through Vesalius came to establish a more prominent place in the early modern hegemonic conceptions of embodiment. Today, it is quite clear, as Park also has pointed out, that an anatomical understanding of embod i- ment has become part of our understanding of our own embodiment. In his book The Anticipatory Corpse the American MD and philosoph er Jeffrey P. Bishop tells us the story of the gradual medicalization of the understanding of human embodiment with the help of the Aristotelian four causes. Two of them are maybe not of prominent interest for our purposes: the material cause that tells us what a thing consists of or the formal cause that tells us how this matter is arranged. More important for Bishop's argument, however, are the two remaining causes: the efficient cause that is the primary source of an entity's movement and the final cause that is its aim or purpose. An i m- portant historical change took place in early modernity that could be inte r- preted by the changing role of the four causes: modern science including modern medicine repudiated or at least minimized formal and final caus a- tion at the same time as it elevated material and efficient causation. Bishop explains: Medicine's metaphysical stance ... is a metaphysics of material and efficient causation, concerned with the empirical realm of matter, effects, and the r a-18 OLA SIGURDSON tional working out of the causes for the purposes of finding ways to control the material of bodies.20 This is part of the technological drift of modern science; the body loses its own integrity and turns into a material object, as there are no intrinsic aims or purposes tha t could be assigned to it. Bishop again: Bodies have no purpose or meaning in themselves, except insofar as we direct those bodies according to our desires. ... The world - the body - stands before us as a manipulable object, and all thinking about the worl d or the body b e- comes instrumental doing.21 Of course, there is still the 'I' which has desires and wishes and aims and purposes, but this subjectivity is now both divorced from our embodiment and also outside the realm of medicine, and, consequently, beyo nd instr u- mental reasoning. Bishop notes that modern medicine or modern science in general sometime s denies having a metaphysics at all, but in the sense that a metaphysics is a particular view of the fundamental nature of being and the world, there is a me taphysics at work, at least implicitly, in its way of dividing the world between the meaningful and the manipulable or subject and o b- ject. It needs to be pointed out that Bishop is not arguing against modern medicine; he is well aware of the ground -breakin g achievements that have followed in its wake. He is also careful to point out that one of the most i m- portant motives for becoming a doctor is that one has been moved by the suffering of the other. At the same time, his often quite generalizing talk of mod ern medicine runs the risk both of reifying modern medicine and of pr e- senting modern technology and the patient's life -world as a dichotomy, thus presenting too stark a contrast between cure and care in t he contemporary world. H is main target, however, is the oblivion of all understanding of the body as something more than just a manipulable object. This presupposition is counterproductive as it obscures how we also experience ourselves as e m- bodied beings with shared histori es. Medicine is, of course, not the only (effi- cient) cause of this tendency, as this is rather a common view of the traje c- tory of a particular modern kind of dualism. What space or place is left for religious embodiment in such a he ge- monic understanding of embodiment? The history of the concept of religion 20 Jeffrey P. Bishop, The Anticipatory Corpse: Medicine, Power, and the Care of the Dying (Notre Dame 2011), 20. 21 Bishop, Anticipatory Corpse , 21. RELIGIOUS EMBODIMENT BETWEEN M EDICINE AND M ODERNITY 19 is, I would presume, quite well known, so I will not spend too much time elaborating on it here.22 Suffice it to say that religion has increasingly unde r- gone a process of subjectivization, correlative to the objectivization of the body. Among other things, in the Protestant repudiation of the Roman Catholic liturgy, its customs and practices - its 'legalism' - the essence of r e- ligion came to be located to 'the inner human being' where all l egitimacy in the eyes of God depends on an inner faith, not external achievements as such. Religion was privatized; its domain came to encompass feeling rather than thought or practice. Charles Taylor has, in his A Secular Age , described this process with the help of the term 'ex -carnation' (as a contrast to 'in - carnation ,' 'becoming flesh'), which means that both the religious commun i- ties as well as society as a whole lose sight of the (inevitable) social embod i- ment of religion, as well as a forgetfulness of how even one's personal faith is expressed through one's body.23 In some ways, medicine came to replace r e- ligion in that the understanding of health came to be understood in both a less holistic way, with the absence of disease as its main meaning rather than the more comprehensive well -being, and also in a more immanent manner, as having no final aim over and above the individual and social body. This means that the contemporary configuration of discursive power where both religion and medicine are parts actually turns the religious body into a su b- lime body; a sublime body that is impossible to represent, both in a spatial and a discursive sense. If one of the defining traits of any talk of the body is that it 'takes place ,' in such a configuration of dis cursive power it is an open question whether religious embodiment actually 'takes place' today. Or if it does, maybe this is a challenge to the very modern configuration of power that wants to make a neat distinction between 'inner' and 'outer' or 'private ' and 'public' but also between 'care' and 'cure .' The challenge to such a configuration of discursive power is hardly a li t- eral revival of an Aristotelian metaphysics of the four causes, and as I read Bishop, this is not his aim. Rather, he argues that fi nal causation could be understood through a contemporary phenomenology of embodiment as we find it in Martin Heidegger and Maurice Merleau -Ponty, and this is to me a viable way forward. Working against the modern dichotomy between subject and object, both philosophers tried to regard embodiment more from the 22 For an ex tended account, see my article ' The Return of Religious Embodiment: On Post - Secular Politics, ' Marius Timmann Mjaaland, Sigurdson Unbound: Philosophical Perspecti ves on Politics, Embodiment and Religion (Cambridge 2010), 19 -36. 23 Charles Taylor, A Secular Age (Cambridge, Mass./London 2007), 554. 20 OLA SIGURDSON perspective of the life -world. Rather than trying to overcome dualisms, they try to show that they are not there from the beginning. There is of course a vast tradition of interpretation with regard to both Heidegger and Merleau - Ponty and how well they actually succeed in overcoming the subject -object dichotomy, but let me here just claim that one important strand in their ph i- losophies is to regard the human body not as a manipulable object for our desir es but rather as the way we exist in the world and through which we r e- late to other bodies. The body is not a tool, but we are our bodies. It is through our embodiment that we are a node in a network of relations and stories and it is so that we become wha t we are. Of course our body lets us do things, for instance drink a cup of coffee, and in this sense it is tool -like. As the act of drinking coffee is not just an extrinsic occurrence that happens to take place to and through my body, but is (hopefully) a pleasurable exper i- ence to me as a person, an experience that also could be a shared experience as a participation in a - however fleeting - human community, it would be misleading to characterize the arm that moves the cup to my lips as a mere tool. It is indeed I who am drinking the coffee. More examples that encompass a broader horizon of human experience could obviously be produced here, but I hope this simple and perhaps pede s- trian example will suffice to convince, for now, that our bodies are always already part of a context where our human existence is defined by our aspir a- tions and desires, who or what we love and what we are hoping for. Thus, we are always already engaged in practical projects that intrinsically contain some form of telei or final causes. For Bishop, these causes can be of different natures, not necessarily belonging to some grand metaphysics as in Aristotle or Christian theology, but are an effect of an understanding of embodiment that refuses to reduce the human body to a manipula ble object. Projects can be of such a grand scale, but can also concern matters of daily living, but common to both long -term projects and more mundane projects is that both take an embodied form. To quote Bishop on this: 'Formal and final causes are embod ied, even as that embodiment is shaped by meaning and significance outside the body and directed to purposes outside of the body.'24 Our ind i- vidual bodies are not only meaningful in and by themselves, but as members of a social body that defines meaning bey ond the borders of the individual body. It is important to realize that such a meaningfulness is not something that is added post hoc but is a part of being embodied in itself. It begins with 24 Bishop, Anticipatory Corpse , 289. RELIGIOUS EMBODIMENT BETWEEN M EDICINE AND M ODERNITY 21 small, everyday projects that evolve into some form of community , whether big or small, with its own history and its own telos , but it can also be part of a living religion. This means that the body is never neutral. Not even the medical body that Bishop equates with the corpse is neutral. Through modern medicine, the human body is reduced to a more or less well -functioning machine. The aim of medicine, then, is to, as far as possible, maintain this machine. But to turn the human body into a manipulable object, it needs to withdraw it from its communal context, making i t acontextual and ahistorical. The corpse b e- comes the paradigmatic body because death stops, ideally at least, the flow of time, helpfully turning the body into a stable ground for a systematic know l- edge. But to a living body according to the phenomenologi cal perspective, death is not only about the termination of the functioning of the body - machine, but more about the cessation of capacities, projects, plans, hopes, desires and so on. This gives an entirely different perspective on life, health, disease an d illness, and, I might add, on religion. Indeed, to the ill person, the body can become an object, as it suddenly or gradually turns from being an invisible background horizon for all intentional projects to a highly visible cause for concern in its own r ight. This can be experienced as an alienation from one's own body. But this is a different objectification from the one that is performed by the doctor in a medical examination, for whom our projects and purposes that we are keen to restore are more or le ss irrelevant. The do c- tor considers the function of the body, something that is distinct from the purpose and goods of the embodied life. This points towards an understanding of embodiment that reaches b e- yond the manipulable object of instrumental rational ity. Significant for such an understanding is that the body is not just a tool or an object but som e- thing that we in a more profound way are. We exist and relate bodily to other bodies in the world. The body can be described as a node in a network of r e- lations and stories that we share with each other and through which we b e- come those we are. This means that we share a life -world with each other where our existence is defined by our longings and desires. The life -world can be understood as a set of practica l projects that all imply some kind of telos . Even if we cannot share or even wish to share the life -world of Chiara of Montefalco, where embodiment was understood within a religious, or more specifically a Christian, context, such contexts, be they of a m ore low key or of a more comprehensive nature, are still around in our daily projects with all their successes or misgivings. Different ways of imagining embodiment are 22 OLA SIGURDSON always already here, if one only knows where to look. It is perhaps one of the contribu tions of a philosophy of religion, a phenomenology or a theology today to be able to critically explore the hegemonical mode of embodiment in the service of suggesting a fuller, less reductive account. Heterotopias are already in existence alongside hegemo nical places in society from where it is possible to challenge their account of embodiment. What I have tried to suggest in this article, more by showing than by a r- guing perhaps, is that such a fuller account needs to be historically informed. The body has a history, not least in its cultural representations, and being aware of this history is, I would suggest, essential for the understanding of religious embodiment even today, to avoid being caught up in the objectific a- tion of time as well as the body. Ess ential to any discussion of religious e m- bodiment or embodied religion is both some kind of historical genealogy of religion as well as of the body, and a philosophical or theological account that tries to lay bare how we always already exist bodily in ways that cannot reduce our embodiment to a manipulable object. For such an endeavour, the comparison between modern and pre -modern representations of embod i- ment could be helpful, not because earlier traditions would provide us with standards, but with critica l perspectives on our own modes of understanding. The task of re -imagining religious embodiment in conversation with different modes of embodiment suggested by politics, science or art is an interpret a- tive undertaking not served well by forgetting that the body exists histor i- cally. Section I: EMBODIED RELIGION A PHILOSOPHICAL REFLECTION ON MYSTICAL EXPERIENCES AND RELIGIOUS DISCIPLINING 24 25 2 A Body Sensitive for Transcendence : A Mystical Under standing of Sensibility JONNA B ORNEMARK S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn Universit y ABSTRACT In phenomenology and existential philosophy the relation to the d i- vine has been understood as closely connected to the human capacity for transcendence. This understanding can be nuanced through a reading of the beguine Mechthild von Magdeburg's Das flie\u00dfende Licht der Gotheit , a Christian mystic text where the body, sen sibility and erotic encounter with the divine is central. Sensibility is here u n- derstood as the meeting place between the soul and God. The article aims to contribute to a phenomenology of religious experience in which the human capacity for transcendence and human embod i- ment are thought as intertwined. KEY WORDS phenomenology, existential philosophy, female mystics, mysticism, Mechthild von embodiment, senses, tran scendence INTRODUCTION In monotheistic traditions religion has most often been understood as a spiritual issue and religiosity and spirituality are understood as closely r e- lated concepts. Even if any religion, as practice, by necessity has strong e m-26 JONNA BORNEMARK bodied dimensions, the body in theory and in writings has not always h ad a very strong position. Christianity, for example, stands with one leg in a Neo - Platonic tradition where the body is understood as the prison of the divine spark of the soul, which hinders the soul from returning to its divine origin. In modern philoso phy the body has been understood as extension, a m a- terial object among others, and as what is present here and now. Such ideas have been profoundly questioned in much contemporary, late modern ph i- losophy - that wants to reevaluate the body. At the same tim e, in phenom e- nological and existential philosophy of religion, it has been implicitly argued that there is a reason for the priority of the soul, since religion is born out of the human capacity for transcendence, the overflowing of the here and now. This situation begs the question: what position does the living body have in relation to the human capacity for transcendence? In the Abrahamitic religions the capacity for transcendence has been developed into a capacity to transgress the present world, an abi lity that is supposed to be exceptionally strong in so -called mystic traditions. In philo s- ophy, mystic traditions are often accused of trying to find that harmonious, clean and peaceful oneness with the divine, where all the trouble and pro b- lems of the wor ld and the body are once and for all left behind. Such an u n- derstanding of mystic traditions can be found throughout contemporary ph i- losophy, explicitly for example in Karl Jaspers and Iris Murdoch.1 And in what has become known as the turn to religion wit hin phenomenology, the capac i- ty of transcendence - here read as a positive and most human capacity - is at the center, and here too, the body tends to be forgotten. In phenomenolog i- cal analysis, attention has primarily been given to Christian male mystics. But if we are interested in the relation between transcendence and the living body, maybe we should turn to a closely related, but slightly different trad i- tion: the Christian female mystic tradition. Historians such as Caroline Bynum and Amy Hollywood ha ve pointed out that it is exactly the relation to the body that is different in the writings of these female mystics.2 As women, female mystics were associated with the body in a more intimate way than male mystics. The figure of Christ as the God that bec omes body was more important to female mystics, and the que s- 1 See Karl Jaspers, Philosophy Vol. 1, (Chicago 1969) and Iris Murdoch, Existentialists and Mystics: Writings on Philosophy and Literature (London 1997). 2 Caroline Bynum, Fragmenta tion and Redemptio: Essays on G ender and the Human Body (New York 1991), 194 and Amy Hollywood, The Soul as Virgin Wife : Mechthild of Magdeburg, Marguerite P o- rete and Meister Eckhardt (Notre Dame/London 1995), 25. A BODY SENSITIVE FOR TRANSCENDENCE : A MYSTICAL UNDERSTAN DING OF SENSIBILITY 27 tion of the body is more present in their texts. When female writers empha s- ize the positive relation between the living body and the divine, the body of Jesus becomes the gateway to an intimate re lation to the divine, most appa r- ent in the Holy Communion. His bleeding body feeds and gives life to h u- manity. During the medieval period the female is connected to blood both through menstrual blood, which was understood as the material of which the child was made, and the belief that blood could be transformed into breast - milk. The female body is the body that is perforated, gives life, and is open to others. The body of Christ with its bleeding stigmata is connected to these aspects of the female body: h is pains were connected to the pain of giving birth, he was breast -feeding humanity with his stigmata, and he gave himself to the humans just as a mother gives herself to her baby. Holy capacities could therefore be connected to abilities of the female bod y. The breast -milk of holy women could cure the sick, female bodies opened up in stigmata to a larger extent than male, and some women, such as St Bridget of Sweden, r e- ceived their calling to God as the movement of a fetus in the womb. But the gender diffe rence is not a total watershed: male mystics such as Bernhard of Clairvaux also use similar female strategies, calls themselves God's bride and identify with Mary. The living body is closely connected to the senses, as has been shown in the phenomenologic al tradition. The living body is even constituted through its sensibility and its capacity to be both sensed and sensing. The senses have of course always been sources of knowledge, but during the high middle ages it was considered to be an unreliable sour ce when it came to the relation with the divine. What we call the mystical tradition had up until the twelfth ce n- tury been a tradition of textual interpretation by purely intellectual means. It was especially the female mystics, within the strong female re ligious mov e- ment of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, which gave the senses a diffe r- ent position. Mystics such as Hildegard of Bingen (1098 -1179) gained their knowledge of the divine through the senses, often in visions based on seeing, hearing, smelli ng etc. But this made them suspicious in the eyes of other mystics. For example, Master Eckhardt (1260 -1328) and Johannes Tauler (1300 -1361), who in many respects were greatly influenced by female mystics, were critical of their dependence on the senses.3 They preferred the specul a- 3 This has been discussed by among others Friedrich -Wilhelm Wentzlaff -Eggebert in 1969), see especially 113. 28 JONNA BORNEMARK tio of the wise rather than the visio of the pious, since the senses could be treacherous: maybe the vision came from the devil rather than from the d i- vine. Instead they considered reason to be the only trustworthy source of knowl edge. In the following my interest lies in how the living and sensing body is conceptualized in the female mystic tradition. I will start with a very short summary of the philosophical and phenomenological philosophy of religion where religion is understoo d as a consequence of the human capacity for transcendence, and of the priority of the soul at the cost of the body. Therea f- ter I will turn to The Flowing Light of Godhead (Das flie\u00dfende Licht der G o- theit ), a Christian and mystic text from the thirteenth c entury written by Mechthild von Magdeburg. In this text the senses as well as the human body are given crucial roles in relation to the divine. My main focus will be on the relation between the capacity for transcendence and the sensing body. RELIGION AS THE HUMAN CAPACIT Y FOR TRANSCENDENCE In modern phenomenology as well as in existential philosophy, the abil i- ty to experience negativity is central to the human being.4 Such ability is of course paradoxical since its negativity is present, and its presen ce is an a b- sence. But it is not an extraordinary experience, rather one that is present in everyday life. The world would not be a world if we only experienced pure presence and no negativity. In this case we would not accept that the house has a backside, since we do not experience it at the moment. Neither would we accept the other person as experiencing, since we never experience her experiences. The now includes thus not only what is present, but includes the past as well as expectations for the future. This capacity for negativity pr o- vides us in early childhood with the very first instance of play: peek -a-boo. Playing this game, the parent, for example, puts her hands in front of her face and then takes them away and reveals her face. The point of this play is that the baby does not alternately see the back of the hands and the face of the parent. Rather it sees the presence of the parent and the absence of the pa r- 4 In this chapter I build upon S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, The Concept of Anxiety (Princeton 1981 [1844]); Max Scheler, The Human Place in the Cosmos (Evanston 2009 [1928]); Edmund Husserl, On the Ph e- nomenology of the Consciousness of Internal Time [1893 -1917] (Dordrecht, 1991); and Simone de Bea u- voir, The Ethics of Ambiguity (Secaucus, 1948) etc. A BODY SENSITIVE FOR TRANSCENDENCE : A MYSTICAL UNDERSTAN DING OF SENSIBILITY 29 ent. The amusing part lies in the memory and the expectation of the parent, which are inter rupted by the presence of the parent. As such it is a play on what is not present, but which nevertheless is shown in the present. The fee l- ing of longing in a similar way is the strong and sometimes overwhelming presence of what is absent. The human being distinguishes herself in the use and development of this capacity, a capacity that makes it possible to make up plans and change both one's surroundings and one's own life. It also makes it possible for the human being to look at herself from the outside a nd reflect upon herself. In order to make up plans she needs the free space co n- stituted through the insight that life might be different, and in order to r e- flect upon herself, she needs to negate the full presence in herself. Maybe this last capacity is th e strangest. How is it possible for her to see herself at the same time as she is the one seeing? One phenomenological answer, Husserl's, would be that it is possible since the human being is a temporal and inte n- tional being continually directed to the wor ld and thereby constituting o b- jects, meaning she does not create them, but constitutes them as objects). In turning to itself, the self is both constituted as an object and as the constitu t- ing subject, i.e. both as body and soul. The body, thus, is part of the world and is subjected to all its laws. The soul, on the other hand, names the above discussed possibility of moving and transcending that which is given as present. It includes free will, creativity, and the ability to reflect. In existential philoso phy, the human being is even identified with these capacities to exceed the present state and situation, i.e. with her transcendence. But if the body names the human being as part of the world, as here and now and as one object among many; where does the soul belong? Where does the soul stand when it looks at itself and thereby transforms itself into an object? It cannot be part of the world since as soon as it sees itself as one object among many it is no longer the experiencing soul. Thus, the soul cannot be part of the world - and the need to formulate another position, a non -worldly position, is born. Even so, the soul is still dependent on the body, and the world still limits its free movement. Such a lack in the power of human transcendence produces th e idea of a pure tra n- scendent power. And since the movement of the soul names the life of the human being and the constituting power, a pure transcendence would also be the source of all life, and as such a transcendental ground. But such a tra n- scendental transcendence is exactly not part of the world and an object among others. It is an origin for all individual life, but itself not an individual creature. As such, it might be understood as given with the world, but never 30 JONNA BORNEMARK given in itself. Therefore the div ine is inexhaustible and unreachable (within the world), and thus impossible to fully understand or describe, since unde r- standing as well as language is adapted to appearance in the world. In this way phenomenological and existential philosophy tries to u nder- stand how 'soul' is separated from 'body ' and 'the divine ' from 'the worldly. ' The phenomenological tradition also has important reflections on embod i- ment, above all in Edmund Husserl and Maurice Merleau -Ponty, but none of them had any greater interest in philosophy of religion. In addition, from those thinkers that are known for their religious reflections, such as Edith Stein, Max Scheler, and Michel Henry, there are intriguing analyses of emb o- diment, but when they turn to religion, the theme of the b ody is pushed aside and transcendence becomes their only quest.5 To sum up: in phenomenology and existential philosophy the divine is closely connected to the human c a- pacity for transcendence and its transcendental presuppositions. I do consi d- er this to be an important contribution to the philosophical understanding of religion, but it is also insufficient in its tendency to further narrow the unde r- standing of the body and the place of embodiment. In drawing on these ph e- nomenological theories, and scrutiniz ing religious texts in which embod i- ment and sensibility are given a different role, I hope to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the relation between transcendence and embod i- ment. In the following I will develop this through a reading of Mechthi ld von Magdeburg and her text The Flowing Light of Godhead . SENSIBLE INTERTWINEME NT Mechthild belonged to the beguine movement, which was part of the quickly expanding female religiosity in Europe during the twelfth and thi r- teenth centuries. The beguines did not take life -long vows and they stayed in the city in their own dwellings. Except for the money that some of the b e- guines brought with them as they entered the house, they made a living from taking care of the dead, nursing, teaching, the weaving ind ustries, etc. Their lives were less regulated than the lives of the nuns and worldlier in the sense that they had much more contact with lay people. Mechthild was probably 5 I develop this argument in 'Ambiguities of the human body in phenomenology and Christian Ola Sigurdson, Sigridur Philosophical Perspectives on Religion, Embodiment, and Polit ics (Cambridge 2010), 73 -88. A BODY SENSITIVE FOR TRANSCENDENCE : A MYSTICAL UNDERSTAN DING OF SENSIBILITY 31 leader for such a house in Magdeburg. She was born between 1207 and 1210 and died be tween 1282 and 1294. The flowing Light of Godhead is a text that belongs to the mystic trad i- tion to the extent that it is inspired by, for example, Hildegard of Bingen and St Augustine. Mechthild's God, though, is not connected only to the capacity for tra nscendence, and the living body is in her writings not something that must be discarded in search for God. On the contrary, as many scholars in different fields have pointed out, her work is permeated by a rich sensory language and a profound eroticism. Th e senses are not something to be r e- jected, but a gateway to God, and a set of capacities that must be refined.6 Her texts, which describe a personal relationship to the divine, contain st o- ries, poems and, maybe most notable, dialogues between personificati ons of love and the senses etc. or, as in the following paragraph, between the soul and God: Soul: Lord, you are the sun for all eyes; You are the delight of all ears; You are the voice of all words; You are the force of all piety; You are the teaching of all wisdom; You are the life of all that lives; You are the ordering of all beings. [...] God: You are a light to my eyes; You are a lyre to my ears; You are a voice for my words; You are a projection of my piety; You are one glory in my wisdom, you are one life in my liveliness, you are a praise in my Being! (III:2)7 6 See, for example, Marilyn Webster, 'Mechthild von Magdeburg's Vocabulary of the Elizabeth Alvilda Petroff, Body and Soul: Essays on Medieval Women and Mysticism (New York 1994); Kurt Ruh, 'Herre, du bist d\u00fa 32 JONNA BORNEMARK This description could be understood as a dramatized and mythological version of a philosophical position. It can be said to describe the relation b e- tween the transcendental and transc endent presupposition (God), and the individual being (the soul). In t his way it articulat es the relation between the continuous and the discontinuous. Those two are however not separate i n- stances, rather the text shows a close intertwinement between God a nd the soul, although it requires a close inspection to be fully discerned. Each line in God's speech to the soul corresponds thematically to a line in the soul's a n- swer. In the following I will analyze some of these thematic couplets. Lord, you are the s un for all eyes, you [the soul] are a light to my eyes. The relation between God and the soul is addressed from two different perspectives: the divine and the human. In each line both these positions are addressed, resulting in a fourfold description of vi sion. At the outset, God, as the light of the sun, is described as the presupposition for seeing, and thus as the possibility for beings to see. The soul, on the other hand, is one visible being in front of God's eyes. The soul has a twofold nature, since it is visible and seeing: visible in front of God, and seeing thanks to God. One might be surprised that it is the soul that is visible, since it does not appear to match the idea of the soul as the transcending capacity presented above. But in fact, in Me chthild I would propose that the soul is that part of the human being that is in dialog (or resists the dialog) with God. The soul is, just as in the phenomenological analysis, the life of the human being, but this life can be seen, and as such it is calle d 'body. ' It is characterized exactly by its possibil i- ty to be seen, but it is seen as a light, i.e. as a seeing seen . The divine does not display this double character of vision, both seeing and seen, but it has a double nature in another way: it is both a seeing, and the presupposition for the seeing of the soul. As such, the divine is in need of the visibility of the soul, the visibility of beings, of which the divine is not one. The visible beings constitute the seeing of the divine, since seeing ca n- not exist without something seen. The soul is in need of the divine and the divine is in need of something to see. This means that the divine is not in need of a particular being, but nevertheless of beings as such. So, how should the divine seeing be unders tood, when the divine is not a being that is poss i- ordenunge stimme worten, du bist meinunge du bist ein ere miner wisheit, du bist ein li p in minem lebende, -Profe, (Frankfurt aM 2003).

A BODY SENSITIVE FOR TRANSCENDENCE : A MYSTICAL UNDERSTAN DING OF SENSIBILITY 33 ble to see at one place, and thus not a being with a specific perspective? It could be understood as a kind of anonymous seeing, since it comes from ev e- rywhere and not from somewhere. It includes the possib ility of the seen to be seen, and as such it is an anonymous capacity to be seen that goes beyond the individual seeing. This intertwining between seeing and seen is remini s- cent of Merleau -Ponty's philosophy of sensibility since it includes the same compon ents.8 God as presupposition, as well as God's seeing is, just as an o- nymity in Merleau -Ponty, the seeing that goes beyond the individual and an element within which the individual can see. The soul as 'a light ' for God's eyes is as all sensing beings a see n seeing and a seeing seen. But does this mean that we should understand God's seeing only as this anonymous seeing, or does it have a privileged position and thus a perspective of its own? In another verse she alludes to John 8:12 (I'm the light of the wo rld) saying: My lover then spoke thus: 'I shall place the light onto the lantern, and for all those that whose eyes look upon the light a special beam shall shine from the light into the eye of their knowledge. ' The soul then asked with great submissivenes s but without fear: 'Dearest, what is the lantern supposed to be? ' Our Lord said: 'I am the light and your breast is the lantern. ' (III:12)9 In this text it is clear that God is the light as such, and in order for there to be sight he needs to have a lante rn that can be lit. Here seeing is const i- tuted through the collaboration between God's light and the human lantern. God lights the human lantern, and everyone who sees this light, and conte m- plates it - one might add - receives a light on another level, a l ight in the eye of their knowledge. I would say that this verse does not only thematize a sp e- cific knowledge of the divine, and neither is the light only used metaphorica l- ly, but it rather connects the seeing of the eyes with the seeing of unde r- standing. S eeing God as one being among many is impossible, just as the sun, this divine light is what blinds you. To see the presuppositions is like trying to see the sun, where the light becomes too bright and destroys all vision. But this does not mean that the se nses can be left. Instead the relation between 8 See especially 'The Intertwining: The Chiasm' in: The Visible and \u00fanser herre: l\u00fahter .' [III:12] 34 JONNA BORNEMARK God and the soul could be understood as a mutual weaving through which they create the element of seeing. In another verse Mechthild says about the soul: 'In the most beautiful light she is blind to herself. In the greatest blindness her vision is the clearest ' (I:22).10 In order for her to relate to God, it could be argued, she needs to co n- sider the light itself, not only what is visible. In such a meditation she b e- comes blind to herself (as a 'seen ' worldly b eing) but also understands herself (as seeing) the clearest. Here 'vision ' clearly plays on the relation between visibility and the more metaphorical use of 'understanding. ' But in doing so, in the transmission of visibility, it starts out from the everyda y seeing, from the senses, and in order to 'see' this capacity, seeing is transformed, an invis i- bility to ordinary seeing paves the way for another kind of seeing. So does this not include exactly the step from the world to another 'heavenly ' region? I would say no, since this other vision is included in the everyday vision. It is not a move away from the senses, but a move into the senses. It is within her capacity to see that she meets her God. Without the senses there is no mee t- ing-place fo r them. The following sections include similar patterns, and the next two e x- tracts include discussions on the senses, although here hearing and speaking are at the center. You are the delight of all ears, you are a lyre to my ears, This line points towards the enjoyment of the senses. The senses are not something negative that the soul should escape, but the means by which God and Mechthild are in contact with each other, although in radically different ways. Through the senses they enjoy each other. God is the joy, the pleasure of the possibility to hear and the individual being is the music in God's ear. They enjoy each other in their sharing of the senses. This shows a mutual dependence, but also an asymmetric relation. They are part of the same weave, th ey both are, or have, eyes/ears/words - and together they both co n- stitute and enjoy these phenomena. Each line in this verse follows the same pattern and merits analysis, but I will end the discussion of this verse with a few words from the very last line : You are the ordering of all beings, you are a praise in my being! 10 'in dem schonsten liehte ist si allerklarost.' A BODY SENSITIVE FOR TRANSCENDENCE : A MYSTICAL UNDERSTAN DING OF SENSIBILITY 35 This line could b e understood as articulat ing what Heidegger called the ontological difference, which in one of the versions that Heidegger proposes would be the difference between beings and the being of beings. Here God is understood as the order and structure of all beings, and the soul as one being that celebrates the Being of God. It is thus order and celebration that are r e- lated to each other in relation to being. It is interesting th at she here co n- nects a concept (order) that we understand as metaphysical, with one that belongs to a religious sphere (praise) and it heralds the next part of the same verse. THE BODY AS MEETING -POINT Above I have borrowed Merleau -Ponty's concept of ano nymity, but Mechthild's God is not anonymous. It is, as we have seen, not a distant met a- physical order, but their relation is the enjoyment of life, which should be celebrated and investigated with all human means. God is not primarily a metaphysical order that needs rational explanation, but is connected to all layers of the human being. Neither is the divine a being that the human being could control or fully know, and in this way it is always overflowing. But this overflowing does not make it distant; it s overflowing presence takes place in the body. This leads us to the second part of the above quoted verse where the soul says: Lord you are constantly lovesick for me. That you have clearly shown personally. You have written me into your book of the Godhead; You have painted me in your humanity; You have buried me in your side, in your hands and feet. Ah, allow me, dear One, to pour balsam upon you. On one dear to my heart, where shall you find the balm? O Lord, I was going to tear the heart of my sou l in two and intended to put you in it. You could never give me a more soothing balsam than to let me unceasingly lie weightlessly in your soul. Lord, if you were to take me home with you, I would be your physician forever. 36 JONNA BORNEMARK Yes, I want that. [...] (III:2)11 The second part, as well as the structure of the whole dialogue, shows a somewhat different picture than the first part. Here 'anonymity ' becomes an even less appropriate category since the metaphysical order is lovesick for the soul. The intertwinement of the first part is further emphasized here, and is set out in the flesh. If the first half describes a positive and creative relation discussed in positive terms that celebrate the difference between them, the second half shows a tension and a longing to ex ceed the creative gap between them. Here it is God who is the weaker part. Even though he is the presuppos i- tion, he is not complete in himself or a harmonious being - rather, in order for God to be God, he is in need of the individual being. As a presupposition he is an open wound, opening up for beings to come into existence. The soul is said to be buried in the holy wounds. Stigmata are given a central role as the place where the individual being takes place and is at once separated and connected to God. The gap created between them also constitutes the poss i- bility of an encounter. If we stick to the idea that God and the soul together weave sensibility, they have to be separated in order to be what they are. Se n- sibility always includes a splittin g up in sensed and sensing, but since each side also within itself and in different ways duplicates this split, they find another closeness and possibility to come close to each other. The wound makes it possible for the soul to be other than God, to be experienced, and to experience on her own. But this means pain, since sep a- ration is pain. But just as in childbirth it is a fruitful pain, necessary for a world of experience to come into being. But it is also the beginning of a pos s- ible consolation that the y might give each other. So God asks her where she will find the balsam. The love that exists through the wound of the flesh and creates separation as well as erotic tension draws them together as the only possibility of consolation. Mechthild finds this c onsoling balsam by tearing her own heart in two, creating a gap in her flesh as she is both experienced 11 '- Herre, du bist ze allen ziten gemalet a n diner monscheit , du hast mich g e- graben an diner siten, an henden und an fussen. mir, vil das du mir niemer so liebe salben als das ich ane underlas diner sele muste sw e- ben. - Herre du dir ze wesen. Ja, ich wil' [III:2] A BODY SENSITIVE FOR TRANSCENDENCE : A MYSTICAL UNDERSTAN DING OF SENSIBILITY 37 and experiencing. As such she duplicates in herself the gap between the two. She duplicates the separation to be able to join and heal him. And he says that she could only be a balsam if she lets him in into her soul. She can take place in him only if he takes place in her. If the first part includes a discussion on the senses, the relation here takes place in a wounded flesh that makes the senses possibl e. The presupposition for seeing is a wound in its need for something seen. But as something seen, the soul doubles this wound in its capacity to see. The soul duplicates the divine wound in its ability to both be seen and to see. It repeats the wound in i tself. Through this wound and di s- tance within herself, the soul alleviates the divine, maybe because its wound makes it possible to turn to the divine. The wound of the divine makes the individual being possible, the soul repeats this wound, which makes it poss i- ble to turn beyond the seen and create a relation to the divine. In this way the soul's wound makes it possible to be open to the divine. It is this mutual seeing that functions as a balsam. I would suggest, here, that the soul should not be understo od in contrast to the body, the flesh is rather the place where the wound can take place. The wound would then be a name for the soul. The soul duplicates or mirrors God, both as seeing and as seen, but mostly she duplicates God as gap b e- tween these. Becau se of this interweaving there is no definite split between man and God, but always a mutual dependence, an interweaving relationship where they weave each other. There can never be a 'one element ' in life and being, since this 'one' is always an immediate split. The element of sensing is from the beginning divided and therefore not only itself, but it is intertwi n- ing and longing for the other. As a body, the human being is thus double -sided - soul, sensed and sensing. Most often it has been her dimension o f sensing and the spiritualiz a- tion of this sensing that has connected her to the divine. But in this text it is the full sensing body that gives her a privileged position: When I reflect that divine nature now includes bone and flesh, body and soul, then I become elated in great joy, far beyond what I am worth. But angels are to some degree formed according to the Holy Trinity, but they are pure spirits. The soul alone with its flesh is mistress of the house in heaven, sits next to the eternal Master of the house, and is most like him. (IV:14]12 12 'Swenne ich das gedenke, da s gotlich nature nu an ir hat bein und vleisch, lip und sele, so e r- hebe mich mit grosser vrode verre \u00faber min wirdekeit. gebildet na 38 JONNA BORNEMARK Here it is obviously the embodiment of Jesus that makes the similarity to God complete. Jesus was body in the trinity from the very beginning, and his embodiment was not the consequence of the fall. In this text it is also clear that there is no opposition between 'soul' and 'body ': 'the soul with her flesh ' has the privileged position. The soul is thus not soul without her body, but just another angel. This is developed in another verse: [...] the noblest angel, Jesus C hrist, who soars above the Seraphim, who is undivided with his Father. Him shall I, the least of souls, take in my arms, eat him and drink him, and have my way with him. This can never happen to the angels. No matter how high he dwells above me, his Godhead shall never be so distant that I cannot constantly entwine my limbs with him; and so I shall never cool off. What, then, do I care what the angels experience? (II:22)13 The description of the communion here shows that the exteriority of the body , its capacity to act and to have power, is central to Mechthild. This c a- pacity gives her a specific intimacy and relation to the divine. Once again it is the worldly body, a body that can be seen and that can act in the world, that can do what the highest angel cannot. This exteriority of the body is closely connected to its interiority, to the warmth, and thus the life of the body, which here becomes the intimate meeting with the divine. This intimate and interior connection with God within the body is al so what constitutes the possibility for her to write: I do not know how to write, nor can I, unless I see with the eyes of my soul and hear with the ears of my eternal spirit and feel in all the parts of my body the power of the Holy Spirit. (IV:13)14 der heligen drivalteke sinem ungeteilet got mus sin, den nim ich minst\u00fa sele in den arm min u nd isse in und trinke in und tun mit wil. den engeln denne, was die engel bevinden? ' [II:22] A BODY SENSITIVE FOR TRANSCENDENCE : A MYSTICAL UNDERSTAN DING OF SENSIBILITY 39 In th is text the eyes of the soul and the ears of the spirit have a spiritu a- lized or metaphorical side to them, but when she comes to the limbs of her body, there is no room for metaphors. Feeling here stands out as the sensing closest to the body. If the eyes of the soul and the ears of the spirit make something present, the feeling of the limbs is the presence that they start out from. This is the present life that makes all transcendence, creativity, and memory of the human being possible. This is the place w here the soul is born and receives itself. THE WORLD BETWEEN US The senses are referred to in Mechthild's writings as the maids and he l- pers of the soul. She also says that her kingdom is sight, thought, speech, hearing and touch (I:46). In contrast to the standard five senses, smell and taste are here replaced by thought and speech. I do not think this is a misu n- derstanding, rather it tells us exactly how Mechthild considers sensing, namely as a sensible intellect or an intellectual sensibility. Her sea rch for the divine is not a spiritual striving beyond or away from sensibility; rather it is by means of the senses that she searches for the divine: 'The person who loves truth likes to pray thus: 'Ah, dear Lord, grant me and help me that I always seek yo u in a holy manner with all my five senses in all things [...]' ' (VII:15)15 By means of the senses she can find God within the things and beings of the world, but not as a thing or being. This means neither that the transcen d- ing power leaves the senses, nor t hat only what can be seen or heard is a c- cepted, rather she claims that the eyes of the soul can move beyond what is sensibly present (II:2 and II:3). We could understand this vision of the soul as exactly the transcending power where we are no longer bound to the present vision, but have a freedom to move within memory, visions of other and of fantasy, etc. Through this capacity, the human being can also turn toward the structure of sensibility itself and reflect upon this ability. But in Mechthild, 14 'Ich enkan noch mag ogen miner sele und hore es mit den oren mines ewigen geistes und bevinde in allen liden herre, gonne hilf mir, das ich dic h ane underlas suche mit minen BORNEMARK such re flection does not lead her to another world, rather she sees the world in a new way: Then the senses say: 'Our lady, the soul, has slept since childhood. Now she has awakened in the light of open love. ' In this light she looks around herself to discover Who that is who reveals himself to her, And what that is that one is saying to her. Thus does she see truly and understand How God is all things in all things. (II:19)16 The enlightened gaze upon the world thus sees the worldly beings not as self-sufficient and autonomous, but rather as connected to their groundless ground that also goes beyond them and ties them together, i.e. in relation to the transcendental and transce ndent divine. We can also emphasize the fact that in the above extract, it is the senses that tell us what the soul sees. That the soul is awakened and sees God could be understood as an event beyond sensibility, but since God here is experienced within th e things, sensibility is still active. Mechthild thus strives for the possibility to see this in all things, not only in some specific religious objects such as icons. When it is said in one verse that her kingdom of intellectual sensibility is threatened by external dangers and must be guarded in order not to be victim of the devil, this devilish moment can be understood as the tendency to see the beings as independent and without a connection to other things and to a ground. In a similar way, Mechthild w arns us for greed and lust, which can characterize earthly living. Although, in a text that is focused on such warnings of the earthly, she concludes with a warning against the opp o- site, i.e. to leave the world and love only God, as her God says: Those who know and love the nobility of my liberty cannot bear to love me o n- ly for my own sake. They must also love me in creatures. Thus do I remain what is most close to them in their souls. (VI:4)17 A theme which is repeated throughout The Flowing Light of Godhea d is thus the question of how one should love the worldly. This love is intimately 16 'So sprechent die der si, der sich iro wiset, und was das si, das man ir zu sprichet. So sieht si werlich und bekennet, wie ist all\u00fa ding in allen di n- gen.' [II:19] 17 edelkeit der mag nit das er mich a l- leine minne dur mich; mere er mus mich minnen in creaturen; so belibe ich der nehste in siner sele. ' [VI:4] A BODY SENSITIVE FOR TRANSCENDENCE : A MYSTICAL UNDERSTAN DING OF SENSIBILITY 41 connected to sensibility, but a sensibility that is not purely her own. It is not only a meeting between herself and the thing sensed, rather it is a meeting between herself , the divine and the created: 'Rather, in the nobility of cre a- tures, in their beauty and usefulness, I shall love God and not myself. ' (VI:5)18 The givenness of the world goes beyond herself to a larger givenness; what is given to a self is connected to a g ivenness beyond this individual, possible to access for others, and even when it is an experience that is not in any detail possible to access for other humans, she is not alone in this experience. G i- venness always transcends her. Mechthild's position mea ns that she does not stand between the world and God in such a way that she either has to turn her back to the beings in her search for God, or turn her back to God in her experience of the world. Rather she is positioned in such a way that her senses can go through the things and beings that are present here and now, towards their presuppos i- tions and interconnections, without objectifying these presuppositions. The senses do not have to be directed in one or other of the two opposing dire c- tions, but can em brace both at once. When she experiences the infinite she does not transform it into one object among many, but senses it as a central aspect of the finite. The change of direction that the awakening soul goes through does not include a move from the finit e to the infinite, but she is directed to the created beings in their direction to God. Or with a more ph i- losophical language: toward the thing in the world in direction to its tra n- scendental, transcending ground through which the thing overflows how it is given to me. In a similar way she says in a hymn of thanksgiving that such a seeing should permeate all our actions. This is pointed out in a text that describes how the human being is always united with God, a union that does not take place in some dista nt heaven, but through the receiving of worldly gifts that are given to the human beings: Then we praise our Lord God with all the gifts that he ever gave us: our body and possessions, friends and relatives, and all the earthly joy that we could d e- sire. In so doing we thank God for all his generous gifts that he ever gave us on earth for body and soul. Then we are united with God in the love of receiving and in humble gratitude. We should thereby press all God's gifts to our heart. Then our heart becomes fu ll of love, our senses are opened, and our soul so 18 'Mere der edelkeit der creaturen, ir sc honi und - da wil got i nne meinen und nit mich selben.' [VI:5] 42 JONNA BORNEMARK resplendent that we look into divine knowledge like someone who sees his own countenance in a bright mirror. (VII:7)19 God, in this instance, names a giving that we cannot control. By opening us up for the feeling of gratitude for having a human life, senses are once again transformed as they are opened up. The union with God is here a d e- lightful enjoyment of the world. There are also some formulations in Mec h- thild's text that could be understood in a panthe istic way, as when God says: 'I am in myself in all places and in all things, As I always have been eternally. ' (II:25)20 God is in himself in the world, i.e. not in himself beyond the world. This is not a pantheism that means that God is exhausted in the w orld though, it is more like a panentheism in which God is present in the beings, but also exceeds them as their horizon of transcendence. This understanding of God and of the presence of God is not just Mec h- thild's personal experience; it is connected to her choice of life as a beguine. Her philosophical position influences her practical life, or the other way around; her practical life is expressed in her writings. As a beguine she was most probably involved in different social and financial activities in the city, since the beguines did not turn their back up the world and isolate the m- selves in a convent. Their relation to the divine went through, or was exp e- rienced within, the rush of the city. Her work in the world was not only an act of compassion for the creatures that were stuck in the world, but rather an experience of the world as a place where a relation to the divine could be established, enjoyed and suffered. SIMILARITY AND DISSIM ILARITY In a very different text (III:9) Mechthild gives us her version of the cre a- tion. She describes the creation as originating in an erotic desire for the soul, 19 'so loben wir \u00fansern herren got gega b: ' 'Ich bin in mir selben an allen stetten und in allen dingen als ich ie was sunder beginnen. ' [II:25] A BODY SENSITIVE FOR TRANSCENDENCE : A MYSTICAL UNDERSTAN DING OF SENSIBILITY 43 connected to Eve and Mary. The angels are said to be created as one spirit with the Holy Spirit, whereas the human being is created in similarity and oppo sition, as the other to God and as his bride. The human being is, as we have seen before, not inferior to the angel, but God's beloved. The human is created in similarity to the humanity of the son, but in otherness to the f a- ther, as his loved one. In one text God says: 'I longed for you before the b e- ginning of the world. I long for you and you long for me. Where two burning desires meet, there love is perfect. ' (VII:16)21 From the very beginning he is desire. As in any desire, there is an urge to both draw the beloved into oneself, and to keep a distance to the beloved in order for her to be herself. Before the fall the soul is God's spouse and a Go d- dess, and the angels are her servants. Through the creation the human being passively receives her life, but i t immediately leads to the fall. The fall only receives attention in passing when God complains about her action saying: 'She decided not to remain in my likeness. ' (III:9)22 She was created in diffe r- ence to him and in the fall she activates what she passiv ely received, and acts out her otherness. Even though the Father turns away from her, the Spirit and the Son ne v- er stop loving her, and they decide to save her. The love between the soul and the divine is not diminished, but the erotic tension grows throug h the i n- creased distance. God is in this text desiring and as such demands his beloved to be other than himself. The human being takes on this otherness and act i- vates it, which necessitates the fall. The distance between them is here created in two steps, one of passivity and one where the activity that is i m- manent in the passivity is activated. The intertwining of sensuality is here formulated in erotic terms. The gap within the net of sensibility is the pr e- supposition for otherness and desire is thus orga nized through a simultan e- ous similarity and dissimilarity. The full erotic meeting, where the worldly senses meet their limit is worked out in I:44, one of the most famous verses in The Flowing Light of the Godhead . This text is dramatized and mythological , and borrows its form from contemporary wedding songs and the poetry of courtly love. The senses play a central role in this verse also. The extract begins with the lover (God) 21 'Ich habe din begert e der welte beginne. 44 JONNA BORNEMARK who tries to make contact with his beloved (the soul) and calls for her. The first one to hear his calling is the senses. They say to the soul: - Lady, you should dress yourself. - Dear ones, where am I supposed to be going? - We have definitely heard it whispered about that the prince intends to come to you in the dew and in the delightful song of the birds. Alas lady, do not tarry! (I:44)23 The calling is not for the senses, but for the soul. But it is the senses that are attentive to the calling and they assist her as she gets dressed and puts on the shirt of humility, the dress of chastity and the coat of the holy calling. She goes to the meeting place where she meets the lover who asks her to dance with him. She answers that if he sings to her, her enjoyment will transcend all human senses. The meeting with the lover is in this text a journey beyond, or \u00fcber . This has often been understood as a leaving of one place for another. But I would rather understand it in relation to the Greek hyper , meaning i n- tensification or deepening. Once the soul has become aware of the divine she also realizes the limitation of the senses and their abilities. The divine is in the perception, but cannot be experienced in one perception. This amorous meeting is an attempt to approach the non -given sides of the divine. After dancing, the soul is invite d to dinner. She is tired and returns to the senses telling them that she needs to rest and cool down. The senses su g- gest different Christian virtues and strategies through which the soul can rest and in which they can take part, but the soul is only satis fied by the erotic meeting beyond strategies on chastity, suffering, or wisdom, or positions of the saints, the angels, or of the child. But the erotic meeting is also the only kind of meeting that would blind the senses. In this meeting the soul finds its nature and even though the senses are blinded in this union, one sensation is still involved: he burns and he refreshes and this is still felt as she explains to the senses: - Don't you believe I feel him intensely? He can both burn powerfully and cool con solingly. Now don't be overly sad. You shall yet instruct 23 '- Vrowe, o- gelsange. Eya vrowe, sument n\u00fat lange!' A BODY SENSITIVE FOR TRANSCENDENCE : A MYSTICAL UNDERSTAN DING OF SENSIBILITY 45 When I return, I shall certainly need your advice; For the earth is full of snares. (I:44)24 And with this promise to come back it is time for the most intimate e n- counter: - Stay, Lady Soul. - What do you bid me, Lord? - Take off your clothes. - Lord, what will happen to me then? - Lady Soul, you are so utterly formed to my nature that not the slightest thing can be between you and me. Never was an angel so glorious that to him was granted for one hour wha t is given to you for eternity. And so you must cast off from you both fear and shame and all external virtues. Rather, those alone that you carry within yourself shall you foster forever. These are your noble longing and your boundless desire. These I sha ll fulfill fo r- ever with my limitless lavishness. - Lord, now I am a naked soul and you in yourself are a well -adorned God. Our shared lot is eternal life without death Then a blessed stillness that both desire comes over them. He surrenders hi m- self to her, a nd she surrenders herself to him. What happens to her then - she knows - and that is fine with me. But this cannot last long. When two lovers meet secretly, they must often part from one another inseparably. (I:44)25 In this intimate amorous meeting the soul is turned away from all things as particular beings and she lays aside all cultural virtues as she removes her clothes. She leaves all particularity in order to open up for the one ove r- whelming desire and sensation that is the sensation of sensing, an d thus above ( \u00fcber ) the ordinary sense experience to an experience of their presu p- position. This intensification erases all distinctions and makes the multiple 24 'Went ir, das ich nit enpfinde son wol? Er kan brennen und mir nihtes nit mag sin. Es enwart nie engel so her, dem das ein stunde \"Herre, nakent ir nu geschehe, das weis si, und des getroste ich JONNA BORNEMARK perceptions impossible. Only one sensation is still there, the sensation of the desire between t he two, i.e. the gap between them: a sensation of the sensual as such. This also includes a move beyond language and a narrator needs to come into the story. But the union between God and the soul is like all other erotic unions - temporary. Following this meeting, she will at all times carry the sensation of sensibility with her in her body, maybe simply because she has become conscious of it. CONCLUSION The body is in many Christian practices what should be disciplined into silence and the senses somet hing that should be transcended. In Mechthild's text also the body is sometimes described as a prison. Her solution is not to abandon it, but to be more attentive to it, i.e. not to follow its desire toward a world of disconnected things and beings, but to go into this desiring stru c- ture of enjoyment and suffering. Such attentiveness means not only to live the activity of the sensing body, but also to be attentive to its passivity - how its sensitivity is given. Disciplining includes a holding back of the a pprehe n- sions in order to find another sensing, a sensing of the sensitivity. One should not turn away from the world, nor should one lose oneself in the world. The experience of the world should rather be deepened and intens i- fied, experiencing the intercon nectedness and presuppositions of the world. The soul that loves the divine and lives in proximity to its own presu p- positions has a body sensitive for transcendence. It is attentive to divine d i- mensions, the non -seen in sensing, eating, suffering, etc. The sensing body as the presence of the here and now includes the presence of absence, of desire for what is not present, and the possibility to have another future as well as to sense differently, noticing new things in t he present. Sensibility turns out to be the path between the body as an object, as static and sensed, and the transcending soul that includes what is not given in the present. The soul that speaks in Mechthild's text should not be under s- tood in opposition to a body. It is rather a sensing and embodied soul, just as her sensing is an intellectual sensing. In this way the lived body is present and activated, and its experiences are intensified in the soul's journey to God. Finally in the erotic encounter, th e tension field, gap and desire between the soul as sensed sensing and her God as (anonymous) sensing beyond sensing, is the only sensation left. This is the intensification of sensibility. 47 3 The Embodied Character of 'Acknowledging God' A Contribution to Understanding the Relationship between Transcendence and Embodiment on the Basis of Hosea PETRUSCHKA SCHAAFSMA Protestant Theological University Amsterdam ABSTRACT In this article I follow Bornemark's approach to clarify the embodied character of religion 'via the text' by turning to the book of Hosea. Hosea is especially suitable for studying the controversy over the body in religion because it has traditionally bee n interpreted as r e- jecting a religious cult of bodily fertility as opposed to the true ethical religion of Israel. I investigate different motives of embodiment in the text. Subsequently I deal with the critical question of whether the project of revaluati ng the bodily guarantees better understanding of Hosea and (biblical) religion. I explore the body -related notions of 'dependence' and 'discernment' as a more specific alternative, which also sheds light on current difficulties in understanding religion. KEYWORDS embodied religion, Hosea, dependence, discernment, Kearney 48 PETRUSCHKA SCHAAFSMA 1. TRANSCENDENCE AND THE BODY By analysing a primary 13th-century religious text by the Christian mystic Mechtild von Magdeburg, Jonna Bornemark wants to arrive at a different view of the relation between transcendence and the body from the current one. Usually, the body and the self - insofar as it is associated with the body - are seen as things that should be left behind in the transcending re lation to God (26). Bornemark wants to combine the good of the phenomenological tradition that is characterized by its thorough attention for the body with the insights from Mechtild's text in which embodiment and sensibility are given a different role with respect to transcending. Thus, she also aims to compe n- sate for the notable lack of positive attention for the body in phenomenolog i- cal accounts of religion. Her general goal is to arrive at 'a more nuanced u n- derstanding of the relation between transcenden ce and embodiment' ( 30). The issue at stake in this session is thus the question: How can paying attention to the embodied character of religion contribute to a better, or 'more nuanced,' understanding of religion? The flipside of embodied religion, i.e. that it may give rise to a critical rethinking of religious notions of freedom and responsibility, and the unique position of the human being based on it will be taken up in later sessions. According to Bornemark, the better unde r- standing of religion that results from analysing an embodied religious pe r- spective consists primarily in the fact that transcendence and the body are not played off against each other. The senses give access to the divine. But it takes effort to comprehend how this is possible. The mainstream understan d- ing of religion has not incorporated this idea of transcenden ce, not even when it was as attentive to embodiment as phenomenology and existential philosophy are. In spite of the importance of their 'connecting the divine closely to the human capacity for transcendence and its transcendental pr e- suppositions,' these a pproaches finally led to the 'further narrowing down [of] the understanding of the body and the place of embodiment' ( 30). Ther e- fore, it is necessary to tap other, non -mainstream, sources of religious refle c- tion outside the philosophical canon, in particul ar those of female mystics like Mechtild von Magdeburg. They are not part of the official religious canon either. Because of their positive evaluation of the senses in relating to God, they aroused suspicion in the eyes of other mystics ( 27-28). Bornemark deals with a 'suspicious' text of this kind. This investigation of embodied religion 'via the text' is not self -evident among current critics of the mainstream spiritual understanding of religion. In the words of Manuel V\u00e1squez, who recently launched a 'ma terialist theory THE EMBODIED CHARACT ER OF 'ACKNOWLEDGING GOD ': THE RELATIONSHIP BET WEEN TRANSCENDENCE A ND EMBODIMENT 49 of religion' that has met with appreciation, modern hermeneutics has 'despite giving us indispensable insights into the situatedness of the process of inte r- pretation and the materiality of texts, tended to reduce all human activity to the production and transmission of meaning. The result has been a suffoca t- ing textualism that approaches religions as essentially systems of symbols, beliefs, narratives, and cosmologies, ignoring other important material d i- mensions of religious life.'1 The id ealist appropriation of phenomenology and modern hermeneutics are identified as the culprits of this focus. This crit i- cism on the one hand and Bornemark's approach - to which I am very sy m- pathetic - of turning quite self -evidently to a primary religious te xt on the other induced me to try out another approach in this paper 'via the text.' I will also turn to a primary religious text that is not considered to be a ph i- losophical text as such. My use of this text is occasioned not so much through my dissatisfa ction with certain aspects of the phenomenological tradition, but through the fact that I am a theologian shaped by a hermeneutical reco g- nition of the vital role of such texts in understanding religion. In particular, my starting point is the wager found i n Paul Ricoeur's early work to nourish reflection on religion by turning to primary religious texts. He suggests that these are closer to religious experience than the speculative ones of philos o- phy and theology.2 In a Western context, the symbols and myth s of the a n- cient Near East and Greece and, in particular the Bible, are primary texts of this kind because they are formative sources of Western reflection. When looking for a biblical text in which embodiment is somehow prominent, I decided to turn to a t ext that may also shed light on the que s- tion why it has apparently always (Bornemark refers to the Neo -Platonic Tr a- dition) been difficult to think religion and the body together. Bornemark points to the tension between transcendence and the body to underst and this difficulty. Religion is concerned with transcendence, the spirit or the soul, and the possibility of going beyond the givenness of the bodily. Especially in 1 Manuel A. V\u00e1squez, More than Belief: A Materialist Theory of Religion (Oxford 2011), 12, cf. 15 and chapter 8. 2 'Speculation / speculative' is used by Ricoeur as a technical term that refers to reflection as found in philosophy or theology, as distinct from more literary forms of reflection as found in symbols and myths of evil ( L'homme faillible , -169 (Paris 19882, first edition 1960)). The philosophical value of pre -philosophical expressions, in the form of the 'path\u00e9tique of mi s- ery', is something that in L'homme faillible (21-34): philosophical refl ection cannot equal it in depth. Nevertheless, reflection is necessary for bringing clarification and coherence to the darkness and complexity of the pre -philosophical expressions. Cf. my chapter on Ricoeur in: Petruschka Schaafsma, Reconsidering Evil : (Leuven 2006). 50 PETRUSCHKA SCHAAFSMA phenomenology and existential philosophy, this tendency to associate reli g- ion entirely wit h the capacity for bodiless transcendence is massive ( 26, 29 - 30). But is this simply to be understood as a one -sidedness, which can be e x- plained at least to a certain extent by the male character of this philosophy (26-27)? I am in complete agreement with the project to investigate margi n- alised voices like those of female mystics who reveal a different kind of refle c- tion and may thus open up new ways of understanding. But I am also inte r- ested in the light these marginalised voices may shed on why the body w ould cause religion trouble. Does the problem lie in not knowing if we can trust our senses, as emphasised in the criticism of dependence 'on the senses' a ticulated by Meister Eckhardt and Johannes Tauler that Bornemark cites, i.e., their question of how we know if the mystical vision comes 'from the devil rather than from the divine' ( 28)? I want to incorporate this issue of the diff i- culty with the body in religion3 by turning to the book of Hosea. In this text, the embodied character of religion seems ob vious: Hosea has to live the rel a- tionship between God and Israel by marrying a prostitute. This book has tr a- ditionally been interpreted as dealing with the problematic character of the body for religion in the concrete form of a religious cult of bodily fe rtility as opposed to the true ethical religion of the Israelite God of the Covenant. Therefore, the text seems to fit the polemical character of the discussion on embodied religion. 2. MOTIVES OF EMBODIED RELIGION IN HOSEA In what sense do we encounter elements of an embodied religion in H o- sea? Obviously, in a quite unusual sense that may immediately confuse the reader: God tells Hosea to marry a prostitute or adulterous wife and have children with her. This divine command has been a stumbling block for exe- getes of all ages. How can God ask such an obviously immoral or nonsensical 3 Bornemark hints at this issue when pointing out that, in Mechtild's text, the love of the worldly is connected to sensibility but sensibility 'that is not purely her own.' The way one should love the worldly is not just in 'a meeting between herself and the thing sensed, rather it is a meeting between herself, the divine and the created' ( 41). Also, Mechtild's thoughts on the 'prison character' of the body relate to this topic. Mechtild does not deny t his problematic character of the body but she does not seek the solution in transcendence as abandonment of 'the presuppositions of the sensing body.' Rather, she seeks it in being more attentive to them ( 44-45). This means a disciplined holding back of the direct sensing, the 'apprehensions,' to arrive at 'another sensing.' It does not 'turn away from the world' but neither does it 'lose itself in the world.' Rather it deepens and intensifies the experience of the world by 'experiencing the interconnectedn ess and presuppositions of the world' ( 46). THE EMBODIED CHARACT ER OF 'ACKNOWLEDGING THE RELATIONSHIP BET WEEN TRANSCENDENCE A ND EMBODIMENT 51 thing from his prophet? As self -evident as this question may be - in our co n- text of discussing embodied religion as well - I do not want to start with it. The supposedly immoral or nonsensical character of the divine command should not outweigh the basic fact that the relationship between God and the people of Israel is presented as bodily: one between husband and wife, an erotic relationship of faithfulness to a partner. This ge neral sense of embod i- ment is of course immediately accentuated by the issue of adultery, which implies a more specific embodiment related to sexuality and procreation. But the meaning of this unfaithfulness can be interpreted only in relation to the meanin g of the embodied relationship as such. I will thus start with the la t- ter. 2.1 THE MARRIAGE The relationship is introduced immediately at the beginning. The first verse introduces Hosea as the one to whom the 'word of the Lord' came. In the second verse G od4 tells him to take for himself an 'et in the same verse: 'for fornicating the land fornicates, away from behind the Lord.' The Hebrew root znh / hnz is used four times in this verse. Znh / hnz means to commit adultery or fornication in the sense of being unfaithful in a marriage, but also in the sense of prostit u- tion or being a harlot. It is often used in the Bible, especially in Isaiah , Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, to indicate Israel's apostasy and unfaithfulness.6 The 4 I will refer to the Tetragrammaton by the word 'God' and not, e.g. by the term LORD or Yahweh because it fits the style of a reflection on embodied religion within the context of philosophy of religion where th e focus is on biblical religion. 5 I take this translation woman and children of 'fornications' from Alice Keefe's study on Hosea; Koehler/ Baumgartner's Lexicon translates 'fornication.' Keefe argues that fornication should be disti n- guished from prostitu tion. Prostitution was a 'legal and tolerated activity in ancient Israel.' The fornic a- tion of a woman in the sense of a wife, however, implied a rupture of the social order. Although there are also references to 'professional prostitution' in Hosea, the te rm's translation by 'fornication' emph a- sises its unique character in the Bible, which indicates that it does not simply refer to a prostitute (Alice A. Keefe, Woman's Body and the Social Body in Hosea (Sheffield 2001), especially 19 -21, where she refers to Phyllis Bird for this translation). Cf. my remarks the text above. 6 On the specific designation in Hos.1:2 of the 'land,' in distinction to Israel, as fornicating, cf. Emmanuel O. Nwaoru, Imagery in the Prophecy of Altes Testament (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz 1999) 145 regards it 'prolegomena to the husband -wife metaphor in Hosea 2,' where Israel is presented as a 'harlotrous wife and mother.' He distinguishes between the unfaithfu l- ness of Israel as land, wife/mother, an d children without indicating the possible distinction in meaning. This corresponds to Kathrin Keita's remark that the wife, children and land in Hos. 1 -2 are related in a 'semantischen Beziehungsgeflecht, das kaum zu entwirren ist.' The d e-52 PETRUSCHKA SCHAAFSMA combination 'woman of fornications' and that of 'children of fornications' is found only in Hosea, however. Placed in immediate succession, they form an even more remarkable expression and are not simply the usual designations of prostitution. The terms are not elucidated in the text, however. The text continues by narrating how Hosea obeyed the divine command: he marries Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim . Then God gives further instructions on the naming of the 'children of fornications' to which Gomer gives birth. The first is called Jezreel because God will punish the house of Jehu for the massacre at Jezreel (1:4). The second is called Lo -Ruhamah, which means : God ' will no longer show love to Israel' (1:6). The third is called Lo -Ammi, ' for you are not my people' (1:9). The names thus reveal God's reaction to the fornications of Israel : punishment, no compassion, deeming them no longer God's people. The relati onship between God and Israel is declared to be terminated. But the text suddenly continues by painting a different time of salvation that will come in which the situation indicated by the children's names will be i n- verted (2:1 -3).7 While the first chapte r of the book indicates the unfaithful behaviour of 'the land' , God's reaction of turning away from his people, and the promise of a reversal of this punishment in a general sense, the second chapter spec i- fies these elements and may thus provide more mate rial for understanding the embodied character of the relation between God and Israel. The theme of fornication returns in the later chapters, but it is not directly related to H o- sea's marriage to Gomer and the children born of that union. Therefore, I will concentrate on the second chapter (the passage from verse 4 onwards) and relate it to similar passages in the rest of the book.8 The passage starts with a termined without referring to the meaning of the 2007), 55 -56). 7 The numbering of the verses of Hos. 2 varies among th e translations. I am using the the New International Version but refer to the numbering of the verses used in the Hebrew Bible (Stuttgarte n- sia). In the Hebrew Bible, chapter 2 starts two verses earlier than in the NIV. Chapter 14 starts in the NIV in the l ast verse of chapter 13 in the Hebrew version. 8 Hos. 1 -3 are usually distinguished from chapters 4 -14, although opinions vary on the question of whether it is a textual unity. For example, according to J\u00f6rg Jeremias Hos. 1 -3 is a thematic colle c- tion, whe reas 4 -14 is a unity. As a result, the obscure chapters of Hos. 1 -3 should be interpreted on the basis of the much more unequivocal chapters 4 -14 (J\u00f6rg Jeremias, Der Prophet Hosea (G\u00f6ttingen 1983), 7). Gerald Morris investigates verbal repetition in Hosea and concludes that many verbs and combin a- tions found in Hos. 1 -3 recur in the rest of the chapters. He argues therefore that Hos. 1 -3 'act as an introduction to the book. Pattern after pattern is introduced in these chapters, sometimes even temp o- rarily res olved, fore -shadowing the pattern that the word or words will take in the remaining chapters' (Gerald Morris, Prophecy, Poetry and Hosea (Sheffield 1996), 114 -115). Hos. 14 serves as a conclusion in which many words from the introduction recur. THE EMBODIED CHARACT ER OF 'ACKNOWLEDGING GOD ': THE RELATIONSHIP BET WEEN TRANSCENDENCE A ND EMBODIMENT 53 divine address opening with the call : 'Rebuke your mother, rebuke her, for she is not my wife, and I am not her husband' (2:4). The mother is su m- moned to do away with her fornications under threat of harsh reprisals: being stripped naked and dying of thirst like a desert, or a parched land (2:5). The following verses elaborate further on what the fornica tion consists in. Three main motives can be distinguished that elucidate the relationship between God and Israel. 1. In one of the rare passages in which Gomer, Hosea's wife, is presented as speaking - albeit in the account of God - her unfaithfulness is made speci - fic: 'She said, \" I will go after my lovers, who give me my food and my water, my wool and my linen, my olive oil and my drink \"' (Hos. 2:7). God will ther e- fore block her path and wall her in, so that she cannot reach her lovers an y- more. Then, the unfaithfulness is stated explicitly once more in the same terms, when God says: 'She has not acknowledged that I was the one who gave her the grain, the new wine and oil, who lavished on her the silver and gold - which they used for Baal' (Hos. 2:10). The punishment corresponds to the betrayal. God says: 'Therefore I will take away my grain when it ripens, and my new wine when it is ready. I will take back my wool and my linen, intended to cover her naked body ' (Hos. 2:9) . 'I will ruin her vines and he r fig trees, which she said were her pay from her lovers; I will make them a thicket, an d wild animals will devour them ' (Hos. 2:13) . It reminds one of the earlier announcement of God's judgement to make Gomer 'like a desert, turn her into a parched land, and slay her with thirst ' (2:5) . The unfaithfulness is thus specified as a denial of the true source of the wealth and sustenance a woman experiences in her marriage, especially in the basic, daily form of food, drink, and clothing, which includes a good h arvest and agricultural thriving. In the depiction of the restoration of the marriage one also finds refe r- ences to this wealth and sustenance bestowed on her. As a result of her being unable to reach her lovers anymore, Gomer will say 'I will go back to my hus- band as at first, for then I was better off than now '(2:9; italics mine). The r e- newal of the marriage is subsequently painted as resulting from an act of a l- lurement by God who will lead the woman into the desert (2:16), not to pu n- ish her (cf. 2:5) but to give her back her vineyards (2:17)9 - another act in the 9 In Hos. 9,10 and 13,5 the word 'desert' or 'wilderness' ( midbar / rbdm ) also occurs, now as the place where Israel is 'found' and 'known/ cared for' by God. According to Keita, 'desert' functions in Hosea as a counterpart to the fertility of the cultivated land. In the days of its living in the desert, Israel 54 PETRUSCHKA SCHAAFSMA same area of being nourished by God. This continues a few verses later : '\"In that day I will respond,\" declares the LORD - \"I will respond to the skies, and they will respond to the earth; and the earth will respond to the grain, the new wine and the olive oil, and they will respond to Jezreel. I will plant her for myself in the land\"' (2:23 -25a; cf. 2:10). In the rest of the book of Hosea, the situation of the people of Israel at the start of its being called from Egypt, the announcement of God's punishment for their unfaithfulness, and the r e- newed relationship are often depicted in terms of agricultural thriving or withering, and Israel being like fruit, or no longer yielding fruit, or flouris h- ing again like the grain and the vine, the blossoming lilies and the cedars with their roots and young shoots (14:5 -7).10 Moreover, even God is seen as part of this natural prosperity : 'I am like a flourishing juniper; your fruitfu l- ness comes from me ' (14:9b).11 This motif in the depiction of the relationship between God and his people in Hosea reminds some exegetes of the creation stories of Genesis 1 - 3.12 I will not go into the different theories here on the age of and dependency relations between Hosea and Gen esis 1 -3, but it is argued that a common creation tradition underlies both. This tradition brings together many of the elements just mentioned. In the second chapter of Hosea, elements remini s- cent of this tradition are the participation of the animals and plants in God's punishment of Israel and in the renewal of the relationship. Animals can co n- stitute a danger, and vegetation can be sparse in Israel if God decrees that it shall be so. But God also announces the time in which ' I will make a covenant for th em [Israel] with the beasts of the field, the birds in the sky and the cre a- tures that move along the ground' (2:20), which is also the time of the flou r- ishing of agriculture and nature in general that was just mentioned.13 Simi- had to rely entirely on the care of God. Similarly, Israel will be led back to the desert (Hos. 2:16; 12:10) to break in on its current craving for the fertile land. Thus, God will also start a new begin in the land (Keita, Gottes Land , 242 -243). 10 Other passages in which Israel is depicted as (bearing) fruit are Hos 9:10,16; 10:1,12 -13; 14:6 -9. 11 For the depiction of the situation of the restored or renewed relationship, the phrase of God as 'responding' ( 'nh/ hn() as used in Cf. Keita , Gottes Land , exegetes. Stefan Paas ( Creation and Judgement: Creation Texts in Some Eighth Century Prophets (Leiden 2003)) also goes into the 'creation texts' and 'motifs' in Hosea but does not focus on the parallels with Gen. 1 -3. Rather, he aims at a broader definition of creation, starting from 'recognised creation texts such as Genesis 1 and 2.' In rel a- tion to Hosea, he goes into the 'creation texts' on LXX insertion on 'God creator of heavens and earth' and the 'creation motifs' in Hos. 6:2 (revival and restoration) and 11:1 (calling out of Egypt, cf. my main text below). 13 M. DeRoche (referring to J.L. Mays ) points out that this is 'a reversal of the oracle of punis h- ment in Hos. 2,14' (M. Deroche, 'The Reversal of Creation in Hosea,' THE EMBODIED CHARACT RELATIONSHIP BET WEEN TRANSCENDENCE A ND EMBODIMENT 55 larly, in the garden of Eden, the animals are placed under the dominion of human beings (Gen. 1:28), and all vegetation of the earth is given to them as food (1:29). Moreover, as DeRoche (406) points out, like Hos. 2:14 and 20, Gen. 1:29 -30 'deals with the relationship between the food supply of man, and that of the beasts.' In the passage in Genesis, this relationship is harmonious, while in Hos 2:14 animals constitute a danger. The covenant in Hos. 2:20 puts an end to this danger and thus depicts a 'return to the state of harmony that existed between man and the beasts at the time of creation (cf. Isa. 11,6 -9)' (DeRoche, 407). After the expulsion from Eden, this harmony is at least partly disturbed: the earth would 'produce thorns and thistles' for them and they would 'eat the plants o f the field' (3:18). The combination 't horns and thistles' is found in the Bible only in the Gen. 3 passage and in Hos. 10:8: 'The high places of wickedness will be destroyed - it is the sin of Israel. Thorns and thistles will grow up and cover their altar s. Then they will say to the mountains, \"Cover us!\" and to the hills, \"Fall on us!\".'14 The theme of nake d- ness and being clothed as expressions of God's taking care of and punishing Adam and Eve and Israel is also found in Gen 2 -3 and Hosea.15 A general co r- respondence, finally, is that the betrayal of and conflict with God is put in the setting of a husband -wife relationship.16 One could even perhaps compare Gomer to Eve as the one who bears the most guilt for the betrayal .17 400-409, 406). Hos. 4:3 contains a counterview to the thriving of the land and the animals, with partly the same phrases as in Hos. 2:20: because there is no acknowledgment of God but only sins - that r e- mind of the Decalogue, i.e., cursing, lying, murder, stealing, adultery - 'the land dries up, and all who live in it waste away; the beasts of the fie ld, the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea are swept away .' DeRoche (403) argues that Hos. 4:3 is the announcement of the reversal of creation: the order of the words 'the beasts of the field, the birds in the sky and the fish in the sea ' is precisel y the reversal of the order in which they are mentioned at creation (Gen 1:20, 24) a nd being placed under the dominion of human beings (Gen 1:26, 28). They represent the three spheres of the 'animal kingdom' and the prophet thus announces 'a total destruct ion' (just like the parallel text in Zeph. 1:2 -3 where the same verb jsp / Psjy is used). 14 Cf. Hos. 9:6 in which the plants also are a danger: ' Their treasures of silver will be taken over by briers [brier roses], and thorns will overrun their tents. ' The unique occurrence of 'thorns and thi s- tles' in Genesis and Hosea seems to me the only real textual 'proof' of any relation to the creation st o- ries in Genesis, but Keita does not indicate this. 15 Hos. 2:5, 11 -12. Cf. Keita, Gottes Land , 319. 16 Keita regards the relations between Hos. 1 -2 and Gen. 3 as the most substantial and striking ones. Apart from the aspects mentioned so far, Keita lists other points that are, in my view, less obvious (319-320): - punishment in the form of spatial removal from God in Hos. 2:8 and Gen. 3:23 -24 as well as the idea of an enclosed garden that cannot be entered; - the use of the verb grsh / #$rg, expel in Hos. 9:15 and Gen 3:24 which also has a parallel meaning: expulsion because of betrayal of God, a meaning that, according to Keita, is not found elsewhere in the Bible (it is only used for the expulsion of Canaa n- ite people in favour of Israel; cf. also p. 328 ); the ' you will call me \"my husband\"; you will no longer call 56 PETRUSCHKA SCHAAFSMA This first interpretive motif, or thematic group of motifs, thus relates the unfaithfulness of the wife to the refusal to acknowledge who it is who pr o- vides her with food, drink, and clothing: the Lord, who is like the rains that water the earth, and like dew.18 Israel turns to other provi ders, and God therefore punishes them by taking the harvest back, and 'my wool and linen.' But Hosea also announces the restoration of the marriage that consists in acknowledging God. This situation is painted as a thriving of the land and a flourishing of nature in which the people of Israel take part. The remini s- cence of Gen. 1 -3 confirms the idea that the relationship between God and human beings is not unrelated to the flourishing of nature and the produce of the land, and the danger posed by animals. T his motif is the most elab o- rate interpretation of Israel's fornications, at least in Hos. 1 -3, with parallels in the other chapters. 2. Other interpretive motifs of Israel's unfaithfulness are far less substa n- tial. One finds a few references in the first three chapters to something like a 'wrong cult.' We just referred to 'the silver and gold - which they used for Baal' (Hos. 2:10), which seems to refer to the making of idols.19 Another verse specifies the punishment of the wife/mother as stopping her celeb rations, festivals, her New Moons, her Sabbath days (Hos. 2:13). This reference to the religious cult is related in the following verse again to the ruining of the 'vine and fig tree.' Subsequently, the wife/mother is accused of burning incense to me \"my master\"' (Hos 2:18) seems to be a r evocation of the ruling of the husband over the wife in Gen. 3:16, and a parallel to Gen. 2:23 ( The man said, 'This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called \"woman,\" for she was taken out of man.' Keita, 305 -306 quoting Frey and H auret). Para lels with Gen. 2 that Keita menti ons are: Hos. 2:17, which deals , just like Gen. 2:8,15 with the human beings as being placed by God in a garden/land; Hos. 2:25 as parallel to Gen. 2:7 -8 (3:19): the human being as created by God from dust/grou nd corresponds to God as the sower who sows Israel in the land (Keita, Gottes Land , 318). Cf. also Keita, Gottes Land , 330 -331 on the dating of Gen. 2 before the return from the exile in 525 BCE. 17 This may seem a very tentative conclusion that is based on the (Christian) reception history of the Genesis story as viewing the woman as the source of evil. However, as Yvonne Sherwood points out, a possible underpinning for this connection may be seen in a 13th century Bible manuscript in which Hosea and Gomer are depicted holding each other's arms. Gomer is decorated with a garland ending in a snake's head (Yvonne Sherwood, The Prostitute and the Prophet: Hosea's Marriage in Literary - Theoretical Perspective (Sheffield 1996 ), 67-69). 18 Cf. Hos. 6:3: ' Let us acknowledge the LORD; let us press on to acknowledge him. As surely as the sun rises, he will appear; he will come to us like the winter rains, like the spring rains that water the earth.' and Hos. 14,5: ' I will be like the dew to Israel'; cf. also Hos. 10:12b: ' for it is time to seek the LORD, until he comes and showers his righteousness on you.' 19 Cf. Hos. 8:4: ' With their silver and gold they make idols for themselves to their own destru c- tion. ' and Hos. 13: 2: ' Now they sin more and more; they mak e idols for themselves from their silver, cleverly fashioned images, all of them the work of craftsmen.

Another verse announces that God ' will remove the names of the Baals from her lips; no longer will their names be invoked' (2:19). I will come back to the mean ing of these Baals and a possible Baal cult below. 3. A third motif in the specification of Israel's infidelity contains refe r- ences to war, justice, and 'international politics.' In the depiction of the r e- stored marriage the making of a covenant with the animals is followed by the announcement: ' Bow and sword and battle I will abolish from the land, so that all may lie down in safety. I will betroth you to me forever; I will betroth you in/with righteousness and justice, in/with love and compassion. I will betroth you in/with faithfulness, and you will acknowledge the LORD' (2:20b - 22). More explicit references to war and politics are found in the later cha p- ters.20 Israel, or Ephraim, is accused of seeking an alliance with Assyria and Egypt ( 5:13; 7:8 -9, 11; 12:2; less which will lead to its fall.21 It is obvious that this turning to the superpowers implies infidelity t o- ward God who led Israel out of Egypt. Israel is reminded explicitly of its ex o- dus tradition (2:15; 11:1; 12:9, 13; 13:4 (8:13; 9:3, (6); 11:5). Thus, we may identify at least three lines or motifs of interpretation of Israel's fornications. The first one is most extensive and therefore difficult to indicate via a single term. It ha s to do with the fault of failing to acknowledge God as the true source of everyday sustenance, and agricultural thriving and flourishing of nature. The second relates Israel's unfaithfulness to cultic pra c- tices, and the third to Israel's defeat in wars an d its seeking alliances with the foreign superpowers Assyria and Egypt. The link with Gen 1 -3 adds to the idea that the setting in which the conflict between the believers and God is placed is meaningful, i.e., the setting of a relationship between man and woman marked by infidelity. 20 The second and third motif may go together, as in Hos. 14:3, where Israel is urged to say to God: ' Assyria cannot save us; we will not mount warhors es. We will never again say \"Our gods\" to what our own hands have made, for in you the fatherless find compassion.' 21 Keefe ( Woman's Body , 16-17, 211) notes that many of the atrocities of war that will befall Israel are depicted in terms of maternal bereavement, loss of female fertility, and death of mothers and chi l- dren (4:5; 9:11 -12, 14; 10:14; 14:1). She concludes: 'Clearly there is some resonance between these images of bereaved maternity, sterility and illegitimate children on one hand, and the m etaphoric complex of the wayward mother and her rejected children of Hos. 1 -2 on the other' (17). 58 PETRUSCHKA SCHAAFSMA 2.2 THE PARENT -CHILD RELATIONSHIP The husband -wife relationship, however, is not the only setting for d e- scribing Israel's disloyalty. The well -known passage of Hos. 11 depicts the r e- lationship between God and Israel as a parent -child relationship.22 When reading it after our analysis starting from chapter 2, however, this setting seems to show many similarities to the husband -wife (and children) setting. Yet the tone of the opening passage, which is resumed at the end of th e cha p- ter, differs: it reflects a warm, personal relationship of love.23 God says: 'When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.' (11:1).24 Many exegetes point to the central role of 'love' ( 'hb / bh)) in this chapter. It is pr e- sented first of all as lying at the foundation of the relationship between God and the people, and thus also of their identity as a people 'called out of Egypt.' In the following verses, the 'upbringing' of Israel is depicted in phrases of affectionate, bodil y love of a parent for its child:25 God teaches I s- rael to walk 'taking him by the arms' (11:3) and leads him with 'cords of h u- man kindness,' with 'ties of love' (11:4a). 'To them I was like one who lifts a little child to the cheek ' (11:4b). The love also meant that God 'bent down to 22 This does not mean that the 'parental model' is the only one present in this chapter, as Eidevall argues, against the 'consensus view' (G\u00f6ran Eidevall, Grap es in the Desert : Metaphors, Models, and Themes in Hosea 4 -14 (Stockholm 1996). On the other hand, Eidevall's conclusion (183) that the co m- plementarity of the different models present in Hos. 11 underscores the view that the central theological significanc e of this passage consists in relativising all models for th e divine and the deity -people rel a- tionship lacks foundations in this text, in which the parental relationship is obviously most important. 23 This love for Israel is also mentioned in Hos. 3:1, but then in the context of the husband -wife relationship: 'The LORD said to me, \"Go, show your love to your wife again, though she is loved by a n- other man and is an adulteress. Love her as the LORD loves the Israelites, though they turn to other gods an d love the sacred raisin cakes.\" ' 24 Hos. 2:1 announces that the Israe lites ( bene-jisrael) will be called children of the living God/El (bene el -chi), which is contrasted to 'not my people,' Lo-Ammi , the name of Gomer's third child. The fact that the children are already mentioned together with the mother in chapter 1 as embodying Israel indicates that the marriage relation is more often than only in Hosea 11 linked to the parental relation, which is why it seems better to speak not just of a 'marriage' image but of a family image. Cf. Keefe, Woman's Body , e.g., 12, 15. 25 Several exegetes point out the human character of the depiction of the parental love: it is not some kind of divine family that is presented here (cf. Brigitte Seifert, Metaphorisches the Prophecy of Hosea , 108 -109.) It is di s- puted among exegetes if the self -evident interpretation of the parent in Hos. 11 as a father is correct, as the expression may seem quite maternal ( cf. Keefe, the Desert , 167). This discussion seems to be inspired more by cu r- rent conceptions of father and mother roles than by the Hosea text, and the conclusion seems corr ect that this was not Hosea's problem (Seifert, Metaphorisches Reden , 201). At most, one may note that Hosea's depiction of the parental love is not gendered, while this could easily have been done (Seifert, Metaphorisches Reden , 200). THE EMBODIED CHARACT THE RELATIONSHIP A ND EMBODIMENT 59 feed them' (11:4b), which recalls the depiction of God as the provider of daily needs in the second chapter. This reminiscence is also found in the account of Israel's rejective response to God's love. This response shows a threefold distinction similar to the three motifs indicated above: (1) not acknowledging (jd' / (dy) who 'healed them' (11:3); (2) cultic betrayal (sacrificing to the Baals and burning incense to images, 11:2); (3) political adultery ( 'Will they not r e- turn to Egypt and will not Assyria rule over them because they refuse to r e- pent?' 11:5).26 In what follows God first announces his wrath, but then resists expressing it because of compassion, repentance, or self -control (11:8b),27 'For I am God, and not a man - the Holy One among you' (11:9). Then Israel's r e- turn from Egypt and Assyria - 'trembling like sparrows' - is foretold; God 'will settle them in their homes' (11:11). Thus, the emphasis in this passage is on God's love for Israel in spi te of Israel's going away. It is expressed in a very personal, loving relationship that is unbreakable ('How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over Israel?' 11:8a). Again, Israel's fault is that it does not acknowledge their God - who has call ed them out of Egypt, gave them loving support, healed and fed them - but turns to other gods (Baals) and other powers (Assyria and Egypt). 2.3 ACKNOWLEDGING GOD In the whole of Hosea the element of not 'acknowledging' God returns as a kind of summary of Israel's fornication.28 The Hebrew root Metaphor 212) also arrives at this threefold characterisation of Israel's r e- action in Hos. 11, which she, moreover, relates to other chapters of Hosea. She summarises the central problem of Israel's behaviour as presented here as 'Liebe die ins Leere geht,' which recalls the tenor of Hos. 2:4ff and 3:1, although anger prevails in these verses, while grief is dominant in Hos. 11 (Seifert, Metaphorisches Reden , 215). 27 According 145) the verb Kph 'overthrow' should not be interpreted as 'Reue,' and in particular not as 'Mitleid' because this conceals that what is at stake here a 'Willenswandel die R\u00fccknahme einer zuvor gehegten Absicht,' verse is about 'Selbstbeherrschung,' whi ch is grounded only in God, not in Israel's behaviour. Note the contrast between the human depiction of the love (cf. note 26 above) and this emphasis on 'being God, not a man.' 28 Several exegetes note the central role of this term in Hosea. Jeremias regar ds it Hosea , 44). object of this knowledge is, according to Jeremias, 'wesenhaft die Geschichte Gottes mit Israel und der Wille Got tes.' According to W. Schottroff, it is a 'Schl\u00fcsselbegriff der e- - Schottroff suggests, primarily on the basis of Hos. 4:6 (and parallel texts in Jer. 2,8; 28,9 and ot h- ers), that knowing, understanding, acknowledging, realizing, noticing, and here mostly has as its object God (2:6.18; 4:1; 5:4; 6:3.6; 8:2; 11:3; 13:4). The first line of interpretation indicated above, in which the word also appears for the first time in Hosea, is illuminating as to the meaning of this 'acknowledging' of God. It specifies it as acknowledging God as the giver of grain, new wine and oil, silver and gold (2:6), as the one who comes like the w inter and spring rains (6:3), and who heals his child Israel (11:3). The other uses of the word are less specific. Knowing God is placed in parallel with faithfulness and love (4:1) and contrasted with 'burnt offerings' (6:6). Not knowing God is placed alongside 'prostitution in the heart' (5:4) and 'rejecting what is good' (8:3). It is related two times to reminding Israel of its being led out of Egypt (11:3; 13:4). Finally, knowledge is also mentioned without an object, as something that is lacking to Isr ael (4:6), and as something to which they are summoned (14:9, the final verse). Thus, the recurrence of the root jd' / (dy as a summary of the right relationship with God, confirms the importance of the first line or motif of interpretation. 2.4 CONCLUSIONS What has our examination of the embodied relationship of Hosea and Gomer yielded regarding the bodily character of the relationship between God and Israel? One may distinguish between 1) the relationship in its ideal form, i.e. as it should be, and as it is announced it will be when God restores the marriage, 2) Israel's view of the relation to the divine, which is attacked by Hosea, and 3) God's punishment as consequence of Israel's unfaithfulness in their relationship. The bodily character of the ideal relationship, which revolves around acknowledging God as the provider of daily sustenance, may be specified in three ways. They overlap or merge into one another in becoming more and more specific: a. The relationship between God and Israel is fi rst of all one in which God should be acknowledged as the one who provides Israel's n e- cessities: food, drink, and clothing. This includes God's taking care of the thriving of the land and the harvest: 'Y our fruitfulness comes from me' (14:9) . These aspects can be regarded as 'embo d- ied' in the sense that basic bodily needs are taken utterly seriously. wegem\u00e4sses Verhalten \u00fcberhaupt erst erm\u00f6glicht. ' On the possible sexual connotation of 'knowing' as associated with God in Hos. 2:20 cf. Keefe, Woman's Body , 47, n. 11. THE EMBODIED CHARACT ER OF 'ACKNOWLEDGING GOD ': THE RELATIONSHIP BET WEEN TRANSCENDENCE A ND EMBODIMENT 61 These are the first and foremost things in which the relationship with God is found. God's maintenance is directed at this basic level first of all. This langu age is prominent also in the imagery used to depict Israel's situation and even God. b. God's maintenance should also be acknowledged in a more sp e- cifically human sense. God heals Israel, raises them from chil d- hood onwards. These elements also clearly have a bodily chara c- ter, as was clear from the warm expressions of human, bodily love in Hos. 11. c. In line with this remembrance of their being taken care of in their 'childhood,' Israel should acknowledge God as the one who called and led them out of Egypt, took care of them, and fed them in the 'land of burning heat ' (13:5). This aspect has to do with Israel's r e- lationship with God as a people. The foundation of this relatio n- ship is depicted in bodily terms, in the sense that God put an end to their physica l presence in Egypt and warns against their retur n- ing to it, and provided for their physical needs during their ex o- dus. Such is the relationship with God in which Israel finds itself. But they do not acknowledge it. They turn to other gods for their daily suste- nance which is imagined as a bodily act of fornication. This fornic a- tion implies bringing sacrifices to the gods, building altars and adorning sacred stones, holding festivals, and making idols. The cult expands when the land prospers (10:1). Moreover , Israel turns to the superpower from which God had liberated them: Egypt. Israel asks Egypt and Assyria for help. In sum, they have 'depended on their own strength' (10:13b).29 Israel does not want the 'embodied relationship' with God to which God has call ed them. They prefer a different kind of religion and politics and view of the source of their daily sust e- nance. The punishment that is announced is also put in bodily terms: it is portrayed as a reversal of the relationship as it should be: no more fruit fulness, no personal love, no longer being God's people etc. The 29 The NIV translates the noun Derek / Krd by 'strength.' The basic meaning of the word is 'way' or 'road'; Koehler -Baumgarner's Lexic on translates the word in this verse as 'way' in the sense of 'cond i- tion' and parallels it to 'determining one's own destiny.' In combination with the verb bth / h+b, 'trust,' the translation 'way' seems possible as well, which the NIV apparently rephrases as 'depending on one's own strength.' 62 PETRUSCHKA SCHAAFSMA bodily character is obvious in a penetrating sense, especially in the foretelling of the atrocities of the war that Israel has called down on itself. Thus, the ideal relationship with God, I srael's different idea of the rel a- tionship to the divine, and the announcement of God's punishment may all be called bodily. Reading the book of Hosea with an eye to embodiment ce r- tainly yields something. The positive relationship between the living body and the divine, for which Bornemark is searching, is found in particular in the elaboration of the acknowledgement of God as the giver of daily, bodily sustenance. But the depiction in itself of the personal, loving relationship with God as a husband -wife o r parent -child relationship also contradicts any easy narrowing down of religion to a purely spiritual understanding. 3. A LITERAL KIND OF EMBODIED RELIGION IN HOSEA Our search for embodied religion in Hosea started quite broadly or open with an investigation into the bodily way the relationship between God and the people of Israel is presented: as that between husband and wife . But at the outset of this broad analysis, I already indicated that the immoral or no n- sensical character of the divine co mmand to take a woman and children of fornications may attract much more attention than this bodily character of the relationship as such, especially when searching for embodied religion. In line with this peculiarity of embodiment in Hosea, many interpret ers have focused on a quite literal sense of embodiment in Hosea: the reality of pra c- tices of fornication in a sacred setting, i.e. some kind of temple prostitution as part of a fertility cult. This illustrates the fact that a 'search for embod i- ment' may s till be a rather unspecific search, which may yield quite divergent results. A brief outline of these interpretations may illustrate the rather u n- specific character of the category of 'embodiment.' I will do this from the pe r- spective of a recent study of H osea by the Old Testament scholar Alice Keefe.30 She is sympathetic to Bornemark's project of revaluing the body in our reflection on religion with special attention to the female perspective. But she also points out that the revaluation of the bodily as su ch may not yet lead to getting beyond the dualistic opposition of spirit and matter or soul and body in relation to religion, i.e. to a more embodied understanding of (the capacity for) transcendence. 30 Cf. note 5 above. THE EMBODIED CHARACT ER OF 'ACKNOWLEDGING GOD ': THE RELATIONSHIP BET WEEN TRANSCENDENCE A ND EMBODIMENT 63 Keefe starts her analysis of Hosea by pointing out the 'long -standing scholarly consensus' (5) that regards Hosea as prophesying against Israel's participation in a Canaanite or syncretistic 'fertility religion.' As we have seen, there are references in Hosea to apostate cultic practices: mention is made of 13:1), calf stones (8:11,13; 10:2; 12:12). This idea of a Baal cult is further specified by combining it with the references in Hosea to prostitution and adultery.31 The 'fertility religion' is outlined as worshipping the rain god Baal, perhaps together with goddesses of sex and fecundity. Natural procreation and regeneration are sanctified in these gods.32 It is sugg ested that participation in this fertility religion includes practising sexual rituals of temple prostitution or even participating in wild orgies. If this fertility cult is actually what Hosea's prophesies against, then the reason why Hosea needs to live the relation of the people to God via the scandal of marrying a woman of fornications is clear: the adultery 'represents the apostasy of Israel both figuratively and literally. The marriage metaphor is more moving than a mere allegory, because \"Gomer's mis conduct is not just like the sin of Israel that infuriates God and breaks his heart; it is that sin.\"'33 Hosea embodies religion to attack 'embodied religion.' The tenor of this traditional interpretation is explained by Keefe as the product of a dualistic way of opposing spirit and body. The dominance of this dualistic view has been denounced by feminist exegetes in particular, who revealed its relationship with patriarchy, and the evaluation of the feminine - and the female body and sexuality in particular - as the other and as sinful. Hosea is indicted as one of the earliest sources that advanced this view. Some of these exegetes argue that Hosea's polemics against the fertility religion implies that such a religion actually existed and that Gomer was a wo man who practised it or represents those women.34 This cult granted them the opportunity to explore their own feminine sexuality and fertility, by concei v- ing a partner of their choice. Investigating this cult may therefore contribute 31 Especially Hos. 4:13b -14: 'Therefore your daughters turn to prostitution and your daughters -in- law to adultery. I will not punish your daughters when they turn to prostitution, nor your daughters -in- law when they commit adultery, because the men themselves consort with harlots and sacrifice with shrine prostitutes - a people without understanding will come to ruin! ' 32 Cf. Keefe, Woman's Body , 43 n.8 for a list of mainstream commentaries with such a version of Canaanite religion, includ ing 'great names' like Von Rad and Ringgren. 33 Keefe, Woman's Body , 47, quoting Francis I. Andersen & David Noel Freedman. 34 Keefe, Woman's Body (62-64, 148 PETRUSCHKA SCHAAFSMA to reconstructing and r eappropriating a kind of embodied religion that has remained out of sight in the dominant views of religion as purely spiritual. After analysing this criticism of traditional Hosea interpretation and the plea for a revaluation of the body in religion, Keef e asks if they really go beyond the opposition of spirit and body. She concludes that the traditional and the feminist interpretations are each other's counterparts: whereas the one f o- cuses on the problematic character of the bodily in relation to religion , the other regards the body as a primary source of religious experience and rela t- ing to the divine. But they remain heirs to the same dualist separation of spirit and body. This exegetical debate may thus illustrate the drawbacks of the plea to pay more a ttention to the embodied character of religion: the spirit -body opposition remains intact, and the focus is on quite extreme kinds of embodiment (prostitution, orgies etc.). In order to undermine the dominance and authority of the dualistic i n- terpretation , Keefe tries a different interpretation, without claiming to arrive at the only 'correct' reading of Hosea.35 She aims to examine Hosea in its own context by taking into account historical and archaeological findings and by means of an intertextual reading of similar texts in the Bible. Such a reading reveals a relation between acts of sexual transgression on the one hand and social disintegration and violence in the land on the other. That Hosea faced a situation of social disintegration can be confirmed f rom what we know about Hosea's time: it was a time of bloodshed by the king, internal war, and the threat of Assyrian occupation. But more important for Keefe's interpret a- tion is the socio -economic and political transitions that took place in that time. Is rael changed, according to Keefe, from a locally organised, tribe - and kinship -based society of small farmers to a centralized market economy of cash cropping and international trading under monarchical control.36 In this 35 Keefe, Woman's Body , 13, 221. Other interpretations that show resemblances to Keefe's a p- proach are the studies by Keita and Sherwood mentioned above. Keefe also refers to Sherwood as to the question of claiming the 'correct' reading. Sherwood characterises her approach as a 'metacomme n- tary': this does not follow the traditional strategy of criticising and displacing the criticism of one's predecessors before introducing a new improved account (38). Her aim is not to reveal th e 'truth' or 'error' of specific interpretations, but the dominance of certain interpretations and their claiming of 'objectivity.' She does not claim to introduce a reading that is free from ideology but wants to bring 'different ideological interests int o play and relativise the dominant (apparently natural) descriptions of Hos. 1,2 by introducing an alternative, more marginal perspective' (39). 36 These processes are called 'latifundialization.' Keefe bases this interpretation on many studies of Israel an d Judah in this period from a socio -scientific perspective (cf. Keefe, Woman's Body , e.g., 27 - 29, where she refers especially to Devadasan N. Premnath , Bernhard Lang , Marvin Chaney, THE EMBODIED CHARACT ER OF 'ACKNOWLEDGING GOD ': THE RELATIONSHIP BET WEEN TRANSCENDENCE A ND EMBODIMENT 65 new situation, the traditional impo rtance of the local family and the interd e- pendence of different families in a tribe for their survival diminished. A new class of wealthy rulers came into existence who exploited farmers for the sake of larger interests. Moreover, the class of rulers also tried to control the rel i- gious cult and thus reinforce the centralized, monarchical power. It is to this situation that female fornication refers in Hosea: an Israel that is out for profit and is prepared to be unfaithful for the sake of that aim. Thus, Is rael eventually puts its own continuity as a people on the line. In the Israelite patrilineally organised society, family is the essential social unit and sacral locus, based upon paternal legitimacy. In this setting the 'imagery of a forn i- cating wife and her illegitimate children signifies the disintegration and end of that society.' (206) Keefe summarises her interpretation by concluding that 'at stake in Hosea's discourse is the loss of the sacred as it was manifest in the relationship of people to the l and, its produce, and to each other, that is, in their relationships to the materiality of their existence' (221). Keefe thus finds the embodied character of religion not so much in the extreme forms of a fertility religion with matching sexual practices b ut in the general idea of 'religion as a mode of orientation to the material and corp o- real bases of human existence' (12). The interpretation of this orientation in Hosea contributes, according to Keefe, to a better understanding of religion.37 This seems a sensible correction of an important tendency in interpreting the place of the body in religion. But the correction also shows that the project of revaluating the material or bodily as such is not a guarantee for arriving at a broader und thus better understanding of religion. For it cannot be denied that the feminist interpretation of religion takes the body seriously. And, in a precisely opposite sense, the traditional interpretation of Hosea did not deny the possible bodily character of reli gion, although it vehemently rejected it. How can the rather unspecific character of the search for a more embodied view of religion be overcome while still taking the problem of the spirit -body dualism seriously? In my view, my analysis of Hosea may itsel f indicate a di f- ferent approach. 37 Keefe does not elaborate systematically on thi s contribution and thus does not go beyond her exegetical confines. A few general suggestions are found however, that indicates that this role of her study interests her. (Keefe, Woman's Body , 12-14, 73 -78, 111, 220 -221). 66 PETRUSCHKA SCHAAFSMA 4. DEPENDENCE AND D ISCERNMENT One of the central points to which my analysis of the relationship b e- tween God and Israel led was the acknowledgement to be in a relationship with God who cares as the giver of daily suste nance. This was contrasted with securing one's needs by turning to other gods in sacrificial rituals as well as in trusting one's own strength in battle and turning to international superpo w- ers for help. I would like to dub the point of this difference in attitude b e- tween acknowledging and not acknowledging 'dependence.' Dependence on God to whose care one may commend oneself is clearly understood in Hosea as a bodily thing. This is contrasted with experiencing the body as a source of disquiet and concern t hat is to be safeguarded by human effort. This contrast could be easily interpreted in line with a classical criticism of religion, i.e., that it makes people passive and hinders them from having control over themselves. But the difficulty Hosea addresses seems to be that this 'control' needs orientation. The body as such cannot provide this orientation, as u n- deniable and strong as its need for food, drink, clothing and shelter may be. Israel should find its orientation in being taken care of as a people ca lled out of Egypt by God. Acknowledging this God is paralleled with faithfulness and love and contrasted with 'cursing, lying and murder, stealing and adultery,' and bloodshed (4:2). It is a dependence that is not to be conceived as a 'spir i- tual kind of th ing' but as one in which the bodily is fully incorporated. It is the reciprocal dependence of a partner -relationship or a parent -child one. This love is one that asks for an answer, an active participation. If it is not or no longer answered, the grief is deep, but the relationship not simply a n- nulled. One remains related, albeit in a very different way. The thrust, however, of 'this dependence in love' in Hosea is not simply whether Israel participates in it or not but also whether the relationship with God as such is acknowledged as a 'loving' one or not. Hosea confronts Israel not only with their own unfaithful behaviour but also with their hopes and fears concerning how God will respond to this behaviour. Does their being dependent on God mean that God w ill destroy them, or that God cannot give them up and will renew the loving relationship with them? At times, the H o- sea text seems to oscillate between these views of God. But in the end, the announcement of the restoration of the relationship is strongest , as is d e- picted expressively in God's 'change of heart' in Hos. 11:8. Precisely against the penetrating depictions of the possible punishments, the loving character of the relationship stands out. Nevertheless, the unrest concerning how God will respond, and thus about who God is, is intensely present in Hosea. By THE EMBODIED CHARACT ER OF 'ACKNOWLEDGING GOD ': RELATIONSHIP A ND EMBODIMENT 67 emphasising the centrality of this struggle to understand or 'acknowledge' God, I do not mean to waive the bodily character again. Rather the moment of understanding, or acknowledging God as the loving, the moment of faith, contains a primordial bodily moment. This may be illuminated by referring to Richard Kearney's notion of 'di s- cernment.' Discernment is one of the components of Kearney's 'anatheist wager.' With this phrase, he indicates the in vitation to revisit in the current situation - i.e. 'in the wake of our letting go of God' (5) - what might be termed a 'primary scene of religion,' in order to get beyond the opposites of theism and atheism. This is the primary scene of 'the encounter wit h a radical Stranger who we choose, or don't choose, to call God,' a choice between faith or nonfaith (7).38 This moment of choice is further explained in terms of di s- cernment. Discernment is present in an exemplary way in the lives of the prophets, saints, and mystics, but it is also common in the sense that a di s- cernment is always to be made where faith is concerned. Kearney emphasises the carnal character of this discernment. The 'choice' is made in a moment and, as such, is pre -reflective, before it beco mes 'a matter of reflective cogn i- tive evaluation' (46). But in spite of its pre -reflectiveness it is choice or inte r- pretation; it is actively responding 'in the moment' to the visiting Stranger, to say 'yes' or 'no.'39 Discernment is difficult, but never co mpletely impossible. It is possible to discern between 'the other who kills, and the other who brings life' (45).40 Moreover, it is a risky affair:41 many invoke the voice of God to 38 Richard Kearney, Anatheism: Ret urning to God After God (New York 2010). Kearney does not mean that the 'event of the Stranger' is the only 'primary scene of religion' (7). Others are creation, salvation, miracle, sovereignty, and judgement. But it is at the core of the anatheist wager, which Kea r- ney regards as the viable option in a current analysis of religion. He indicates five main components of the anatheist wager: imagination, humour, commitment, discernment and hospitality. They should not be regarded as 'sequential moments' but ra ther as 'equiprimordial aspects of a single hermeneutic arc' (40). 39 By emphasising the choosing, interpretative character of the primary moment of meeting the divine Stranger, Kearney opposes the view of Jean -Luc Marion who understands the moment of 'sat ura- tion' as a being overwhelmed completely. Discernment comes only afterwards, according to Marion. Cf. Kearney, Anatheism , note 6, 197 -199. 40 Kearney opposes this view to that of Derrida who says, in Kearney's words, 'we have no way of knowing the differ ence between one kind of other and another' (Kearney, Anatheism , 45 and note 5, 196-197). 41 The risky character of faith that lies in its being first of all an act of 'pre - or hyper -linguistic r e- sponse' is also central to the thinking of Ricoeur by whom Ke arney is profoundly influenced (e.g., Paul Ricoeur, 'Philosophy and Religious Language,' in: Figuring the Sacred: Religion, and Imagin a- tion, transl. by David A. Pellauer, ed. by Mark Wallace (Minneapolis: Fortress Press 1995), emphasises this chance of being mistaken, but argues that the risk is not 'groundless': 'Love - as compassion and justice - is the watermark.' (47) These are the difficulties and the risk of the 'drama of discernment.' This drama is experienced by the prophet Hosea who must decide on the voice he hears. And it is the situation of the reader of the book Hosea, who becomes confronted with the God to whom Israel has to respond, the God on whom they depend and who is first experienced as the one who may punish them or restore their relationship. The book of Hosea also shows that the difficulty and risk of this discernment is never something that can be left behind after having said 'yes' or having converted to the faith. Rather, the 'yes' is 'in the moment.' This difficulty or tension is part of religion, but it is not 'groundless.' It comes down to not only the question whether I relate to God or not but also that of whether I want to be dependent on a loving God. The momentary character of the answer to this question relates to its embo d- iedness: it is a resp onse, by the body, 'the ear and eye' (46), by 'emotion and affect, before any theoretical reflection' (40). As such it is already interpret a- tion. It may be rethought and reinterpreted in a more cognitive sense en d- lessly, as we do in reinterpreting the disc ernment present in Hosea. Is this discernment an entirely personal thing, something between God and the individual believer? Kearney points out that 'great saints and mystics ... scrupulously insisted upon disciplined criteria of discernment, chief among them being the distinction between the divine visitor who brings compassion and counterfeits who bring confusion' (47). This idea of 'disciplined criteria' presupposes some kind of discerning community who reflects on them, su p- ports them and passes them on. Moreover, responding to the divine Other is very much a question of being and acting in the world, of ethics. It is about 'giving a cup of cold water to a thirsting stranger' (153). Therefore, Kearney concludes his book with a reference to the lives of thr ee exemplary figures who respond to the stranger in a life of 'sacramental action': Dorothy Day, Jean Vanier, and Gandhi. The disciplined approach of discernment and the ethical practices of discernment in everyday life underscore the bodily cha r- acter of t he discernment. Thus, the concept of the discernment character of faith as going back to a level of primordial, pre -reflective, carnal response allows for thinking spirit and body together. It is more specific than the co n- cept of 'embodied religion' and as such gives a more specific contribution to the understanding of religion. Moreover, it sheds light on the issue indicated in the introduction of a religious 'difficulty with the body.' THE EMBODIED CHARACT ER OF 'ACKNOWLEDGING ': THE RELATIONSHIP BET WEEN TRANSCENDENCE A ND EMBODIMENT 69 5. DIFFICULTY WITH THE BODY OR WITH D ISCERNMENT ? The search for a mor e embodied view of religion is presented as a way to gain a better understanding of religion. But there is also a critical side to it insofar as it implies that from time immemorial there has been a reluctance to recognize the bodily character of religion. This should be overcome by turning to the body explicitly and consciously. If we confine ourselves to the current, post -secular Western context, is it the body that stands between ourselves and religion, that hinders our understanding of religion? Or is i t rather a specifically religious idea of embodiment, with its moment of fu n- damental dependence and responsive discernment? In my view, our current difficulty with the bodily in relation to religion is not Eckhardt's or Tauler's, i.e., the untrustworthines s of the senses, which cannot discriminate between a vision of the devil or God. What they indicated sounds very much like the difficulty of discernment. They emphasised that this difficulty cannot be solved by turning to the body or the senses. In compari son, the current issue is first of all that of arriving at, becoming sensitive to this moment of di s- cernment. A focus on the difficulty of making sense of the embodied chara c- ter of religion may fail to recognise that our search for a better understanding of religion presupposes a being at a loss at a more primary level of, for exa m- ple, the primary religious scene of discernment. In my view, the idea that we are in a fundamental sense dependent on God is one of the most difficult to relate to in our times of autonomous choice and control - not just over 'wine, grain, and oil' but also over being a family or not, our health, or international politics. But it is important to reappropriate what this dependence may mean and not reject it beforehand because of an assumed one -sided emphasis on passivity, resignation, or humility. Kearney's notion of discernment unravels the active moment in this dependence: the moment of saying 'yes' or 'no.' In my view, this is also what is at stake in Hosea's struggle for the ackn owled g- ment of God as the giver of daily sustenance. Understanding oneself in the face of a text, like that of Mechtild von Magdeburg or that Hosea, thus does not mean that important material d i- mensions of religious life are ignored, as V\u00e1squez and other h ard core mat e- rialist theorists of religion argue. It does point out the interpretative moment inherent in the response of faith, which may not come to light if one focuses on the apparent obviousness of the body, as if it were a phenomenon without interpre tation. Interpretation is a very bodily thing. Because texts intend a 70 PETRUSCHKA SCHAAFSMA world, as Paul Ricoeur puts it, they 'call forth on our part a way of dwelling there.... Understanding oneself in front of the text is not something that just happens in one's head or in l anguage.... [T]o understand the world and to change it are fundamentally the same thing.' 42 This idea of interpretation as a both active and bodily responding, dependent upon an 'initiative that always precedes me,' supports, I hope, Bornemark's search for ' a more nuanced u n- derstanding of the relation between transcendence and embodiment.' 42 'Naming II: RITUALS AND SACRAMENT S AS EMBODIMENTS OF GOD BEYOND A PURELY SYMB OLIC RELIGION 72 73 4 Sacramental S ensibility and the ' Embodiment of God' MARK WYNN University of Leeds ABSTRACT In this paper I follow the conference theme, by considering how 'r i- tuals and sacraments' may function as 'material expressions of a spir i- tual reality' and even as 'embodiments of God'. I begin by noting some of the ways in which human beings can be attuned in bodily terms to place -relative 'existential meanings'. I then extend this case, and relate it to the religious domain, by examining t he nature of s a- cred sites and the role of religious concepts in aesthetic experience. I also consider what sense we might make of the idea that transce n- dent 'meanings' may be not only imaged in the sensory appearances, but encountered in them. Overall, the paper seeks to identify some of the ways in which bodily demeanour and habits of perception, and in general sensitivity to materially embedded existential meanings, are integral to the religious life. KEYWORDS rituals, sacraments, places, meaning 74 MARK WYNN INTRODUCTION In this session of the conference, we have been invited to examine the idea that 'rituals and sacraments' may function as 'material expressions of a spiritual reality' and even as 'embodiments of God'. We have also been given an opportunity to consider what a treatment of these issues might imply for our understanding of 'magic', and in concluding I shall touch on that que s- tion too. I would like to approach these themes by turning, first of all, to the question of how 'existential meanings' may be presented to a person in their bodily interaction with a material context. Assuming that we do encounter such meanings in this sort of way, then we might suppose that ultimate, or religiously important, existential meanings may be presented to us simil arly, that is, via an appropriate bodily engagement with a relevant material co n- text. And if all of this is so, then, so I shall argue, we have one way of elab o- rating upon the thought that 'spiritual realities' may be 'embodied', and e n- countered through 'r itual' and in general via an appropriate bodily engag e- ment with material forms. My remarks will throughout have a rather programmatic character, since my object here is to offer an invitation to conversational exchange, r a- ther than to construct a perspecti ve which is hedged about by qualifications for the sake of pre -empting objections! THE UNDERSTANDING OF PLACE -RELATIVE EXISTENTIAL MEANINGS In recent years, philosophers of religion in the analytic tradition in pa r- ticular have been much occupied by the t hought that our understanding of God might be likened to the kind of understanding which derives from scie n- tific enquiry, or the kind of understanding which is rooted in our everyday experience of the sensory world. Such strategies are well known and there is no need to document them here. While undoubtedly of interest, these a p- proaches do pose a number of difficulties, it seems to me, in regard to their conception of the mode and also the object of religious understanding. For example, they may lead us to think of religious understanding as basically theoretical and inferential (if we pattern religious understanding on scientific understanding) or as straightforwardly observational. So neither approach looks like a very promising starting point if our conce rn is (as ours is here) with the question of how religious understanding may be realised in bodily SACRAMENTAL SENSIBILI TY AND THE 'EMBODIMENT OF GOD' 75 and ritual terms. Of course, the body is integral to sensory experience, and in its way it is also integral to scientific forms of enquiry, but sense experie nce and scientific enquiry do not look much like ritual forms of engagement with the world, above all because they do not require the same sort of attunement of the whole body - an attunement in which all of the senses are implicated - to a value -saturated context. Moreover, if we take scientific understanding, or sensory observation, as a starting point for our reflections upon the nature of religious understanding, then there will presumably be some pressure to think of God's reality by analogy with the r eality of particular objects - as- suming that we take scientific theorising to have as its goal the identification of fundamental entities which are not themselves observable but postulated to explain the data of observation, and to the extent that everyday observ a- tion of the world concerns, as philosophers are wont to say, 'tables and chairs'. But it is of course a commonplace of theological enquiry that the co n- ception of God as some kind of 'thing', whatever its attractions may be in a b- stractly philosophic al terms, is religiously problematic. So on this count too, we have some reason to consider whether other ways of apprehending the world may present a more promising route into the question of how religious understanding is to be conceived. I would like to suggest that we can make some headway with these questions by turning to our appreciation of place -relative existential mea n- ings. (Certainly, place -relative meanings are not 'things', and their identific a- tion is standardly a matter neither of theorisation nor of 'just looking'.) This kind of understanding is so basic to our capacity to orient ourselves in the world that it is easily overlooked from a theoretical point of view. It is pe r- haps for this reason that in the history of philosophy (and by contrast with the kind of understanding that is grounded in simple sense observation, or in scientific theory construction), understanding of 'place' often seems to drop out of view, despite its fundamental role in our practical dealings with other people and the material world in general. To take just one example, in his discussion of the nature of virtue, Aristotle famously remarks that the person of good character is able to regulate their feelings appropriately; and he adds that this is a matter of 'having thes e feelings at the right times, about the right things, toward the right people, for the right end, and in the right way'.1 But if we take a particular example of the regulation of feeling, say the feeling of gratitude, it is evident that it matters not onl y that this feeling should be 1 Nicomachean Ethics , Book II; I am following Terence Irwin's translation, reproduced in Russ Shafer -Landau (ed.), Ethical Theory: An Anthology (Oxford 2007), 678. 76 MARK WYNN had at the right time, in relation to the right thing, and so on for the r e- mainder of the items on Aristotle's list, but also that it should be had, and expressed, in the right place. A person could in some abstract sense have the feeling at the right time, and so on, but there would be little merit in that if the feeling were had or expressed at the wrong place. We might prefer to say then that time -relative rightness, and rightness measured against these other dimensions of a ppraisal, cannot really be disentangled from rightness with respect to place: rightness in temporal terms is in effect rightness in temporal terms relative to rightness in respect of place. It may also be that we are apt to overlook the significance of rig htness in respect of place when we are operating in a theoretical mode because very often achieving this sort of rightness is a rather untheoretical and even unre f- lective sort of matter. Whether I am in a lecture theatre, or standing at a bus stop, or ente ring a church, or whatever it might be, I am all the while cal i- brating my bodily movements to the space in which I am located. And this is not just a matter of making those bodily adjustments which are necessary to negotiate the space from a physical point of view, as when I raise my foot in the way required to surmount the dais at the front of the lecture theatre. It is also and more fundamentally a matter of my calibrating my bodily mov e- ments so that they are fitted for this particular space in existentia l terms. And this sort of calibration is necessary because the action which is constituted by a given stretch of bodily movement will vary with place. To put the point briefly, waving my hands will count as one sort of action, with one kind of existential significance, when I am looking towards a friend who is departing on a train, and another when I am standing on the Kop and Liverpool have scored a goal, and another when I am drifting out to sea, and so on. But typ i- cally this regulation of bodily movement in relation to context is not r e- hearsed reflectively: if I wish to say farewell to my friend as she leaves on the train, I do not work backwards from the thought that my action should be one of bidding farewell, to a consideration of the gestures which re lative to this particular material context might carry that sort of significance, to the performance of the relevant gesture. Instead, in normal circumstances, I just wave. So all of us are all of the time calibrating our bodily movements to sp a- tial contex t, in recognition of the 'existential meanings' which are embedded in these contexts, and the sense which attaches to various stretches of bodily behaviour given those meanings. There is no achievement more basic to our capacity to function as agents in so ciety than this. And again, when we e n-SACRAMENTAL SENSIBILI TY AND THE 'EMBODIMENT OF GOD' 77 gage in this sort of calibration of bodily response to context, we are guided often enough by a kind of intelligence in the body - rather than the body b e- ing directed by a set of instructions which are the product of s ome process of ratiocination. When I walk into a room of people, I adjust my bodily mov e- ments to the space taking into account its dimensions, the apparent mood of the group, the disposition of people and objects in the space, and so on, without any of the se considerations becoming, in the normal case, the object of focal awareness. The capacity to orient oneself in these terms is more akin, then, to the capacity to ride a bike than it is to the capacity to rehearse a m a- thematical or scientific proof, or to determine whether the object at the other side of the room is a bookcase or a cupboard simply by looking. But by co n- trast with the bike -riding case, this is not just an achievement of physical dexterity: what is required is a capacity to bring one's body into appropriate alignment with the existential demands of the context, and not only with its demands considered from an abstractly physical point of view. So in this thoroughly familiar (even if, from a theoretical point of view, sometimes rather opaque) sort of way, we are all of us used to recognising existential meanings as they are embodied in particular material contexts; and we are all of us used to adjusting our bodily movements to these mea n- ings, and to being guided by the body's own 'intelligence' in these matters. If all of this is so, then we have, I think, the beginnings of an account of how a sacramental appreciation of the material world might work. Let's see if we can move a little closer towards such an account by considering next the case of 'sacred sites'. THE EMBODIMENT OF EX ISTENTIAL MEANINGS A T THE 'SACRED SITE ' The phenomenological literature on 'sacred space' suggests that such places are marked by a number of features which recur across cultures. For instance, the sacred site is oft en deemed to have a 'microcosmic' significance. (That is, the existential meaning which is embedded in the site is thought to represent or embody in miniature the significance of reality as such.) And whether because of its remoteness or because of its int rinsic physical chara c- ter, the sacred site also poses, typically, a degree of challenge to the body. And lastly, such places are often associated with religiously important events. These events may have occurred at the site; or it may be that while the sit e is not itself the locus of some such event, it houses objects such as relics which 78 MARK WYNN once played an integral role in the unfolding of events of religious impo r- tance.2 These accounts ground the sacred significance of a site in rather di f- ferent features, and these features need not co -vary. For instance, in so far as it is the sensory qualities of a place which mark it out as religiously signif i- cant, then a further place which replicates those qualities will, to that extent, share the same religious significa nce. But in so far as the religious signifi c- ance of a place is relative to its history, then even a perfect replica of the place will fail to reproduce in full its religious import, in so far as the replica has in relevant respects a different past. These various dimensions of a site's religious import are also capable of interaction. Most obviously, a place's se n- sory qualities or history may be deemed religiously significant because the place is conceived in microcosmic terms, so that these qualities, or t his hist o- ry, are taken to bear not simply some localised importance, but an ultimate or divine significance. These truths concerning sacred sites have a counterpart in our dealings with everyday, secular spaces. Here we seem to be responsive to these same varieties of existential meaning in ways which require acknowledgement, once again, in the form of an appropriate bodily response. For example, a place may acquire a particular existential significance on account of its hist o- ry, and that significance may c all for acknowledgement in bodily terms. It is for this reason that we can be drawn intelligibly into debates about what sort of building, for what sort of purpose, it would be appropriate to erect at the site of the 9/11 attacks - and so on for many other , more everyday kinds of example. So a site can in some respects store up the significance of what has happened there, so that this significance exercises an enduring claim upon us, in so far as it invites, or requires, a certain kind of bodily response wh en we are located at the site in the present. And we might suppose that the same kind of connection is at work when the significance of a sacred site is grounded in its history. Similarly, we can also encounter microcosmic meanings in our exp e- rience of sec ular spaces. The places of childhood often bear this sort of sign i- ficance. I recently returned to some of the places of my own childhood in L i- verpool. And standing again where that child once stood, and assuming at that place, so far as I could, his perspe ctive on things, I found myself revie w- 2 For an account of broadly this kind, see for example Lindsay Jones, The Hermeneutics of Sacred Architecture: E xperience, Interpretation, Comparison , Volume Two, Hermeneutical Calisthenics (Cam- bridge MA 2000), and Thomas Barrie, Sacred Place: Myth, Ritual, and Meaning in Architecture (Boston MA 1996). SACRAMENTAL SENSIBILI TY AND THE 'EMBODIMENT OF GOD' 79 ing later episodes in my life story from the vantage point of his aspirations and sense of the world's significance. In this way, the place was able to a s- sume for me a microcosmic significance, by providing a window on to the sense of my life as a whole. Of course, it would be possible in principle to take up such a stance on my life anywhere, simply by rehearsing the relevant thoughts. But if we revert to the idea that behaviour can be more or less co n- sonant with the h istory of a place, then we might say that at the places of childhood, it's not just that we can think certain microcosmically significant thoughts (thoughts which we could in principle think anywhere), but also that we can acknowledge the microcosmic meani ng of the place in our enacted responses, by virtue of what we do in bodily terms when located at the site, and also by virtue of what we think when we are there. Minimally, we might suppose that it is fitting that I should think microcosmic thoughts about the meaning of my life when located at the places of my childhood (e s- pecially if I have been away from them for some considerable time), and the failure to act in this way would signify a kind of unresponsiveness or blin d- ness to meanings which make some g enuine claim on me. So there is some sense in the idea that we can not only think about but also encounter, or be claimed by, a microcosmic meaning when located at the relevant place. And when the relevant microcosmic meaning is particularly encompassing, when it concerns the significance of reality in general, then we may suppose that it is fundamentally religious in character. The case of sacred sites also reveals something of the variety of preco n- ditions which are relevant to the recognition of place -relative existential meanings. It is notable that the approach to a sacred site often poses a degree of challenge to the body: because of its inaccessibility, the site may require the believer to undertake a long and relatively arduous journey; or because of its use of threshold walls or other such structures, the believer may be r e- quired to submit to various bodily disciplines as a condition of penetrating to the inner precincts of the site. The recurrence of such features of spatial o r- ganisation across tradi tions suggests that an appropriate attunement of the body is integral to the believer's capacity to apprehend the existential import of the sacred site aright. To put the point briefly, we might say that the stru c- ture of many sacred sites suggests that the ir existential import cannot be grasped in straightforwardly observational terms, just by turning up and looking around, let alone by constructing some sort of inference from the data of observation. Rather, to grasp, or be grasped by, the import of the si te, the believer must first take on the relevant bodily and existential condition - 80 MARK WYNN broadly, one of heightened seriousness about the meaning of the site, and heightened attentiveness to that meaning as it is presented in the sensory qualities of the site. The physical challenges posed by the site ensure that such seriousness is presupposed and at the same time cultivated: given these challenges, only the person who is already serious about the prospective meaning of the site will persevere in their resolve to reach the site; and in negotiating the physical demands of the space, such a person will be required to take on a correlative bodily state, and to enter thereby into a condition of focused awareness and heightened seriousness. Given the need for this so rt of preparation of the body, we would expect the believer to be addressed in bodily terms upon arrival at the site. And this is what we do find, in so far as the significance of the site is communicated through its imposing scale, its use of intense ligh t or equally of visual obscu r- ity, and so on for other visual features of the site and for other sensory mo d- alities. The recurrence of such qualities across traditions suggests that to some extent the import of the sacred site is communicated directly in th eory- or tradition -independent terms, by virtue simply of its brute impact upon the senses. If we had to generalise, we might say that, in many cases anyway, the site works, at least in part, by imposing a degree of strain upon the senses, so leading the p erson to an intensified bodily awareness of the space, and in turn to a condition of rapt absorption in the place and its import.3 So the recognition of the existential meaning of the sacred site is re a- lised, in some measure, in the body's responsiveness t o its sensory qualities; and given the structure of such sites and their surroundings, we should su p- pose that this sort of bodily responsiveness cannot always be counted on as a matter of course, but has instead to be cultivated, by the adoption of the r e- quisite physical discipline. We might suppose, once again, that the same sorts of connection hold in secular contexts. To take an everyday kind of example, suppose that the light of the low trajectory winter sun, as it streams towards me from the periphery of my visual field, irradiates the long grasses in the meadow in which I am standing, so that the silhouettes of their bobbing heads are brought into sharp relief and wrapped in a warm glow. All of us (I think I can say) will have been gripped at some time or other by the sensory qualities of some such scene, in a relatively theory -independent way, and r e- duced thereby to a condition of quietened, rapt attention. Sacred sites seem, in some cases, to aim at inducing a similar sort of bodily response, in so fa r as 3 I expand on these matters in the discussion of conversion expe rience below. SACRAMENTAL SENSIBILI TY AND THE 'EMBODIMENT OF GOD' 81 they invite the believer into a state of heightened sensory awareness, in which certain material things become compellingly present. But of course, it would be all too easy for me to pass by this scene of sun -lit grasses without further thought, obser ving in some sense the sensory qualities of the scene, but without being engaged by them. For engagement, and fuller apprehe n- sion of these qualities we need, as well as mere observation, the requisite f o- cused attunement of the body, and a quietening of the mind's absorption in other, competing concerns. And the sacred site, in its own way, ensures that these same conditions are realised. THE ROLE OF CONCEPTS IN THE RECOGNITION O F MATERIALLY EMBEDDE D MEANINGS In everyday contexts, a person's recognition of materially embodied va l- ues can also depend of course upon their capacity to deploy appropriate co n- cepts. Let's think about this case next. Once the difference between a swift and a swallow and a martin has been explained to me, then my experience of these swooping forms becomes newly focused and newly informed. And we might suppose similarly that while the significance of sacred sites is to some extent communicated in theory -independent terms, the apprehension of their import can also depend upon the capac ity to read them in terms of a relevant doctrinal scheme. And this scheme may work not simply by allowing the believer to provide doctrinally informed comment upon a given exp e- rience of the site, but also by entering into that experience, so that the ph e- nomenology of the experience is shaped accordingly. Roger Scruton provides an example of this possibility when he notes how the experience of a Gothic church can be inhabited, or structured from within, by the thought that such churches were intended to pres ent an image of the heavenly city. When our experience is guided by such a thought, he notes, it is possible to apprehend a Gothic church not as a single thing subdivided into various components, but as a composite entity, assembled from parts (by analogy with the way in which a city is a composite entity, assembled from the various buildings and other structures of which it is comprised). So the conceptual distinction b e- tween thinking of the church as a composite entity and thinking of it as a single entit y subdivided has, Scruton is suggesting, a phenomenological 82 MARK WYNN counterpart. And the person who is acquainted with this conceptual distin c- tion can, in principle, organise their experience accordingly.4 It is notable that when the experience of a Gothic church is inhabited in this way by the thought of the heavenly city, then the building as experienced can function as an image of the heavenly city: the building so experienced will share the structure of a city, and will therefore be able to image a city. This p ossibility suggests a further way in which religious meanings may be materially mediated: when it penetrates or inhabits an experience in this sort of way, a religious thought can be embodied in the sensory appearances, r a- ther than serving simply as commen tary upon them. And in such cases, the content of the thought will then be imaged by the appearances, so that it is possible to be addressed by and reckon with the thought through one's e n- gagement with the relevant material forms. Of course, the example of the Gothic church is a relatively easy case: here one spatially extended thing (the church) is taken to image another sp a- tially extended thing (the heavenly city) once the appearance of the first thing has been organised appropriately. And there is no gre at mystery about how this is possible. As anyone who has had to entertain small children on a car journey will know, it is possible to take cloud shapes as images of just about any material object you might care to mention: here, the thought of a given obj ect, as named by the child, is inscribed in the appearance of the cloud so as to produce a relevant perceptual gestalt, with the result that the cloud's appearance now images the object. This sort of example works straightforwardly because here we are conf iguring the appearance of one sp a- tially extended thing by reference to the structure of another spatially e x- tended thing. But we might suppose in addition that abstract thoughts, and not only thoughts of spatially extended things, can be inscribed in the s en- sory appearances. Strikingly, many reports of conversion experience seem to suggest som e- thing of this kind. If we turn to William James's classic treatment of these matters in his Varieties of Religious Experience , we find converts reporting that, post -conversion, it is not simply that they feel a new intimacy with God, or that they have come to some deepened doctrinal insight, but rather that the sensory world in general has now taken on a new appearance for them, so that it seems to be in some way glori fied, or newly 'real'. And some converts say of their post -conversion condition that the sensory world is now able to 4 Scruton develops this example in his book The Aesthetics of Architecture (Princeton NJ 1979), 74-75. SACRAMENTAL SENSIBILI TY AND THE 'EMBODIMENT OF GOD' 83 image the divine nature. For example, Jonathan Edwards, who is not noted for levity in his use of theological language, remarks of his own conversion experience that: 'The appearance of everything was altered; there seemed to be, as it were, a calm, sweet cast, or appearance of divine glory, in almost ev e- rything. God's excellency, his wisdom, his purity and love, seemed to appear in everythi ng; in the grass, flowers, and trees; in the water and all nature...'5 The experience which Edwards reports here is like Scruton's example of exp e- riencing a Gothic church in so far as, in each case, the appearance of some relevant stretch of the material wor ld is taken to image something else - only here it is the divine nature which is said to be imaged in the appearance of the sensory world in general, rather than the heavenly city being imaged in the appearance of a Gothic church. How is it possible, we mi ght wonder, for the sensory world to image the divine nature in this way? I'll allude just brie f- ly to three possibilities. First of all, following the drift of Scruton's example, we might suppose that the thought of the divine nature can enter into the app earance of the sensory world, with the result that the sensory world now presents an image of the divine nature. In Scruton's example, the thought of the heavenly city is able to enter into the appearance of the Gothic church because city and church share certain qualities. Notably, they share the property of spatial o r- ganisation; and accordingly, the appearance of the church can conform to the thought of the heavenly city once the organisation of the church, as it is pr e- sented in the relevant perceptual ge stalt, is isomorphic with the organisation of the heavenly city. Taking up Edwards's remarks, we might suppose simila r- ly that the qualities of 'calmness', 'sweetness' and 'glory' can be found in the world and also, in some suitably adjusted sense, in the d ivine nature. And in turn, we might suppose therefore that the thought of the divine nature can inform the appearance of the sensory world in so far as these qualities (of calmness and sweetness and glory) assume the requisite prominence in our experience of the sensory world. We might suppose, secondly, that it is not only the organisation of the perceptual field that is relevant here but also its 'hue'. If I discover that the meat which I am chewing derives from Shuttlecock, the pet rabbit, it is not only that the taste of the meat will now assume new salience in my exp e- rience of the world. Its intrinsic phenomenal feel will also change, as it comes to be experienced as revolting. Here 'hue' and salience work together to 5 Edwards's remarks are cited by James in The Varieties of Religious Experience: A Study in H u- man Nature (London 1911), 248-249. 84 MARK WYNN communicate the existential import of this stuff. Edwards is clearly talking about a change in the 'appearance' of the sensory world, so he has in mind, I take it, some transformation in the sensory phenomena, and not simply some new assessment of the significance of a given body of sensory appearances. And perhaps this transformation can be understood in terms of the ideas of salience and also of hue: relevant features of the world (such as its 'calmness') may now be newly salient, and also the world may come to seem (not revol t- ing but) new ly meaningful, or it may be presented with a new intensity, where this quality of meaningfulness or intensity is given directly in the v i- vidness of the sensory appearances. (Compare the experience of the person who has fallen in love, and the associated tr ansformation in the appearance of the sensory world in general which is often reported in such cases.) Edwards also talks of 'glory' in nature. Perhaps this possibility can be understood in some measure by reference to the sort of heightened awar e- ness of t he natural world which I mentioned before, where the salience of the grasses in my perceptual field and their 'hue' are both potentially relevant to the experience of the scene as compellingly present. I take it that something of broadly this kind is also what Hopkins has in mind when we writes that: 'The world is charged with the grandeur of God / It will flame out like shining from shook foil.' (These are of course the opening lines of his poem 'God's Grandeur'.) In this sort of way, we might argue that t he thought of God's n a- ture can enter into the appearance of the sensory world not so much because of some isomorphism of spatial structure which unites that nature and the relevant perceptual gestalt, but because certain qualities which we might also assoc iate with the divine nature can become newly prominent in the sensory appearances, and because the sensory world can undergo a correlative shift in 'hue'. So here are two ways (relative to the ideas of salience and hue) in which we might understand how it is possible for the sensory world to image the divine nature. A further, related approach to this question might draw on the thought, commonly expressed in reports of conversion experience, that the sensory world post -conversion is somehow newly 'real'.6 Perhaps this intens i- fication in its reality is to be understood simply in terms of its appearing ne w- ly glorified in the sense we have just explored. But we might also try to u n- derstand this case by analogy with our experience of everyday sensory things when the practical possibilities which they afford are taken to be somehow 6 Compare the experience of religious melancholiacs who find that reality is in some fashion 'u n- real'. See James, Varieties , 151. SACRAMENTAL SENSIBILI AND THE 'EMBODIMENT OF GOD' 85 truncated. Matthew Ratcliffe takes up this case in this thought experiment: 'Consider experiencing a table without co -included possibilities like seeing it from another angle, moving it or sitting on a chair in front of it. Without the possibilities of its being accessed from different perspectives, or acted upon, it would appear strangely distant, intangible and incomplete.'7 Here, the table comes to seem in some measure unreal (or inta ngible and incomplete) when some of the practical possibilities which we would normally associate with it fall away. And in a ready sense, the table in that case is indeed less real (than it would have been if it had the normal range of potentialities for a table), in so far as it is not so capable now of contributing causally to the further u n- folding of the world. In a similar vein, perhaps we can understand the co n- vert's experience of the sensory world as newly real as a matter of their co m- ing to a new as sessment of the causal potentialities of the sensory world, where this newly intensified sense of its reality is registered directly in exp e- rience, just as the diminution in the reality of the table in Ratcliffe's example (in the understanding of the subje ct of the experience) is registered directly in experience. And how might religious conversion involve a new assessment of the sensory world's causal potentialities? Well, minimally, perhaps the convert has a new sense of God's activity in the sensory worl d, and a new sense therefore of how the sensory world is caught up into a divinely o r- dained telos . This account suggests a third way in which we might understand the idea that the world can image God. When it is experienced as newly real, perhaps the senso ry world can then image God in so far as God is supremely real, or ipsum esse subsistens . Here it is not so much that a given concept (such as the concept of the divine nature) comes to inhabit the appearance of the sensory world in so far as certain featu res of the world acquire a correl a- tive salience or hue; it is, rather, that our experience of the sensory world is now set within a new assessment of its possibilities, and that its appearance in general is transformed for this reason. This way of putting the matter su g- gests that the new assessment of the sensory world's possibilities comes first, and then a consequent change in its appearance. (And this is the ordering of things which is suggested by Ratcliffe's example.) But we might also suppose that it is possible to move in the other direction: in Ratcliffe's terms, a change 7 Matthew Ratcliffe, Feelings of Being: Phenomen ology, Psychiatry and the Sense of Reality (Ox- ford 2008), 156. Although he does not use the expression 'unreal' in this passage, Ratcliffe associates the example he is developing here with the case where a thing is experienced as 'unreal'. See for example the passage which he quotes on the following page. 86 MARK WYNN in the appearance of the table may issue in the thought that its causal poss i- bilities have been in some way truncated. If we can make some sense of the idea that the divine nature may be i m- aged by the sensory appearances in these various ways, then we might su p- pose that a similar kind of account can be developed for the believer's exp e- rience of the sacred site. Here too, the sensory appearances undergo a tran s- formation, with the res ult that certain material objects become compellingly present; and here too, the believer may suppose that the sensory appearances now provide a window onto the divine nature. In the first section of this paper, we considered the idea that existential meanings can be embodied in material contexts, and can be identified and appropriately acknowledged in the responses of the body. We have now e x- tended this discussion by considering the role of sacred sites, of conversion experience, and of certain kinds of t hought -infused 'seeing', in mediating r e- ligious meanings. In these ways, we can make sense of the idea that not only 'secular' meanings but also religiously germane existential meanings can be embedded in material contexts, and can be apprehended and ackno wledged in the requisite habits of seeing and responses of the body. So we have now identified a number of ways in which we might elaborate upon the idea that there can be 'material expressions of a spiritual reality' which can be encou n- tered and engaged i n bodily terms. But this account is still some way r e- moved from the thought that these 'expressions' can be taken in relevant ci r- cumstances as 'embodiments of God'. Let's consider this possibility rather more directly. SENSORY EXPER IENCE AND THE EMBODIMENT OF GOD In my discussion of Jonathan Edwards's conversion experience, I co n- centrated on his suggestion that, following his conversion, the divine nature was in some fashion imaged in the appearance of the sensory world. But E d- wards is interested in more than simply the idea that the sensory world can, under appropriate conditions, image the divine nature. As we have seen, he remarks that 'God's excellency, his wisdom, his purity and love, seemed to appear in everything; in the grass, flowers, and trees; in the water and all n a- ture...' And although he does not make this point explicitly here, I take it that the divine nature's capacity to appear in these terms is, for Edwards, a cons e- quence of the fact that this same nature sustains the world in being , so that SACRAMENTAL SENSIBILI TY AND THE 'EMBODIMENT OF GOD' 87 its character is in some fashion impressed upon the sensory world. So the imaging relation with which Edwards is concerned derives from the fact that the thing imaged (namely, the divine nature) is causally present in the image. On this point, hi s example differs from the case where a Gothic church i m- ages the heavenly city. We would be reluctant to say, I think, that the he a- venly city is present in the Gothic church when the church serves as an image of the city. But on Edwards's account, it makes good sense to say both that the divine nature is imaged in the sensory world, and that the divine nature is present in the sensory world as that which appears or is made manifest there. There is perhaps a rough analogy here with the case where I press a piece of cloth to my face so that it reveals the lineaments of my face. In this case, the cloth images my face. A second piece of cloth which has just by chance fallen into the relevant shape would also present an image of my face. But we would not wish to say in this second case that my face 'appears' in the cloth, or that my face is present in the cloth. But these ways of speaking seem to be perfectly in order in the first case, assuming that there is here not only an imaging relation, but also a relation of causal sustaining. Suppose that there is a third piece of cloth which owes its shape to being pressed to my face, but which does not, even so, image my face. (Perhaps it has been pressed to my face in a somewhat haphazard way.) Of this cloth too, we would be reluctant to say, I think, that my face appears in the cloth. But if we can affirm both that the cloth owes its shape right now to the impress of my face right now, and that it thereby images my face, then we have some reason to use Edwards's kind of language, and to say that my face 'appears' there. So here we have one way of developing the thought that it is not simply that the divine nature (or some associated reality) may be imaged by the material world, but also that the divine nature can appear in, or be bodied forth in, or 'embodied in', the material world in so far as that nature is imaged by the material world and is here and now the source of that imaging relation. Let me consider briefly one further way of elaborating upon the thought that G od can be embodied in the sensory world. In Matthew's Gospel, Jesus says to those who have fed the hungry, clothed the naked, and visited priso n- ers that 'as often as you have done this to one of these my lowliest brothers and sisters, you have done it to m e'.8 Some commentators have wanted to take this passage at its word, and to suppose that when we treat such people decently, it's not just that we treat people who are in the relevant respect like 8 Matthew 25: 40. I have based this t ranslation on the English rendering of the text given in U l- rich Luz, Matthew 21 -28: A Commentary , tr. J. E. Crouch (Minneapolis MN 2005), 264. 88 MARK WYNN Jesus with decency, but that we treat him decently. To take one example, Gregory of Nyssa supposes that since Christ and other human beings share a single nature, a person who fails in their regard for another human being will thereby fail in their regard for Christ, and for all who can be counted as h u- man.9 We mi ght put this point by saying, for example, that to insult (gratui t- ously) a given human being is to insult human nature, and thereby to insult each and every human being. On this account, it is not only afflicted human beings (those who are hungry and so on ) who are drawn into the relevant moral relation to Christ, but all of us in so far as we share a single nature. It is not difficult to multiply examples of this stronger reading of our text, which takes it to mean more than simply 'like me', from across t he Christian trad i- tion, though no doubt it remains a minority view.10 Let's suppose for the sake of argument that this reading is warranted. In that case, we have another perspective on the thought that God can be embodied in the material world. Of course, Christians in general have wanted to say that the Word became flesh in Jesus of Nazareth. But on this reading of Matthew's text, we can also say that in our dealings with other human beings in general (and perhaps especially in our dealings with afflicted human beings), we encounter Christ himself, and therefore God, in so far as Christ is both human and divine. And in this extended sense, we may say that God is embodied not only in Christ, but in humankind in general. Let's see if we can press this thought a little further. We can distinguish the case where I experience another human being as a person who is embodied from the case where I experience them as a body while bracketing out or perhaps even suppressing any thought of their pe r- sonal significance.11 We might take pornographic experience, in so far as it brackets out the personhood of the other, to illustrate the second of these 9 See for instance Gregory's comment: 'In condemning the sickness that preys upon the body of this man, you fail to consider whether you might be, in the process condemning yourself and all nature. For you yourself belong to the common nature of all. Treat all therefore as one common reality.' The passage appears in Gregory's sermon 'On the Saying, \"Whoever Has Done It to One of These Has Done It to Me\"' and is reproduced in Susan R. Holman , The Hungry are Dying: Beggars and Bishops in Roman Cappadocia (Oxford 2001), 201. I am grateful to Morwenna Ludlow for this reference. 10 A well -known medieval example of the same sort of view can be found in the story of Martin of Tours. Having given half his tunic to a beggar, Martin had a dream in which Christ said that it was he who had received the tunic. See Luz, Matthew 21 -28, 272. See too Sarah Coakley's discussion of Gregor y of Nazianzus's reading of the same passage from Matthew: 'The Identity of the Risen Jesus: Finding Jesus Christ in the Poor', in Beverly Robe rts Gaventa and Richard B. Hays (eds) , Seeking the Identity of Jesus: A Pilgrimage (Grand Rapids MI 2008), 301-319. 11 As Roger Scruton comments, we can distinguish between 'an interest in a person's body and an interest in a person as embodied ': Scruton, Beauty (Oxford 2009), 47. SACRAMENTAL SENSIBILI TY AND THE 'EMBODIMENT OF GOD' 89 kinds of experience. Such an experience is evidently very different morally and phenomenologically from one which is infused by the recognition of the person as a person. So while as a matter of fact, it is a person whom I encou n- ter in my experience of another human being, this truth may not be manifest to me directly in the sensory appearances. Similarly, we might suppose (fo l- lowing Gregory's reading of our text) that while it is in fact Christ whom I encounter in my dealings with another human being, it is a further matter for that person's identification with Christ to be presented to me in the sensory appearances. But to the extent that this truth about their relation to Christ can be rendered in the person's appearance, then we may say not only that God can be encountered in another human being, by virtue of the incarn a- tion, but also that God can be presented to me as God, or as Christ, in the appearance of the person. On this second perspective, God is embodied in the sensory order in a particularly radical sense, in so far as the fact of divine embodiment is itself manifest in the sensory appearances. What would it take for Christ to be presented in the appearance of another person? I am not going to pursue this question at any length here, but by analogy with the case of the convert who takes the divine nature to be presented in the sensory appearances, we might suppose that this Christ - relative construal of another human being's identity can be rendered in the appearances in some measure in so far as the person and their needs become appropriately salient in my perceptual field, and in so far as relevant portions of this fie ld take on an appropriate hue. And perhaps my sense of the pe r- son's Christ -relative identity may even mean that they appear to me as more fully real, in so far as this conception of their identity also involves a new and extended assessment of their causal potentialities. SACRAMENTAL SENSIBIL ITY AND THE TRANSFOR MATION OF THE WORLD In concluding, let me try to draw out some of the implications of the picture we have been exploring for the following themes: the idea of a sacr a- mental sensibility; a conceptio n of the sacraments and 'ritual' more narrowly defined; and the question of how we should think of 'magic'. I have been arguing that just as in familiar, non -religious cases, we can identify and acknowledge existential values through our enacted relationsh ip to particular material contexts, so we can identify and acknowledge religious values through our relationship to places with relevant histories, sensory 90 MARK WYNN qualities and microcosmic significance. In both the secular and the religious case, the relevant val ues will sometimes be apprehended directly in the re s- ponses of the body, as when the sensory qualities of a sacred site have a rel a- tively brute or theory -independent impact on the body, and communicate some religious meaning thereby. These values can also be given due a c- knowledgement in the responses of the body, as when our bodily demeanour at a site is calibrated to what we know of its history. The history of a site may not be identified directly in bodily terms, but the value which attaches to the site i n virtue of that history can be acknowledged in our bodily demeanour, when we are present at the place; and in some cases our appreciation of what kind of bodily demeanour would be most congruent with this history may depend upon an intelligence 'in the bo dy', rather than upon any process of ratiocination. For the more metaphysically adventurous, this sort of account can be supplemented by supposing that in sustaining the world, God i m- presses something of the divine nature upon the world, or by supposing th at by virtue of the incarnation, it is Christ whom we encounter in our relations with other people. And we might add that these truths too can be acknow l- edged and reckoned with not only in abstractly doctrinal terms, but in the sensory appearances, in so f ar as the appearances display the right kind of salience or hue, or manifest the right degree of 'reality'. If we understand the idea of a sacramental sensibility in these terms, then we can make some sense of the thought that a person's religious or sp i- ritual life may be realised not simply in what they think in some relatively abstract sort of way, but also in their bodily demeanour, and in the sensory phenomenology of their experience, in so far as bodily demeanour and ph e- nomenology both constitute ways in which we can recognise and appr o- priately acknowledge 'material expressions of a spiritual reality'. And in this way, we can also make sense of the idea that 'spiritual practice' is integral to a sacramental sensibility, to the extent that this sort of b odily and experiential sensitivity is likely to depend in some measure upon the person's particip a- tion in relevant bodily disciplines, upon their acquisition and careful de p- loyment of the requisite concepts, and in general upon a training of their powers o f attention. I have been talking of how religiously significant existential values may be embedded in particular material contexts, and speaking of a 'sacramental sensibility' in this regard. But what of the sacraments more narrowly co n- strued? Thomas Aquin as writes that the sacraments: SACRAMENTAL SENSIBILI TY AND THE 'EMBODIMENT OF GOD' 91 touch the body and so produce upon it the sort of effects which are connatural to them as physical entities. But in the very act of doing so they may also ope r- ate as instruments, producing effects upon the soul in the power o f God. For instance the water of baptism, by the very fact of washing the body of its own connatural power, washes the soul too in virtue of being an instrument of the divine power.12 On this view, in baptism, for example, God does not suspend or displace the powers which are 'connatural' to water, but instead uses those powers so as to bring about an effect that is beyond their unaided reach. So on this perspective, water achieves in baptism a kind of heightened reality, in so far as it now participates in a more encompassing, divinely ordained network of causes. (By contrast, if the powers which are connatural to water were to be suspended or displaced in baptism, then there would be a sense in which, in the sacramental context, its reality would have been diminished.) So in bap t- ism, and in the other sacraments, the material order takes on a new and heightened significance. And the account we have been developing suggests that this sort of truth, here as elsewhere, can be registered and appropriately acknowl edged not only in discursive terms, as it is in Aquinas's text, but also in our bodily demeanour and in thought -infused experience. So we should expect baptism and the other sacraments to be surrounded by relevant forms of bodily and conceptual preparation . And this is, we might suppose, part of the point of 'ritual' in this context. The stylised gestures and forms of words which we associate with baptism and the other sacraments do not serve simply to instruct us in abstractly conceptual terms of what the sacrament signifies. They also help to inform us perceptually, so that in our experience of the sacramental scene, and in our registering of its significance in bodily terms, the sacrament is fittingly received. Although I shall not develop the point here, we might add that the history of the sacraments (and perhaps especially of the Eucharist ) also calls for acknowledgement in the form of relevant gestures and habits of seeing. Aquinas's doctrine of 'connaturality' (as he develops it here, in relation to the sacraments) points towards a broadly sacramental picture of reality as a whole: God acts we might say by setting material things within a larger, God-directed teleology, which does not subvert the natural tendencies of those things, but draws out those tendencies into a more encompassing set of possibilities. This is we might say the nature of divine love: we are invited 12 Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae 3a. 62. 1, ad 2, The Sacr D. Bourke (Blackfriars 1975). 92 MARK WYNN hereby into a new set of potentialities which calls for the completion or fu l- filment or perfection (and not the displacement or annihil ation) of the p o- tentialities which are ours by nature. And in so far as material things in ge n- eral have that sort of significance (and not only the sort of significance that we recognise when they are understood from a purely secular point of view), then w e should expect there to be a form of life and experience (consisting in the relevant kinds of bodily demeanour and habits of perception) in which these truths are fittingly identified and acknowledged. Lastly, what should we make of magic in that case? We ll, the term 'ma g- ic' admits of course of many meanings. But if when we think of magic, our focus is upon the capacity of words and gestures to effect some transform a- tion in the material world, then perhaps we should allow that there is a sense in which we can speak of, for example, a 'Christian magic'. This 'magic' i n- vites us to engage in certain practices of intellectual and bodily formation, and to enter thereby a correlative perceptual world - one which is charact e- rised by its own patterns of salience, a nd by its own 'colouring' and sense of reality. And we might add that this sort of magic is especially remarkable - for here we are concerned not with a change in some narrowly delimited sphere of experience, but with a transformation of the world as a who le. 93 5 Arguments for a Symbol Theory of Embodied Religion A Response to Mark Wynn RODERICH BART H Martin -Luther -Universit\u00e4t Halle -Wittenberg ABSTRACT Within a scientistic view of the world, rituals and sacraments are su s- pect. They are often invoked as proof of the incompatibility of rel i- gion and modernity. Mark Wynn employs important theoretical and phenomenological arguments against this widespread view. These a r- guments allow for a non -reductionist understanding of everyday and religious experience. In my reply I reconstruct these considerations in the context of a symbol theory that incorporates insights of phil o- sophical anthropology and the contemporary theory of emotion. In this light, metaphorical language about rituals and sacraments as embodiments of God or religion can be approached with interpret a- tive strategies that can take criticisms into account. KEYWORDS symbol theory, rituals, sacraments This paper presents some critical (but constructive) remarks, directed less at the arguments put forward by Mark Wynn than at the dismissive att i- tude toward religious symbols implied by this session's subtitle, 'Beyond a purely symbolic religion .' I aim to show that rituals and sacraments make 94 RODERICH BARTH sense as embodiments of God only within - not beyond - symbol theory. My approach to symbol theory relies on a framework that departs from symbol theory proper, encompassing a whole set of methods for understanding e m- bodied religion. The plausibility of my claim will be measured in large part by whether I succeed in reformulating the sense of 'purely symbolic' in terms of symbol theory. Before sketching out my position, I consider Mark Wynn's nuanced a r- guments for a theory of religious experience that he believes paves the way for an understanding of rituals and sacraments as embodiments of God. I b e- gin with our (many) points of agreement. I then identify some problems that lead me to pursue a symbol theory approach to embodied religion. 1. MEANINGS AND EMBODIM ENTS OF G OD Mark Wynn's text begins with a germane - and, in my view, spot -on - observation: the scientistic worldview has the coercive tendency to see rituals and sacraments as deficient forms of engagemen t with the world. According to scientism's naturalist epistemology, rituals and sacraments originate in a prescientific stage of civilization superseded by modern empiricism. In this view, not only rituals and sacraments but also positive religion itself (of which rituals and sacraments are essential embodiments) represent hol d- overs from an outdated era. A recent court ruling in Germany offers a forceful example of scientism at work. A four -year-old Muslim boy was hospitalized due to complications arising from a circumcision procedure he underwent a few days earlier, lea d- ing a local prosecutor to file crimin al charges against the doctor who pe r- formed the operation. The judges at the regional appellate court in Cologne who presided over the case ruled that non -therapeutic circumcision inflicts permanent and irreparable damage to the body and without consent is tan- tamount to criminal assault. A political uproar followed the court's decision, with the vast majority of Germans supporting the legality of ritual male ci r- cumcision. The ruling and the strong public reaction it provoked exemplify the conflict between t he naturalist epistemology of modern medicine and a belief system that makes exceptions for traditional religious rituals. According to Wynn, this conflict affects the very foundations of a theory of religious experience, and once again I agree. He argues that our idea of religious experience must, therefore, reject the assumptions of scientism. ARGUMENTS FOR A SYMB OL THEORY OF EMBODIE D RELIGION : A RESPONSE TO MARK W YNN 95 That is to say, a philosophy of religion cannot be grounded on a concept of experience borrowed from naturalist epistemology. If we did, then religious values would wind up becoming isolated phenomena in a scientistic ontology and we'd be forced to see them in pejorative light. Wynn attributes scientism's reductionist approach to the analytic trad i- tion, which, as we all know, was greatly shaped by logical positivism. Before anyone raises objections - pointing out the variety of views within the an a- lytical philosophy of religion and the numerous corrections to logical positi v- ism that have been offered over the years - we should see Wynn's claim for what it is: a pointe d generalization, and in this sense it can hardly be denied; quite the contrary. Something like a scientist tendency accompanies the West's entire religious history. In every period of Western civilization, movements arose that overemphasized the discursiv e side of religious exper i- ence and that provoked counter movements in return. For instance, medieval scholastics such as Duns Scotus and William of Ockham warned against the convergence of knowledge and faith, a concern that culminated in Luther's ideas ab out religious belief. When the intellectualism of Protestant orth o- doxy grew too power ful, the Pietists sought to ground faith in personal d e- voutness. Any remaining rationalist hopes of securing religion through met a- physical knowledge were dashed once and f or all by Kant, who claimed that an unbridgeable gap separated knowledge and faith - a tenet Schleiermacher would later take up as well, albeit in an entirely different way. How should we address today's scientist approach to religious exper i- ence, which is far more virulent than its historical manifestations? I want to highlight two basic methodological premises made by Wynn that I find s u- premely helpful in this regard. First, Wynn couches his approach to religion in a theory of meaning. Religion - however we understand it - has always been bound up with meanings we can access through understanding. That is, religious or spiritual beliefs always reveal themselves to us as meanings we can understand. One particular advantage of seeing religion this way is tha t it spans philosophical traditions, uniting positions in continental theories of consciousness, in language philosophy, in theology and in hermeneutics. Connected to this approach is Wynn's second premise: religious unde r- standing must be distinguished fro m everyday understanding. For Wynn, this holds true - especially so - even when we acknowledge the structures they have in common. 96 RODERICH BARTH This twofold approach shapes Wynn's very notion of meaning. His co n- cept of 'existential meanings' takes into account the fact that we understand meanings not only theoretically, discursively and inferentially but also pract i- cally. In our everyday dealings with the world we have a special access to meaning that grounds our interactions with the environment. We can a t- tempt to desc ribe these existential meanings abstractly, but such descriptions never capture the actual richness of meaning we experience, and, at any rate, we rarely think about such everyday meanings on a meta -level. For Wynn, existential meanings are tied to two cen tral elements: bodily movements and place -relative contexts. Both these elements are crucial for religious experience. Just as existential meanings are 'embedded in particular material contexts' ( 90) to which we adjust our bodily movements, so too are sacraments and rituals. In the second section of his paper, Wynn specifically considers the phenomenology of sacred sites. He identifies many parallels between the meanings experienced at sacred sites and existential meanings in general, which leads him to con clude that the former are a special case of the latter. That is to say: not all existential meanings have religious meaning, but all religious meanings have existential meaning - the kind we register via bodily interactions with a specific place. For Wynn, religious meaning is a kind of microcosmic meaning in that it contains a holistic perspective. M i- crocosmic meanings may reveal themselves at sacred sites but also in per se nonreligious contexts where we feel a spatial relationship to our biography as a whole (places of childhood) or where we experience nature in a certain light. The link between existential and microcosmic meanings forces Wynn to consider the epistemic structure of existential meanings in general and of microcosmic meanings in particular . In a somewhat surprising move given his initial arguments, Wynn does this by turning to the role of concepts. He argues that sensory phenomena represent religious meaning only when a b- stract concepts (divine nature, say) participate in the experience. Yet this does not contradict his basic idea that religious experience is not primarily theoretical or doctrinal; our abstract religious concepts must inhabit the se n- sory world and be registered by us directly in experience, which is why on several occasions h e speaks of the body's own intelligence (77, 90 ). Wynn seeks to further support his argument with the notions of 'salience ,' 'hue,' and the 'newly real ,' but, to my mind, the main argumentative burden for Wynn lies on the previous claims that I reconstruct above and that ultimately ground his understanding of sacramental and ritual practice. ARGUMENTS FOR A SYMB OL THEORY OF EMBODIE D RELIGION : A RESPONSE TO MARK W YNN 97 This brings me to some criticisms of Wynn's position. I begin with his section on 'Sensory Experience and the Embodiment of God .' There, if I u n- derstand him correctly, he draws a distinction that tries to account for the attitude expressed in the beyond a purely symbolic religion of the session su b- title. The distinction he makes is between a simple imaging relation and an imaging relation in which 'the thing imagined . . . is causally present in the image,' i.e. one in which divine nature, say, 'can appear in, or be bodied forth in, or \"embodied in\", the material world' (87 ). In traditional Christian do g- matics, the later phenomenon concerns the question of God's 'real pre sence ,' a question that arises with particular vehemence in the doctrine of the sa c- raments. Wynn supports this distinction with several allusions to creation theology - he speaks of 'causal sustaining' and God's 'sustaining the world' (87, 90 ) - but the ma in thrust of his argumentation springs from incarn a- tional Christology. His claim goes somewhat like this: if Jesus is the incarn a- tion of God, then the sensory appearance of human beings is the embod i- ment, or manifestation, of God in a real sense. The mora l lesson from this claim is poignant: the dignity of all persons must be acknowledged based on their sensory appearance alone. But this moral argument does not provide a sufficient theological justification for Wynn's position, as it can be argued from a u niversalist standpoint, which needs no theology. Neither does the doctrine of incarnation, beset as it is by a whole nest of philosophical pro b- lems. Wynn's final section, which applies his view to sacraments and rituals, provides no additional attempts at justification. Rather, Wynn describes his account as something 'for the more metaphysically adventurous' ( 90). Wit h- out denying in principle the possibility of such a metaphysics, I see Wynn's ontological assumption as unproven. Moreover, the idea of a supernatural causality, which runs through medieval theology, contradicts Wynn's initial idea: eschewing the scientistic paradigm when developing a philosophical theory of religious rituals and sacraments. In the following section, I turn to symbol theory to provide an altern a- tive account, especially regarding the reality of rituals and sacraments. I b e- gin by asking what exactly Mark Wynn means when he says that existential meanings are inhabited, or embedded, in material contexts. In conclusion, I offer so me thoughts on Wynn's question about the epistemic character of nondiscursive understanding. 98 RODERICH BARTH 2. THREE APPROACHES TO EMBODIED R ELIGION 2.1. How do we explain the phenomena of pre -discursive understanding described by Wynn, in which we comprehend existent ial meanings via bodily interactions with the world? A good place to look for answers is 20th -century philosophical anthropology. One reason its insights are important today is that they draw on natural and social sciences to overcome philosophical d u- alism and in doing so unintentionally provide biblical anthropology (esp e- cially Old Testament anthropology) with a new theoretical language. The basic tenet of philosophical anthropology is that human beings are 'open to the world .' Unlike animals, which are ro oted in a specific environment, h u- man beings must actively build a world in response to the challenges of exi s- tence. Culture - the habitat human beings engineer - is their 'second nature .' Crucially, human interactions with the world rely on mind and body as a si n- gle unit.1 Sensomotoric feedback loops, an especially important aspect of early child development, guide our actions in a mutually reinforcing system of sensory perception and motoric orientation.2 Over time, these somatose n- sory operations lend the objects we perceive a symbolic character: we imm e- diately grasp their usefulness without having to interact with them directly; so unburdened, we can focus on adjusting our bodily movements to the ex i- gencies of space. For example, we all know just by looki ng at a whitewashed wall which tactile or gustatory qualities it possesses without having to touch or taste it anew. This elementary symbolization takes place already at the optical level. Though these optical symbols form at the prelinguistic, or pr e- discu rsive, level (similar to Wynn's existential meanings), they can also d e- velop into more com plex symbols such as language. 2.2. According to the view of philosophical anthropology, our physical orientation in the world is mediated by symbols that do not nec essarily start 1 The sense of body as understood by Wynn and the conference organizers conflates the human body as physical obj ect with the human body as a veh icle for experience. The German language distinguishes between K\u00f6rper (the physical object) and Leib (the living body). In Husserl's phenomenology, the concept of Leib plays a central role in overcoming dualistic anthropology.

ARGUMENTS FOR A SYMB OL THEORY OF EMBODIE D RELIGION : A RESPONSE TO MARK W YNN 99 out linguistic or discursive. Do such symbols play a role in our religious u n- derstanding? Let us recall Mark Wynn's premise that specific differences exist between nonreligious and religious forms of understanding. If symbols make religious understanding possible, then there must exist similar differences between symbols as well. Now the anthropological notion of the symbol I have sketched so far is quite broad. It is equivalent to the definition of cogn i- tio symbolica in the enlightened herme neutics of Scholastic philosophy, which understood the symbol as a cognition mediated by a sign. This unsp e- cific understanding can be found in Schleiermacher's idea of symbolic action or in Ernst Cassirer's philosophy of symbolic forms. But there also exis ts a narrower idea of the symbol that restricts it to a certain kind of sign. The bulk of this tradition goes back to Immanuel Kant, who understood symbolic co g- nition as a specific subclass of intuitive cognition ( cognitio intuitiva ) rather than opposi te, as argued by the Scholastics. For Kant, the true antithesis of symbolic cognition is discursive cognition, i.e. cognition through concepts.3 In addition linking symbolic cognition with intuitive cognition, Kant emphasized religion's need for symbols. Not surprisingly, further contrib u- tions to the philosophy of religion have taken much inspiration from Kant's ideas. For instance, Paul Tillich and Paul Ricur both essentially argue that the language of religion consists of symbols.4 Although Til lich and Ricur start from very different premises,5 they agree for the most part that symbols are a class of signs whose indirect and intuitive meaning points beyond itself to a secondary, transcendent meaning. Symbols, thus, have a double inte n- tionality. They represent everyday objects but also render sensible that which transcends representation. The transcendent meaning of symbols, like Wynn's religious forms of understanding, is not entirely irrational; it displays a certain inner logic, which, traditi onally, has been understood as a form of analogy. The transcendent meaning ultimately exceeds the finite horizon of discursive imagination. Here lies the affinity between symbols and religious 3 On the intellectual history of the symbol, see Andreas Kubik , Die S ymboltheorie See Pau l Tillich, 'The Meaning and Justification of Religious Symbols ,' in Writings in the Philosophy of Religion (Berlin: de Gruyter, 1987), 417 and Paul Ricur, The Symbolism of Evil (New York: Harper & Row, 1967), 8. 5 Tillich relies on a theory of the unconditional; Ricur takes a phenomenological approach. 100 RODERICH BARTH understanding - and, on the other hand, the reason transcendent meaning must be rendered sensible.6 It should be clear from my brief sketch so far that the phenomena Mark Wynn analyses contain classic examples from symbol theory. A distinguis h- ing feature of religious meaning is its ability to transport an experience o f totality that affects reality as such or signifies in it a deep dimension that transcends everyday experience. Religious meaning is not intuitive in itself; to be able to imagine it at all, we must register it in sensory form. When Wynn argues that meani ngs 'are embodied in material contexts ,' he describes the basic mechanism of the symbol. This why we find at the heart of Wynn's ideas about the relationship b e- tween sensory appearance and religious understanding the classical topos of religious aesthetics : the experience of grandeur, also known as the sublime. Kant believes the sublime comes in two forms: the mathematical sublime (things that have great magnitude) and the dynamic sublime (things that have great power).7 According to Tillich and Ricur, no t only linguistic signs can be understood as symbols in the narrower sense of the term; cultic acts and rituals can as well. Such activities and objects are made comprehensible by virtue of the symbolic function of language. Although more can be said about the sublime and its relationship to symbolic cognition, I now want to address the suspicion that symbols are 'purely' symbolic - that they inadequately describe God's reality - as this se s- sion's title appears to insinuate. This suspicion is nothing new. A s early as 1925, Tillich addressed misgivings about symbols, and he almost succeeded in eliminating them. In his view, the 'nothing more' of the symbolic was, in truth, a 'nothing less ,' as without symbols we misjudge actual religious pra c- tice, if not clos e ourselves off to religious meaning entirely. But the actual argument used by Tillich and Ricur to explain the symbol's dialectic was this: religious meaning can only appear in the form of symbols.8 And, as I 6 See Ricur, The Symbolism of Evil , 10-18; and Paul Tillich, 'The Religion Symbol ,' in Writings in the Philosophy of Religion , 213-28. 7 For more on Kant's notion of the sublime, see Jean Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard, Lessons on the Analytic of the Sublime: Kant's Critique of Judgment, 23 -29, trans. Elizabeth Rottenberg (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1994), 98 -146. Wynn's concept of 'hue' corresponds to that of the subli me (12); his notions of 'salience' (11) and 'the newly real' (12 -13) describe the mathematical sublime and the dynamic sublime, respectively. 8 Tillich implies so much in his Religionsphilosophie when he chooses to discuss symbolic action and language not in the first part ('The Essence of Religion') but in the second, titled 'The Philosophical ARGUMENTS FOR A SYMB OL THEORY OF EMBODIE D RELIGION : A RESPONSE TO MARK W YNN 101 have argued, religious meaning is embodied in actions, objects and words whose intuitive meanings are finite. Indeed, on close examination, we di s- cover that symbols need reality . It is precisely in this sense that we refere to the transcendent through symbols without representing the transcendent as itself as 'purely' symbolic. This paradox between the infinite meaning of co n- tent and the finite meaning of form explains also the need from within pos i- tive religion to criticize its own finite manifestations. Think of the positions taken in the Jewish pro phecy movement, in Early Christianity, in Monast i- cism, in the Christian sects, in Protestantism, or in the conflicts about the status of the sacraments. The telos of religious history in this respect is the full awareness of the symbol as symbol in the sym bol. For Tillich it is at least the concrete, Christological symbol of a self -sacrificing intermediary that is paradigmatic; but so too are rituals, which as active performances prevent symbolic meaning as it pertains to objects from coagulating, so to spe ak. Both these examples - Christ as sacrifice and rituals as active performances - make explicit that even the most inverted symbols need a meaning in ever y- day reality to express transcendent meaning. This point was best emphasized by Ricur, who in his he rmeneutics of symbols also demonstrated its truth. 2.3. We are left with the question as to the epistemology of symbolic understanding. As I mention above, Wynn too poses this question and hints that its answer lies in concepts, which he believes both in form our sensory experiences of religious meaning and develop from them. But this suggestion, as well as Wynn's idea that we are guided by the 'body's own intelligence ,' does not identify the specific epistemic form of religious understanding. The beginni ngs of a real answer, I argue, can be taken from recent stu d- ies in the philosophy of emotion, and I believe Wynn would follow me in this. Unlike previous generations of theorists, in the last 15 years or so philos o- phers have sought to prove that emotions p osses a specific form of rationality or intelligence.9 Despite their many differences, they all agree that emotions neither result from propositional or discursive beliefs nor represent subje c- Doctrine of Appearance .' See Paul Tillich, Religionsphilosophie, in Gesammelte Werke , I (Stuttgart: Evangelisches Verlagswerk, 294 -364. 9 See, for instance, Ronald de Sousa, The Rationality of Emotion (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1987); Peter Goldie, The Emotions: A Philosophical Exploration (Oxford: OUP , 2000); and Martha C. Nussbaum, Upheavals of Thought: The Intelligence of Emotions (Cam bridge: CUP , 2001). 102 RODERICH BARTH tive states or desires. Rather, emotions are states that represe nt and evaluate objects in a specific sort of way. But what these philosophers deliberately overlook is that this understanding of emotions was already put forth in the classic texts of religious phenomenology. The German theologian Rudolf Otto, for instan ce, rejects the idea that the emotion of the numinous is an irrational condition existing only in opposition to rationality. Instead he a r- gues that it is a 'category of value and [...] a definitely \"numinous\" state of mind, which is always found wherever t he category is applied.'10 In our em o- tional response to experience, the world - and with it, our very selves - ap- pears in a new 'hue ,' to borrow Wynn's expression. From this perspective, emotions can be seen as mental correlates of religious symbols and as forms of religious understanding. Neither for Otto nor for recent philosophers of emotion does this perspective speak in favour of irrationalism. Rather, it pr o- vides a more complete idea of rationality, including the rationality of rel i- gious symbols. And s ince emotions belong to the embodied soul we have a quite narrow sense of embodied religion. 10 Rudolf Otto, The Idea of the Holy: An Inquiry into the Non -Rational Factor in the Idea of the Divine and Its Relation to the Rational (London: Oxford University Press, 1958), 7. Section III: NEUROSCIENCE AND FRE E WI LL CAN WE STILL SAY THA T WE 'ARE CALLED TO BE FREE'? 104 105 6 Christian Faith, Free Will and Neuroscience MARCEL SAROT Tilburg Univer sity ABSTRACT In this contribution I explain what the libertarian conception of free will is, and why it is of moral and religious importance. Consequently, I defend this conception of free will agains t secular and religious charges. After that, I present and evaluate neuroscientific exper i- ments on free will, especially Benjamin Libet's experiments. I argue that Libet's experiments do not decide the debate between compat i- bilist and incompatibilis t conceptions of free will; that is a conceptual issue and not an empirical one. Nor do Libet's experiments count against the libertarian conception of free will that I defend, because they deal with arbitrary actions rather than act ions that we do for a reason. I conclude by summing up the case for a libertarian conce p- tion of free will, giving attention especially to a religious reason for preferring this conception. KEYWORDS free will, libertarianism, compatibilism, incompatibilism , Benjamin Libet INTRODUCTION At the beginning of the 21st century, neuroscience is booming and in its wake, belief in free will is on the decline. In this contribution I will inquire (1) how free will and morality are connected and (2) how free will and Christian 106 MARCEL SAROT faith are connected. Moreover, (3) I will give a brief survey of neuroscientific findings on free will. Consequently, (4) I will discuss the claim that Christian faith and/or morality are threa tened by neuroscientific findings on free will. To what extent is this the case? In light of the complexity of the field, it is inevitable that I simplify some of the issues. If, however, I succeed in provi d- ing a conceptual map of the main issues, in demy thologizing some conte m- porary myths and in indicating what are the main issues that deserve further discussion in the philosophy of religion, I will consider my mission for this contribution to be completed. FREE WILL: INTRODUCTORY CONCEPTUAL EXPLORATIONS A quarter of an hour ago, at 7:30 on 27 February 2012, I have begun to write down my paper for the ESPR conference 2012. Though the deadline for this paper has already elapsed and the second speaker of the ESPR session on neuroscience and free will is eag erly awaiting my first paper, I might have postponed the writing of the paper even further. I decided , however, that fu r- ther postponement would be irresponsible and I started writing. Now let's step back and take a look at what I have just said. I have cla imed that the fact that I started to write this paper did not just happen to me, was not the result of a chain of events inevitably leading to it (e.g., mail exchanges with Peter Jonkers and Aku Visala), but was the result of my decision. In my experience, it was I who took the decision; I am in charge and responsible, both for the fact that there is a delay and for the fact that there is to be no further delay. I am aware, of course, that external factors have influenced me. If I had not received reminders I would probably have given precedence to yet another paper. Nevertheless, the fact that I have begun today is the result of my deci- sion. This is, I submit, what is involved in a common sense view of free will. Note that the word 'will' does not appear i n this account. It is not needed. The point is that ordinarily, I take my decisions and commit my actions. I just added ordinarily , because most people would claim that this is the default position, but would have no problem in admitting that there would b e exce p- tions. Under the influence of alcohol, for instance, people apparently do things that they would ordinarily not have done: Alcohol reduces our control. That is one of the reasons why we should control our consumption of alc o- hol. Medicine may have a similar effect - even though we may not be aware CHRISTIAN FAITH , FREE W ILL AND NEUROSCIENCE 107 of that when taking it - and so may some psychological conditions. These exceptions do not endanger the default position that I am in control . More o- ver, most people would readily admit that even under ordin ary circum s- tances, they do not control themselves entirely. Our actions are rooted in a bodily basis, a physiological pattern that is given to us, perpetuating itself automatically. This stable pattern of bodily activity - heart beat, respiration, blood ci rculation - may be under our control to a very limited extent only (if I stop these processes, that is the end of my career as an agent), but that is not considered as threatening my control. As Thomas F. Tracy has argued, 'this stable pattern of bodily ac tivity provides the foundation for the life of an agent because it permits a margin of intentional variation.' 1 In other words, our actions are rooted in a bodily substrate that is to a large extent given to us; this does not threaten our being agents but enable it, as long as we are able to control our body to some extent. The more control, the more freedom to act. That is why we take trouble to increase the control of our bodies (whether it is in learning to walk or in learning to play the piano): it inc reases our range of actions. The above may be summarized as follows: freedom is always freedom of, freedom to and freedom from , and freedom involves control . Freedom of: A free act is not an arbitrary act; it is the act of someone . My action is explained by me, by my decision . In many cases those who know me can to a certain extent predict me. Freedom to : It is the freedom to start writing a paper or to delay that start; more generally, it is the ability to do something or to absta in from it. Freedom from : Freedom is always freedom from compulsion: when I am free, the causal antecedents of my action do not make that action inevit a- ble. Control : If the agent does not control the action, but the action is ra n- dom, it is not free. Absolu te freedom , then, does not exist. In our daily lives, we consider freedom to be important. Why? On a s e- cular level , I think, because we see freedom as a necessary condition for r e- sponsibility: No responsibility without control. If an agent does not act fr eely, she cannot be held responsible for her actions. In other words, persons who are not free from compulsion or who did not have alternatives, cannot be held responsible. This also means that our legal system is based on the a s- sumption that in principle, people are free. To the extent that they are not, they are in a state of diminished responsibility and qualify for reduction of 1 Thomas F. Tracy, God, Action and Embodiment (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1984), 104. 108 MARCEL SAROT sentence. Freedom is important in other domains of life as well. Our whole way of thinking about love and friendship assumes th at we are free to chose with whom we will have these relationships. The fact that a person freely chooses me for a friend is one of the things that makes his friendship valu a- ble for me. And the fact that I am free to return his friendship or not is one of the things that make my positive response valuable to him. Moreover, one of the most influential ideals in contemporary society, that of autonomy, pr e- supposes that we are free. We can be autonomous only to the extent that our actions are truly our own and are not caused by factors outside our control, i.e., in so far as we are free. The same applies to the political ideal of demo c- racy: people are allowed to choose their own government on the presuppos i- tion that when they choose, this choice is their choice , so that the resulting government expresses the will of the people . On a religious level , freedom and responsibility are not l ess important. Theists generally think that it matters what we believe and that it matters that we live according to our beliefs. They may even think that our final de s- tiny depends upon it. Now if that is the case, we must again be responsible and therefore free. Even those who do not think that our final destiny d e- pends upon the decisions we make during our lives, however, will ofte n argue that it is of paramount importance that we return the love of God and that we love our neighbors. And here again, love requires freedom. Moreover, free will may - but need not - play a role in various contexts in theology and ph i- losophy of religion , for example in a free will defence, an attempt to reconcile the existence of evil with the existence of a good, omnipotent and omniscient God by arguing that evil is due to human free actions for which God cannot be held responsible. FURTHER C ONCEPTUAL EXPLORATIONS : THREATS TO BELIEF IN FREE WILL2 Free will may be important, but there are a number of reasons not to b e- lieve that we actually have free will. These reasons again fall apart into two groups: secular reasons and religious reasons. 2 For the philosophical distinctions introduced in this section see current introductions to free will like Joseph Keim Campbell, Free Will (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2011); T.J. Mawson, Will: Continuum, 2011); Ted Honderich (ed.), The Determinism and Fre e- dom Philosophy Website, http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwIntroIndex.htm (visited 5 May 2012). CHRISTIAN FAITH , FREE W ILL AND NEUROSCIENCE 109 Secular reasons for not believing in free will are motivated by science. Science seeks to explain things, and in the course of doing so it lays bare causal sequences: chains of cause and effect. It is useful to be aware here of the fact that causal explana tion hardly ever involves single causes: mostly, it is a causal condition rather than a single cause that explains an effect. If I turn the light switch, that may be called the cause of the room becoming i l- luminated; nevertheless, the room would still in d arkness if the Electricity Company would not supply electricity, if my wife would not have paid the bills, etc. etc. A full causal explanation is almost always complicate rather than simple. A full causal complication, moreover, does not only include cause s, but also the causes of these causes etc. In principle, for each cause science may legitimately ask for the cause of that. It is here that a tension with belief in free will emerges, for as we have just seen, this belief supposes that the explanation of free actions has an end in the person who acts, or in that person's free will. If I claim that I did a certain action, I do not claim my act of will is a full explanation for that action; circumstances like those just mentioned (e.g., there being electrici ty) will invariably figure in full explan a- tions of my actions. But I do claim that my ch oice is not explained by a chain of cause and effect that stretches back for an indefinite time: It was I who made the choice or committed the action, and if this is me rely an appropri a- tion of a particular part of a chain of causes and effects that in no way differs from other chains of cause and effect like those determining the weather or the orbits of the planets, it becomes meaningless to claim that my act is a free act. This comes down to the claim that free will and determinism are i n- compatible, a claim that I would like to defend. I defend indeterminism with respect to human choices and actions, therefore; I do not take position here with respect to the choice bet ween determinism and indeterminism in a more general or cosmic way. Indeterminism with respect to human choices and actions is compatible both with cosmic determinism and cosmic ind e- terminism, I submit.3 It is important to note, however, that in the philos ophi- cal literature on free will and determinism another position is frequently d e- fended: Simultaneous acceptance of determinism and free will, made possible by a revised, more limited definition of free will. Because this view of free will 3 In th at case, of course, cosmic determinism becomes determinism with an exception: Free will. From now on, I will u se '(in)determinism' in the limited sense of (in)determinism with respect to h u- man choices and actions only, not in the wider sense of cosmic (in) determinism. 110 MARCEL SAROT is compatible wi th determinism, it is called the compatibilist view of free will. Compatibilists assert that if an action is voluntary in the sense that we are not compelled to do it against our will, that action is free. Most philosophers would admit that determinism lea ves room for actions that are free in this sense: Determinism asserts that insofar as we have a will, that will is the e f- fect of a causal sequence (genetic factors and environment al factors) as well, but it does not assert that our actions take place again st that will. For these philosophers, this compatibilist form of free will is sufficient for responsibi l- ity. For them, I would say, appropriation of the action is more important than control or origination (in the sense of having done the action while bein g able not to do the action). The opposite of compatibilism is incompatibilism ; incompatibilists d e- fend libertarian free will , that is to say they defend that if a person freely commits an action, this person should have been able to act otherwise as well. Mere identification with an action is insufficient for full responsibility, incompatibilists hold. We generally hold that this applies to other persons' actions: identifying with someone else's terrorist attack is morally repugnant, but does not bring ful l moral and legal responsibility for that attack with it. Incompatibilists hold that this also applies to one's own actions: if one could not avoid one's own actions because these are fully causally determined, identification with or appropriation of these actions does not suffice to make one fully morally and legally responsible. I am not going to argue in full for this view here. I suggest, however, that most compatibilists will to a certain extent share my intuition with respect to identification being insufficient for responsibility; the reason they nevertheless reject a libertarian view of free will is that they judge that it is either indefensible in light of the findings of science, or has never yet been articulated in a philosophically acceptable wa y. By confronting some of the scientific findings that are the most difficult to accommodate within a libertarian view of free will, those of the Libet exper i- ments, later on in this paper, I hope to take away at least part of their obje c- tions to libertaria n free will. Religious reasons for not believing in free will are motivated by the Christian understanding of either God's foreknowledge, providence or pr e- destination. Providence and predestination, if they are well understood, co n- stitute no problems for f ree will, I submit. When we say that God is prov i- dent, we say that God guides nature, history and individual lives in acco r- dance with God's goals. If we are determinists as outlined above, we may b e- lieve that God can fully determine nature, history and in dividual lives; if we CHRISTIAN FAITH , FREE W ILL AND NEUROSCIENCE 111 are not, we can interpret God's providence in terms of a salvific influence that in no way hinders free will. Predestination is about one's eternal destiny rather than about one's free choices; this doctrine wants to assert that human salvation is entirely dependent upon God, not upon human choice. Contrary to what is often thought, even the strictest form of predestination, double predestination, is compatible with libertarian free will. Predestinatarian th e- ologies do assert that ther e are limits to free will, of course: one cannot will oneself to salvation. That there are limits to free will, however, is a general given of experience: I cannot by the exertion of free will jump to the moon or become a marathon champion either, because the first is impossible and the second is impossible for me, given my lack of talents in this field. Foreknowledge is a different cup of tea, I think, because the assertion of full foreknowledge does create problems for libertarian free will. If God knows all free acts in advance, these acts are determined when God knows them and the actors lack the ability to act otherwise. For determinists this is not a problem; it is merely another argument against libertarian free will. Incompatibilists like myself hav e two options available. Firstly, they may - with Augustine and Boethius - assert that God does not exist in time but eternally, which means that He lacks temporal location and extension. For e- knowledge is then no longer foreknowledge; God does not know in time. I n- genious attempts have been made to show how eternal existence can yield omniscience with respect to temporal events and (free) actions even if d e- terminism is not true.4 Personally, I don't believe that these attempts work; as soon as one uncovers t heir hidden inconsistencies, a hidden determinism is uncovered as well.5 That is why I opt for another possibility: God has limited knowledge of the future only: 'It is logically impossible for God to know with certainty the future choices to be made by fr ee persons. This should not be seen as a denial of omniscience, any more than it is a denial of omnipotence that God cannot perform actions that are logically impossible.'6 Though there is a tension between divine foreknowledge and libertarian free will, then, there is no need to resolve this tension in such a way that li b- 4 Eleonore Stump & Norman Kretzmann , 'Eternity,' The Journal of Philosophy 78/8 (August 1981), 429-458, reprinted in: Thomas V.

Since I have argued above that libertarian free will is important to theism, the upshot of the religious considerations concerning libertarian free will seem s to be in favour of it. It seems that the findings of science are a more serious problem for those who want to ascribe libertarian free will to human beings than the beliefs of Christendom. Let us now turn, therefore, to the findings of science, and more specifically to those of Benj a- min Libet. BENJAMIN LIBET'S EXPERIMENTS ON FREE WILL Benjamin Libet's experiments on free will did not come out of the blue. In these experiments, he built on earlier experiments that suggested that conscious awareness of certain brain processes was delayed by 500 millise c- onds, and that people in hindsight often think that their conscious exper i- ences took place at an earlier moment than they in fact did ('backward refe r- ral').7 In the most famous experiment in which Libet brings empirical ev i- dence to bear on the question whether we have free will,8 he starts from the fact tha t if people perform self -initiated voluntary acts, like a quick flexion of the fingers or wrist, a DC system with an active electrode on the scalp can measure a slow electrical change at the vertex that precedes the actual movement by up to 1 second or mor e. This electrical change is called the readiness potential (RP). In other words, approximately a second elapses b e- tween the first perceptible brain change (RP) and the actual movement. Libet knew, as we all know, that our conscious decision to move preced es our movements. He doubted, however, whether the time between conscious d e- cision and actual movement is as long as a second. If the time was smaller, that would mean that brain changes leading to the movement were begi n- ning before the conscious decision was made. In order to ascertain whether this really is the case, he devised an ingenious clock, an oscilloscope timer, which has a dot that moves at approximately 25 times the speed of the 7 On these experiments, see Adina L.

Experiments show that su b- jects using such a clock can report the actual time at which a weak electrical stimulus was delivered to their skins with an error of only -50 milliseconds. When Libet asked su bjects to indicate the moment of their actual conscious decision at this clock, he found that RP started 550 milliseconds before the act, human subjects became aware of the intention to act 350 -400 msec after RP and 200 msec before the actual motor act. Ev en admitting an error of - 50msec, this would still place the conscious decision firmly after the RP. Many scholars conclude from Libet's experiments to free will scepticism, so much so that Benjamin Libet, Anthony Freeman and Keith Sutherland write that Much of the contemporary case for the illusory nature of free will is derived from the experimental work of Libet and his colleagues9 and Tim Bayne calls Libet's studies concerning the neural basis of human agency ... the most infl u- ential rebutting [of free will - MS] objection in the current literature.10 Libet's alleged objection is reinforced by more recent experiments, that su g- gest that we can view the process leading to free acts begin up to ten seconds before the act.11 Thus, the indications that free will - if we may continue to call the process through which we make our decisions thus - is rooted in brain processes that precede (and partly elude) consciousness, become stronger and stronger. On the other hand, as John S earle has noted, ' This e x- perience of free will is very compelling, and even those of us who think it is 9 Benjamin Libet, Anthony Freeman & Keith Sutherland , 'Editor's Introduction: The Volitional Brain,' Journal of Consciousness (1999), ix -xxiii, xvi. 10 Tim Bayne, 'Libet and t he Case for Free Will Scepticism,' in: Richard Swinburne (ed.), Free Will and Modern Science (Oxford: OUP: 2011), 25 -46, 26.

'12 Libet himself is a clear example of this. He concludes f rom his exper i- ment: The volitional process is therefore initiated unconsciously. But the conscious function could still control the outcome; it can veto the act. Free will is ther e- fore not excluded . These findings put constraints on views of how free will may operate; it would not initiate a voluntary act, but it could control performance of the act.13 In other words, Libet suggests that free will is not nonexistent, but operates in a different way: it does not generate our decisions but controls them. If it wants to, free will interrupts the process leading to our acts and thereby pr e- vents them. If it endorses the act, free will gives in to the process leading to it. In the literature this is sometimes characterized as freedom of won't rather than freedom of will.14 There's a host of technical questions that could be asked about the rel i- ability of Libet's experiments. Libet may have been the first to engage in si g- nificant empirical research on free will, but novel research designs are prone to contain errors that have to be corrected by later generations of researc h- ers. There's the technical question, for example, if subjects who are required to divide their attention between their own action and position of the clock face are not likely to make errors in tem poral order judgements.15 There's the not less technical, but crucial question whether RP reflects processes i n- volved in initiating a movement or in forming a conscious intention.16 Since we are often unaware of our intentions (e.g., I am aware of driving, s teering, accelerating, changing gear, etc. but not of the intentions to do all these things), becoming conscious of the intention (as required in Libet's exper i- ments) may often temporally follow the intention itself - even though we 12 John Searle, 'Free Will as a Problem in Neurobiology,' Philosophy 76 (2001) , 491 -514, quot. 494. 13 Libet, 'Do We Have Free Will?', 47. 14 Alan L.

CHRISTIAN FAITH , FREE W ILL AND NEUROSCIENCE 115 would ordinarily call t he intention itself a 'conscious intention.' If that is the case, we can ask: I s Libet measuring the interval between conscious intention and movement, or between consciousness of conscious intention and mov e- ment?17 While all of these questions on Libet's e xperiments can be seen as throwing doubt on his results and thus supporting libertarian free will, some empirical questions go in the opposite direction. For example, if brain pro c- esses precede our conscious decision to act, is it not likely that brain pro c- esses also precede our conscious processes to veto an act? In what sense do we have 'free won't,' then?18 I abstain from an in -depth discussion of these questions for three reasons. (1) Scientists themselves have not come to defin i- tive decisions on these. (2) As long as scientists disagree, philosophers cannot do much more than pick and choose, and that with less authority than a sc i- entist making such a choice would have. (3) We don't need answers to all of these questions for our purposes. The main reason why we don't need these answers is that the type of a c- tions that is studied in Libet's experiments and the like, is neither morally nor religiously relevant. Spontaneously generated simple motor movements that have no real consequences do qualify as free a cts for those who believe in free acts; there is no question about that. Nor is it difficult to understand why Libet studies this type of movements: In order to shed experimental light on the genesis of free actions, Libet focuses on the simplest examples . The whimsical movements that he studies, however, are hardly meaningful examples of free agency. It is not even clear that Libet studies the relation between the intention to act and the act itself . The subjects in Libet's exper i- ments are in fact invited to adopt a certain mental set, namely move wrist at random moment . The decision they have to make after this is not whether to move, but when to. And there are no reasons that govern this decision.19 It is not with pointless movements that religion and mo rality are co n- cerned. They are concerned, rather, with our ability to act for a reason , and for a reason that we consider good. They are concerned with acts that are rooted in our deepest convictions and are the result of conscious deliber a- tion. It is not clear that Libet -experiments shed any on these. Adina Roskies concludes: 17 Roskies, 'Why Libet's Studies Don't Pose a Threat to Free Will,' 20 -22. 18 Marcel Brass & Patrick Haggard, 'To Do or Not to Do: The Neural Signature of Self -Control,' The Journ al -9145. 19 Roskies, 'Why Libet's Studies Don't Pose a Threat to Free Will,' 18 -19. 116 MARCEL SAROT Arbitrary action is, at best, a degenerate case of freedom of the will. ... Suppose ... that it turned out that in purely arbitrary cases in the absence of reasons (i n- cluding forese eable consequences of those actions), actions were the results of random fluctuations in the nervous system, and suppose further that in all cases in which there are reasons relevant to the decision to act, we responded appropriately to these reasons, del iberating and weighing them, and then reg u- lating our actions so as to bring them in line with our deliberations. Would we conclude on the basis of the random mechanisms that caused actions in cases where our actions had no consequences that we lacked freedom?20 The answer is, of course: No. If this is how things stand, in the cases that matter we do have the relevant form of freedom. Consider the following e x- ample: While dusk is beginning to fall, a couple is taking a stroll in the forest near their hom e. Towards the end of their walk, one of them believes that she has heard a women crying. They stand still and listen together, briefly discuss what might be the case and then run together into the direction from which the voice is coming. Up to then, thei r walk did not have a moral significance; even if their route had been the result of random fluctuations in their ner v- ous systems, that is hardly relevant to the question whether they really have free will. The decision they make when they hear the cries, however, is mo r- ally relevant; and it this decision turned out to be the result of random flu c- tuations rather than conscious deliberations, this would be very relevant to the question whether they have free will. On this type of decisions, however, Libet -type experiments do not shed much light. THE LIMITS OF EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON FREE WILL Benjamin Libet is perhaps the most prominent among those who bring empirical research to bear on questions of free will, but he is certainly not the only one: Robert Kan e, Daniel Dennett and Daniel Wegner should be me n- tioned here as well.21 The reason that I don't analyse their views here is that the above discussion of Libet's experiments suffices to give us some insight 20 Roskies, 'Why Libet's Studies Don't Pose a Threat to Free Will,' 18. Similar points are made in: Bayne, 'Libet and the Case f or Free Will Scepticism,' 28 -31; Mawson, Free Will , Evolves (New York: Viking, 2003); Robert R. Kane, The Significance of Free Will (Oxford: OUP, 1996); Kane, 'Responsibility, Luck and Chance,' Journal of Philosophy 96 (1999), 217 -240; Wegner, The Illusion of Conscious Will . Cf. Stephen Hawking & Leonard Mlodinow, The Grand Design (New York: Bantam Books, 2010), 32. CHRISTIAN FAITH , FREE W ILL AND NEUROSCIENCE 117 into both the value and the limits of empirical res earch on free will. Discu s- sion of more scholars and their positions would in this respect yield no new insights. We have seen that empirical research sheds some light on the question to what extent acts that in ordinary life we would call 'free' are causal ly de- termined by processes other than conscious decisions. I write 'some light' because we have seen that Libet's research concerns only a limited class of free actions - random and pointless bodily movements - and not the type of free actions that we woul d ordinarily consider of paramount importance: acts of moral or religious significance that are preceded by serious conscious d e- liberation. The current limitations of empirical research into free will, ho w- ever, are not limitations of principle but of pract ice. This type of research is still in its infancy and we have good reason to suppose that in the long run it will provide fuller and more reliable data about Libet -type of actions and, moreover, will provide data about more central examples of exertion of the free will as well. It may well be the case, then, that in the long run the issue of determinism versus indeterminism will be empirical ly decidable. This, however, does not apply to the issue of compatibilism versus i n- compatibilism. The issue that is a t stake here is not to what extent our a c- tions are in fact determined, but under which circumstances we are prepared to call an action free (and blame of praise a person for it) and under which circumstances not. That's an issue on which we have to make u p our minds on philosophical grounds and that cannot be decided by empirical research. Empirical research should settle the question to what extent our actions are determined; philosophy should help us settle whether we should call our a c- tions free.22 We h ave seen above that absence of coercion is insufficient for inco m- patibilists. Incompatibilists assert that an action is free only if the actor might have acted otherwise if s/he had wanted to. In other words, incompatibilists assert that an action is free if and only if (1) it is at least partly explained by a conscious decision of the actor, (2) the actor was capable of deciding othe r- 22 This also means that if one accepts determinism, it is up to philosophy and not to empirical r e- search t o decide whether this should be soft determinism (determinism accepting a compatibilist form of free will) or hard determinism (determinism rejecting the reality of free will). See on these issues Peter W. Ross, 'Empirical Constraints on the Problem of Fre e Will,' in: Susan Pockett, William P. Banks & Shaun Gallagher (eds.), Does Consciousness Cause Behaviour? (Cambridge, MA: Mit Press, 2006), 125-144. 118 MARCEL SAROT wise, so that the action in question would not have taken place, and (3) the decision of will itself cannot restlessly be ex plained from its causal antec e- dents. Incompatibilists therefore assume that free agency requires conscious states to be causally efficacious in producing an action in a way that cannot be restlessly explained in terms of genetics, environment, etc. Whether this is really required for free agency is a conceptual question to be discussed in ph i- losophy; whether this type of freedom actually obtains in our world, is an empirical question to be settled by science. Given the current scientific state of affairs, w here does this bring us? Firstly, above I have distinguished between cosmic determinism and dete r- minism with respect to human will. On the standard interpretation of qua n- tum mechanics, cosmic determinism has been proven false, with quantum indeterminacy as the exception.23 Secondly, quantum indeterminacy does not suffice to prove that we have libertarian free will. It is not clear that quantum determinacy leads to indeterminacy at the level of phenomena that are o b- servable with the naked eye, while that is t he level at which we would like our free will to have effect.24 Moreover, even if higher level indeterminacy could be proven, that could be explained by chance rather than by volitional control. The fact that there is an exception to cosmic determinism does un- dermine determinism, however. Thirdly, as I have shown in my discussion of Libet's experiments, science is still a long way off from proving key examples of libertarian free will an illusion. In the absence of decisive scientific ev i- dence, other conside rations should guide our decision on the issue of free will. Fourthly, one such consideration may be introspection, which - in the absence of scientific evidence to the contrary - provides a 'very compelling' argument in favour of libertarian free will. Fi fthly, a second such consider a- tion is provided by the conceptual link between moral responsibility and li b- ertarian free will. Until now, no convincing example has been given in which we would without hesitation hold someone without libertarian free will r e- sponsible for her actions. 23 Ross, 'Empirical Constraints,' 129. 24 84; Mats J. Hansson, Understanding an Act of God: An Essay in Philosophical Theology (Uppsala: Acta Universitatis Upsaliensis, 1991), 99. In another way Stephen Hawking also argues th at quantum physics does not lead us away from determinism: Hawking & Mlodinow, Grand Design , 72. CHRISTIAN FAITH , FREE W ILL AND NEUROSCIENCE 119 FINAL CONSIDERATION Those who reject libertarian free will mostly do so because of scientific reasons: they believe that science rules out the possi bility that conscious d e- cisions that are themselves at least partly independent of (material) causal antecedents, decide our courses of action. However, while it is true that sc i- ence has not proven that conscious decisions are causal factors, it cannot rule them out either. And while it is true that on scientific grounds o ne cannot rule out the possibility that conscious decisions are epiphenomena of other conditions that can be studied empirically, one cannot prove them to be so either. Empirically, it is imposs ible to prove that consciousness is always and under all circu mstances consciousness of a body and originated by that body. Moreover, for those who believe in a conscious God or other supernatural conscious beings, this seems a very unpromising position to adopt. For it would imply that God could be no more than a f unction of this world ( aliquid mundi )25, that He could in no way act or know or be independently of the world, and that He could neither begin to exist before creation began to exist, nor continue to exist after creation had stopped to exist. Therefore it s eems that those philosophers of religion who defend the existence of a God who exists independently of the world, have good reason to defend the existence of libertarian free will as well. We have seen above that both morality and theism seem to require li b- ertarian free will. Contrary to what is often thought, neuroscientific exper i- ments on free will like those of Benjamin Libet give us little reason to reject the idea that human beings have libertarian free will. Therefore these fin d- ings do not undermine m orality and religion either. 25 Austin Farrer, Reflective Faith: Essays in Philosophical Theology (London: SPCK, 1972), 186. 120 MARCEL SAROT 121 7 Theism, Compatibilism and Neurodeterminism: A Response to Marcel Sarot AKU VISALA Center of Theological Inquiry, Princeton ABSTRACT Christian theology affirms that humans are free. In his paper 'Christian Faith, Free Will and Neuroscience ,'Marcel Sarot defends the view that liber - tarianism is the best account of our freedom and argues that recent results of neuroscience are compatible with libertarianism. Although I am sympathetic towards his latter conclusion, I am not as sure about the for mer. My paper discusses some of Sarot's arguments and maintains that theists might still have some good reasons to be compatibilists. Theological reasons for compatibilism have to do with traditional doctrines of providence, grace and human sinfulness. Cer tain solutions to the problem of free will and foreknowledge also suggest compatibilism. Philosophically, libertarianism suffers from problems that have to with reasons causing actions. Furthermore, the paper also provides some reasons to think that the re sults of neuroscience are, for the most part, irrelevant for assessing whether we are free in the compatibilist or libertarian sense. This is because neuroscience seems to be unable to give us evidence that neuroscientific / psychological laws are universa l or exceptionless. KEYWORDS will, neuroscience, theism, compatibilism, determinism, libertarianism 122 AKU VISALA I take it that Christian theology affirms human free will and moral responsibility. Thus, Christians need to reject all views that entail either hard determinism or fatalism. If hard determinism is true, we have no free will or moral responsibility. If fatalism is true, there is nothing we can do to influence how the future will turn out. Against these views, Christian theologians affirm that we are indeed responsible and free and can influence the future. Now, two questions are before us: first, do we need libertarian free will to account for what Christians affirm or is compatibilism enough; and second, will neuroscience make any difference in this issue. In his paper, Christian Faith, Free Will and Neuroscience , prof. Marcel Sarot argues that we need not give up our belief in libertarian freedom because of theological or neuroscientific reasons. On the theological side, he argues that God 's providen ce and foreknowledge do not conflict with libertarian free will. With respect to foreknowledge, he adopts the Open Theist position: namely, that propositions about future free actions do not have truth -values, so even God cannot know them. On the scientifi c side, according to him, one major reason for rejecting libertarian free will is the work of Benjamin Libet (and other neuroscientists). He then presents arguments for the conclusion that Libet 's experiments only deal with actions that are morally irrelev ant; morally relevant actions, Sarot claims, are much more complicated than the actions that Libet studies, so Libet 's experiments say very little about moral responsibility. Major threats to libertarian free will are thus removed. Although I agree with th e general thrust of Sarot 's paper - especially his criticisms of Libet 's experiments and their interpretation - I am prepared to play the devil 's advocate here. I will argue that Sarot lets the libertarian off the hook a bit too easily and simplifies the c ompatibilist position unjustifiably. So, I think that a much stronger case for theistic compatibilism can be made - a case that is not so easily defeated. I will not present a complete case for Christian compatibilism here, but I will be presenting some re asons for it. Before I go on, I want to say that I am not a card -carrying Christian compatibilist (or at least not yet). But I do think that there are some good reasons for Christians to be compatibilists and that there are good arguments against theistic libertarianism. I also want to highlight the fact that neuroscience does not, I think, feature in these arguments. Whether these arguments - all things considered - warrant compatibilism over libertarianism or whether the libertarian position could be form ulated in such a way to make it immune to criticisms I will present I am not sure. THEISM , COMPATIBILISM AND N EURODETERMINISM : A RESPONSE TO MARCEL SAROT 123 My article has three parts. In the first part, I will argue that there are some theological reasons for compatibilism. These reasons have to do with providence, grace and hu man sin. Further, I will present some criticisms of Sarot 's solution to the problem of free will and foreknowledge. In the second part, I will take issue with some of the more philosophical aspects of Sarot 's libertarianism. Sarot has failed to discuss the biggest obstacle to a libertarian theory of free will, the issue of randomness or arbitrariness. Finally, in the third part I will present some arguments in support of Sarot 's position on neuroscience and determinism. 1. DEFINITIONS As I said, the contest is in between libertarians and compatibilists. For the sake of clarity, let me briefly say what I mean by these views.1 First of all, determinism is the view that for any S 's action A (or choice or decision) at some time is necessitated by antecedent factors. What is meant by 'necessitated ' here is that there are some conditions such that if those conditions occur, then S 's action A will always occur. In other words, the cond itions - whatever they are - make it necessary for S 's action A to occur. This way of defining determinism has the benefit of being rather liberal as to what the necessitating antecedent factors are. In the scientific case, these factors would be antecede nt physical events and physical laws, but there might be other conditions as well. More specifically, some neuroscientists think that our actions are not necessitated by general physical laws and events, but instead our brain events and laws governing thos e events. Finally, a religious person could believe that there is a God that necessitates our actions. Or one might believe in some other, non -personal force, like fate. Let us call these views scientific determinism , neurodeterminism and theological deter minism respectively.2 Generally speaking, a compatibilist claims that for S to be free and morally responsible in performing action A is compatible with action A being ultimately caused by factors outside S 's control. In other words, despite the fact that our actions and choices are caused by factors outside our influence, 1 My basic definitions draw more or less from Robert Kane, A Contemporary Introduction to Free Will (New York 2005) and the introduction to Robert Kane (ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Free Will (Oxford 2011). 2 Notice, that these three types of determinism are independent of each other. 124 AKU VISALA let us say our brain states plus psychological laws, we are still free and morally responsible. Of course, some causes remove moral responsibility - let us say external coercion or some other external constraint - but other causes do not. These causes are usually understood to involve the subject 's own reasons and desires for acting. Furthermore, the compatibilist has to deny that for S 's action A to be free, S had a power to do action B instead of A. In other words, S's action A can be considered free even when S could not have done otherwise. This is why the compatibilist thinks that freedom and determinism are compatible. Equally roughly, a libertarian argues that for S to be free and m orally responsible for performing action A is incompatible with action A being ultimately caused by factors outside S 's control. In other words, in order to be free and responsible for A, S has to be in some sense control of the factors that ultimately cau se A. Thus, most libertarians affirm that free actions are indeed caused, but those causes are such that they themselves are under the control of the agent. A libertarian would say that although my reasons for acting cause my actions in some particular sit uation, I could reflect and change my beliefs that constitute my reasons for actin g. Further, a libertarian insists that free actions require the power to do otherwise. If determinism of any kind is true, then S could have not done otherwise. Since freedom requires the power to do otherwise and determinism entails that S cannot do otherwise, determinism is incompatible with freedom. 2. THEOLOGICAL REASONS FOR COMPATIBILISM Sarot seems to think that libertarianism is required to make sense of the core Christian conviction that human beings are free. What I find surprising, however, is how easily Sarot rejects the theological case for compatibilism. I think the theological case for compatibilist free will is rather strong. Compatibilism (or something lik e it) is, after all, a venerable Christian tradition. Theologians, such as Augustine, Luther, Aquinas and Calvin are much closer to compatibilism than libertarianism. One reason for this is that all these thinkers are theological determinists of some kind or another. Further, embracing compatibilism would solve many problems that have to do with providence, predestination and God 's foreknowledge. In what follows, I will briefly discuss two topics: first, I will give some reasons to think that traditional Au gustinian -Lutheran views of providence, grace and sin suggest compatibilism (or at least do not require libertarianism); THEISM , COMPATIBILISM AND N EURODETERMINISM : A RESPONSE TO MARCEL SAROT 125 second, I will present a few arguments against Open Theism and its view about God 's foreknowledge and providence. 2.1. PROVIDENCE , GRACE AND PREDESTINATION I was surprised by Sarot 's claim that neither providence nor predestination present problems to libertarian free will. With respect to predestination, he does not even give an argument for his conclusion. Contrary to this, it seems to me that classical ideas of providence and the justification by grace strongly suggest, a compatibilist notion of free will.3 Since I have little space, let me just talk about Luther here. I am no Luther -scholar so permit me to simply quote one: Luther as serted God 's complete freedom and complete control of his creation, his total responsibility for all that happens within it. God has predestined and provides for all his creatures according to his decisions, conditioned by nothing else. Nothing impedes or impairs the power of his will to make happen what he has decided. Preparing to treat human creatures as totally responsible within the sphere God gives them, Luther did not flinch before the logical necessity of the Almighty Creator 's being totally respons ible for all things. Luther was determined to hold these two total responsibilities in tension and not harmonize or homogenize them, as had his teachers. Therefore, he rejected their finely honed logical distinctions framing God 's almighty power with the maneuvering room of contingency, which permitted human freedom. God 's 'immutable, eternal, and infallible will' foresees, plans, and enacts all things that ensue in the course of creation. His foreknowledge is creative and determinative, not passively obser ving human actions and decisions but governing and affecting their thoughts and actions.4 For Luther, it seems that the causal influence of God necessitates human action and thinking so as to remove the power to do otherwise, but he still maintain that hum ans are free in the space that God has given them. Recall that libertarian free will entails the power to do otherwise. For Luther, such a power seems impossible: God determines everything, including our wills. Since Luther nevertheless maintains that huma ns are morally responsible, his freedom is surely of the compatibilist kind. 3 Such a case is made more comprehensively in Lynne Rudder Baker, ' Why Christians Should not Be Liberta rians: An Augustinian Challenge ,' Faith and Philosophy 20 (2003), 460 -478. See a lso the response, Kevin Timpe, ' Why Christians Might Be Libertarians: A Response to Lynne Rudder Baker ,' Philosophia Christi 6 (2004), 279 -288. 4 Robert Kolb, Martin Luther: Confessor of Faith (Oxford 2009), chapter 6. 126 AKU VISALA We can put the problem in the form of a brief argument. Let us imagine that God's providential plan for the world entails that I become a good person. God being omnipotent and be ing in full providential control I cannot choose to act against God 's plan. Thus, given that libertarian freedom requires the power to do otherwise, I am not free regarding whether I will become a good person or a bad person. Further, I am neither morally responsible nor praiseworthy when I finally become a good person. So, I think that there is a dilemma here for the libertarian. Either (1) the libertarian has to give up the notion that freedom requires the power to do otherwise and become a compatibilist; (2) loosen God 's providential control of the creation, or (3) try to combine libertarian free will with God 's providential control in some roundabout way. Something is got to give here. Given what Sarot says about providence, I take it that he goes with ( 2), that is, loosening God 's providential control over creation. A similar dilemma emerges in the case of grace and salvation. Luther argued in his De Servo Arbitrio against Erasmus that if humans have libertarian free will, they could resist God 's provid ential plans and possibly reject or earn God 's grace. For Luther as for Augustine, earning God 's grace through human actions is a non -Biblical idea. God 's grace is a pure gift that requires nothing from the recipient. If it did so, it would not be a free g ift. Taking a strong stance on original sin, Luther argued that it is impossible for humans even to turn towards God without God first causing their will to act this way. So no previous act of will to turn towards God is even possible for sinful humans. Co ntrary to Luther, Erasmus insisted that although humans cannot by their own will save themselves, the human will can co -operate with God's grace in order to cause salvation. So, the dispute between Erasmus and Luther was between these two theses (among oth er things): 1. Luther: God 's unwarranted grace is both necessary and sufficient for salvation. No libertarian act of the will is needed. 2. Erasmus: God 's unwarranted grace is necessary but not sufficient for salvation. A libertarian act of the will is needed. Notice, that both of these views are orthodox, as I understand orthodoxy. Both rule out what I take to be the Pelagian position: THEISM , COMPATIBILISM AND N EURODETERMINISM : A RESPONSE TO MARCEL SAROT 127 1. Pelagius: God 's unwarranted grace is neither necessary nor sufficient for salvation. Libertarian actions are enough. Notice, that if (1) is correct and the power to do otherwise is required for freedom, then none of us is free or morally responsible for our salvation or the lack of it. The argument can be put, very roughly, like this. If I am predestined to heaven, there is nothing I can do to prevent this. I cannot choose not to go to heaven. Thus, my going to heaven or hell is not under my control, nor have I the power to choose otherwise. There is nothing we can do to change God 's plan to save (or not to save) us. This conclusion, it seems to me, entails the doctrine of double predestination and the rejecti on of libertarian free will. Again, the libertarian is faced with a dilemma here. They either need to go with Erasmus and concede that at least some libertarian acts are required for salvation or go with Luther and reject the idea that freedom requires the power to do otherwise and accept double predestination. 2.2. SOME PROBLEMS IN OPEN THEISM Sarot wisely distinguishes the issues of providence and predestination from the issue of God 's foreknowledge. Sarot wants to solve the problem of freedom and foreknowledge by adopting Open Theism. According to Open Theism, God is everlasting, not timeless, and has limited knowledge of the future, especially about future contingent events, such as free actions. God can, however, predict what is going to happen, but he cannot know it. For the Open Theist, this does not hinder God 's omniscience, because there are no truths to be known about future contingent events.5 Despite its relative popularity, Open Theism has various problems. Instead of developing them fully, I will simply mention a few. The first is, of course, that it is an innovation: the traditional view is that God is atemporal or eternal and has full knowledge an d providential control over the past, present and future. Further, on the Open Theist view, God would be subject to change and influence from the outside through our actions and the increase and decrease of His knowledge. God would also need to be complex for these reasons. For the classical theist, none of the above is acceptable. But going against the tradition might not be that bad, especially if you have good reasons for it. 5 For a sophisticated version of Open Theism, see, e.g., William Hasker, Providence, Evil and the Openness of God (London 2004). 128 AKU VISALA Second, on Open Theism, some of God 's beliefs could end up being false. Indeed, this is rather likely.6 God's beliefs about the future are based on the knowledge that He now has. God can know a lot about the future by predicting on the basis of His full knowledge of the present. This way God knows truths about what free beings are li kely to do in the future and what contingent events are likely to occur. But given that there is an infinite set of libertarian free actions that free beings could do in the future, it is likely that a small subset of God 's beliefs about what free beings d o in the future turn out to be false when the time comes. So it seems that the Open Theist has to accept that God has false beliefs. But this is problematic. First of all, it flies against the face of the tradition of omniscience. Second, the opponent of Open Theism is now free to argue that it is possible that a being exists who does not have false beliefs but is in all other ways similar to the God of Open Theism. Thus, the God of Open Theism would no longer be the most perfect being. Third, the claim th at propositions about future contingent events have no truth -values is contested among philosophers. The main reason for this is that if this is true, we can have no knowledge about future actions or contingent events. If there is no truth to be known abou t whether I will go to the bar tomorrow, I cannot now know whether I will go to the bar tomorrow. This is a high price to pay. However, the Open Theist might have a response here: William Hasker, for instance, has argued that propositions about future free actions do have truth -value, but the truth -value is in principle unknowable before the time of the action. This seems to me to be a more promising avenue for the Open Theist to take. Finally, Open Theism has problems with God 's providence. For the Open Theist, God is like a chess master playing against a novice. The master does not know what the novice is going to do, but he has a plan for every possible contingency. No matter what the novice does, the master can counter that and win. Now, the problem is that this is not certain. It is not metaphysically impossible for the novice to win against the master. In the case of the God of Open Theism, it is possible that His plans for saving me are thwarted because of the choices that other people make. This seem s very unlikely but it is not impossible. Although God can control events, the inherent contingency of the world can, in principle, prevent his plans coming into fruition. The Open 6 This argument was originally put forward by Alexander Pruss. See RESPONSE TO MARCEL SAROT 129 Theist s must acknowledge that their God is a risk-taker and that his plans are not necessarily realised. 3. PHILOSOPHICAL ISSUES WITH LIBERTARIANISM I have now given a few theological reasons for compatibilism and discussed some problems with libertarianism. In what follows, I will discuss a few philosophical issues that have to do with compatibilism and libertarianism. I do this because I think that S arot has neglected a few good philosophical arguments for compatibilism and also failed to discuss some of the central problems of libertarianism. As I said before, a decent theological case for compatibilist free will can be made. The question then is wh ether there are insurmountable philosophical barriers to overcome. Most contemporary philosophers do not seem to think so. Almost 60% of contemporary analytic philosophers accept compatibilism - the claim that determinism and freedom and moral responsibili ty are compatible.7 If some compatibilist position is workable, and I think that at least some of them are, this would clearly support the case for theistic compatibilism. 3.1. COMPATIBILISM AND TH E POWER TO DO OTHERWISE I think Sarot might not be challe nging the strongest forms of compat - ibilism. When he describes compatibilism, he presents it as a view according to which an action is free if it proceeds from a person 's desires and is not subject to external constraints. This is the view of classical com patibilism . He then claims that classical compatibilism is not enough for moral responsibility. But this is something that most contemporary compatibilists would agree with anyway, so it is not enough to refute compatibilism as a whole. So for the classic al compatibilist, we are free to the extent that we have the power to do what we want and are not constrained by external factors. Notice how this way of defining freedom says nothing about alternative futures or the origins of our desires. But there is a well-known problem with classical compatibilism: it cannot accommodate compulsive, deviant or artificially engineered desires and motivations. On the classical compatibilist 7 The PhilPapers Survey: http://philpapers.org/surveys/ . 130 AKU VISALA analysis, a person who has been genetically engineered to wanting to become a fighter pilot would come out being free when becoming one. He is acting according to his desires and is not subject to some external constraint. But the problem is that his desires are manufactured for that very purpose. Our intuition is very strong on this: t his person is not free when he decides and becomes a fighter pilot. To distinguish such cases from genuine freedom, contemporary compatibilist have adopted a more nuanced idea of hierarchically ordered desires. These new compatibilists insist that it is n ot enough for freedom to have the power to act on one 's desires; one also needs the power to reflect, evaluate and control one 's own reasons and desires for acting. This involves making a distinction between first -order and second -order desires. In the cas e of our fighter pilot, the compatibilist can now insist that he is not free. It is true that in becoming a fighter pilot he is acting according to his desires, but he is un able to reflect upon the reasons for his actions and he lacks the power to control and shape them on the basis of his reflection . In other words, his first-order desires are not in control of his second -order desires. Thus, he lacks rational self -control and so is not free. Notice that second -order desires and reflections can be causall y necessitated by antecedent factors, which means that such an account is compatible with determinism. On the basis of such analysis, the compatibilist is able to give an account of reason or desire -based actions - an account that does not entail that the person has the power to do otherwise. But for the libertarian, the power to do otherwise is necessary for freedom and responsibility. Surprisingly, Sarot claims that no good example of morally responsible action where the person lacks the power to do othe rwise has been presented. I think this is false. I think there are rather good arguments for the conclusion that the power to do otherwise - the principle of alternative possibilities - is not necessary for moral responsibility. A well know defender of compatibilism, Harry Frankfurt, has various examples, known as the Frankfurt examples that seek to establish this.8 Let me simply adopt one. Suppose that Dr Jones wants his patient Mr Smith to kill one of their mutual acquaintances, Mr Black. When Mr Smith comes to Dr. Jones for brain surgery, Dr Jones installs a microchip in the head of Mr Smith. This microchip can detect the neural correlates of Mr Smith 's decisions and direct them. Now, Dr Jones ' plan is to send instructions to Mr Smith 's 8 For discussion, see the essays in Part V of Kane, Oxford Handbook . THEISM , COMPATIBILISM AND N EURODETERMINISM : A RESPONSE TO MARCEL SAROT 131 microchip as to make him kill their acquaintance, Mr Black, when they next meet. But when they meet the next time, Mr Smith has himself decided to kill Mr Black. Dr Jones then does not need to exert control over Mr Smith via the microchip and is h appy when Smith kills Mr Black. Now, it is clear that Mr Smith does not have the power to do otherwise. He could not have decided not to kill Mr Black, because if he had tried, Dr Jones ' microchip would have overridden his decision. Does this mean that Mr Smith is not morally responsible for killing Mr Black? It seems to me that it does not: Mr Smith killed Mr Black in cold blood without any external or internal compulsion. Yet, he could not have done otherwise. If this is correct and the power to do otherw ise is not a necessary condition for moral responsibility and freedom, then the compatibilist is in the clear: he can say that an action is free when the action is caused by well -reflected desires and reasons of the subject. 3.2. LIBERTARIANISM , REASONS AND ARBITRARINESS In addition to not backing up his claim that the power to do otherwise is necessary for freedom, Sarot does not give an account of how reasons cause actions in the libertarian scheme. For the compatibilist, free actions are those that are determined by properly reflected reasons and desires. For Sarot, a libertarian free decision cannot be causally necessitated by anything. But is it not the case that reasons for action are causal factors in our actions and decisions? The compatibil ist can accuse the libertarian here as follows: if one 's action is not causally necessitated by well -reflected reasons, then the action is random or arbitrary; it has no reason whatsoever. Sarot says that libertarian actions are not arbitrary because they are actions of someone. But this is not enough to establish the conclusion that actions are not arbitrary. Arbitrary actions, it seems to me, are actions that are done by someone but without any reason. If an action is done without any reason, without any desire, it is hardly a free action, hardly an action at all. Sarot also says that non -arbitrary actions are explained by be the decision that the person makes. This is true, but, again, it is not enough to make the arbitrariness objection go away: we need a reason or an explanation for the decision that the person made. It is not the decision to act that removes randomness, but the fact that the de cision is grounded in reasons and desires. As I already pointed out, the compatibilist can make sense of reaso ns and desires causing actions, but it seems that if Sarot claims that all antecedent conditions that cause our actions make those actions less free, for him having 132 AKU VISALA reasons and desires for action actually take your freedom away. So if I have good reasons t o act in a certain way, I am not really free in a libertarian sense. Surely, this cannot be the case. Sarot could now respond in two ways. First, he could deny that reasons relate causally to our actions. Some libertarians do this and the result is called non-causal libertarianism . The problem here is that the non -causal libertarian has to account for reason -guided actions somehow without causation. Most philosophers think that this is extremely difficult and implausible. The arguments are in the literature, if anyone wants them.9 But I do not think that Sarot wants to go this way. He might want to take the second route, namely, to argue that reasons do c ausally contribute to actions but they do not necessitate them. In other words, our reasons do operate as causal factors in our actions but they do not determine our actions. Fair enough, but I can still insist that the causal influence that the decision has on the action apart from reasons and desires is random. It must be, since Sarot has to insis t that they do not ultimately cause the decision . Since he is an indeterminist, he must insist that there is a causal gap between whatever causes an action has and the decision to act. What the compatibilist can say here is whatever fills that gap is bound to be random and arbitrary. Imagine a world in which you are faced with a choice. You have been offered a job in, let us say, Princeton University. You consider the reason for going and not going. For the libertarian who insists that a power to do otherw ise is necessary, there must be one possible world in which you take the job and another in which you do not take it. But notice that these worlds are identical before the actual decision is made. In other words, at the moment of the decision you have acce ss to exactly the same reasons and deliberations and have exactly the same desires, but in one world you choose differently than in the other. If this were not the case, there would be no causal gap between the decision and the action would not be a free a ction, as the libertarian understands it. But, as I pointed out, it is extremely difficult to see what could fill that gap, since it cannot be any reason or desire or a deliberation that the person has. What we have here is a metaphysically brute, non -grou nded, non - caused decision. What I am trying to say here is that if we endorse causal indeterminism, we have difficulties in explaining how our actions can be anything else than random or arbitrary. Causally indeterministic actions are not determined by 9 See, again , essays in Kane , Oxford Handbook . THEISM , AND N EURODETERMINISM : A RESPONSE TO MARCEL SAROT 133 anything apart from some kind of ungrounded decision. Notice that the causal indeterminist cannot simply resort to reasons here: if he did, he would no longer be an indeterminist. The compatibilist has no such problems, since, for him, actions are determined by people 's desires and reasons for acting (among other things). 4. AVOIDING N EURODETERMINISM : ALTERNATE A CCOUNTS Finally, I want address the issue of neuroscience and determinism. Now, both Sarot and I agree that with respect to free will, there is a gap in science. The question is what kind of a gap this is. Sarot concludes that, as neuroscience currently stands, it does not explain morally relevant actions. Thus, there is no threat to libertarian free will. This, however, leaves open the possibility of the gap closing in the future. Sarot has given us no reason to think that neuroscience is unable to explain morally relevant actions and threaten free will in the future. In other words, some day a genius neuroscientist might come up with an experimenta l setting in which she could explain morally relevant actions. Sarot 's position would be stronger if he could give a reason why this is unlikely or impossible. But he thinks that the issues surrounding free will and determinism might be, at least to some e xtent, empirically tractable. I, on the contrary, think that there are some reasonably good arguments against such a conclusion. To be more specific, I think that there are some reasons to think that the issue of free will and determinism is not a scientific issue at all and that any amount of experimental data will not solve it. The first reason has to do with what the sciences of the mind are actually like and the second with the nature of freedom itself. But before I can get to these arguments, I will claim that the issue of neuroscientific determinism goes deeper than to Libet 's experiments. 4.1. NEURODETERMINISM : THE DEEP PROBLEM Sarot identifies Benjamin Libet 's studies as potentially problematic for libertarian free will. He then argues that they are only potentially problematic because they do not deal with morally relevant free actions. The problem, I think, goes much deeper than this. Not only are specific experiments in neuroscience problematic for libertarian free will, but also the whole thrust of the enterprise of neuroscience, if it is interpreted in a certain way. Libet 's views 134 AKU VISALA are only a symptom of a comprehensive view that many neuroscientists share. Here is one example by Colin Blakemore: The human brain is a machine, which alone ac counts for all our actions, our most private thoughts, our beliefs ... All our actions are products of the activity of our brain. It makes no sense (in scientific terms) to try to distinguish sharply between acts that result from conscious attention and thos e that result from our reflexes or are caused by disease or damage to the brain.10 The basic idea seems to be that there is a closed flow of physical events caused by other physical events in our brains. This is what neuroscience sees when it looks at the b rain. It follows that an active self or any other process of conscious decision -making cannot influence what goes on in the brain. We see no selves actively controlling neural circuitry, no acts of the will, nothing like that. The conscious choice seems to be a mere epiphenomenon instead of being causally efficacious. Since freedom requires something like conscious decisions or choices to be found by neuroscience in the brain, free will is an illusion. The problem can also be stated in a more philosophical way. Most contemporary neuroscientists and philosophers are physicalists . As physicalists, they believe that for all events there are sufficient physical causes (that is antecedent physical events governed by physical laws) for that event to occur. This t hesis is usually called the causal closure thesis . It entails that an ideal science, complete and true physics, can explain all mental events and actions that are supposedly caused by those events in terms of physical interactions and physical laws that ma ke no reference to any events or objects of mental kinds. If physicalism and the causal closure thesis are true, it seems that there can be no free will in the sense of the subject herself determining or causing her actions on the basis of her mental state s. Instead, antecedent physical events and the universally quantifiable neuroscientific / psychological laws necessitate the mental states and actions of the subject. 4.2. NEUROSCIENCE AND LAWS Now, the question is whether neuroscience can ever tell us that neurodeterminism is true. In other words, could neuroscience tell us that antecedent brain states and universally quantifiable neuroscientific / psychological laws determine all human actions? I, and many others, do not 10 Quoted in Raymond Tallis , Aping Mankind: Neuromania, Darwinitis 52. THEISM , COMPATIBILISM AND N EURODETERMINISM : A RESPONSE TO MARCEL SAROT 135 think so. This is because neuro science can never give us the kind of universally quantifiable l aws that neurodeterminism require s. In his book Laws, Mind and Free Will (2011) Steven Horst argues that the problems with free will have to with our ideas about neuroscientific / psychologic al laws. As we have already seen, when formulating the notion of determinism laws are understood 'strictly ' or universally quantifiable and exceptionless. Among several others, Horst has argued that at least neuroscientific / psychological laws are not lik e this at all. Instead these laws resemble ideal models that abstract away numerous causal factors and are highly context sensitive. Thus, one can embrace the truth of individual laws, or indeed any set of such laws, without any implication of determinism, because the idealization conditions of each law are essentially open -ended. ... Likewise, psychological laws, as idealized laws, do not claim to govern all possible behavior, but only extract a partial list of real invariants in psychodynamics. In no way ar e further lawful invariants or voluntary anomic spontaneity excluded.11 Psychological / neuroscientific laws are, thus, idealizations that abstract away 'from facts about other parts that may matter crucially in vivo in modulating the behaviour of the system we are studying .' In this sense, laws of psychology and neuroscience are far more complicated than physical laws that benefit from a very small number of physical forces and variables. Horst 's view of laws is based on his more general framework h e calls cognitive pluralism . According to cognitive pluralism, our representations of the world depend on our cognitive processes. Our models and representations indeed represent the world, or at least have realistic intent, but they are not simply reflect ions of how things are in the world. They are idealised representations of some highly specific parts of the world for a certain purpose and are entertained by some specific cognitive systems. This dependency of our models from our cognitive systems create s a situation that Horst calls pluralistic: we have numerous models in representing the world, but no unambiguous way to reduce them into one single 'super -model ' of the world that would allow us to explain everything. This plurality of non -reducible model s, Horst suggests, is not an immature state of science, but a permanent feature due to our cognitive limitations. Horst 's account of scientific and psychological laws leads to the conclusions that neuroscience can no longer be seen as producing laws that 11 Steven Horst , Laws, Mind and Free Will (Cambridge 2011), 9. 136 AKU VISALA force us to accept any kind neurodeterminism. The laws in neuroscience are not universally quantifiable, but instead highly context specific and have ceteris paribus clauses. 'The motivation for determinism must, thus, be found either in misunderstanding o f the laws we have received from the scientists or else in a commitment to some additional type of principle. '12 These additional principles are usually metaphysical in nature - the most common being the causal closure thesis that I just mentioned. 4.3. FREEDOM AS T RANSCENDENTAL Horst 's argument can be supported by arguments coming from other sources. For Horst, the necessary plurality of our models of human minds and behaviour entails that we cannot get from neuroscientific models to neurodeterminism. On e supporting line of argument could be that freedom is not the kind of phenomenon that neuroscience can say anything about anyway. Raymond Tallis and Roger Scruton, among many others, have argued that the concept of freedom is not really an empirical notio n, but rather a transcendental one. Freedom is, in this view, something that is beyond neuroscience. Both Tallis and Scruton argue that the issue of human freedom has to do with what human selves are and how intentionality , aboutness, works. Further, they argue that neurodeterministic interpretations of neuroscience threaten not only freedom, but all our mental concepts based on intentionality: selves, consc iousness, responsibility, duty, purpose and all such notions that are irreducibly teleological , or p urpose -driven. Teleological notions cannot be translated into the notions of science because science, in principle, rules them out. This does not mean that the phenomena they refer to are not real. Let us think of mental states as propositional attitudes towards certain propositions. Let us further say that propositions can be understood as representing some states of the world being such and such.13 When I am aware of, let us say, a hat in front of me, I have a certain propositional attitude towards it, na mely, the attitude of believing that there is a hat in front of me. On the one hand, there are all sorts of causal processes connecting the hat and my awareness of it - processes that neuroscientists study. These involve light rays hitting my eyes, them be ing converted into electric impulses and 12 Horst , Laws, Mind and Free Will , 139. 13 Here, we can leave aside the question whether all mental states are intentional in this sense. It is enough for the argument that there are some mental states that are. I myself tend to think that there are some mental states that do not exhibit th is kind of intentionality. THEISM , COMPATIBILISM AND N EURODETERMINISM : A RESPONSE TO MARCEL SAROT 137 processed in a certain way in my cerebral cortex. But this is not everything that is going on. According to Tallis, there is another process, intentionality, which reaches from the causal effect of the hat to the ca use, the hat itself. Not only does my perception consist of the hat causing certain things in me, there is my awareness of the hat as an object with certain properties that proceeds from me towards the hat. Without this 'reaching out ' of intentionality, th ere would be no awareness or aboutness that connects my propositional attitudes to the hat. Thus, with respect to persons and the way that they relate to themselves and their surroundings, there is always two -way traffic: causal influences from the objects of awareness to the experiencer that the sciences can track and intentional influence from the experiencer towards the object of awareness.14 According to Scruton, this intentionality makes it impossible to replace our everyday mental concepts with those of neuroscience. Our mental concepts do not provide us with causal explanations of our actions; rather they represent others and us in the light of rationality. Scruton writes: Our way of representing the Lebenswelt is not replaceable by th e theory that explains it. Our world is the world of appearances, ordered by concepts that are rooted in dialogue, and therefore in the first -person perspective. But that perspective will not feature in the data of any science.15 Our life world interpreted through intenti onal concepts is, thus, not understandable in causal, scientific terms: People can be conceptualized in two ways, as organisms and as agents. The first way employs the concept of 'human being ' (a natural kind); it divides our actions at the joints of expla nation, and derives our behavior from a biological science of man. The second way employs the concept of 'person ,' which is not a concept of a natural kind, but sui generis . Though this concept, and the associated notions of freedom, resp onsibility, reason for action, right, duty, justice, and so on, we gain the description under w hich a human being is seen, by those who respond to him or her as a person.16 Thus, for both Scruton and Tallis, the capacity for first -person awareness and intentionality allows us to see ourselves and other people from a non -scientific and non -causal point of view, from the point of view of reasons and freedom. In other words, hum ans are special because they acts as agents in a human 14 Tallis , Aping Mankind , 103-111. 15 Roger Scruton, th e Soul ,' J. Wentzel van Huyssteen & Erik Wiebe (ed. ), In Search of Self: Interdisciplinary Perspectives 2012), , Neurononsense , 345. 138 AKU VISALA world created and sustained by first -person awareness and sharing of that awareness through numerous social interactions and behaviours. Freedom, as Tallis and Scruton understan d it, is the human capa city to 'own' one's actions and take actions as representing what one is. Free actions are actions that can be made sense of in terms of a person 's reasons for action. Notice, that reasons for actions are irreducibly intentional: The countless events that are subsumed in reasons cannot be generated - requisitioned, orchestrated - by ordinary causation by processes of the kind that are described in neuroscience. ... Wishes, intentions and other propositional attitudes are not simply caused, nor simply causes. ... Actions are not - and could not be - caused in the narrow, atomic, linear sense implied in the term 'cause .' To see actions aright, we have to invoke the notion of a n explicit purpose, which pulls us towards goal, which w e have ourselves envisaged and articulated, and shapes the succession of action -components we undertake.17 And because of the peculiar aboutness of intentionality, reasons cannot be made sense in causal terms. Thus, all attempts to see human actions in purely causal, neuroscientific terms will fail: they remove the whole context of meaningful action and the agent 's reasons for acting thus losing the possibility to judge whether an action was a free action or not. Given their analysis of freedom, one need not be particularly bright to predict what Scruton and Tallis say about Libet 's experiments. Although their solution to the problems presented by Libet 's research is somewhat similar to Sarot 's, the difference is their insistence that intentional phenomena cannot be studied the way in which Libet set up his experiments. Scruton and Tallis argue that Libet 's experimental setting is na\u00efve and simplified because it attempts to address the issue of freedom by tracking the neural correlates of simple hand movements and removing their intenti onal context. This is to forget the immense network of decisions, goals and reasons that go into the whole situation in the lab itself: what is expected from the participants, what they think is going on, what they want by participating in those experiment s, and so on. Flexing one 's hands is not the goal of the participant 's action, rather the participant 's reason for flexing his hand is that he wants to do what Libet says, that is, respond accordingly to what he is asked to do. Thus, the fact that there is a physical -causal antecedent for the participant 's hand flexing before , Aping Mankind , 251. THEISM , EURODETERMINISM : A RESPONSE TO MARCEL SAROT 139 the conscious awareness of it, is neither here nor there as to the question whether that action was free or not.18 5. CONCLUDING REMARKS In this article, I have presented some theolo gical and philosophical reasons for Christian compatibilism. I have also argued that despite all the (pop) science fuzz, the nature of our freedom and what is required for it are outside the sciences. In this sense, I think, I am willing to go as far as sa ying that not only is it the case that current neuroscience does not eliminate libertarian free will, but it seems that it is not even possible for any conceivable theory of neuroscience to do this. What neuroscience can do, however, is to highlight the fa ct that some of our actions are driven by causal factors which we have not previously recognised and which we have no control over. Thus, neuroscience (as well as cognitive science and cognitive psychology) gives us a reason to reflect whether we are actua lly as free as we think we are. This might lead us to consider the theological and philosophical reasons for libertarianism and compatibilism. 18 For Tallis ' view on Libet, see Tallis , Aping IV: RELI GION, MORALITY AND B EING HUMAN WHAT ABOUT 'THY WILL BE DONE'? 142 143 8 Religion, Morality and Being Human: The Controversial Status of Human Dignity INGOLF U. DALFERTH Claremont Graduate University / University of Z\u00fcrich ABSTRACT 'Dignity' holds a controversial place in contemporary debates in ethics, pol i- cy, and studies in human personhood. Is 'dignity' a property predicated of something called 'human'? Is it something humans have by virtue of being human, or by virtue of existing as humans? Can it be damaged, or taken away? And does discussion of the term add any thing at all to our unde r- standing of how to treat other human beings, or is it a useless term? Here we see that when viewed from a Kantian and Christian perspective, 'dignity' is best understood as an orienting term which distinguishes not the or a basic set of features which separate humans from everything else, or some humans from some others, but rather an orientation which calls attention to the h u- mane vs. inhumane way of life to which we commit ourselves when we a s- cribe dignity to others and ourselves. From a Christian point of view, this humane way of life is a consequence of acknowledging the basic passivity of human life with respect to what is made possible in and for us through the gift of the love of God. KEYWORDS dignity, love, orientation, ethics, Kant, Nietzsche, elitism 144 INGOLF DALFERTH 1. A CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE In recent years human dignity has become a central and controversial i s- sue in legal, political, moral, philosophical, and theological debates. Some take human dignity to be the funda mental 'right to have rights' that unde r- pins all our other rights and duties, whether laid down in a written constit u- tion or not.1 Others dismiss it as a useless and harmful notion that adds not h- ing substant ive to the understanding of our rights but rather ob fuscates the ideas of human rights, freedom, justice, and equality.2 In de mocratic socie ties 'our rights are constrained by respect for the rights of others. My rights corr e- late with your duties; your rights correlate with my duties. So when rights are equal, ea ch person has duties in regard to the rights of others. '3 This correl a- tion of rights and duties among members of modern society is an important insight. But all we need to state and justify it are the ideas of freedom, justice, and equality , but not, howev er, the 'Reapprais al of an Ancient Legal Concept' such as human dignity.4 We can do without it; and we should. However, the history of human rights discourse in the 20th century tells a different story. Respect for human dignity is a central idea in The Universal Declara tion of Human Rights . It plays a foundational role in a growing nu m- ber of national constitutions, most notably in Article 1 (1) of the German Basic Law. It lies at the center of many contempo rary de bates in bio ethics, the et h- ics of w ar, or the ethics of care. It plays the key role 'in the emerging intern a- tional biomedical law.

RELIGION , MORALITY AND BEING HUMAN : THE CONTROVERSIAL S TATUS OF HUMAN D IGNITY 145 did not function centrally in the Christian tradition before the 20th century. But since the Second World War it has won growing public mo mentum by playing a major role in constitu tions and international legal declarati ons.7 This is where we must start if we want to understand the contemporary d e- bates about human dignity. W hat exact ly is the role it plays in those constit u- tional documents, and what does 'human dig nity' mean there? 2. A RIGHT TO DIGNITY VS . RIGHTS BASED ON DIGN ITY The answer is not easy. There is no clear legal definition of the term in any of these do cuments,8 and the way they refer to it is ambiguous. In the preamble of The Uni versal Declara tion of Human Rights the 'recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inali enable rights of all members of the human family' is called 'the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world. '9 Similarly Article 1 states: 'All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and con science and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood. '10 But then we are also told to make every effort to safe guard the inherent dignity of human beings a nd make it the funda mental right of rights, the right that grounds all others.11 Thus, on the one hand, dignity 'is what some of our rights are rights to,' on the other hand, 'dignity is also what grounds all of our rights. '12 Hu- man rights are said to, 'derive from the inher ent dignity of the human pe r- son,'13 but people are also held to have a right to be protect ed against 'degra d- ing treatment ' and 'outrages on personal dignity .'14 7 Cf. the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights (October 19, 2005) [http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php -URL_ID=31058&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html]. 8 Bartha Maria Knoppers, Human Dignity and Genetic H eritage: Study Paper (Law Reform Co m- mission of Canada, 1991) 2: 'Those provisions concerning human dignity have not been authoritatively interpreted or applied by any of the com petent, independent, international institutions.' 9 The Un i versal Declara tion of Hum an Rig hts , Preamble [http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml] (accessed September 7, 2012). 10 Ibid.

To quote a recent commentator: Defenders of natural rights would say that men are born free, B entham obser - ved, but then complain in the name of rights that so many of them were born into slavery. If challenged to justify their demands for liberty, they would cite human liberty as the ground of these demands. But liberty, which they were citing as an existent justification for rights, was also what they were deman d- ing, and because they thought they had to demand it, they were acknowled g- ing that men were not free. So what became of the alleged justification for their claim? 'Men ought to be free beca use they are free, even though they are not' - was that the claim? Such reasoning, which Bentham called 'absurd and miser a- ble nonsense,'16 seemed to veer between the incoherent and the tautological. And the dual usage of 'dignity' appears to partake of thi s logic ... As Bentham said (not specifically about dignity but in an analogous context): 'It is from b e- ginning to end so much flat assertion: it neither has anything to do with reason nor will endure the mention of it. It lays down as a fundamental and in violable principle whatever is in dispute.'17 But this dispute is spurious. It is perfectly possible to understand human dignity as a fundamental right (the right of rights) on which other rights are based witho ut falling into inconsistency, but whether one can or should claim that all other rights are based on dignity is a different matter. But rights can only function as rights if they are clearly de fined: Unclear formul a- tions and vague terms make an alleged right pointless. If we do not know what the sta tement of an alleged right means or involves, we cannot use it in legal practice or in deciding cases. However, the term 'dignity' or 'human dignity' is not defined in the legal documents cited nor does there seem to exist a canonical definition of the ter m in the law.18 15 Waldron, 'Dignity, Rank, and Rights ,' Bentham, Fallacies , in: Jeremy Waldron (ed.)

Its intrinsic meaning has been left to intuitive understanding, conditioned in large measure by cultural factors.' RELIGION , MORALITY AND BEING HUMAN : THE CONTROVERSIAL S TATUS OF HUMAN D IGNITY 147 3. HUMAN DIGNITY VS . THE DIGNITY OF HUMAN BEINGS This has been lamented as a highly problematic deficiency (especially by criminal law yers and judges who have to decide cases), or defended as an important feature of the functioning of the term in a constitutional context (especially by constitutional lawyers who look at the moral foundation and political role of constitutions in state an d society). The German Grundg e- setz,19 one of the first and most influential constitutions using the term 'h u- man dignity ,' states without much ado in Article 1 Paragraph 1: 'Human dign i- ty shall be inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of al l state authority .'20 The German version puts it even more categorically by using indicative language: 'Die Wurde or 'non - negotiable'] . To respect and protect it is the duty of all state authority. ' It is clear that the first sen tence states an absolute principle in a categorical way. However, we are not told what 'human dignity' means. There was conflict about this from the beginning. Carlo Schmid, one of the most influen tial mem bers of the Parliamentary Council that drafted the Constitution, insisted that the term 'should be defined .'21 Theo dor Heuss , on the other hand, the first president of the republic, defended the first sentence as a 'non-interpreted thesis .'22 The term, he insisted, should not be defined. He declared that 'Human dig nity must rest in itself. It must not be derived from any govern mental posi tion. '23 This opened the door to an ongoing dispute in German constitutional scholarship and jurisprud ence.24 In 1952 G\u00fcnter D\u00fcrig argued that (G\u00f6ttingen 2011). 20 I follow the official translation of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany published by the Bun destag in October 2010 (80201000.pdf). 21 He understood it to be 'a quality, an attribute that determines the human and that distinguis h- es humans from other creatures.' 22 Theodor Heuss in : Parlamentarischer Rat, war (ac- cessed February 15, 2012). 23 Heuss , Parlamentarischer Rat, vol. 5, 72 : 'No one in power should have the prerogative to d e- fine it. Definitions are ruled or governed by interests, and it is better to leave the term \"human dignity\" undefined than to tailor it to the interests of a government.' 24 Max Schreiter , dignity means: being a per sonality ,' and a person becomes a per sonality by affirming and s erving the basic values of being relat ed to the eternal 'you' of God, the 'you' of others, and the 'we' of the com munity.25 Ten years later, in 1964, Peter Badura criticized this interpretation because it did not see human beings as they are but as they s hould be according to the ideal of an auto - nomous per sonality.26 This had the unfortunate effect that one had to give reasons for somebody being an autonomous person in this sense in order to be a subject of dig nity, and this made it difficult for precise ly those who were most in need of it to claim the protection of Article 1 of the Basic Law (little children, the mentally disabled, people suffering from Alzheimer's disease, the unborn and the deceased). Badura therefore suggested what came to be Anwendung des Rechts,' 2004 Law: A Historical Perspective' (unpublished paper at Berlin, Wissenschaftskolleg, November 17, 2011). 26 Peter Badura , Juridische Zeitung (1964) , 336-344. RELIGION , MORALITY AND BEING HUMAN : THE CONTROVERSIAL S TATUS OF HUMAN D IGNITY 149 called \" the negative interpretation method\": One should concentrate on inj u- ries of human dignity and clear violations but not try to define it positively. It is easier to agree on what the principle of human dignity excludes and pro - hibits than on what it states o r defends. For to agree on violations of human dignity is possible even where we differ in our positive accounts of it. However, the debate is confused because it does not distinguish b e- tween two different readings of the term 'human dignity' (Wurde des Me n- schen). One is to take it to mean a complex property human dignity that can truly be predicated of everything that fulfills the conditions summarized in its definition: 'human dignity' = def. XYZ. The other is to construe it as refe r- ring to the dignity of human beings , i.e. to a particular aspect of human b e- ings called 'dignity .' In the first case we talk about a complex property (h u- man dignity), in the second case about a particular aspect or characteristic of human beings27 (the dignity of human beings). H owever, the property human dignity can be meaningfully defined whether or not there is somebody of whom it can truly be predicated, and so can dignity . But to speak affirmativ e- ly of the dignity of human beings is to assume that there are human beings who h ave dignity or to claim that if there are human beings, then they have dignity. The claim is not that they have human dignity : For every x, if x is a human being, then it has human dignity , but rather: For every x, if x is a h u- man being, then it has dignit y. The first sentence of Article 1 of the Basic Law is not about a property human dignity that is said to be inviolable. Rather it starts from the fact that there are human beings, it ascribes dignity to them, and it strictly prohibits any violation of it to any body, not only to the state. The dignity of human beings is non -negotiable for anyone in any situation and under any cir - cumstances. The point of this principle is not the mistaken claim that bearers of this dignity (i.e. persons) cannot be harmed (they can), nor the highly a m- biguous claim that a person's dignity cannot be violated whatever one may do to a person (even if human dignity cannot be violated directly or per se, it is violated indirectly by harming the bearers of it). However, the first sen- tence of the Basic Law does not speak of human beings (the bearers of dign i- ty) but of their dignity (an essential characteristic which they cannot lose). It 27 As I shall argue below, it is not a property in the sense of a defining characteristic of human beings but rath er an indicator of how we ought to relate to them, that is, how we ought to determine ourselves to behave towards human beings: in a way that is not in conflict with our common humanity. Because human beings qua human beings have dignity, we ought to deter mine ourselves to treat them (and us) with dignity. 150 INGOLF DALFERTH is not stated that only human beings have or can have dig nity.28 But the term 'dignity' is not d efined. It cannot be used to identify those to whom it is rightly applied but rather presupposes that those to whom it is applied are rightly identified as human beings - whatever this may mean. Human beings are bearers of a dig nity which is said to be in violable. Thus, in an important sense the principle is not about human dignity but about human beings who have dignity: What is at stake is not a property but the bearer of it. And the property human beings are said to have in an in violable way is not human dignity but dignity - the dignity that is characteristic of human beings as hu- man beings. 4. PREDICATE VS . DESIGNATION Thus, the descriptive phrase 'die Wurde des Menschen' (the dignity of the human being) must not be confused with the predicate phrase 'Me n- schenwurde' (human dig nity). The second is a predicate that can (in pri n- ciple) be defined by enumerating the features that together characterize the property human dignity ; and this property can be predicated of something (wrongly) or somebody (truly) in propositions such as 'Peter has human di g- nity' or 'There is an x and x posses ses human dignity .' The first, on the con - trary, is not a predicate but a condensed predication or proposition 'Human beings have dignity' or 'Human beings qua human be ings posse ss dignity' which cannot be predicated of some thing else because it is not a property but a proposition used as a designation29 to refer to those who are said to have this dignity: human beings.30 It is true to say that human beings have this 28 Kant used it not for human beings but for the moral law or morality: 'Morality, and humanity as capable of it, is that which alone has dignity.' I. Kant, The Metaphysics of Morals, ed. Andrea D i- em/David Lane (Walnut 20 08), 58. And Pope Benedikt XVI has used it recently not merely for human beings but for the earth when he spoke of 'the dignity of the earth .' 29 Cf. Bertrand Russell, 'On Denoting,' Mind 14 (1905) 479 -493; M. Devitt, Designation (New York 1981). 30 Whereas it is mean ingful but false to say 'Chimps possess human dignity' (i.e. that which we mean by the predi cate 'human dignity') because Chimps may possess dignity, but not human dignity, it is meaningless to say 'Chimps possess t hat which we mean by the propo sition 'Human be ings have dignity.' Human dignity is a property that can be predicated of someone, and so is dignity, but the dign i- ty of the human being is an ab breviated pro position used as a designation that cannot be predicated of something else. It does not re fer to a specific human dignity (that can only be ascribed to humans) but to a dignity (not necessarily only of human beings) ascribed to human beings; and it is stated that the truth that humans possess this di gnity is seen and accep ted as a principle that must never be vio lated by anybody. RELIGION , MORALITY AND BEING HUMAN : THE CONTROVERSIAL S TATUS OF HUMAN D IGNITY 151 dign ity, whatever may hap pen to them or what ever they may do. Hence, whatever we may do to other human beings or to ourselves must not conflict with the fact that we all posse ss this dignity - not because of what makes us different from other beings (being human) or from other human beings (b e- ing a particular human being) but by the sheer fact of existing as human be - ings. But what exactly does this mean? Are we said to have this dignity b e- cause we are human beings or because we exist as human beings? Is the as- cription of dignity tied to what or who we are (our essence31) or to the fact that we are (our existence)? In the first case even a mere ly possible human being would posses s dignity: To posse ss dignity would be ana lytically true of anybody who is huma n. In the second case the possession of dig nity would be contingent on actually existing as a human being: To posse ss dignity would be synthetic ally true only of those human beings who exist (have e x- isted or will exist). The latter understanding seems t o be closer to our actual practice. Exi s- tence seems to be an essential requirement for ascribing dignity to human beings. Someone who doesn't exist cannot claim a right to have rights. The claim is not that if x is a human being, then x posses ses dignity, but rather that if x is a human being and exists , then x posses ses dignity. The ascription of dignity does not depend on being human, but on existing as a human b e- ing.32 That is to say , the dignity of human beings is not a particular human dignity which the y have inso far as they are humans ('If x is a human being, then x has human dignity ') but rather the dignity they have insofar as they exist as humans ('If x is a human being and exists , then x has dignity ' or 'If x is a human being, then x has dig nity, if x exists'). It is not an analytic truth that humans have this dignity but a synthetic truth that if they exist, then they have it: their dignity comes with their exist ence, not with their essence. 31 I use the term in a broad sense to signify everything that provides a defensible answer to the question 'What are human beings?' 32 If we construe dignity as an essential property of human beings (i.e. as human dignity ) then it belongs to the set of determinations of what humans are so that it is impossible for anyone to be h u- man and not to possess human dignity - whether he or she exists or not. If, on the other hand, we c on- strue dignity not as a property of what humans are but of the fact that they are (if they are), then it is impossible for any human being to exist and not to have this dignity. Possible human beings do not possess any dig nity but at best possible digni ty: If they exist, then they have dignity, if they don't, then they don't. Actual beings, on the other hand, are not human beings because they possess human dign i- ty but rather they possess dignity (not human dignity) because they are human beings who exist . 152 INGOLF DALFERTH Merely possible human be ings have at best a possible d ignity. Only actual human beings, i.e. human be ings who exist, have dignity. 5. WHO WE ARE VS . THAT WE ARE This allows for a different way of distinguishing between human dignity and the dignity we have as human beings: If the dignity of human beings comes with their existence (the fact that they are), not with their essence (that which they are), then their dignity should not be construed as a nece s- sary property of their essence (human dignity) but as a contingent property of their existence (the dignit y of humans). This dignity (whatever it is) need not be restricted to humans (the dignity only of humans). Rather, the term 'human dig nity' - and this is a different reading from the one discussed above - may be an abbreviation of the human way or mode in which human beings have dig nity: They do not possess a special human dignity but they have the dignity they have in a special human way. The decisive point of this special way is that humans have this dignity not simply by being human but by being human b eings who exist. Dignity is not a feature of their humanity per se (their essence) but rather of their existence as human beings (their actual presence with others in situations of communication and interaction). That is to say, it is im possible for human beings to be and not posse ss this dignity but not because their being human analytically implies this property but be - cause it is impos sible for them to be and not to have this dignity. We do not need to know what this dignity involves, nor what exactly we mean by 'h u- man being ,' but we can say that human beings (whatever that may mean) have dignity (whatever that may mean) not because of who or what they are (human beings) but because of the fact that they are: 'For every x, if x is a human being, then i t has dignity if it exists .' 6. DENIALS OF HUMANITY , DENIALS OF EXISTENCE , AND DENIALS OF PERSO NHOOD If we start from here, then we must distinguish not merely between hu- man dignity and the dignity of humans but also between three ways of den y- ing the dignity of humans: de nials of their humanity, denials of their exi s- tence, and denials of their personhood. If we construe human dig nity as an essential property of human beings, then to be human is a necessary and su f- ficient con dition for having this property: To be human is to have human RELIGION , MORALITY AND BEING HUMAN : THE CONTROVERSIAL S TATUS OF HUMAN D IGNITY 153 dignity, and to deny it of some one is to deny that she or he is human. We may still see them as something inter esting or useful for us, but we would not treat them as humans, i.e. as one of us. On the other hand, if we construe dignity as a property tied to the existence of human beings, then to be human is neither necessary nor sufficient for having it: Other beings may have dign i- ty as well, and humans have it only if they exist (have existed or will exist). However , if they exist, then they exist as human persons , i.e. as beings who deserve to be treated in the same way as we and all other persons want to be treated. A person is a being that exists as a member of a community of pe r- sons, i.e. by communicating and int eracting with other persons as persons, and a human person is a being that lives his or her humanity in communica t- ing with and interacting with other human persons, i.e. as a member of the community of those with whom we interact as persons. Thus, to be a person is to put a demand on other persons to be treated as a person, and it involves a commitment, obligation, or duty to treat other persons as persons. We cannot see someone as a person and deny the demand on us to treat him or her as a person. And we c annot see ourselves as persons and deny the duty to relate to other persons as persons. We may fail to do so, but this failure is not merely a failure with respect to the other, but also with respect to ourselves: We fail to be true to who we are as person s. A denial of dignity is then not merely or always a denial of being human (at least not necessarily so) but a refusal to see someone as a human being that actually exists together with us or to refuse to relate to somebody as a person who lives as a pers on among us: It is not his or her humanity that is ignored but the fact that he or she exists as a member of our community of persons. We deny their existence and personhood, not necessarily that they are humans. Just as in the first case we do not take t hem to be humans but mistake them for something else, so in the second case we ig nore that they exist at all (existence) or that they are present to us as one of us (person): We treat them like the dead, i.e. someone who is no longer with us, or like fi c- tional characters, i.e. someone who was never with us, or like a thing or o b- ject that we use, but we do not relate to them as partners with whom we may or should or could communicate and interact as persons among persons. All these are ways of mistreating t he other. But it is one thing to be mi s- taken for something else (not a human being), another to be simply ignored (a non -existing entity) or to be excluded from the community of persons by being treated as an unperson or non -person. If we con strue violati ons of h u-154 INGOLF DALFERTH man dignity as an offense against the humanity of a person, then we treat him or her not as a human being: We de -humanize the other by ignoring his or her humanity. If we con strue violations of human dignity as a denial of the existence of a pers on, then we treat him or her as a non -existent entity, or as a non -person: We de -personalize the other by excluding him or her from the community of those who exist and with whom we communicate as persons. In the first case we act as if there were not a h uman being but only something else. I n the se cond we act as if there were nobody or nothing at all or no pe r- son with whom we would and ought to interact as a person. All these are i n- human e ways of relating to others: to deny what they are (their humanity) , to ignore that they are (their existence), or to disregard who they are (persons). All this is incompatible with the dignity of human beings. However, none of this can do away with the fact (if it is a fact) that the other is a human being, that he or sh e exists, and that he or she is present to us as a person. We may deny the one, ig nore the other, and disregard the third. We may behave in ways that flatly contradict them. But we cannot do away with them. 7. VIOLATING PERSONS VS . VIOLATING DIGNITY Is this the meaning of the first se ntence of the German Basic Law ' The dignity of the human be ing is inviolable' ? Hardly. It is true: Nobody ceases to be human by being treated in inhuman e ways or by living under inhumane conditions. Human beings do not stop being human by being treated in ways that contradict their dignity or by being forced to live under con ditions that are in humane. But these ways and conditions are incompat ible with their irrevoc able dignity as human persons. A state that prides itself on serving and protecting the welfare of its citizens cannot put up with this. Thus, although the first sentence in German uses the gram matical indi c- ative, i.e. is rather than shall , it states a norm, not merely a fact - or perhaps one could say: it sta tes a norm with respect to human beings and a fact with respect to their dignity: You can violate the first (human beings) but not the second (their dignity), yet you ought not to violate the first because of the second. Dignity is indeed not so mething th at can be 'touched;' only things, bodies, animals or human be ings can. A nd where as you can touch a human being, you cannot, at least not in the same sense, touch his or her dignity. But this is not to say that Article 1 allows us to do what we want to human beings because their dignity will stay untouched. On the contrary, just be cause the RELIGION , MORALITY AND BEING HUMAN : THE CONTROVERSIAL S TATUS OF HUMAN D IGNITY 155 human bearers of dignity are vio lable, the principle of the inviolability of the dignity of human beings states that this shall not be the case: The human bearers o f dignity - not the bearers of human dignity - must not be touched in a way that conflicts with their dignity as human persons. The principle is not about human dignity (Menschenw\u00fcrde) but about the dignity human beings have in an irrevoc able way if and i nsofar as they exist as persons among pe r- sons (W\u00fcr de des Men schen ), and their dignity defines the scope and limit of what is accept able, or not acceptable, in our dealings with human beings. Just because human be ings are violable, and in deed are viola ted often to a shoc k- ing de gree, the principle states that everybody must respect the dignity of human beings in dealing with them. N ot only must the state do so, but also each individual must respect the dignity not only of others but also of him - or hers elf. Therefore, the German constitution commits the German people ax i- omatically to the absolute principle of not violating the dignity of human b e- ings, i.e. of not treating human bearers of dignity in ways that are incompat i- ble with their dignity as human persons. This implies negative ly not to allow, or put up with, any violation of those who are human bearers of dignity that conflicts with their dignity as human persons. And it implies posi tively to do everything to create conditions for humans to live their lives among and t o- gether with others as bearers of this dignity. This is clear from the second para graph of Article 1: 'The German people therefore acknowledge inviolable and in alien able human rights as the basis of every community, of peace and of justice in the world .' The dignity of human beings is not the same as h u- man rights. But as the 'there fore' indi cates, human rights are guaran teed b e- cause of the dignity of human beings, and they are necessary to pro tect h u- man beings against violati ons that conflict with and are contrary to their di g- nity. The right to have rights is restric ted to human bearers of this dignity, i.e. to human persons. Human beings who exist cannot lose their dig nity even when they are treated in inhumane ways. Since they cannot lose it as long as they live, and even be yond (because if they have been persons, it will always be true that they have been persons), they will always be bearers of the funda mental human rights that unfold the nor mative content and point of their dignity. This dignity is said to be in violable just because its bear ers can be, and often are, violated. 156 INGOLF DALFERTH In this sense the first sentence of Article 1 states an absolute principle not to be violated by anybody. To torture anybody is strictly pro hibited, even if it may help to save the lives of many. Torture of whatever sort harms not merely the body but contradicts the dignity of a per son. The same principle has been invoked in decisions of the German Federal Consti tutional Court against life i mprisonment without the possibility of parole, the shooting down of aircrafts that are used as weapons by terrorists, abortion of embryos, peep shows where the performer cannot see those who are watching , or ho r- ror movies and video games such as the Mortal Kombat series. Actions of this sort are strictly forbidden not only to the state but to anyone. The second sentence ad dresses the state explicitly and states two public duties that re quire action: The state has to respect the dignity of human pe r- sons, i.e. has to design the entire legal sys tem in a manner that does not co n- flict with the dignity of persons. And it also has to protect this dignity, i.e. has to take appropriate measures if other people or poor living con ditions enda n- ger or under mine the dignity of persons. Whereas the prohibit ion of viola - tions of the dignity of human persons in the first sentence of Paragraph 1 A r- ticle 1 is strict and without exception, the state duties mentioned in the second sentence are such that they require consid eration of all interests a f- fected, all parties concerned, and even of political prefer ences. Here balan c- ing is not merely a possibility but a duty, whereas all balancing of prin ciples is excluded in the first sentence.33 The dignity of human persons is not some - thing that can be relativized in any way. It is not a relative but an absolute value. 8. VALUE VS . DIGNITY But is it? If it is a value it cannot be absolute because all value or worth (Wert ) is the po lar opposite of worthlessness or non -value (Unwert ) and thus can come by degrees: it has more or less value as its price indicates. But this is not so with dignity as Kant em phasized: In the kingdom of ends everything has either value or dignity. Whatever has a value can be replaced by something e lse which is equivalent; whatever, on the other hand, is above all value, and therefore admits of no equivalent, has a dig - nity. 33 Cf. RELIGION MORALITY AND BEING HUMAN : THE CONTROVERSIAL S TATUS OF HUMAN D IGNITY 157 Whatever has reference to the general inclinations and wants of man kind has a market value; whatever, without presupposing a want, corresponds to a certain taste, that is to a satisfaction in the mere purposeless play of our faculties, has a fancy value; but that which constitutes the condition under which alone an y- thing can be an end in itself, this has not merely a relative wo rth, i.e., value, but an intrinsic worth, that is, dignity. Now morality is the condition under which alone a rational being can be an end in himself, since by this alone is it possible that he should be a legislating member in the kingdom of ends. Thus morality, and humanity as capable of it, is that which alone has dignity... This estimation therefore shows that the worth of such a dispo sition is dignity, and places it infinitely above all value, with which it cannot for a mo ment be brought into compari son or competition without as it were violating its sanctity .34 Dignity is here explicitly contrasted to and distinguished from all value discourse. Some thing may be more or less valuable, and no value can be ab - solute because it is always positioned on a scale between 0 and 1. Values are necessarily relative because the value of something depends on comparison and a particular judgment of that thing. Not so with dignity. Dignity is abs o- lute, its ascription is not based on comparison, and it does not come b y de- grees. Either one has it, or one doesn't, and if one has it, one has it in exactly the same way and to the same extent as everybody else who has it. Dignity is not a relative value but an absolute, exclusive and complete distinction: If any human being has it, every human being has it. But human beings have it not because of any empirical trait or biological characteristic but only in so far as they are moral beings, i.e. capable of autonomy - of determining their own will (i.e. themselves) in dependent of any actual context according to the maxim of the good will. For to be autonomous in the Kantian sense is not merely to be able to choose between available options or courses of action in terms of what is more pleasant, or more useful, or more conduc ive to a grea t- er happiness of many. Rather it is to be able to determine oneself to will only that which is willed by anybody who determines herself or himself to will only that which is willed by any body who determines herself or himself to will only that w hich ... - in short, to be one who wills nothing that cannot be willed by anyone who puts not his own interests but the requirements of our 34 I. Kant, The Metaphysics of Morals, ed. Andrea Diem/David Lane (Walnut 2 o08), 57-8.; cf. I. Kant, Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, ed. and trans. by Mary Gregor (Cam bridge 1996), 42 - 43. 158 INGOLF DALFERTH common humanity first. Kantian autonomy does not hinge on the capacity for deciding or choosing between options - this is something we find in one way or other everywhere among living beings. Nor is it to be identified with the specifically human capacity for rational decision, that is, for deciding b e- tween options motivated by reasons and not merely by desires, interests , or conventions - this distinguishes humans from other beings only by degree. Rather, it hinges on the moral capacity for deciding how to decide, or willing how to will, or choosing how to choose, in terms of the good , that is, by orien ting the way one de cides how to decide to the (morally) good , which is not defined by the individual interests of those who choose but which is the same for everyone. I am autonomous not because I can choose between o p- tions for reasons but because I can choose how to choose and determine the how of my choosing by orienting it to the good which is universally valid for everyone (the moral law). In choosing how to choose I am not determined by the actual options at hand, or by what I think or perceive to be the options in a giv en situation, or by reasons that appeal to some end that I desire. Rather, I can determine my way of choosing how to choose independently of the co n- tingent (causal) actualities of a given situation and subjective interests in a situation by orienting it to the (morally) good. For the morally good does not vary with different situations or subjective interests but is the same, and m o- tivates per se in the same way, in all possible situations of human choosing, deciding, and acting.35 9. THE DIGNITY OF MORALITY Therefore - and this is perhaps the most important point which Kant makes about dignity - dignity is not ascribed to human beings qua rational animals , at least not primarily and directly, but to moral ity, and through m o- rality to humanity : 'moral ity, and humanity as capable of it, is that which alone has dignity. ' Morality has dignity in an absolute sense: There is not m o- rality without dignity, and no dignity that is not tied to morality. Humanity, on the other hand, has dignity in a relative sens e in so far as it is capable of being informed by morality: Humanity, i.e. that which characterizes human beings and distinguishes them from all other beings, can be viewed and th e- matized in many different ways: from empirical, biological, psychological, 35 There is nothing in the much -discussed Libet experiments that comes close to the complexity of Kantian autonomy or could be construed as an objection to it. RELIGION , MORALITY AND BEING HUMAN : THE CONTROVERSIAL S TATUS OF HUMAN D IGNITY 159 sociological, historical, philosophical or theological perspectives. But only if we regard humanity from a moral perspective as something capable of mora l- ity can we ascribe dignity to it. Morality has dignity under any description, humanity only when viewed from a moral perspective. For Kant this is not the only perspective for understanding human b e- ings but it is an indispensible one if we really want to be true to the way we experience our lives and ourselves. From the moral perspective, to be human is to be capable of orienting one's life to the good, that is to say, to be able to live in a morally good or morally evil way. However, we are not merely cap a- ble of living a moral life but we cannot avoid doing so: A morally neutral life is not one of our optio ns. As human beings it is possible for us to choose b e- tween good and evil (we can determine our willing or choosing by orienting it to the good, or by not doing so) but we also must do so and hence always in fact do: It is not possible for us not to choose between good and evil. If we can choose, we must choose, and there is nobody, as Kant elaborates in his doctrine of radical evil, who will not have to admit upon careful examination that he or she has in fact chosen not to live in a morally good but rathe r in a morally evil way. Without going into detail, we may summarize Kant's account of human personhood as follows: Human beings are persons . As persons they are moral beings capable of orienting their willing how to will to the good, or of not doing so, and as human persons they are not capable of not orienting their willing in either of these two ways: It is impossible for humans to live in a morally ne utral way. To be human is to be capable of morality: It is imposs i- ble to be human and not to be able to live a moral life. And to be a human person is necessarily to actualize this capability: It is impossible to live as a human person and not to live in e ither a morally good or a morally evil way. As it happens, all of us in fact actualize our human capacity for morality in a way that misses the possibility of the good. We all live in fact by not orienting our lives to the good, or to the good only, or pri marily to the good. We all live in fact in a way that is morally problematic, far from perfect, or outright evil. 10. THE DIGNITY OF BEING CAPABLE OF MORALITY However, this does not infringe on our dignity. We do not possess dign i- ty because we live a morally good life but because we have the potential and capacity to do so. The capability of morality, not the actuality of a morally 160 INGOLF DALFERTH good life is Kant's basis for ascribing unrestricted dignity to human persons. The ascription of dign ity is not restricted to those who live a morally good life, or denied to those who live in a morally evil way. It is tied to our capacity to live morally, and since every human person necessarily actualizes this c a- pacity in a positive or negative way, the re is no human being who cannot rightly be viewed and judged from a moral perspective. Thus, Kant's account of dignity has two important implications. First, since dig nity is ascribed to human beings in terms of the moral capacity of our common humanity, it does not allow us to distinguish between human beings or to classify human beings into groups, sets or classes of those who have or don't have dignity: Dig nity is not a concept that defines a class of human beings but a general feature of human beings as such. Human beings qua human beings have dignity, i.e. the right to be tr eated with dignity by everybody because every human being is capable of morality and in fact lives a morally good or evil life. Recourse to dignity does not allow us to draw a distinction between different sorts, groups, ranks, or clas ses of human beings (one group of humans vs. another group of humans) but only to distinguish humans from non-human beings in terms of the capacity for morality that humans share with all other moral beings. However, and this is the second point, dignity is not a property that t o- gether with others defines our common humanity. Whatever we take to be the essence of humanity, i.e. the set of properties that together constitutes our common humanity, it w ill not include dig nity but only our capacity for morality . This capacity is the basis for ascribing dignity to us, but dignity is not identical with it. Dignity is not a defining feature of humanity but rather humanity is capable of ma nifest ing moralit y that alone has dignity. It does so because we cannot enact our humanity concretely without in fact living in a moral way, whether good or evil. However, our dignity does not depend on how we live in fact, but on the fact that we can live in a morally good or evil way and cannot live without in fact living in the one way or the other. Since we can orient our lives to the morally good we ought to do so, but even if we fail to do so and miss our end as moral beings we still have dignity because, as humans, we are capable of morality. Whereas morality has dignity, we pa r- take in it by living a morally good or a morally evil life. As humans we can do this because we, and we alone among all living a nimals, are capable of mora l- ity and thus can live in a humane (morally good) or inhumane (morally evil) way. We are moral ends in ourselves, and this is true of us even if we fail to live in a humane way. The dignity of humans as moral beings is that they are RELIGION , MORALITY AND BEING HUMAN : THE CONTROVERSIAL S TATUS OF HUMAN D IGNITY 161 faced with the challenge and tas k of existing as persons, that is, not merely as means to an end but as moral ends in themselves. Kant makes the point e x- plicitly: 'Now I say that the human being and in general every rational being exists not merely as a means to be used by this or that w ill at its discretion; instead he must in all his actions always be regarded at the same time as an end.'36 In short, d ignity is not a feat ure of what we are (human s) but of the way in which we live as human beings who can and must determine ourselves mora lly (moral beings or persons ). Not our actual moral self -determination (how we in fact orient our lives) but the possibility and necessity of such a determination is decisive for our dignity: As finite moral beings (human pe r- sons) we are capable of orienti ng our lives to the good or of not doing so, and at the same time we are not capable of not orienting our lives either to the good or not to the good. In this sense, dignity hinges not on our actual moral character but on the possibility of having a moral character (as human s) and on the impossibility of not actually having a positive or negative moral ch a- racter (as persons ). Here as elsewhere Kant puts the emphasis on our real possibility (we are capable of morality) and not on our concrete actuality as moral beings (we in fact live in a morally evil or in a morally good way). Thus for Kant , to be hu man is, from an empirical perspective, not to be a rational animal ( animal rationale ) but an animal capable of rationality ( animal rati - onabi le) and, from a moral perspective, not to be moral ly good or to be mora l- ly evil but to be capable of morality. Human beings manifest the dignity of morality by living as moral beings , ends in themselves, or persons . They may fail to live up to their full potential as pers ons in their actual way of living by not orienting themselves to the good, and in one way or other we all in fact fail to do so. But this does not stop us from being persons who manifest the dignity of morality . If we can live in a morally good way, then w e ought to do so. And we know that we can precisely because the moral law tells us that we ought to ex ist in this way by orienting our life to the good . 36 Ibid. 79 ( Grundlegung 4, 429) Not human ity per se (i.e. that which makes us human beings) nor any other essential de termination (such as the one of rational beings) but only the inescapably moral way of existing or living our common humanity as persons among persons is the basis for ascrib - ing dignity to us: Dignity is true of us not because of our common humanity (essence) but only because we are able to live our common humanity in a moral way (mode of existence). 162 INGOLF DALFERTH 11. RATIONAL VS . ACCOUNTABLE BEING It is obvious that Kant does not argue within the parameters of the cla s- sical definition of the human being as rational animal (animal rationale ) or embodied rationality.37 He does not merely discriminate between our ani- mality , which we share as our genus proximum with other living beings, and our ratio nality , which i s the differ entia specifica that marks us off from other living be ings; nor does he merely discriminate from a reverse perspec tive b e- tween our ratio nality, which is the genus proximum that we share with all rational beings, and our animality, which is the differentia specifica that makes us embodied crea tures in the realm of ratio nal beings. Rather, Kant operates with a threefold distinction with respect to what we are between our biological (animali ty), rational (hu man ity) and moral dimensions (perso na- lity) which corresponds to his and reason (Vernunft): We not merely living beings (our 'predisposition to animali ty'), nor merely living and rational be - ings (our 'predisposi tion to humanity' ) but ratio nal and at the same time ac - count able beings (our 'predisposi tion to personality ').38 The traditional dual i- ty between our animal and rational natures is thus incorporated into a new duality between our phen omenal (animality and rationality) and noumenal side (accountability or per sona lity). We are individuals as or ganisms ( biolo g- ical animality) and rational agents (ration ality), but we are necessarily mem - bers of a moral society as persons (moral account ability). Persons are not pa r- ticulars of a shared commo nality or general nature (humanity or ratio nality) but singular beings in a society of singular moral beings.39 As living beings we belong to the system of nature or, more precisely, to the physical realm of animals. However, compared with other animals we are not excellent and outstanding but rather a weak, vul nerable and endangered kind of animal. On the scale of physical values we do not figure very high: 'Man in the system 37 Cf. I. U. Dalferth, Siebeck 2011). 38 I. Kant, Religion within the limits of reason alone , book 1. 39 This also enlarges and deepens the notion of human embodiment' (the metaphor is probl e- matic because it wrongly suggests that 'we' - whoever we may be - live in our bodies, that is, are di s- tinct from our bodies in such a way that our bodies are only the contingent temporal manifestation of our true eternal reality). But we are bodies, not merely in a biological sense but also, and in many co n- texts more importantly, in a social, cultural, moral, religious or political sense. To be part of a moral (religious, cultural, social, political, ecclesial) community is to be a body of a particular sort, and as human persons we cannot be who we are without being such a body. In this sense, we do not merely have a body but are bodies - in more than one respect. RELIGION , MORALITY AND BEING HUMAN : THE CONTROVERSIAL S TATUS OF HUMAN D IGNITY 163 of nature (homo phaeno menon, animal rationale) is a being of slight impo r- tance and shares with the rest of the animals, as offsprings of the earth, a common value (pretium vulgare ).'40 This is not much different when we turn to our much -praised rational i- ty. As rational agents we can set ends for our selves and rationally choose b e- tween opti ons because of our capacities of understanding and will. However, as such we are still part of the animal world and only relatively but not in principle different from other living beings. 'Although man has, in his reason, something more than they and can set his own ends, even this gives him only an extrinsic value in terms of his usefulness (preti um usus). This extrinsic value is the value of one man above another - that is, his price as a ware that can be exchanged for these other animals, as things. But, so conceived, man still has a lower value than the universal medium of exchange, the value of which can therefore be called pre -eminent (pretium eminens ).'41 Only in the third respect, i. e. as persons , we radically differ from other animals: 'But man regarded as a person - that is, as the subject of morally practical reason - is exalted above any price; for as such (homo noumenon) he is not to be valued as a mere means to the ends of other s or even to his own ends, but as an end in himself. He possesses, in other words, a dignity (an absolute inner worth) by which he ex acts respect for himself from all other rational beings in the world: he can measure himself with every other being of thi s kind and value himself on a footing of equali ty with them .'42 That is to say, persons are not just rational agents who can set ends for them selves. Humans are not merely rational de ciders and individual agents but per sons who are accountable to other s, i.e. who can be held responsible by others for what they do or fail to do or, even more importantly, how they do what they do and how they will what they will and do. As rational deciders and agents we can be compared with other animals or other humans accor d- ing to the degree of efficiency in which we achieve our ends. Humans are generally more efficient than most other animals, and some humans are more efficient than others. As persons, however, we cannot be compared with ot h- ers, whether animals or huma ns. With regard to personhood, we are not 'higher animals' than others (specie sism) and some of us do not rank 'higher' than others (elitism). Ac countability is not a matter of degree, and it is not 40 Kant, The Metaphysics of Morals , 186. 41 Kant, The Metaphysics of Morals , 186. 42 Kant, The Metaphysics of Morals , 186. 164 INGOLF DALFERTH ascribed on the basis of comparing our effectiveness as rational decid ers with that of other species (great apes, chimps, rats, dolphins) or other members of our own spe cies (the educated vs. the uneducated, the rich vs. the poor, those in power vs. those without power, the aristocrats vs. the herd -people). Its ascription is based on a simple and ab solute alternative: Are we able to live a moral life, or aren't we? We, and we alone among all living beings, have the capacity to do so , and since we can, we must because we cannot live in a m o- rally neutral way . For Kant, morality is not a system of values based on gut feelings but on our capacity for autonomy, i.e. our po tential to determine ourselves in dependently from any stimuli in our actual environ ment or state of our feelings by t he maxim of the good w ill alone; and this capacity is such that we cannot live without in fact exercising it by either living, or failing to live, a moral life. This potential for autonomy is the basis for the absolute respect we owe each other - a respect that does not depend on our rationality, physical strength, attractiveness, soci ability or anything else that comes in degrees, i.e. can be increased or decreased, but on the mere capacity to live as moral beings according to the practical law. We are not mere ly rational an imals (Verstandeswesen ) but persons (Vernunftwesen ). As such we are in trinsically related to a community of persons (rational spirits) who can hold us ac count - able for how we determine ourselves and live our lives, and who therefore owe us the same respe ct which we owe them. As Vernunft wesen we are not merely rational indivi duals but singular members of a moral society of pe r- sons or spirits. This moral society of free spirits does not coincide with an y- thing in the physical world of animal life or the rational world of human knowers , deciders, and agents. As rational beings we differ from other an i- mals only by degree. But as moral beings or persons we differ from them a b- solutely or qualitatively. 12. ELITIST VS . UNIVERSAL CONCEPTION S OF DIGNITY For Kant, dignity can only be predicated of moral beings, i.e. of beings capable of auto nomy, and no moral being , whether finite or infinite, can be excluded from hav ing it. Thus, with respect to humans the co ncept of dignity is intrinsically universal: If it is true of any person, then it is true of every pe r-RELIGION , MORALITY AND BEING HUMAN : THE CONTROVERSIAL S TATUS OF HUMAN D IGNITY 165 son. You cannot be a person and not have dignity.43 Moreover, dignity does not come in degrees: Either one has it or one doesn't. Either you are a person, or you are not. Dignity is an absolute, exclusive and complete distinction of persons. The concept of dignity does not allow us to draw di stinct ions b e- tween human beings or classify humans into groups, sets or classes (those who have dignity and those wh o don't). Kant's conception of dignity is stric t- ly universal . The contrary is true for Nietzsche. Following ancient elitist conceptions he sees an 'order of rank between man and man, '44 and a gap between those few human beings who have true worth (rulers) and the average human b e- ing (slaves). For him, dignity is not the highest human value shared by all human be ings. His understanding derives from the ancient notions of dig- nitas, auctoritas, maiestas or nobilitas . Dignity is not an in trinsic human va l- ue but rather an earned nobility. In the past one had it by being born into the right social class, and today one gets it by breaking away from the democratic egalitarianism of modern resentment driven herd culture through radical self-making, i.e. the willi ngness to stand in solitude over against the cor rupt moral majority of the many . 'Morality is the herd -instinct in the individual,'45 not that which distinguished persons from all other beings. 'We, \"the few and true ones \" want to become those we are - human beings who are new, unique, incomparable, who give themselves laws, who create themselves. '46 In short, dignity is not a universal charac ter-trait of human beings but rather an indicator of social class (nobility vs. herd cult ure) that is not applic able to everybody. It is easy to see how this can be found in religious and cultural traditions as well, espe cially where questions of religion and questions of national ide n- tity are so closely inter twined as in the Jewish tradition. As Susannah Heschel has pointed out, where human dignity is seen as a distinction or an honor of a particular group or nation (such as Isra el) or of a particular group of people within a nation (such as male Jews) it is used in fact as an elitist concept that is not applica ble to women and gentiles. 'In Judaism, as in most religious tr a- ditions ..., dignity, like religion itself, is not universal. '47 43 This is not r estricted to human persons but true of each and every person, whether human or other. 44 Friedrich Ni etzsche, Beyond Good and Evil. Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future , \u00a7 228. 45 Friedrich Ni etzsche, The Gay Science trans. Walter Kaufmann (Random House 1974), \u00a7 116. 46 Nietzsche, Gay Science , \u00a7 266. 47 Susanna Heschel, unpublished paper at Berlin, Wissenschaftskolleg, November 17 (2011), 1. 166 INGOLF DALFERTH This is Nietzsche's view, not Christian ity's - at least not in an ideal world. It is pre cisely because it can be (mis)understoo d in this elitist way that Protest ant theologians in the 19th century have shied away from using this category.48 'Image of God' was their term for expressing the universal chara c- teristic of human persons, whereas 'dignity' was used only, if at all, when a d- dressing a general non -Christian audience, as in Schleiermacher. Only against the backdrop of such an elitist conception of dignity does it make sense to say that 'claims that base human dignity on God and divine crea tion or imago Dei make human rights d erivative, rather than primary. '49 And only then does it makes sense to denounce dignity discourse as 'a religious fou n- dation clothed in se cular garb ,' by insist ing that 'What must be primary is the human being as such, peri od.'50 The point of mo dern dig nity discourse is pr e- cisely to make the human being prim ary - the very fact of being human and not the possession of a particular quality or the belonging to a partic ular rel i- gious, political, or social group, class or orientation. But then, what exactly is this universal distinction of human beings called dignity? 13. THE FAILURE OF THE FACTOR X APPROACH 1. In 2002 , Francis Fukuyama searched for that 'Factor X ' which makes us human, without which, he believes, human dignity can't have a foundation.51 In 'the political realm we are required to respect people equally on the basis of their possession of Factor X. '52 He is not satisfied with either the religious answer that all souls are equal before God,53 nor with Kant's answer that right is based on our capacity to make rational choices,54 (which isn't Kant's a n- swer) nor with the Darwinian position 'that species do not have essences ' as a species is merely a snapshot at the moment between what came before and what will come afterwards.55 Rather, he argues, 'Factor X cannot be reduced to the possession of moral choice, or reason, or language, or sociabi lity, or 48 Cf. Stephan Schaede, unpublished paper at Berlin, Wissenschaftskolleg, November 17 (2011). 49 Heschel, 7. 50 Ibid. 51 Francis Fukuyama, Our Posthuman Future : Consequences of the Biotech nology Revolution (New York 2002) , 149. 52 Fukuyama, Posthuman Future , 152. 53 Fukuyama, Posthuman Future , 150. 54 Fukuyama, Posthuman Future , 151 - which isn't Kant's answer as we have seen. 55 Fukuyama, Posthuman Future , 152. RELIGION , MORALITY AND BEING HUMAN : THE CONTROVERSIAL S TATUS OF HUMAN D IGNITY 167 sentience, or emoti ons, or consciousness, or any other quality that has been put forth as a ground for human dignity. It is all these qualities com ing t o- gether in a human whole that make up factor X. '56 It is not clear whether he uses the term 'human dignity' as a short formula of this com plex set of fe a- tures, or whether he understands the set of features to be the neces sary (and/or sufficient?) con dition for applying the term 'human dignity' to a be - ing. But it is clear, that for him there must be a set of features that mark off humans from other be ings if the ascription of dignity is to have a legitimate foundation. 2. A year later, in 2003, Ruth Macklin, professor of medical ethics at the Albert Einstein Col lege of Medicine in New York, argued that 'Dignity is a useless concept. It means no more than respect for persons or their auton o- my.'57 'Why, ' she asked, 'do so many articles and reports appeal to human dignity, as if it means some thing over and above respect for persons or for their autonomy? '58 And she concludes: 'Although the aetiology may remain a mystery, the diagnosis is clear. Dignity is a useless concept in medical ethics and can b e eliminated without any loss of content .'59 3. Another 5 years later, in 2008, the President's Council on Bioethics tried to put dignity on firmer conceptual ground in a 555 -page report, titled Human Dignity and Bio ethics . The report came under heavy fire , especially from the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science . Steven Pinker a t- tacked it in a paper on 'The Stupidity of Dignity ' as 'conserva tive bioethics' latest, most dangerous ploy. '60 'The problem is that \" dignity \" is a squishy, subjective notion, hardly up to the heavyweight moral demands assigned to it.'61 He criticizes that many of the 28 essays are written by 'vociferous adv o- cates of a central role for religion in morality and public life, '62 and that some 'align their argu ments with Jude o-Christian doctrine' which he finds shoc k- ing in a secular context.63 56 Fukuyama, Posthuman Future , 171. 57 Ruth Macklin, 'Dignity is a http://richarddawkins.net/articles/2567] (accessed Pinker, 'Stupidity 'Stupidity ,' 2-3. 168 INGOLF DALFERTH It comes as little surprise when Pinker concludes that 'the concept of dignity remains a mess. '64 For him, dignity has three features that undermine any possibility of using it as a foundation for bioethics. First, dignity is relative . One doesn't have to be a scientific or moral relativist to notice that ascriptions of dignity vary radically with the time, place, and b eholder. Second, dignity is fungible . The Council and Vatican treat dignity as a sac red value, never to be compromised. In fact, every one of us v o- luntarily and repeatedly relinquishes dignity for other goods in life. ... Third, dignity can be harmful . ... In deed, tota litarianism is often the imposition of a leader's conception of dignity on a popu lation, such as the identical uniforms in Maoist China or the burqas of the Tali ban ... So is dignity a useless co n- cept? Almost. The word does have an identi fiable sense, which gives it a claim, though a limited one, on our moral considera tion. Dignity is a phenomenon of human perception ... certain features in another human being trigger ascripti - ons of worth. These features include signs of com posure, cleanline ss, maturity, attract iveness, and control of the body. The per ception of dignity in turn elicits a response in the perceiver. Just as the smell of baking bread triggers a desire to eat it, and the sight of a baby's face triggers a desire to protect it , the appea r- ance of dignity triggers a desire to esteem and re spect the dignified person .65 Dignity is clearly seen here as a descriptive concept, and an elitist one. This explains why dignity is morally significant: We should not ig nore a phe - nome non that causes one person to respect the rights and interests of an other. But it also explains why dignity is relative, fungible, and often harmful. Dignity is skin -deep: it's the sizzle, not the steak; the cover, not the book. What ult i- mately matters is res pect for the person, not the perceptual signals that typica l- ly trigger it. Indeed, the gap between perception and reality makes us vulner a- ble to dig nity illusions. We may be impressed by signs of dignity without u n- derlying merit, as in the tin -pot dictato r, and fail to recognize merit in a person who has been stripped of the signs of dignity, such as a pauper or refugee .66 'Exactly what aspects of dignity should we respect?'67 Pinker gives two a n- swers, one posi tive, the other negative. For one thing, peopl e general ly want to be seen as dignified. Dignity is thus one of the interests of a person, alongside bodily integrity and personal prope r- ty, that other people are obligated to respect. We don't want anyone to stomp 64 Pinker, 'Stupidity ,' 5. 65 Pinker, ,' 6. 67 Pinker, 'Stupidity ,' 6. RELIGION , MORALITY AND BEING HUMAN : THE CONTROVERSIAL S TATUS OF HUMAN D IGNITY 169 on our toes; we don't want anyone to st eal our hubcaps; and we don't want anyone to open the bathroom door when we're sitting on the john ... There is a second reason to give dignity a measure of cautious respect. Reducti ons in di g- nity may harden the perceiver's heart and loosen his inhibition s against mis t- reating the person. When people are de graded and humiliated, such as Jews in Nazi Germa ny being forced to wear yellow arm bands or dissidents in the Cu l- tural Revoluti on being forced to wear grotesque haircuts and costumes, onlo o- kers find i t easier to despise them. ... Note, though, that all these cases involve coercion, so once again they are ruled out by autonomy and respect for pe r- sons. So, even when breaches of dignity lead to an identifiable harm, it's ult i- mately autonomy and respect fo r persons that gives us the grounds for co n- demning it.68 Thus, according to Steven Pinker, d ignity is a psychologically (or scie n- tifically) useless concept: everything we want to say can be expressed by a u- tonomy talk ; it is a category of religious fanatics ; and it is a phenomenon of human perception (what we conceive as 'dignified') that can bar us from se e- ing what is really important about persons. For all those reasons we should not continue dignity -discourse but rather decry this neocon servative idea a s a scientifically useless notion. 4. In 2010, Peter Augustine Lawle r, a member of the President's Council on Bioethics attacked by Pinker, replied in his Modern and American Dignity: Who We Are as Persons, and What That Means for our Future69 by drawing a sharp distinction between the 'mod ern' and the 'American' view of dignity. The 'modern ' view of dignity, as he calls it, de nies what's good about who we are by nature, understanding human dignity to mean moral autonomy (fre e- dom from nature ) or producti vity (asserting our mastery over nature by d e- vising ingenious transformations). This new understanding of dignity stands at odds with the 'American ' view, which depends on the self -evidence of the truth that we are all created equally unique and irreplacea ble. The American view, which is indebted to clas sical, Christian, and modern sources, unde r- stands that free persons are more than merely autonomous or productive beings \u2014or, for that matter, clever chimps. It sees what's good in our personal freedom and o ur technical mastery over nature, but only in balance with the rest of what makes us whole persons \u2014our dignified performance of our 'rela- tional ' duties as familial, political, and religious be ings. 68Pinker, 'Stupidity ,' 6-7. 69 Peter Augustine Lawler, Modern and American Dignity: W ho We Are as Persons, and what t hat Means for our Future (Wilmington: ISI Books: Intercollegiate Studies Institute 2010). 170 INGOLF DALFERTH The modern view, as Lawler calls it, is based on a proble matic method o- logical pre judice. It seems clear enough that human dignity must consist in what is unique about man as compared with other beings. That is to say, we must compare human beings with some thing else. Now, in a culture which has little or no c onception of the supernatur al, man cannot avoid comparing himself primarily with other visible beings (as opposed to in visible or spiritual beings) in determining where his uniqueness lies. Especially in a scientific culture, preoccupied as it is with natural studies and the alleviation of natural problems, it is not hard to see why many would reason ably conclude that what is unique about us humans is our ability to reflect on and alter our own nature. Animals cannot do this. You will never find even the noblest ape attempt ing to do things that it cannot do given its natural (or material) constituti on (to fly, for example, or to develop electronic means of communication), nor will an ape attempt to make itself something other than it is by nature. Ye t because of our unique abilities for i n- tellection and self -reflecti on, we humans do extend our abilities beyond what nature has equipped us to do (that is, our physical limitations), and we also dream of im proving ourselves in other ways, including ove rcoming our own mortality. Human persons, in other words, have a strong tendency to find their uniqueness precisely in their autonomy with respect to nature, including their own nature .70 Thus, for all his differences from Pinker, Lawler also agrees that di gnity is a descriptive notion whose ascription is to be based on comparison. Not, however, on the comparison with other animals but on the comparison with supernatural beings. Since our culture has lost touch with this tradition, we look for dignity where it cannot be found (in our freedom from nature) i n- stead of concentrating on what is good about who we are by nature. We need to be more Aristotelian and less modernist in our understanding of dig nity if we want to defend it against the attack and criticis m of empiricist and natur - alist philosophers. 14. DESCRIPTIVE VS . ORIENTING CONCEPTION S However, Lawler shares too much common ground with the views he repudiates. H e construes dignity as a descriptive concept based on com pari- son just as his op ponents do, and he criticizes his critics only for arguing 70 Jeffrey Mirus, 'Human Dignity? ' [http://www.catholicculture.org/commentary/otc.cfm?id=819]. RELIGION , MORALITY AND BEING HUMAN : THE CONTROVERSIAL S TATUS OF HUMAN D IGNITY 171 from a wrong natural ist comparison with ani mals instead of from a compar i- son with supernatural beings. But this ties the prob lem to the prob lematic distinction between naturalism and theism and forgoes the opportunity to benefit from the Kantian insight that is neither naturalistic nor theistic. For Kant, 'dignity' is not a descriptive but an orienting concept . What does this mean? Descriptive concepts can be predicated of subjects, defined, and used to classify phenomena into sets on the basis of particular features, traits, or ch a- racteristics. The traditional definiti on of 'human being' as 'rational animal' (animal ratio nale) is a case in point: It describes humans as animals, and it marks them off from other animals by their rationality as their distinguishing characteristic.71 Orienting concepts, on the other hand, cannot be defined because they have no se mantic ally fixed meaning but only a pragmatic use whose rules or grammar can be described. T hey provide a scheme of orientation in terms of a set of distinctions and a means of locating ourselves and others by using that scheme that allow us to orient ourselves and others in real or symbolic spa c- es. Thus, we use schemes of spatial distinctions (left/right; above/ below; in front/be hind etc.) to orient ourselves in space; or schemes of temporal di s- tinctions (past/present/ future; earlier/later than etc.) to orient ourselves in time; or schemes of communication (personal pronouns) to orient oursel ves in communicative contexts; or schemes of salutary distinctions (healthy/unhealthy; good/bad; medi cine/ poison; etc.) to orient ourselves in health situations; or schemes of emotional distinctions to orient ourselves situa tions (pleasant/unp leasant; moral distinctions (good/evil) to orient ourselves in moral co n- texts; or schemes of interpersonal behavior (dignity/value) to orient ourselves in the mode of relating to others. These schemes are diffe rent and each has its own internal logic. For example, the spatial distinction between left and right can only be applied from a neutral position that is neither left nor right, whereas the temporal distinctions between past, present, and future can only be applied by being places in the present and not in the past or the future. But for all these differences, they have a common set of pragmatic functions that can be summarized as follows: 1. These distinctions are not descriptive distinctions 'in the world' b ut orienting di stinc tions in how we relate to the world: There is no 'here' 71 Cf. or 'evil' in the world, but only with respect to us as we relate to the world around us in these ways. 2. These distinction s orient by not allowing for degrees or exceptions: If anything is present, past, or future in a given discourse, everything is present, past, or future. 3. These distinctions are only relevant, i.e. effective, by being used: Unless we orient ourselves in space in terms of left and right, there is no 'left' or 'right.' 4. One cannot use any one of these distinctions without using the whole scheme: No body can say 'I' or 'you' without being to say 'he,' 'she,' 'it,' 'we,' 'you' and 'they' as well. Take on e element of the scheme away and the whole scheme stops functi oning. 5. One cannot use these distinctions without at the same time applying them to oneself, i.e. to locate one self and others within the scheme: We cannot say 'you' without using (implicitly or in fact) 'I' or 'we' for us; and we cannot use 'dignity' for us without using it of others, and vice versa. Thus, whereas elitist conceptions of dignity are either rank - or hi e- rarchy -relative (as in Nietzsche or - in a different and more complex way - in Thomas) or description based, i.e. require a partic ular set of features to be instantiated by someone to whom they are applied legitimately, dig nity used in a Kantian sense is not a generalized description or universalized elitist conception (i.e. a n elitist conception with unrestricted scope) but an orien t- ing de vice for a particular practice of human life, i.e. the practice of relating to others in moral con texts, in com muni cation, and in other forms of social interaction. The basis for a legiti mate a scrip tion of dignity is not a ' Factor X ,' whether understood as a single feature or a complex set of features, but a practice of (moral) communication. We ascribe dignity to those with whom we communi cate as human beings: If they are human persons, we treat them with dignity. This we do not because of any partic ular feature or set of fe a- tures in them , but solely because we commit ourselves in principle to view and relate to anyone who is a human person in such a way that certain types of behavior a re not acceptable (negative notions of dignity) , whereas others are appropriate, desirable, required, or imperative (positive notions of dign i- ty). How we con ceptualize dignity changes over time and from culture to cu l- ture, but to use dignity as a basic de vice or idea for orienting our ways of r e-RELIGION , MORALITY AND BEING HUMAN : THE CONTROVERSIAL S TATUS OF HUMAN D IGNITY 173 lating to those who communicate with us in human interactions and practi c- es is or can be (relative ly) stable over time. What is important here is that practice comes first, not dignity. Without a humane prac tice of living together with other persons, there is no dig nity. We destroy or harm this practice if we ascribe dig nity only to us and not to others as well, or only to some humans, and not to all, or only sometimes, and not always, or not only to humans but also to other animals. Conversely, we further this practice if we commit ourselves to viewing and treating every human being, not merely family and friends but also strangers and enemies, as human persons with an untouchable dignity. In this sense, dignity is an orienting con cept of a particular human practice - the practice of living a humane rather than an in human e life together with others (before God - as Christians, Jews, or Moslems will add). The rule of dignity defines a practice that encompasses a ll human beings to whom we can or could relate in co m- municative interactions as persons, it comprises all dimensions of our lives from the biological and corporeal through the social and political to the mo r- al and religious,72 and it states that we commit o urselves to relate to other persons in the same way as we relate to our selves as persons. To be a human person is enough for sharing this dignity - not to be human in a partic ular way, or to be genetically close or very similar to humans. The ascription of dignity is not based on comparison, and it is not relative to or dependent on a set of features in a human being , but merely on the fact that we see and identify the other as a human person73 with whom we interact in a common practice with other human persons. 72 We are bodies not merely in a narrow biologi cal sense but in a rich and complex sense that comprises all dimensions of human life, biological and physical as well as social, cultural, economic, political, moral and religious. In all these dimensions we can suffer and be hurt, and in all these dime n- sions we can live in humane or inhumane ways by the way we and others orient our lives. 73 Pinker is right in understanding dignity as a phenomenon of human perception: how we see others and ourselves determines how we relate to others and ourselves. But he miscon strues this i n- sight in a narrowly empiricist way as an occasion that triggers certain ascriptions of worth instead of conceiving it as indicating a human practice based on an ethics of seeing as Arne Gr\u00f8n has developed DALFERTH 15. THREE DIMENSIONS OF D IGNITY DISCOURSE Thus, if we construe dignity discourse as orienting discourse, then the basic problem is not how to define dig nity (in a naturalistic or theistic, a modern or an American way) , but ra ther who is to count as a human person so that he or she is a potential partner of human dignity practice. For emp i- ricists this seems to be primarily a biological problem, but it is not. Throug h- out West ern history the character and identity of human beings has been ex - plored by drawing on three basic contrasts or comparisons: the biological contrast between humans and non -humans (humans vs. other animals); the theological contrast between humans and super -humans (humans vs. gods); and the anthropological con trast betwee n humans and humans (inhuman e vs. humane ways of living). Against the backdrop of these approaches three distinct sets of diffe r- ences have been used to determine the content and function of the concept of dignity. For many it 'seems clear enough that huma n dignity must consist in what is unique about man as compared with other beings. '74 However, this can be spelled out in naturalistic, theistic or anthropo logical terms. Naturalists understand dignity to be a relative distinction based on a set of biological features that can be found more or less clearly in (some) h u- mans and to some de gree also in (some) other great apes; and sometimes more clearly in apes than in humans. Dignity can legitimately be ascribed to those who manifest these features, whet her human or not. Theists, on the other hand, base their account of dignity on a comparison of humans with deities or the divine. Whereas humans are deficient with respect to perfect be ing, they are more perfect than any other non -divine beings because of their sense of the divine - a sense allegedly unique to them (sensus divinitatis).75 Anthropological accounts of dignity, finally, compare humans with other humans and under stand dignity as a distinct mode of living a human life - a mode that differ entiates between inhuman e und humane ways of living. The ascription of dignity here de pends on a conception of the good life 74 Mirus. 75 Cf. G.E. Lessing, 'Die Religion. Fragment Werke, 'Der Humans betwixt and bet ween the divine and non -human creatures and hence in a dangerous if not impossible and paradoxical position: too good to be merely a product of blind chance, as Lessin g put it, and not good enough to be divine or angelic. Thus, dignity is ascribed to all and only humans because and in sofar as they differ from all other creatures in possessing a sense of the divine. RELIGION , MORALITY AND BEING HUMAN : THE CONTROVERSIAL S TATUS OF HUMAN D IGNITY 175 that serves as the touchstone for judging the actual life of humans if they live up to this standard or fail to do so. Those, and only those, who live their lives in a humane way, however this may be defined, mani fest dign i- ty. Thus, whereas naturalistic accounts ascribe dignity to some humans and some other apes, theistic accounts ascribe it to all humans and only to humans, and anthrop ological accounts ascribe it to those humans who live their lives in a particular way. 16. DIGNITY AS A DISTINCT ION OF PERSONS In the anthropological sense, dignity is not a natural property or trait, nor a set of na tural properties or traits that can be identified in an organism (naturalism), but a moral ca tegory: It is a short formula for the human self - determination to treat other persons with the respect they deserve because of our common humanity. However, what is this common humanity? Answers differ widely. Biolo g- ical accounts ela borate the differences between humans and other animals. But this by itself will never be enough. It will always result in identifying merely gradual differences, and this is not enough for the absolute ascription of dignity because it misses the moral point and orient ing function of dignity discourse. In order to avoid the naturalistic fallacy of searching for a Factor X in Fukuya ma's sense, moral answers understand our being human not simply as a natural fact but a s a way of basing our lives on a normative decision about what we want to be and how we want to live as humans. We can live, or fail to live, our lives in a humane (as opposed to an inhuman e) way, and if we can, then we should. From a moral perspective the decisive feature of being human is not to be what one is , but rather to have the potential, the duty and the obligation to become what one can be as a human being by living a h u- mane rather than an inhuman e life. The religious answer goes beyond the moral answer by defining a h u- mane way of life in a specific way, i.e. by viewing, placing, or locating human life in relation to God. The the ological argument behind this can briefly be summarized as follows: We are all dif ferent, but as the different indiv iduals we are, we are all equal before the law. However, the set of those who are equal before the law comprises those, and only those, who are equal be fore 176 INGOLF DALFERTH God. Equality before God is the non -natural distinction we all share as pe r- sons, and this is the b asis for the ascription of dignity to us. Personhood and equality are not some thing that can be ascribed to humans on the basis of a comparison , but rather are presupposed in com paring humans with others. The logic of compar ing requires refer ence to a third in order to compare two: to compare A with B is to com pare A to B with respect to C. From a religious perspective, humans are equal with respect to the law because they are equal with respect to the presence of God; and they are equal with re spec t to God not because they chose to live in the presence of God but rather because God freely becomes their loving neighbor and in doing so opens the space and time for humans to live their lives in a humane way - or to fail to do so. That is to say, digni ty is not ascribed to us tout court but to us as pe r- sons , and not just in any sense of 'person' but in so far as we as persons m a- nifest or express the pres ence of God . As persons we are more than we appear to be: We are signs that point beyond ourselves t o the pres ence of the one without whom we would not be, and we can become signs that manifest the presence of God to others, not necessarily by intentionally trying to do so but rather, and normally, without knowing it, or learning about it only retrospe c- tively. To be able to signify God's presence to others is what distinguishes us from other beings. As persons we are personae of God's presence. Thus, to respect the dignity of persons is to respect the presence of God in the other and myself. This is more than the Kantian principle that human beings should never be treat ed merely as a means, but always as ends in them selves. It is to insist that we - each and every one of us - are more than we appear to be because we are personae dei , i.e. some body in and through whom God makes his presence manifest to others. Persons in this sense are not only the power ful and rich, as a misconceived doctrine of analogy might suggest, but even more so the poor and oppressed , those without rights and possession, th ose whom we don't like, even our enemies: They are all pote n- tial occasions of the manifestation of God's presence to us, and hence should be treated with the respect those deserve who are dig nified by God to b e- come occasions for manifesting his presence. That is to say, everybody, simply by being a human person, is dignified to become an occasion of manifesting God's presence to others. This is the Christian origin and foundation of the universalist idea of human dignity with respect to humans , which is b ased on a n elitist un derstand ing of dignity with respect to God : Dignity is first and foremost the dignity of God the cre - ator, maker of heaven and earth. God's dignity is transferred and extended to RELIGION , MORALITY AND BEING HUMAN : THE CONTROVERSIAL S TATUS OF HUMAN D IGNITY 177 the creature when and in so far as God makes them bear ers and revealers of his presence to others. It is a dignity in which creatures participate by recei v- ing it as a gift of God without ever possessing it. And since they do not po s- sess it, they cannot lose or be robbed of it. This is why the dignity of human persons is universal and untouchable, and yet they can be treated in ways that ignore and contradict it. Their dignity can be offended by treating them in inhuman e ways. But this offends the dignity of the source and origin of all dignity, i.e. the one w ho has chosen to make human beings his represent a- tives and to mani fest his presence to us in and through each and every h u- man person, not merely, as the elitist notion has it, through some of us but not others. 17. PROPERTY ESSENTIALISM VS. DYNAMIC PE RSONALISM The three basic contrasts for comparing human beings result in three different ap proach es to human dignity. The first concentrates on comparing humans and non -humans (animals) , and seeks to explicate dignity as an ind i- cator of biological excell ence. But this approach is a failure. Naturalism is no help in understanding dignity. The third concentrates on comparing humans with humans and sees the real difference at stake not in the biological difference between humans and other animals but rather in the anthropological difference between human e and inhuman e ways of living a human life. Dignity here indicates a mode of human living - a humane as distinct from an inhuman e mode of living. This is the proper locus of dignity discourse as developed in the 20th century. The central question then becomes what we mean by a 'humane way of living a human life .' Here the second approach as worked out in the Christian tradition offers t wo im portantly different answers. The first is property essentialism: Dignity is a pro perty that distinguishes humans (and angels) from other creatures or distinguishes a re ligious view of the world as creation (Pope Benedict XVI: 'dignity of the eart h') from secular views. Thus humans have dignity because they are rational beings or at least beings who have the potential of being rational beings. They are rational souls in a body, and whereas the latter signifies their commonality with other creatures , the former signifies their (analogical) com monality with their Creator. The problem of this approach is that it collapses two distinctions into one: the distinction between God and creature, and the distinction b e-178 INGOLF DALFERTH tween human and other creatures. Reason or rationality are taken to const i- tute the decisive difference between humans and other creatures on earth, and they are at the same time taken to be that which show us, and only us, to be related to God. The feature or property that singles humans out amo ng creatures is at the same time that which singles humans out in their relati - onship to God. But this is in no way obvious and results in an over - determined notion of reason: Reason is what distinguishes us from other a n- imals (animal rationale ) and as s uch constitutes our (relative) sameness with God according to the analogical difference between God as the source of re a- son and dignity and humans as the created occasions of reason and dignity. However, why should that which distinguishes us from other an imals be at the same time that which manifests our special relationship with God? Pro p- erty essentialism uses the theological comparison between the human and the divine to inter pret or elucidate the biological difference between humans and other animals. It gives a theological answer to a biological problem, and in doing so it fails to locate the problem of dignity where it ought to be l o- cated: in the differ ence between humane and inhumane ways of living a h u- man life. The second and very different answer i s given by a dynamic personalism: Dignity is seen as divine gift that empowers us to become what we can be because of the gift given to us. It is a distinction that enables us to become the persons we can be by living up to who we are as persons: God's fr eely chosen neighbors . We are all born as humans who can live as persons, and we do this in the fullest sense open to us if we orient our lives to the way God relates to us . By relating to us as our neighbor , God gives us the potential to become what we ca nnot become from our own powers: humans who live a humane life as persons among persons before God. The theological contrast between human and divine is used here not to elucidate the contrast between humans and animals but rather the anthropological or et hical contrast b e- tween humane and inhuman e ways of living our life. The point of departure is not what humans are, do, or have but rather what God does to and for them. From a human perspective this means emphasizing the basic passivity, dependency or (in more positive terms) enrichment and empower ment of human life by the way God relates to and becomes present in it. Dignity is and remains God's property and hence cannot be taken away from us who participate in it as a divine gift. This gift can be spell ed out without reference to dignity. Indeed, this category may explicitly be avoided because it lends itself to naturalist or essentialist misunderstandings, i.e. as signifying some-RELIGION , MORALITY AND BEING HUMAN : THE CONTROVERSIAL S TATUS OF HUMAN D IGNITY 179 thing in our biological, natural or cultural make -up that marks us off from other creatures. But the point of the dynamic personalist understanding of dignity is that we are unique not in what we are but in what we become em- powered to show or indicate about God (creator) - i.e. that God is present to his creation in a particular way, a way spelled out as love in the Christian tr a- dition. Thus, the criterion of a properly humane humanity is to accept one's basic passivity, i.e. our empowerment to mediate and manifest the presence of God to others. This empowerment is something beyon d our control: we cannot give it to anyone nor can we take it away from anyone: It is a pre - given of all our acting and doing. This in turn grounds our respect for each other - a respect that is always a re spect for the respect of God for others. That is to say, we respect others because we re spect that God respects ever y- one as his neighbor, not merely those who belong to a particular nation, group, or tradition, but unrestrictedly everyone: God is the neighbor of ever y- body . This constitutes the dignity o f human persons as the human e mode of living a human life in the presence of God . Humans acknowledge and respect this, as Christ ians say, by living according to the rule of love: To live in this way is to see God (or God's presence) in everybody and hence tailor what we do not merely to our own interests or the re quire ments of the other but also, and even more so, to the gift that he or she represents as much as we do: to be those whom God has chosen to be his neighbors. 180 INGOLF DALFERTH 181 9 Dignity, Autonomy and Embodiment JOHN COTTINGHAM Heythrop College, University of London / University of Reading ABSTRACT The inalienable dignity of all human beings is independent of circumstances, capacities, or qualifications. Kantian autonomy (construed as the rational will, or the ability to exercise it) cannot ground such a notion. The roots of universal human dignity are more plausibly traced to the Judaeo -Chris tian worldview in which God loves all his children equally, despite their vulner a- bility and weakness. To mature morally is to come to realize that we gain nothing by insisting on our status, or 'standing on our dignity'; we should recognize instead the dep endency we share with all our neighbours. KEYWORDS dignity, autonomy, Kant, embodiment, love, God, location, neighbour, vulnerability 1. THE PROBLEMATIC CONCE PT OF DIGNITY In his fascinating paper, 'Religion, Morality and Being Human ,' Ingolf Dalferth reminds us of the Kantian conception of a person. In qualifying as persons, we are something very special.1 We are not just animals, which 1 See above, 158 -159. I am grateful to Professor Dalferth, and the other participants at the ESPR Conference on 'Embodied Religion' held in Soesterberg, Netherlands, September 2012 for stimulating discussion and comments. 182 JOHN COTTINGHAM would give us only a common value shared by any natural living being or 'offspring of the earth .' We are not even ju st animals with the distinctive fe a- ture of rationality; for this, though entailing that we can chose between o p- tions, and set goals for ourselves, sets us apart only in degree, not in kind, from the manifold animal species that manifest purposive activity. What makes us 'exalted above any price' is the fact that we are persons , that is to say, subjects who engage in moral reasoning (or 'morally practical reason'). This alone, says Kant, gives us dignity - in German W\u00fcrde - an 'absolute i n- ner worth .'2 And Pr ofessor Dalferth glosses this by saying that ascribing pe r- sonhood to someone is not a matter of degree, but a matter of a simple yes/no question: are we able to live a moral life or aren't we? It follows, on Dalferth's analysis, that this Kantian notion of dignity is a 'strictly universal' notion: it can never be a matter of classifying humans into groups or classes. And he contrasts this universality with more elitist conce p- tions, such as that of Nietzsche, which ascribes a certain greatness or nobility to those capable of extraordinary acts of self -overcoming, and also with more recent accounts which make dignity depend on the instantiation of certain descriptive features. He suggests that dignity should better be understood as an 'orienting concept': it f osters, or encapsulates, a humane way of living with others, one in which 'we commit ourselves to viewing and treating every h u- man being, not merely family and friends, but also strangers and enemies, as human persons with untouchable dignity .' Or expresse d theologically, 'we - each and every one of us - are more than we appear to be, because we are persons in and whom God makes his presence manifest to others.'3 Clearly the conception being articulated here is to some extent prescri p- tive. It does not merel y purport to describe how the notion of dignity is in fact commonly used in ordinary moral and political discourse, but instead puts forward a kind of ideal regulative or normative principle: that we should be committed to living in a moral community - a community of self - respecting human agents who accord respect to every one of their fellows simply in virtue of their humanity. One of the interesting things about this conception is that it leads us in a rather different direction from the one we should tak e if we were explica t- 2 Immanuel Kant, Metaphysics of Morals [Metaphysik der Sitten , 1797] , trans. M. Gre gor (Ca m- bridge1996), 186 (Akademie edition, VI, 435).

DIGNITY , AUTONOMY AND EMBODIMENT 183 ing dignity by focusing directly on the central Kantian notion of autonomy. Autonomy, for Kant, is 'the basis of the dignity of human nature and of every rational nature' [ Autonomie is der Grund der W\u00fcrde der menschlichen und jeder ver n\u00fcnftigen Natur ], as that aspect of our will whereby it must be cons i- dered as selbstgesetzgebend ('giving the law to itself').4 What this suggests is that the independent power of exercising the rational will is what gives us our human dignity. To have hum an dignity is to be able to make decisions independently of the arbitrary will of another, acting in the full light of re a- son, free from internal or external interference with one's rational processes. Hence, to be autonomous I must be free from external t yranny (my status as a rational agent must be respected) and also from internal interference, such as arises from the contingencies of appetite and mere inclination.5 I must be a fully rational, self -legislating being. The Swiss euthanasia clinic Dignitas , which offers, for a fee, to terminate the lives of those with incurable and irreversible medical conditions, appears to focus above all on this aspect of autonomy. The 'dignity' that the clinic purports to promote and respect is above all the dignity of exercising the r a- tional will; and this explains the elaborate procedures designed to make sure that the patient is rationally choosing to end his or her life, without conf u- sion or external pressure. Clients are carefully interviewed on arrival at the clinic to ascertain that they are there of their own volition, and understand what they are doing. They are then interviewed again, after a 'cooling off' p e- riod of one day, to check that they are steadfast in their resolve to end their lives. And finally, on th e day of the killing, they are again questioned about whether they know what is about to happen, what will be the effect of the drugs administered, and so on.6 Now of course there are good legal reasons why an organisation involved in the business of killi ng7 should want to make 4 Immanuel Kant, Groundwork for th e Metaphysics of Morals [Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten, 1785], ch. 2 , ed. E. Hill Jr. and Arnulf Zweig, (Oxford 2003), 236, 232 (Akademie edition, IV 436; 431). 5 Thus, for Kant, moral imperatives cannot be construed as conditional on whatev er contingent desires one happens to have, for 'in these cases the will never determines itself directly by the thought of an action, but only by the motivations which the anticipated effect of the action exercises on the will - I ought to do something bec ause I want something else. ' (Groundwork, ed. Hill and Zweig, 244; Ak a- demie edn IV 444). Because of its dependency on the contingencies of inclination, action of this kind is always for Kant heteronomous. 6 James Ross, 'One Last Helping Hand ,' The Independent (London), 24 April 2012, 44 -5. 7 The use of the term 'killing' may strike some readers as hostile or critical, but there is no such necessary implication. It is a matter of simple factual accuracy to describe the clinic's work as that of 184 JOHN COTTINGHAM sure that those who use its services are doing so in full knowledge and of their own volition. But the relevant point for the purposes of the present di s- cussion is that the qualifications the patient has to display in order to pass these tests are very far from being a matter of simply belonging to the co m- munity of human beings. Something much more active is required - articul a- cy, moral responsibility, ability to respond to searching questions at inte r- view, and so on. And these are n ot 'all or nothing' matters: they are matters of degree. One can clearly imagine many confused, distressed or disabled terminally ill patients failing the tests. So the 'dignity' that is the focus of a t- tention in the Clinic's operations is by implication a property pertaining only to a qualified subset of human beings. If we are to make acceptable use of the concept of human dignity, it seems clear that it needs to be a more 'universalist' notion than this (here I would wholeheartedly agree with what I take to be the conclusions of Da l- ferth's paper). It needs to be somet hing that is possessed by all of us, qua human, and which should be recognized as an inalienable and absolute h u- man attribute, independent of our circumstances, capacities, group - membership, qualifications or faculties. It is notorious that the principal forms of modern secular consequentialism cannot ground such a universal notion of dignity (Peter Singer's 'preference utilitarianism ,' in its attitude to the unborn and to infants, makes this abundantly clear);8 and as the Dignitas example illustrates, it a lso seems that Kantian autonomy (construed as the rational will, or the ability to exercise it) cannot ground it either. Even Da l- ferth's heroic attempts to ground dignity in a universalist Kantian notion of membership of the moral community do not quite se em to work; for me m- bership of the moral community presumably requires certain abilities. Da l- ferth bases his argument on the idea that Kantian dignity is 'ascribed not to the individual human being directly but to morality, and through morality to humanity' ;9 but this 'indirect' Kantian strategy seems to me to problematic for a number of reasons. First, it is the individual who needs the protections of dignity, not humanity in general (it would hardly be comforting to be told: 'don't worry that we are sacrific ing you - we are protecting the dignity of the killing people, or, perhaps, helping them to kill themselves. The euphemistic (not to say Orwellian) term 'assisted dying ,' used for example by Mary Warnock, should cause disquiet precisely because it attempts to divert attention from what is actually being done in such cases. See Warnock, Easeful Death: Is There a Case for Assisted Dying? (Oxford 2008). 8 Peter Singer, Practical Ethics (Cambridge 1979, 3rd edn. 2011). 9 Dalferth, 'Religion, Morality and Being Human, ' 158. DIGNITY , AUTONOMY AND EMBODIMENT 185 human race in general!'). And second, ascribing dignity to the institution of morality seems to gloss over the fact that we participate in the institution to differing degrees (young children, for example, cle arly participate less, since they are involved merely as recipients of moral action but not as fully fledged agents). So on the 'dignity -as-belonging -to-morality -in-general' argument, we seem to need a further reason why the protecting embrace of dignity s hould extend to all humans, independent of their capacities, their rational will, and their degree of participation in the moral domain. 2. HOW IS WORTH CONFERRE D? The Latin word dignitas has connotations which partly overlap with those of the German te rm W\u00fcrde. In its Classical usage, it most frequently refers to some exalted or honoured status that attached to someone in virtue of their rank or position - the dignity of a consul, for example, or of a patr i- cian as opposed to a plebeian. This usage spill s over into English term 'dign i- ty,' so that when Prince Florizel in Shakespeare's Winter's Tale leaves the ro y- al palace in disguise to woo the humble Perdita, a courtier describes him as one 'who has his Dignity and Duty both cast off, Fled from his Father , from his hopes, and with a Shepherd's daughter.'10 (Of course it eventually turns out that Perdita, unbeknownst to anyone, is actually herself a King's daug h- ter, so the threat to Florizel's dignity which would have been occasioned by his marrying someone of low birth is happily avoided.) In this conception, status is conferred by birth or high office. But as so often in Shakespeare, the idea is no sooner developed than it is subverted. When the lovers are discovered, and Florizel is subjected to the furiou s wrath of his royal father for having risked his dignity, Perdita refuses to be cowed: I was not much afeard; for once or twice I was about to speak and tell him plainly, The selfsame sun that shines upon his court Hides not his visage from our cottag e but Looks on alike.11 10 William Shakespeare, The Winter's Tale [c. 1610], Act V, scene 1, line 182. 11 Wint er's Tale , Act IV, scene 4, lines 434 -7. 186 JOHN COTTINGHAM Just as the sun shines on all, high and lowly alike, so, she seems to be saying, distinctions of rank and status are irrelevant to someone's true worth. This conception comes not from the Classical or pagan world, where consider a- tions of 'dignity' as rank were all -important, but from the Judaeo -Christian worldview. In the words of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, 'the dignity of the human person is rooted in his or her creation in the image and likeness of God.'12 Or again, 'All human beings, in as much as they are created in the image of God, have the dignity of a person.'13 Nicolas Wolterstorff, in an impressive recent study, has underlined the roots of this idea in the Hebrew Bible, where he argues, with a wealth of su p- porting evidence, that there is a clear recognition of the equal value of all in the sight of God. Throughout the Old Testament, what Wolterstorff aptly calls the ' quartet of the vulnerable' - widows, orphans, resident aliens, and the impoverished - make repeated appearances. And in the injunctions of the law and the prophets, and the poetry of the Psalms, God is seen as calling on his people to 'loose the bonds of i njustice' by rescuing these vulnerable groups who have been wronged: to 'raise the poor from the dust, and lift the needy from the ash -heap' (Psalm 113 [112]). Injustice is seen both as wronging God and as wronging the victims of injustice by failing to re cognize their i n- herent human worth.14 The New Testament continues the same message, though Wolterstorff argues that it often comes to our ears in distorted or diluted form, owing to difficulties of translation. Jesus in Matthew's Gospel (5:6) says 'Blessed are those who hunger for dikaiosune. ' The latter term is often translated 'rig h- teousness ,' which today may suggest some sort of personal rectitude , whereas the Greek stem ( dik-) has a much more interpersonal and social flavour and connects directly with ju stice. The 'kingdom' which Jesus was to inaugurate was to be a kingdom of 'justice and righteousness' - the very combination that so frequently occurs in the Old Testament (in the Hebrew terms mishpat and tsedeqa ). And the righteous king or Messiah foretol d in the Hebrew Scriptures was to be one who (in the words of Psalm 72 [71]), 'judges the poor with justice and ... saves the lives of the needy.' On Wolterstorff's reading, Jesus' words and actions (consorting with outcasts, touching and curing those who we re ritually unclean, explaining why it was right to heal on the 12 Catechism of the Catholic Church [1997], Part III, section 1, Ch. 1; \u00a71700. 13 Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church [2005], \u00a766. 14 Nicolas Wolterstorff, Justice: Rights and Wrongs (Princeton, 2008). DIGNITY , AUTONOMY AND EMBODIMENT 187 Sabbath) were designed to 'appeal to our worth as human beings to explain God's care for each and every one of us.'15 Not only does Wolterstorff trace the origins of the idea of universal h u- man dignity back to early Jewish and Christian moral thinking, but he also makes the striking and controversial claim that without such theistic r e- sources we will be left without any satisfactory grounding for dignity: no s e- cular worldview can do the job. Now while it is impossible to deny the dec i- sive influence of the Judaeo -Christian tradition on the development of Wes t- ern moral thought, the majority of contemporary moral philosophers would nevertheless strongly resist the suggestion that our modern concepti ons of justice, human dignity and rights require a theistic underpinning. Many would regard Kant's principle of respect for persons (referred to many times in Dalferth's paper) as providing a fully secularized basis for the modern co n- ception of inherent hu man dignity - the right of each of us to be treated as an end in him or her self, never merely as a means. And this in turn is often seen as the origin of the modern idea, found in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights that ' All human beings are born free and equal in dignity ...' (Article 1). Wolterstorff is adamant, however, that 'it is impossible to develop a secular account of human dignity adequate for grounding human rights .'16 This is because Kantian respect hinges on the capacity for rational action; yet if human worth depends on this, then those who lack that capacity (infants, those born with severe mental impairment, Alzheimer's patients) risk being excluded from the domain of right -holders. The point is a familiar one in the debates over Ka ntian ethics, and Wolterstorff makes repeated use of it to pose a powerful challenge to a variety of secular moral theorists (including Alan Gewirth and Ronald Dworkin): if rational choice (Gewirth) or mental creativity (Dworkin) is the criterion, how can this explain why every human, qua human, should be regarded as having inherent worth?17 In the Christian worldview, by contrast, 'God loves ... each and every human being equally and permanently'; and if this is true, then 'natural h u- man rights are grounded in that love,' since they 'inhere in the bestowed worth that supervenes on being thus loved.'18 The idea has a certain intuitive 15 Wolterstorff, Justice , 131. 16 Wolterstorff, Justice , 325 17 See Ronald Dworkin, Life's Dominion (New York 1993); Alan Gewirth, Human Rights (Chicago 1982). 18 Wolterstorff, Justice, 360. 188 JOHN COTTINGHAM plausibility, since our experience of human parental and conjugal love does seem to give some support to the idea that attachmen t or commitment to someone can endow that person with a certain moral status. Nevertheless, philosophical critics are sure here to raise the question of how exactly love can 'bestow worth .' The question is related to the vexed issue of the Euthy p- hro proble m (which, perhaps disappointingly, is not directly addressed by Wolterstorff); the crucial worry is whether love in itself can make something valuable. One is reminded here of the arguments of Harry Frankfurt that by lo v- ing something, or caring about it, we imbue it with worth or value.19 Value, on Frankfurt's picture is a matter of our exercising our will, our choice, to care about something or someone. The resulting picture is one where, in a certain sense, it is we who create values by our own authentic choices. By deciding what we care about we bring value into the world. But there is a s e- rious problem with this view, together with many other 'internalist' views (compare Bernard Williams's idea that value is generated by my commi t- ments to certain 'projec ts' that I make my own)20 - namely that they seem to put the cart before the horse. I cannot, surely, create value or worth merely by caring about something (or else I could bestow worth on a pile of wort h- less rubbish merely by choosing to care about it); on the contrary, it seems that my caring about something is only justified if that thing is already worth caring about. Caring, in other words, depends on worth, rather than creating it. Perhaps, however, the status of the person caring makes a difference. Wolterstorff uses the analogy of a great monarch bestowing her friendship on a courtier: the courtier is now 'honoured and envied in ways she was not b e- fore.'21 Unfortunately for this argument, it still le aves open the question of whether the courtier ought to be so honoured. Has genuine worth been be s- towed - is the courtier now genuinely fit to be honoured - or is any resulting 'honouring' that may occur merely a prudently deferential recognition of the monarch's arbitrary power? (Analogies here abound with the Euthyphro problem: the mere arbitrary commands of a God, however powerful, cannot 19 Harry G. Frankfurt, The Reasons of Love (Princeton 2004), 40ff. 20 See Bernard Williams, Shame and Necessity (Berkeley 1993), Ch. 5. For more discussion of the positions of Frankfurt and Williams, see J. Cottingham, 'Integrity and Fragmentation ,' Journal of A p- plied Philosophy 27/1 (2010), 2 -14. 21 Wolterstorff, Justice , 259. DIGNITY , AUTONOMY AND EMBODIMENT 189 create moral obligation). If, however, we add the premise that the aforesaid Queen is supremely good and wise and jus t, then her bestowing of her friendship will make not just a causal but a normative difference: there will now be genuine reason to honour the courtier, namely that in the eyes of one who is wholly good and wise and just the courtier in question is an obje ct of affection and delight. I conclude that there is reason to think that the impartial love of a s u- premely good and just God for all his creatures does indeed give us reason to honour them all alike. In the eyes of a supremely loving, good and wise he a- venly father, each of us, as Wolterstorff puts it, is 'irreducibly precious .' As for whether there can be viable alternative secular groundings for the idea of universal dignity and worth, in the light of Wolterstorff's arguments that seems doubtful but stil l open. He has made a strong case for thinking the standard Kantian -derived attempts to provide such grounding are not pro m- ising, but this evidently leaves open the logical possibility that a better sec u- lar alternative might be round the corner. 3. DIGNITY AND EMBODIMEN T In the final section of this paper, I should like to connect some of the ideas so far broached to the question of embodiment, bearing in mind the theme outlined in the general rubric for this conference, that 'religion is a l- ways embod ied in various ways.' The contrast, discussed at various points in Ingolf Dalferth's paper, between secular and religious approaches to human dignity leaves it open how far either conception might be understood as irr e- ducibly body -involving. Certainly, the Kantian approaches seem to lay stress on rather abstract notions - dignity as attaching to an abstract human inst i- tution (morality), rather tha n to individual embodied creatures; dignity as a function of purely 'noumenal' properties, such as the exercise of rational choice, rather than as depending on our situatedness in the embodied biolo g- ical world. What of the religion -based approaches? The one that Dalferth adumbrates at the close of his paper again seems to abstract somewhat from the context of our em bodied human existence. We are born as humans, he suggests, but we have the power to become something more - to become per- sons 'capable of living a humane life as persons among persons before God .' The focus of attention is not on our similarities with (or differences from) 190 JOHN COTTINGHAM other animals, but on 'the ... ethical contrast between humane or inhumane ways of living.'22 (The latter contrast is actually described by Dalferth as 'anthropological or ethical ,' but the former term does not seem to play any role, at any rate if one understands 'anthropology' to involve an irreducible reference to our biological and embodied nature as a species.) The concluding sentences of Dalferth's paper, however, point directly to the importance, in elucidating the theistic ground for dignity, of a relatio n- ship - the relationship of being a neighbour. 'We respect others because we respect that God respects everyone as his neighbour... God is the neighbour of everyone.' Now this relationship, it seems to me, is one that has to be pr i- maril y understood in terms of embodiment, and indeed in terms of physical location. A neighbour in the most basic sense is someone who lives next -door - in physical proximity to you. When talking of God, we may be inclined to 'spiritualize' all this, on the grounds that God is supposed to be incorporeal, and so to have no physical relationship with anyone. But that, I think, would be too swift. In the first place, the fact that God cannot be comprehended in physical terms does not licence the inference that we c an comprehend him better as a 'non -physical' kind of Cartesian ghost. It is surely better to admit, with Nicolas Mal e- branche, that the deity must wholly transcend any anthropomorphic conce p- tions: just as we should not imagine God to be corporeal, Malebranc he o b- served, so we should not really describe him as a Mind or Spirit, since that invites comparison with a human mind. Rather, Malebranche suggested, we should think that 'just as He includes the perfections of matter without being material, so He include s the perfections of created spirits without being spirit - at least in the manner we conceive spirit.'23 All we can really say of the 'neighbour' relation between God and his creatures - the only analogy we have for it - is that of physical proximity: God is somehow close to us: close to us in the closest possible way - closer within me than I am to my inner self, as St Augustine put it.24 In the second place, in speaking of the relationship between God and human beings as 'personal ,' we should not be too sw ift to 'spiritualize' the central feature of personhood which is ascribed both to God and to huma n- kind made in his image. On the contrary, both modern philosophy (one 22 Dalferth, 'Religion, Morality and Being Human ,' 177. 23 Nicolas Malebranche, Recherche de la V\u00e9rit\u00e9 [1674], Bk. 3, Ch. 9. 24 Interior intimo meo ; Augustine, Confessiones [397-8], III, 6, 11. DIGNITY , AUTONOMY AND EMBODIMENT 191 thinks here particularly of Wittgenstein) and traditional Christian doctrine (the concept ion of God as supremely revealed in the human life of Jesus of Nazareth) concur in supposing that personal attributes are to be understood primarily in term of the embodied beings who manifest them. In general, our handle on personhood, despite perennial p hilosophical tendencies to abstra c- tify it, is an irreducibly corporeal one, and we need to beware of following John Locke down a long road of philosophical errors and confusions, in trying to define a 'person' in terms of something abstract called 'conscio usness .' As Anthony Kenny has persuasively argued, 'the concept of a human being - an animal of a particular species with particular capacities - provides us with the only concept of a person that we can really understand.'25 The latter claim might seem something of an exaggeration if it were taken to mean that only a human being could count as a person (we can certainly make sense of the idea of a Martian being a person); but it remains true, as Kenny implies, that it the con cept of a person is most fundamentally at home in the context of our human, biological status as a certain kind of embodied species, and that it is from here that any possible understanding of the concept must begin. We need to keep these points in mind wh en reflecting further on the concept of a neighbour. The story in Luke (10: 29 -37) of the Good Samaritan, told in response to the question 'But who is my neighbour?', shows that my neighbour need not be understood simply as the guy next door. But the story nonetheless depends crucially on the idea of a physical, locatable encounter, on the road going up from Jerusalem to Jericho - as the Samaritan comes upon someone who had fallen among thieves, tends to him physically, bin d- ing up his wounds, takes him to t he inn, and arranges for him to be cared for. To be a neighbour to someone is to be there for him, not to simply wish him well in some disembodied haze of general benevolence. The importance of physicality and location in religious thought has been brought out recently in Mark Wynn's illuminating study Faith and Place. Many theologians and philosophers in the past have been very wary of co n- ceptions that seem to 'localize' God and his action - something that is co n- nected with the so -called 'scandal of partic ularity .' Why should the eternal creator of the universe have a preference for a particular tribe on an insignif i- cant planet revolving round a very average star? Why should he manifest himself as a human being in an unprepossessing town in a remote corner of 25 Anthony Kenny, What I Believe (London 2006), 73. 192 JOHN COTTINGHAM the early Roman empire? In Catholic Christianity, with its traditional emph a- sis on relics and pilgrimage sites, the problem has seemed to many people to be particularly acute: why should an omnibenevolent creator dispense f a- vours specifically to those w ho travel to Lourdes or to Santiago de Compost e- la? An uncompromisingly 'metaphysical' answer offered by the hard -line traditionalist believer would be that God miraculously exercises his power precisely by intervening, or by being present in an especially immediate way, in particular locations. At the other end of the spectrum would be a psych o- logical or pragmatic answer of the kind that might be offered by theologians of a more 'progressive' stripe: it just so happens that some places put people in a benef icial frame of mind, perhaps because of their natural beauty, or moving architecture, or historical associations. But the latter view might seem to smack of reductionism - the attempt to purge theology of reference to anything not readily explicable in nat ural terms; while the former position could leave one wondering at the theological coherence of the idea that the activity of an omnipresent, omnipotent God is 'localised' in this way. Wynn ingeniously steers a middle course between these two extremes. To explain how particular places can be religiously significant, we neither have to venture into the murky realms of metaphysical speculation about God's mode of intervention in the natural world, nor do we have to reduce the value of a sacred space to no mor e than its subjective effects in the minds of those who visit it. How might such an intermediate strategy work? In the case of pilgrimage, rather than grounding its meaning in miraculous or s u- pernatural events on the one hand, or just in the interior life of the believer on the other, Wynn suggests that we need to take note of the physicality of the practice: it is the 'relations of physical continuity and proximity that e x- plain the sense of pilgrimage practice .'26 These features certainly seem important in many religious contexts. A highly successful exhibition at the British Museum in Summer of 2011 e x- plored what the curators described as 'the spiritual and artistic significance of Christian relics and reliquaries in medieval Europe .' The 'artistic' elemen t was clear enough: many of the reliquaries are extraordinarily beautiful, their craftsmanship exquisite. But the religious significance, for many of those v i- siting the exhibition, surely had something to do with the 'physical continu i- 26 Mark Wynn, Faith and Place (Oxford 2009), 152. DIGNITY , AUTONOMY AND EMBODIMENT 193 ty and proximity' und erlined by Wynn. You are now, at this moment., stan d- ing in front of the very casket that contains the remains of the revered man or woman who so many centuries ago suffered and died for their faith. Mere superstition, or (its even more degenerate cousin) m ere touristic gawping? No doubt there can be elements of both, but it would take a very cynical cri t- ic, faced with the extraordinary devotion manifested in these lovingly wrought works of art, to suppose this to be the whole story. The point has applicatio n beyond the purely religious sphere. Wynn points out that in visiting the grave of a loved one 'it matters to us ... that we should be physically alongside the remains of the dead person.' And descri b- ing some crucial episodes in his own friendship with the poet Edmund C u- sick, who died in 2007, he argues that the development of human relatio n- ships is often rooted in a shared sensibility for place - a sensibility which, in turn, is closely bound up with 'bodily movement and affectively informed perception .'27 Part of Wynn's agenda here is to counter, or at least suppl e- ment, the highly abstract and intellectualistic framework within which much philosophy, especially the philosophy of religion, is typically carried on. When friends revisit a favourite place where they have often walked and talked together, the place itself may have a distinctive character, a genius loci , which allows them to interact and converse in a distinctive way, and to 'a f- firm ... their commitment to certain values, by means of embodied intera c- tion with the [place], rather than by way of explicit articulation .'28 This is an argument that needs a specific personal narrative, such as Wynn provides, to make it vivid. But the case for such an 'embodied epistemology' seems very persuasive. Wynn does n ot mention Thomas Hardy's poetry, but anyone who has responded to masterpieces like 'At Castle Boterel' (1913) will understand something of what is meant. Everything hinges on a physical, locatable e n- counter: Myself and a girlish form benighted In dry Ma rch weather. We climbed the road Beside a chaise. We had just alighted To ease the sturdy pony's load When he sighed and slowed ... Primaeval rocks form the road's steep border, 27 Wynn, Faith and Place , 42-3. 28 Wynn, Faith and Place , 28-9 194 JOHN COTTINGHAM And much have they faced there, first and last, Of the transitory in Ear th's long order; But what they record in colour and cast Is - that we two passed ... I look and see it there, shrinking, shrinking, I look back at it amid the rain For the very last time; for my sand is sinking, And I shall traverse old love's domain Never again ... The poet's grasp of the significance of his relationship with his former love is intimately bound up with his knowledge of the place where they once alighted from the pony cart, their physical orientation as they climbed the steep hill together, flanked by the 'primeval rocks' that have witnessed so much of 'the transitory in Earth's long order ,' and which now see the poet physically present at the scene in old age, knowing that he will 'traverse old love' s domain never again.' I would submit that there are important lessons to be learned here about the general structure of human relationships. Love for friends is not an abstractified flowing of benevolence or even of individuated commitment, but a dynamic process that unfolds in corporeally and physically mediated ways, through what we do together, how we walk and talk together, where we go, and the trajectory of embodied memories of shared dwellings and journeys. To be a friend or neighbour with someone i s to go with them along these paths, and to be prepared to have one's own space encroached on by them, as they will reciprocally be prepared to receive us. If we were purely rational disembodied agents or mere 'persons ,' in some quasi -Cartesian sense of me re 'thinking things' or 'conscious beings ,' true relationships as we u n- derstand them would be inconceivable: they would be reduced to detached interchanges of information, interactive exercises of intellection and volition, but without all the vulnerabilit ies of embodied particularity that make love and friendship truly precious. For in true relations of neighbourliness, frien d- ship and love, we abandon our austere self -sufficient autonomy, and accept our 'passivity' (to use a term aptly deployed by Dalferth at the close of his paper): we know our need, our dependency, and need it to be recognized by others. And once we know this, we can see at once that our dignity and worth cannot depend on our rational powers and capacities, nor our ability to d e- termine ou r choices as moral lawgivers, nor any other intellectual endo w- ment, even that of consciousness (which may of course be dormant, or de -DIGNITY , AUTONOMY AND EMBODIMENT 195 activated, as in a coma), but simply and solely on our need for others to reach out to us, as we need to reach out to them . This is a need that applies to every single human being on the planet. To mature morally is to come to realize that we gain nothing by insisting on our status, or 'standing on our dignity' (as the English idiom has it), but that we gain everything by rec ognizing the dependency we share with all our neighbours. Finally to the issue which has been involved, explicitly or implicitly, throughout this paper, and which I take to be central to Ingolf Dalferth's concerns also, namely the relative merits of religi ous versus secular accounts of dignity. The focus on passivity and vulnerability that has just emerged seems to me to be a clear point in favour of the religious account; for it is not clear that our human weakness and dependency provides any purely secula r reason why dignity or worth should attach to us all qua human. If anything, the reverse seems true. For on a standard Darwinian view of human nature, our nature is simply a set of contingent features that have emerged out of a blind nexus of forces, shap ed by random mutation and the struggle for su r- vival. So selecting any one of these features, such as our frailty and depe n- dency, as the basis for according inherent worth to us, seems pretty arbitrary, or at any rate no more or less warranted than ascribin g true dignity on the basis of strength, following Nietzsche, or 'great -souledness ,' following Ari s- totle.29 On the Judaeo -Christian view, by contrast, human beings, despite their frailty (formed of the 'dust of the earth') are, as the Hebrew Bible has it, m ade in the image and likeness of God.30 So simply in virtue of our human status we participate in some way in that infinite worth that is God. (Again, we should beware of 'spiritualizing' this - the creation language of Genesis is robustly corporeal.) And b uilding on this foundation, the Christian vision takes the extraordinary further step of declaring that our corporeal human nature is actually 'divinised' - raised up to the fullest dignity by Christ's humbling himself to take our bodily nature upon him. A s the poet and priest Gerard Manley Hopkins so vividly puts it: In a flash, at a trumpet crash, I am all at once what Christ is, since he was what I am, and This Jack, joke, poor potsherd, patch, matchwood, immortal diamond, 29 Cf. Friedrich Nietzsche, 30 Genesis, 2:7 (d ust) and 1:26 (image). 196 JOHN COTTINGHAM Is immortal diamond.31 Nothing, on the face of it, could be more undignified than this 'Jack' - a common, ordinary fellow, of undistinguished worth; this 'patch ,' a mere fool or ninny; this potsherd, a broken fragment, like that with which the wretched Job, reduced to the utmost indignit y, scraped his sores (Job 2:8); weak and feeble, as perishable as matchwood. Yet all at once, by Christ's sharing in our bodily nature, this paltry individual becomes 'immortal diamond' - of infinite worth and dignity. None of this, of course, counts as a philosophically watertight theistic grounding of the concept of human dignity, since it depends on the revealed truth of the Incarnation. But for those who accept that truth, it does indeed, as Hopkins beautifully expresses it, raise every human being, 'al l at once ,' to infinite, Christlike, worth. The secularist can, to be sure, resolve to treat every human being as if they were of such infinite worth; but it is entirely unclear what might ground that resolve, since there is nothing in the way things are, on the naturalist worldview, that underwrites it; there is only a plurality of diverse specimens of a certain species of featherless biped, some stronger, some weaker, some outstanding and splendid, some defective and wretched, all subject to infirmity and eventual decrepitude. The universal dignity of humankind is the pearl of great price in our ethical culture. But torn out of the religious seabed that nurtured it, it may not take very long to be swept away on the advancing tide of secularism. 31 G.M.

Section V: SELECTED SHORT PAPERS 198 199 10 I Think Therefore I Am Not Mystical Desire and the Dispossession of the Cogito ARIANNE CONTY American University of Sharjah , Sharjah, UAE ABSTRACT This article sets out to question the understanding of religion as a purely spir i- tual relationship with God by focusing on the mystical experience of ecstasy, an experience that has often been described as leaving the body behind in a moment of spiritual rapture. Using psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan's work, this article will set out to show that it is not the body that is left behind in mystical ecstasy, but rather a certain understanding of selfhood constituted by aut o- nomous reason that will come to be conceptualized as the Cartesian cogito . The body figures as the site of an unknown that accepts having be en const i- tuted by another unknown, a God that cannot be sublated or grasped by re a- son alone. In this sense, the goal of psychoanalysis will be shown to overlap with an apophatic and embodied relation to the divine. KEYWORDS The opening paragraph of the ESPR call for papers for the Embodied R e- ligion Conference spoke indiscriminately of all religions as, and I quote, 'b e- longing to the sphere of the spiritual, since for most religious traditions (Christian as well as non -Christian) God is a spiritual being and relates to humankind spiritually.' By positing such a separation between the spiritual and the material, the soul and the body, this description reiterates a longstanding dualist tradition that separates the spiritual and the material, the transcendent and the immanent, placing religion on the side of the spirit, where it has traditionally been accompanied by God, man, reaso n and he a- ven, thereby relegating the immanent and embodied to a lesser sphere where it has found the company of women, the passions and hell.2 The conference description then goes on to describe the ways in which these religious trad i- tions nonetheless come down to earth to deal with embodied issues. Here, a list of a variety of these embodied religious practices are given, dealing with rituals related to sexuality and reproduction, eating, propitiation and sacr i- fice, birth and death, art and liturgy, sacram ents and asceticism. Yet one wonders, after reading the list of embodied practices of religion, what a list of 'spiritual practices' might look like?3 Though Christianity is an orthodox rel i- gion, giving central importance to creed, both of the other monoth eisms, to name just those, are orthopraxes, giving central importance to ritual practice. But even in the case of Christianity, is not belief, is not faith, always insta n- tiated in a way of life (in certain political and ethical choices, in a gaze, a way of speaking) and inseparable from that embodied life? Are not prayer, rituals, sacrifices and forms of asceticism also spiritual practices? In fact, notwithstanding its orthodoxy, embodiment is perhaps the most defining characteristic of Christianity, the very trait that sets it apart from all other religions. Christianity differs from other monotheisms by believing in a 1 This phrase was published as a posthumous note.

Consciousness is thus disembodied. I THINK THEREFORE I AM NOT: MYSTICAL DESIRE AND THE DISPOSSESSION OF THE COGITO 201 God who is at the same time man, who suffered, ate and slept, in a body, who was born, died, and resurrected in and as a body. Though many traditions believe in anthropomorphic gods, who live embodied lives, they are normally endowed with immortality, and placed in a realm outs ide of human conti n- gency. Hence, amongst all religions, Christianity is set apart precisely due to its embodied God, who did not escape from human contingency, who was misunderstood and left to die at a particular time, as one among many pri s- oners in the R oman colony of Jerusalem in the first century. Jesus Christ thus places Christianity in a special relationship to embodiment, one that has a unique claim to the suffering and joys of the flesh, setting it apart from the Greek condemnation of the flesh, as well as from the many rival forms of Christianity that attempted to interpret Christ's body as an illusion, or to place Christ lower than God the Father in the divine hierarchy, precisely b e- cause he was born into time and hence not understood as being eter nal.4 Showing that the transcendent is embodied in the here and now of conti n- gent existence, the being here of what is beyond, the Incarnation is certainly Christianity's most distinctive trait. The novelty of this event in the history of religions is brou ght home by Jesuit historian of religions Michel de Certeau in an interview he gave to France Culture. I quote: Something, in my opinion, can be found at the center of a Christian faith, which can be called, in Christian jargon, the incarnation, in other words, the fact that God is man. I would say that with this idea there is a fundamental rupture in relation to the ways in which God was represented as a sun, as something or someone somewhere who escaped from contingency, from hi s- tory, from death, from the avatars of circumstance. What Christianity brought with this idea that God is man, is the fact that he is but a person in history named Jesus, it is the bursting o f the sun. This sun is stained and dispersed in a thousand pieces in the accident of daily life [le quotidien ]. At bottom, God is the stained sun, is the stain in the sun. If we can look for God somewhere, it is not in a paradise, in a cloud or in an exter iority in respect to history, but on the contrary in everyday human relations.5 So, to come back to our question, what might a purely spiritual event look like in the Christian tradition? Mystical experiences immediately come to mind, as a place where we m ight find a means of bypassing the mediated word of Scripture for an immediate and direct spiritual communication with 4 I am thinking here of Arianism, Docetism and Mono phys itism in particular. 19 December, 1975, in: F.

This is indeed the way mystical experience is described by many mystics themselves, and one of the primary reasons for th e persecution of many of these mystics by the Church, as they stood directly under God's authority, rather than that of the Pope and his interpretation of Scripture. During the phase of apologetic, perennial philosophy of religion epit o- mized by Rudolf Otto , Ald ous Huxley, Evelyn Underhill, William James and Mircea Eliade, this is often the interpretation given to mystical experience, and particularly mystical ecstasy (from ec-stasis , to stand outside) which came to be seen as a universal and direct experien ce of transpersonal union with the divine that transcended religious differences and particular emb o- died practices.6 Though this approach is still defended, especially among pr o- fessors schooled by Eliade, much scholarship has been done deflating such a universal and disembodied interpretation of mystical experience.7 But if r e- cent interpretations of mysticism convincingly refute these perennial claims, what, we might ask, does the mystic transcend, when she speaks of herself as outside herself in ecstasy, i f it is not her body? Examples of Christian mystics describing ecstasy as an event at which they were absent abound. Mechthild Von Magdeburg gives an excellent e x- ample of becoming absent to herself by describing her soul in union with Christ in the third person voice: 'Then a blessed stillness/ That both desire comes over them./ He surrenders himself to her,/ And she surrenders herself to him./ What happens to her then - she knows -/ And that is fine with me.'8 Who is this knowing 'she,' and this unknowing 'me?' Hadewijch similarly writes: 'It weighs me down that I cannot obtain/ knowledge of Love without renouncing self'; and again: 'After that I remained in a passing away in my Beloved, so that I wholly melted away in him and nothing any longer r e- mained t o me of myself.'9 John of the Cross similarly describes abandoning himself in order to experience his Beloved: 'I abandoned and forgot myself/ laying my face on my beloved; All things ceased; I went out from myself, / Leaving my cares Forgotten among the l ilies.'10 All of these passages describe the experience of a divided self, where a knowing narrative self is abandoned by an unknowing self who melts away in God.

' If the conscious knowing self is left behind, who is the subject of this unknowing ecstasy, and how are we to understand its rel a- tionship to the embodied self? I would like to venture a reply to this question by look ing at the work of psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, focusing particularly on his Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis and his Seminar XX, 'Encore.' By choosing to call the experience of ecstasy by the French term 'jouissance,' which simultan e- ously conno tes both joy and intense physical pleasure, Lacan stands firmly in the postmodern camp, understanding mystical ecstasy as an embodied and contingent spatio -temporal experience. As he puts it in Seminar XX, ' Encore ,' 'for jouissance to occur, there has to b e a body.'11 I will use the Four Fund a- mental Concepts of Psychoanalysis to provide an interpretation of his Sem i- nar XX on mysticism, interpreting Lacan as showing that it is a form of re a- son, which sees itself as autonomous and self -supporting, that is tran scended during moments of mystical jouissance , when the mystic accepts having been constituted by an Other beyond her understanding, and beyond her control. Identifying the self with a vulnerable and embodied desire for a vulnerable and embodied God, the m ystic abandons the inviolability of the ego and its sublation of the other, and opens herself to an encounter with the other in its own terms. Lacan, this paper will argue, uses mystical subjectivity as a tool in order to reveal the untenability of Descart es' cogito ,12 thereby undermining the modern construction of an autonomous subject. It is thus in the mystical tradition that Lacan will find the model for a n embodied subject who, by abandoning the 'all,' the 'whole, ' for what he calls the 'not all,' opens herself to an Other, who, instead of mirroring and thereby reinforcing the ego, u n- 11 Jacques -Alain Miller (ed.), The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Book XX : Encore (NY 1998), 26. 12 Although the modern subject, characterized by autonomous and rational self -representation, can be traced to a visual source in the mechanization of vision and Brunelleschi's invention of artificial perspective, it remains the case that many postmodern thinkers, including Heidegger and Jacques Lacan, used Descartes as a foundational example of this modern and reflexive subject , though he is of course merely emblematic of a shift that can be attributed to no single person. As Charles W inquist puts it in his article 'Person': ' There is no one event or thinker that can be definitively identified with an epochal epistemic shift in a culture. However, it is convenient to read Descartes' Meditations on the First Philosophy as synechdochi ally emblematic of the epistemic shift initiating the Age of Reason. The heuristic use of radical doubt to clear away any uncertainties was, as Descarte s sugges ted, a removal from below of the foundation of the whole edifi ce of thinking and believing.' Cited i n Mark Taylor (ed.), Critical Terms for Religious Studies (Chicago 1998), 227. One of the unfortunate results of this shift, most evident in Descart es, is the Manichaean divide between mind and body that has plagued the Christian West. 204 ARIANNE CONTY ravels it. Mirroring the unknowability of God, the body will be understood as the site of the unconscious, a site that remains always alien, always u n- known.13 By placing Lacan's critique of Descartes in his Four Fundamental Co n- cepts alongside his celebration of mystical jouissance in 'Encore,' I am not making an ahistorical claim that the cogito was somehow already constitutive of medieva l subjectivity. Rather I am using Lacan to show how Descartes' cogito can be understood as a defence mechanism, which actually resembles in interesting ways the foundation of the ego in the psychological develo p- ment of the child. In this sense, the experie nce of ecstasy as described by m e- dieval mystics coincides with Lacan's understanding of the Real, as an exper i- ence of ex -istence, beyond language and the symbolic constitution of the self as subject. The cogito , one might say, develops as a natural defence of the subject against this Real, which is beyond our cognitive understanding, and hence a source of anxiety. According to Lacan's analysis, only certain ap o- phatic mystics, then and now (and Lacan would include himself here), can accept this unknown as th e very nature of the embodied self. 1. THROUGH A GLASS , DARKLY Descartes has become emblematic of a certain reflexive subject who is constituted through his own rational thought and hence understood as somehow independent of the world and the people in it.14 And like Descartes, many of us choose to understand ourselves as somehow whole and inde- pendent, self -created through the activity of our own autonomous reason. As phenomenologist and Catholic theologian Jean-Luc Marion has pointed out, this hubris can lead to the positing of an Other who comes to function as an idolatrous mirror, guaranteeing our individuality, our fictive whole ness and 13 It is important here to differentiate Lacan's analysis of the body as constituted in the imaginary and symbolic phase, where it is a cultural construction, rather tha n something we are born with, from the body as the Real, the organism that is the site of jouissance , separate from the subject and its co n- structed identity. 14 In his third meditation, Descartes expresses himself as follows: ' I am a thinking (conscious) thing, that is, a being who doubts, affirms, denies, knows a few objects, and is ignorant of many, - [who loves, hates], wills, refuses, - who imagines likewise, and perceives; for, as I before remarked, although the things which I perceive or imagine are pe rhaps nothing at all apart from me, I am nevertheless assured that those modes of consciousness which I call perceptions and imaginations, in as far only as they are modes of conscious ness, exist in me.' Descartes, (Meditations, III, pg. 119 ) cited in The Rati o- nalists (NY, 1960), 128. I THINK THEREFORE I AM NOT: MYSTICAL DESIRE AND THE DISPOSSESSION OF THE COGITO 205 autonomy as real. Marion describes this mirror as a prison, locking the su b- ject in a world inhabited exclusively by h is own reflection: Man becomes obsessed when he can see only images modelled on himself; from constantly seeing without being seen he can finally only see images that mirror his unique gaze. The obsidian obscenity of a universe of idols can tole r- ate no ex it, since the gaze will always and only reproduce its idols.15 Psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan has explained how the function of this i n- visible mirror develops during childhood when an actual and visible mirror leads the subject to identify itself with its mirr or image, thereby limiting its identity to a visible appearance which saturates the gaze with an illusory un i- ty. Lacan calls this reflection the ego. This interface between seeing oneself seeing and ego formation is described by Lacan as constituting the s ubject. He describes what he calls a mirror stage, when a young child (between six and eighteen months) first recognizes a mirror reflection as representing i t- self. When this recognition occurs, a disjointed identity, characterized by undisciplined motor f unctions, is replaced by a 'proper body, ' a gestalt , a whole that the gaze appropriates as itself in its encounter with its mirror re f- lection. Because the mirror reflection lies outside the self, the 'I' as well is alien or other, constituting the subject as self -different, split. Michel de Certeau comments as follows: Though the child has only dispersed, successive and mobile corporeal exper i- ences, he receives from the mirror the image that makes him one, but accor d- ing to a fiction . With a 'jubilatory activity ' [affairement], he discovers that he is one (primordial form of the I), but by means of an alienation that identifies him with this thing that is other than him (a mirror image). The experience could be called: I am that. The I is formed only at t he price of alienation. Its capture begins with its birth... From the start, it installs the I as 'discordance of the subject with its own reality, ' and it calls forth the work of the negative ( 'It is not that ') by means of which the subject closes itself wi thin the lie of its ide n- tity ( 'I am that ').16 The mirror closes the subject within the lie of its unicity. Seeing itself as other to itself, the subject effaces its own self -difference, its own relationality. This identification with the fiction of the mirr or thus creates an alienated subject, who arms himself with the specter of unity, thereby giving rise to the 15 Jean-Luc Marion, 'Le prototype de l'image,' in Fran\u00e7ois Boesflug Douze si\u00e8cles 465. 16 Michel de Certeau, Histoire et psychanalyse: entre science et fiction , (Paris 1987), 223 -224. 206 ARIANNE CONTY unconscious as the memory of its fragmented embodied nature, its lack of singularity. Lacan writes: The mirror stage is a drama... that machinates t he phantasms that replace [se succ\u00e8dent] a fragmented image of the body with a form that we will call ortho- pedic of its totality, and with the finally assumed armor of an alienating ide n- tity...17 In the mirror reflection, the 'I' is thus already constituted as 'ideal I ' and thus already as ego: This form situates the instance of the ego [moi], even before its social determ i- nation, in a line of fiction that is forever irreducible for the individual alone.18 It is the ego as an ill usion or fiction of undivided totality that experiences a solitary exultation in recognizing itself as the independent object it has c a- thected. Caught in the mise -en-abyme of the mirror, self -consciousness is imprisoned in an identity that is 'whole, ' 'one,' and 'autonomously const i- tuted, ' forcing it to suppress its own lived experience of embodiment as u n- knowable, vulnerable and constituted by alterity. The unconscious, we could say, is the lived experience of the body, both intimate and alien, one's own, yet constantly eluding the conscious mind and its constitution of itself as subject, as ego. This Real is lost to consciousness when the child enters into the symbolic, but returns in moments of trauma and moments of jouissance , experiences that exist in t he realm of non -meaning, where they remain stranded, outside of language and cognition. This need to be 'all,' to enfram e the self as a controllable image attests to what Lacan calls, in psycho analytic jargon, 'the phallic function,' understood as the need to appropriate, label and hence control 'that obscure obje ct of desire' to ensure that it reflect s back to us our autonomous and inflated ego. This other who is transformed into a mirror, can be God (and mor e often than not the signifier 'God' seems to take on this function), just as it can be Woman, who reflects his maleness back to man, his self -esteem. Phallic jouissance thus reduces the other to an object that is imputed with causation, with having caused our desire (Lacan calls this object objet petit a ).19 As Bernard of Cla irvaux told us long ago in his sermon 'On Loving God,' because our desire is infinite, it can never find satisfaction in a finite object of desire. Similarly, for psychoanalysis, and I quote, ' phallic jouissance is the 17 Jacques Lacan, Ecrits (Paris 1966), 96. 18 Jacques 19 According to metonymy , objet petit a can be cathected as a breast or penis for instance . I THINK THEREFORE I AM NOT: MYSTICAL DESIRE AND THE DISPOSSESSION OF THE COGITO 207 jouissance that fails us, that disappoints us... it always leave s something more to be desired...'20 Moving beyond phallic jouiss ance , then, would leave the subject facing an infinite unknown that cannot be reified or sublated .21 The name that Lacan gives to this unknown is 'the obscure God,' thereby identif y- ing an apophatic experience of the divine with the end of the subject's alie n- ation from her own embodied nature. 2. THE OBSCURE G OD In his Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis , Lacan provides his critique of the autonomous Cartesian cogito in order to elucidate his central claim that the self is constituted by and as this unknown alterity. Just as Ec k- hart calls for God to think in and for man, so Descartes, according to Lacan, founded his thought outside himself by turning to a malin g\u00e9nie . Thus his I think therefore I am cannot fulfill its intended self -sufficient autonomy, for its negation of the world, of the body and of others is at the mercy of his malin g\u00e9nie 's whim. Even the fac t that he is certain, that is, that he has a clear and distinct idea that he is doubting and therefore that he is a thinking thing, has a cause exterior to his thought.22 This cause, because it cannot be overridden, fulfills Descartes' idea of God, and as s uch destroys it, for as infinite and pe r- fect signifier of truth, its role can no longer be distinguished from that of the malin g\u00e9nie , for both can manipulate the real. According to this reading, De s- cartes' other is neither clear nor distinct, and though h e cannot think it, it necessarily thinks him. In letting the g\u00e9nie possess his interiority, Descartes is unwittingly saying that only the other can think for him, and thus that he doesn't think ( 'je ne pense pas '). Jean-Luc Marion's extensive exegesis of D es- cartes is in fundamental agreement with Lacan, leading him to refer to the cogito as being constituted a-posteriori , as a res cogitans cogitate . Using De s- cartes' thought experiment , which begins with the cogito being thought 20 Bruce Fink, 'Knowledge and Jouissance ,' in: Bruce Fink & Suzanne Bernard (eds.), Reading S e- minar XX (NJ 2002), 37. 21 Roland Barthes describes this unknown other quite well in the secular context of love: '...That the other is not to be known; his opacity is not a screen around a secret, but instead, r eality and a p- pearance is done away with. I am then seized with that exaltation of loving someone unknown , som e- one who will remain so forever: a mystic impulse.

Descartes ( Meditations III) cited in The Rationalists , 137. 208 ARIANNE CONTY (whether by the evil genius o r by God changes little), and thinking only as a response, Marion describes the subject as fundamentally delayed, always a r- riving late to the event of its own constitution .23 Descartes' supposedly solit a- ry and self -sufficient subject is thus able to think itself only relationally, to a transcendent Other.24 Thus for Lacan, Descartes' I think therefore I am de- constructs itself in two important ways. Since the two I's it cites cannot be grounded in a united subject, Lacan dissociates the infamous conjunctive 'therefore' from the ontological clause that follows it, replacing it with what he calls the vel, the 'or' that separates the two clauses and reveals the subject to be fundamentally split (subject = $).25 'I think or I am,' we could say, or 'I think therefore I am not,' or even 'I am because the other thinks me .' Accor d- ing to psychoanalyst Gerard Miller, the Lacanian question thus becomes 'what am I in the desire of the Other?'26 The answer, for Lacan, is gi ven in his famous and oft -repeated phrase 'le d\u00e9sir de l'homme be rendered: 'Man's desire is the desire of/for the other [...] which is to say that it is as the Other that he desires.'27 Saint Francis could not have agree d more, for it was what Bonaventure called his 'burning desire' that led him to an identification with Christ such that Christ desired and suffered in him, as him. In infinitely desiring an infinite Other, the mystic desires an apophatic God from the site of its own apophatic unknowing: the body. Lacan calls this unknown other who cannot be reduced to a mirror image, 'the obscure God,' thereby using the apophatic tradition to illustrate a relation to the Other b e- 23 'I am insofar as originally thought by another thought [pens\u00e9 par une autre pens\u00e9e] that a l- ways already thinks me, even if I cannot yet identify its essence or prove its existence. I am already a res cogitans , but only understood as a thought that someone else t hinks, a thinking thought thought by another thinking thought - res cogitans cogitata... The first thought of the ego is, in fact, not about an object (certain or false), nor about itself, but about t he thought by means of which an other (or even an alterity [voire un autrui]) thinks it (persuades or fools it).

I THINK THEREFORE I AM NOT: MYSTICAL DESIRE AND THE DISPOSSESSION OF THE COGITO 209 yond the caption of the thinking self. I quo te from his Four Concepts of Ps y- choanalysis : '...in the object of our desires, we try to find the witness of the presence of the desire of that Other that I w ill here call the obscure God.'28 In seminar XX, ' Encore ,' Lacan clarifies how the subject is constit uted by the desire of this obscure God, explicitly placing his own work among the classics of the mystical canon, and thereby equating the goal of psychoanal y- sis and mysticism. He writes: These mystical ejaculations are neither idle gossip nor mere verbiage, in fact they are the best thing you can read - note right at the bottom of the page, add the Ecrits of Jacques Lacan, which is of the same order.29 Lacan's argument centers on replacing phallic jouissance with what he calls a 'supplementary jouissance,' which can be experienced only when one stands on the side of the 'not all.'30 He identifies this 'supplementary jouissance' as the goal of psychoanalysis, in that it acknowledges that we a re founded by an Other that we cannot possess and know. The mystico -psychoanalytic cure can occur only when, rather than obscuring this obscure origin, we can achieve jouissance by means of it, accept it as our origin and our destination. We, frail, needy, immanent creatures experience life and its joys only in rel a- tion to, and thanks to, others. The subject ($) thus comes to experience jouis- sance not through controlling and possessing, but by accepting embodied finitude by means of dispossession, surrender and unknowing. This, for L a- can, is what the mystics were able to achieve, for the most part women, but 28 Les quatre concepts fondamentaux de la psychanalyse , 306. 29 'God and the J ouissance of The (barred) Woman ,' in: Juliet Mitchell & Jacqueline Rose (eds.), Feminine Sexuality: Jacques Lacan and the Ecole Freudienne , (NY 1985), 147. This discourse places Lacan in a quandary that draws him even closer to the mystics, for the radical unknowing of the cogito is undermined by his own posit ion as 'sujet suppos\u00e9 savoir.' The difficulty of reading Lacan, then, is pr e- cisely analogous to that of mystical texts, for he is constantly using both kataphasis and apophasis to gain and then cross out his own authority. Jacqueline Rose thus writes: 'Muc h of the difficulty of Lacan's work stemmed from his attempt to subvert that position from within his own utterance, to rejoin the place of 'non -knowledge' which he designated the unconscious, by the constant slippage or escape of his speech, and thereby t o undercut the very mastery which his own position as speaker (master and analyst) necessarily constructs. In fact one can carry out the same operation on the statement 'I do not know' as Lacan performed on the utterance 'I am lying'... - for, if I do not kn ow, then how come I know enough to know that I do not know and if I do know that I do not know, then it is not true that I do not know. Lacan was undoubtedly trapped in thi s paradox of his own utterance.' Jacqueline Rose ' Introduction II ,' in: Feminine Sex uality , 50. 30 He develops this idea using the cultural distinction between man and woman, a distinction that has historically placed the (barred) woman on the side of the 'not all' because she has been unde r- stood by man as lacking the wholeness that is sym bolized by the phallic function. 210 ARIANNE CONTY also men, for just as women can identify with the phallic function, so can men identify with the 'not all.' He writes: There is a jouissance... of the bo dy which is, if the expression be allowed, be- yond the phallus ... There is a jouissance proper to her and of which she herself may know nothing, except that she experiences it - that much she does know... The mystical is by no means that which is not political. It is something serious, which a few people teach us about, and most often women or highly gifted people like Saint John of the Cross - since, when you are male, you don't have to put yourself on the side of the phallus. You can also put yourself on the s ide of not -all. There are men who are just as good as women. It does happen... De- spite, I won't say their phallus, despite what encumbers them on that score, they get the idea, they sense that there must be a jouissance which goes b e- yond. That is what we cal l a mystic...31 Lacan characterizes a mystic as experiencing jouissance not from the t o- tality and presence of the cogito , but from the detachment from this gras p- ing, the acknowledgment that desire is always desire for what is beyond our grasp as 'I,' as 'ego. '32 In this sense, the Other, whether human or divine, will play the role of the apophatic God, remaining transcendent and ever beyond our caption . If the mystic does not know, it follows that she must be exper i- encing jouissance from a place that is necessa rily other to the cogito , the cogito 's other, which is to say, the body. Should we then consider Lacan an apophatic mystic of sorts? The prophet of a postmodern apophatic theology? The relationship between L a- canian psychoanalysis and Christian phenomenology is not as tenuous as it might at first appear.33 In a certain reading, both seek to rehabilitate fallen man: Christianity by means of a transcendent God, with the help of Scripture which relates a revelation; psyc hoanalysis by means of the transcendent (or subscendent) unconscious, with the help of language which betrays a me m- ory of Adam before his Fall into the symbolic. Instead of Christ, psychoanal y- sis offers humanity the psychoanalyst, who is, like Christ, a pr esent absence, 31 Jacques Lacan in Feminine Sexuality , 146 -147. 32 I quote from Lacan once more: 'As regards the Hadewijch in question, it is the same for Saint Teresa, - you only have to go and look at Bernini's statue in Rome to understand immediately that she's coming, there is no doubt about it. And what is her jouissance , her coming from? It is clear that the essential testimony of the mystics is that they are experie ncing it but know nothing about it.' Jacques Lacan in Feminine Sexuality , 147. 33 Michel de Certeau noticed this correlation, and comments extensively on the monotheistic r e- ligion that 'haunts the house' of psychoanalysis in his work Histoire et psychoanal yse: Entre science et fiction (Paris 1987). See especially pages 258-260. I THINK THEREFORE I AM NOT: MYSTICAL DESIRE AND THE DISPOSSESSION OF THE COGITO 211 and like Christ the instigator of a revelation that his invisible gaze (the p a- tient is seen but does not see) helps to disclose. After stating that his own book should be treated as a mystical text , Lacan clarifies what it is that he believe s in: ...naturally, you are all going to be convinced that I believe in God. I believe in the jouissance of the woman in so far as it is something more... Might not this jouissance , which one experiences and knows nothing of, be that which puts us on the path of ex -istence? And why not interpret one face of the Other, the God face, as supported by feminine jouissance ?34 The psychoanalytic cure then, involves the ability to identify with the site of jouissance , the body as organism, which is to say the unconsci ous, before it has been transformed into an 'ideal I, ' by means of language. As Bruce Fink explains, 'The I is not already in the unconscious. It may be everywhere pr e- supposed there, but it has to be made to appear.'35 Lacan can thus be seen as using a myst ical technique to show that the subject is precisely where it ca n- not constitute itself as a thinking thing. The 'I' must associate with this u n- thinkable site and learn to speak in the first person in 'its' name . The 'I' that is to say, can only find itself where thinking does not go. ' The real is here that which always returns to the same place - to the place where the subject in so far as it thinks, where the res cogitans, does not meet it.'36 The real, then, as the certainty that the 'I' will always find i tself where thinking does not go. In this experience of jouissance , where the subject ex -ists, the mystic finds he r- self before that 'essential object which is not an object any longer, but this something faced with which all words cease and all categories fail, the object of anxiety par excellence. '37 To accept this experience as the moment of truth is what the mystic and the cured psychoanalytic patient share in common. We are now in a position to answer the question with which we began. If we are to take s eriously Lacan's analysis of ecstasy as an embodied jouissance that is an opening to an Other that cannot be utilized by reason as one more object to be understood and mastered, what is left behind by the mystic is not the body, but the cogito as set over and against our embodied vulne r- abilities, over and against the Other in its radical otherness.

ENGLERT Ruprecht -Karls -Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg, Germany ABSTRACT This paper offers a critique of empirical tests of the free will, aiming at a pr e- supposition underpinning the experiments' methodology. The presupposition is that the artificial reporting of machines is prima facie directly congruent with the first -person perspectival report of the participant. A critique of the method reveals the problematic nature of this methodological set -up. The phenomenological critique, however, also carries implications for a theoretical framework dealing with 'embodied' religion; these implications will be di s- cussed via reference to the art icle by Marcel Sarot. KEYWORDS free will, empiricism, phenomenology, methodology, intention, embodied religion 1. INTRODUCTION Empirical experiments testing the free will supposedly prove that the human agent is controlled by an unconscious urge to act. Many philosophical 214 ALEXANDER T . ENGLERT critiques criticize only this result, thereby implicitly accepting the methodo l- ogy itself as unproblematic. I propose, however, that the methodology itself is seriously problematic from the start . Therefore, in this paper I pursue a dif fe- rently aimed critique, one that examines exclusively the methodological set - up of the experiments. It is my hope to show that a prima facie presuppos i- tion underpins the methodology, which 1:1 comparison between artificial elements and phenome nological elements. This presupposition p o- sits congruency where, instead, one finds evidence of fundamental, categor i- cal differences, and is ipso facto unfounded. Granting this presupposition leads in evitably to a comparison of apples and oranges on the on e hand, and pictures or videos or long exposure shots of apples and orang es on the other hand. Moreover, and of pronounced importance in the context of embodied religion, these considerations resonate with a modern theoretical account of religious experien ce at the crossroads of empirical science. The paper divides into four parts. My attempt to describe the basic m e- thodological structure of the experiments constitutes the first part. In the second part, I unpack the basic presupposition underlying this met hodolog i- cal structure. Then, the third part is the space in which I argue (via phen o- menological considerations) against this prima facie presupposition of the congruency supporting the experiments' results. Finally, in the fourth part I move the discussion in the direction of philosophy of religion, by focusing on the philosophical -theological position of Marcel Sarot. 2. A BREAKDOWN OF THE EXPERIMENTS ' METHODOLOGICAL STRUCTURE I want to describe the basic structure of the free will experiments con- ducted by Benjamin Libet1 and by John Dylan -Haynes .2 These experiments used different equipment but utilize d the same basic me thod to arrive at the same general result, namely that the brain 'decides ' unconsciously to a ct be- fore the person does. This result arose out of a comparison of two reports from independent operations . First, a programmed device measured and re c- orded the participant's relevant b rain activity (this is the 'artificial' oper a- tion). Second, the participant made a movement and reported when she was 1 Benjamin Libet et al. , 'Time of Conscious Intention to Act in Relation to Onset of Cerebral A c- tivity (Readiness -Potential),' Brain 106 (1983), 623 -642. 2 John Dylan -Haynes et al. , 'Unconscious determinants of free decisions in the human brain,' Na- ture Neuroscience 11/5 (May 2008), 543 -545. EXPERIENCE AND E MPIRICISM IN TESTING THE FREE WILL: WHAT PHENOMENOLOGY O FFERS A DISCUSSION O F EMBODIED RELIGION 215 consciously aware of her intention to act (this is the voluntary and, thus, 'i n- tentional' operation) . The artificially generated report showed activity in the brain preceding the participant's conscious intention to move spontaneously. The precedi ng electrical activity in the brain has been dubbed 'readiness p o- tential.'3 Let u s examine these operations. The artificial operation of report ing measures brain activity precisely by capturing linear, static moments . In the experiments by Libet, a reading of electrical impulses in the brain occurred via electroencephalography (EEG) readings, which showed brain activity about 500 milliseconds before the participant's reported time of conscious - urge. In Dylan -Haynes' experiments, the investigators used funct ional ma g- netic r esonance imaging (or, fMRI) to track brain activity, by noting regions of the brain needing more oxygenated blood during the participant's compl e- tion of the assigned task. The fMRI readings showed brain activity preceding the time of the co nscious urge to act by 7 -10 seconds and could be used to predict roughly which hand the participant would move.4 Both artificial techniques record the when and the where of activity occurring in the brain by precise measurements of time in a linear (or obj ective) series of static moments. The second report (in both experiments) is a self -reported , intentional moment of the participant. The participant should make an intentional movement fulfilling a conscious urge, and then report the time that she was cons cious of this 'urge .' In the Libet experiment, the participants reported the time by taking note of the position of a rotating , blinking light. In the Dylan - Haynes experiments, they were asked to remember a projected letter of the alphabet flashing on a sc reen before their faces. The action and the concom i- tant operation of reporting is completely embedded in the first -person per s- pective; the temporal framework is necessarily one of conscious time - the subject must be able to say, that in her present, her conscious urge happened before her intentional act. A problematic prima facie presupposition, however, underpins the co m- parison of these operations . To understand this presupposition upon which 3 Libet, 'Ti me of Conscious Intention to Act,' 623: 'The onset of cerebral activity clearly preceded by at least several hundred milliseconds t he reported time of conscious intention to act.' 4 Dylan -Haynes, 'Unconscious Determinants of Free Decisions,' 544: 'Indeed, we found that two brain regions encoded with high accuracy whether the subject was about to choose the left or right response prior to the conscious decision.' 216 ALEXANDER T . ENGLERT the comparison is grounded, let us examine this methodological structure with a philosophical gaze. 3. THE PROBLEMATIC PRESUPPOSITION Neuroscience of this kind attends the person as both an object and as a subject. As such it assumes necessarily that one's neurological activity corr e- lates in some ordered way to one 's thinking. In many instances, this leads to quite pragmatically satisfactory ends. Discovering the source of somatic pain, for example, allows for its alleviation. Noting a lesion in the brain can illum i- nate the source of mental afflictions. The correlat ion between the hammer, which I drop on my toe, and the resulting pain is not contingent, rather fills in a conditional proposition. If hammer falls on big toe, then pain ! Such pragmatism, however, can be stretched overzealously to explaining away the ment al completely. 'Overzealously,' because clear -cut cases of somatic pain cannot justify similar correlative attempts regarding intention. The probl e- matic presupposition of the free will experiments grows out of this basic principle of correlation that bolst ers empirical experiments in the natu ral sciences. Without intending to simplify the phenomenal experience of 'clear -cut cases' of pain, the case of intentional action does seem to present two good reasons for requiring different treatment when attempting to squeeze it into correlative relations. First, we feel intention to be the movement from a men- tal event to a physical event, which contrasts the causal correlation in simple cases of pain. Second, a supposition of an empirical correlation ignores that this mental event arises with ends in mind, instead of pure effects. Ends b e- long to a contextual web involving one's personal history, one's cultural env i- ronment, along with one's interpersonal network - thus, demanding herm e- neutic considerations along wit h empirical descriptions. Intention , therefore, requires attentive unpacking since it is an essential building block of the e x- periments, i. e., move when you feel the urge to do so . A discussion of intention in the context of the experiments is also of special prevalence because a common critique of the results of the free will experiments claims that the experiments fail to measure real intention. J\u00fcrgen Habermas, for example, refers to the free will as the 'reflected' or 'del i-EXPERIENCE AND E MPIRICISM IN TESTING THE FREE WILL: WHAT PHENOMENOLOGY O FFERS A DISCUSSION O F EMBODIED RELIGION 217 berated will',5 from which fo llows that the experiments deal with an insuff i- cient sort of intention since the participant should decide to move spont a- neously. Such an insightful argument , however, treats the spontaneous a c- tions as a sort of inferi or subspecies under the genus 'i ntenti onal action,' as though this concept were clear. I think that these critiques, however, are wrong in not taking the spontaneous actions as serious elements within the sphere of intentional actions, for they beg the question: How can we call d e- liberated act ions intentional, if the physical (spontaneous) actions, which they comprise and which are voluntary, belong to a separate intentional d o- main? Or put differently: where does ' real' intention begin and end? These questions I think block the progress of the above -mentioned critiques and give reason to hesitate before accepting immediately that the experiments fail to measure 'real' intention, whatever that is. These questions resonate with G.E.M. Anscombe's thinking in Inten- tion.6 In her example that runs fro m \u00a723 through \u00a726, an example of a man pumping well water is offered. Along with the act of pumping - taken as a purely physical motion willed by the pumper - the man may intend to pump to a specific rhythm, intend to resupply water to a house of politicos (with a malevolent agenda), and (simultaneously) intend to do these actions with the knowledge that the water has been poisoned. The series of intentions i n- volved may be 'swallowed up' by that intention ' with which ' the man performs the series of connecte d acts.7 In other words, the intention to move his arm, the intention of drawing water from the well, and the intention to resupply the house with water, may be subsumed under the lead intention of poiso n- ing those men. Intention becomes manifold in these c onsiderations; it r e- mains anything but diaphanous and basic. The intention to act is not found in any one place or another, rather spread throughout the composite action as a whole. A spontaneous, intended movement makes up a salient moment within the arc of intentional action. It follows that we should take free, spo n- taneous action seriously for the sake of our de liberative actions, which build upon its Naturalismus und Religion: Philosophische 160, my translation. 6 G.E.M. Anscombe, Intention (Cambridge, Massachussetts 1957). 7 Anscombe, Intention, \u00a726, esp. 46. 8 John Bishop, in 'Exercising Control in Practical Reasoning: Problems for Naturalism about Agency,' in Philosophical Issues , 22, Action Theory (2012), refers to spontaneous, unreflected action as 218 ALEXANDER T . ENGLERT Let us draw these considerations over into the free will experiments. What do the investigat ors understand as intentional action? Three basic su p- positions form this understanding that leads to the presupposition to be cri t- icized. To begin, the investigators study intention to act in contrast to uni n- tentional action. The spontaneous action of the participant moving her hand should not be a random spasm or carried out under hypnosis, i. e., the exp e- rimenters set out to measure action free from all external determinants. The act should be determined by an internal intention to do so. Intentional a c- tion, however, cannot remain a purely internal factor and at the same time be understandable. An intentional action as such is in some way an amalgam of both internal factors and external factors centered about the person. Thus, the intention to act must sec ondly extend beyond the internal in- tention to move one's hand; an intentional action is nothing if not enacted. Beyond the internal intention to move, that which matters is the amalgam a- tion between an internal content and the external realization of this c ontent. This amalgamation might be posited as the keystone to the entire exper i- ments' validity. After all, if no amalgamation existed between an intention and an actual action, then the second report originating from the first -person perspective would beco me absolutely superfluous. One could say, in other words, 'These actions are mysterious. Let us look in the brain to see where they come from,' without needing to ask the participant at all. On the co n- trary, the experiment seeks to explore the connection b etween the activity of the brain and the everyday thoughts in which we posit intentions. Finally, the correlation of the temporal awareness of the intention to act and the action itself cannot be supposed as separate or isolatable. This pro p- osition also fi nds resonance in the thinking of Anscombe. Whatever inte n- tion is, it must remain a member of a 'class of things known without observ a- tion.'9 Intention must be something directly knowable. If an intention to act were only realizable through observation, the n two absurd consequences would follow. First, if the movement of one's hand does not correlate to a specific intention to do so, then one must search for a separate cause, e. g., a consisting in 'sub -agential' components that 'belong to what realizes the action' (12). Here, as above, the argument grants naturalistic accounts those actions requiring little -to-no reflection, while seeking higher ground by attending truer, or more paradigmatic cases of intention, or as Bishop puts it, 'real agency' (13). Although insightful and differentiated, I cannot see how one can successfully draw a line between intentional actions of a sub -agential kind, and those of a real kind, and avoid falling into some sort of dualistic picture. 9 Anscombe, Intention , \u00a78, esp. 14. EXPERIENCE AND E MPIRICISM IN TESTING THE FREE WILL: WHAT PHENOMENOLOGY O FFERS A DISCUSSION O F EMBODIED RELIGION 219 hypnotist or mind -controlling genius \u00e0 la Dr. Mabuse. 'I moved my hand,' requires a direct relation - an intimate relation, one might say, with the co r- relating action. Without something extra to fill this descriptive gap, everyone would be in d anger of falling under the term 'moved things.'10 Second, an i n- finite regress would for ce itself into discourse. If only indirectly aware of her movement, the mover would need a separate vantage point within herself from which she observed the movement, which would continue ad in finitum. Both of these consequences derail theoretical -explicat ive attempts complet e- ly. To summarize, we must take the spontaneous action tested in the exp e- riments seriously since deliberative intentions interweave with the substrate of spontaneous intentions. Also, we can succinctly synthesize the three ch a- racteristics that an intention to act comprises within the context of the exp e- riments. First, an intention to act involves an internal aspect basic to exp e- rience. Second, this internal aspect must essentially complete itself in exte r- nal realization to count at all. These first two characteristics represent two necessary, inseparable halves of the intentional whole. Third, the amalgam a- tion between the internal aspect and the external realization should be di- rectly known without recourse to observation. Withou t knowing more about intention as such, we can posit a greater understanding of that which the experiments must suppose as occurring du r- ing the reporting of the participant. The participant, in contrast to feeling pain, should affect , instead of being a ffected. Due to the assumption that this movement is (i) a unified amalgam of a basic kind between one internal and one external aspect that constitute a singular moment, and (ii) an amalgam about which the participant should be directly conscious , the presup position is that a comparison with other basic, and directly knowable information is u n- problematic. The artificially recorded information represents information, which may also be individuated into basic, comparable elements. Thus, the experimenters presum e that a comparison between a person's self -reported intention to act and measurements from machines poses no inherent contr a- diction. 10 Or, consider if you move and then were asked, 'How did you know you really moved?' The movement is mine without needing to refer to some mediating relation - no degree of separation exists between my pushing the button now and my intending to do so. 220 ALEXANDER T . ENGLERT The presupposition, phenomenologically speaking , is that the only s a- lient moment to be considered in a person's first -person perspective is this internal moment of intention, which is directly attached to the actual action without requiring observation. This presupposition trivializes the rest of the first-person perspective, treating it as irrelevant to the precipitant momen t of action. Yet, even if we were to grant the investigators the point and forget all overarching phenomenological complexity, the presupposition would still remain problematic. For when considered in a phenomenological light, even the ostensibly basic mom ent of willed (and, thus, intentionally) spontaneous action embedded within the first -person perspective consists of at least two acts, where the presupposition posits only one. 4. IN A PHENOMENOLOGICAL LIGHT Let us now consider specifically those operations of reporting that are at play in the experiments testing the free will. First, both operations of repor t- ing focus on the same trigger -event. A movement occurs, which the subject (necessarily) intends. Second, two operations should report the occ urrence of this movement. The first operation of reporting is the measurements by the artificial, mechanical devices involved, which react automatically; they co n- sist in a chain of single actions . We must suppose a pure cause -effect relation with regards t o the recording actions of the devices. If our artificial means for recording information consisted of the same layering found in embodied pe r- ceptual consciousness, then they could hardly offer accurate measurements. Furthermore, the reports created by the se operations are static in the sense that the data remain intransigent to external manipulation. As much as one may like to rearrange a bad photograph of oneself, the pixels remain ( sans technical manipulation) fixed upon the paper; just so, a major tenet of empi r- ical natural science, is that the data are static pieces of information, which remain the same regardless of one's point (and time) of view. The data are fixed - because the operation fixing them is designed to do just that - freeze and capture th at which comes before it, and only that which it is designed to freeze and capture. The other operation of reporting is the intentional self -reporting e m- bedded in the first -person perspective of the participant. When considered in a phenomenological light, even the so -called basic or direct moment of spo n- taneous action (as discussed in the second part) consists in at least two a c-EXPERIENCE AND E MPIRICISM IN TESTING THE FREE WILL: WHAT PHENOMENOLOGY O FFERS A DISCUSSION O F EMBODIED RELIGION 221 tions. First, the urge or decision to act occurs and one is simultaneously aware of this. Second, the participant must combine thi s initial act 1 with the perceptual and cognitive act 2 of marking this felt urge by remembering the position of an external timepiece. These two acts, albeit banal when co m- pared with more complex activities and tasks, reveal the implicit complexity of our e xperiences. If asked, a participant could not locate the interval b e- tween the two acts because the two acts occur as if they were one more co m- plex act. Pointing out that in fact two acts fill the space where an elementally simple action is postulated provi des enough potency for revealing a basic asymmetry - especially, when one considers that these two acts interweave with the ever -unfolding history of the participant in affective embodiment. Where empiricism posits a simple datum, we actually find a multi -faceted action, which cannot be boiled down to a single, basic element.11 But are they truly two acts? The basic considerations of the experiment postulate that this moment of intention, at least in theory, should be just as immediate as any other immediate action. We should be able to move spo n- taneously in some way no matter how confined the space. The investigators, however, want consciously considered, spontaneous freedom, indicated by an awareness of the time that one was conscious of the urge to act. Thus, two acts do occur, and necessarily so for the sake of the experiment, which wants not just arbitrary pressing of buttons, rather decidedly timed pushing of bu t- tons. The person does not simply move. The person moves and at the same time makes conscious note of the position of an external timepiece. Although not requiring any grandiose physical movement, a second act coinciding with the pressing of the experimental button should indeed occur via the co n- scious attention given to a moving, external object. The two acts are not only logically present in the executed action; they are, in fact, implicit in the i n- structions given to the participants by the investigators. The experiment r e- quires that both acts occur. It simply forgets to take into account the pre con- dition for such multi -faceted actions occurring in the first place: namely, an unfolding presence of mind permanently constituting such multi -faceted moments. 11 For an account of the impossibility of reducing the experiential experience of time down to b a- sic, singular elements, cf. Henri Bergson, Zeit und Freiheit [Essai sur les donn\u00e9es imm\u00e9diates de la co n- science , Paris 1889] (Jena 1911), esp. 134ff. 222 ALEXANDER T . ENGLERT Drawing attention to this complexity does not require technical la n- guage of the classic phenom enological sort (although such language would be easy to find). Instead, the complexity is so unmistakably evident from our everyday experience that we mistake it as constituting data, which may be compared without question to the information measured by automated m a- chines and manipulated immediately by algorithms of computer programs. This presupposition, which supports the methodology of the experiment, fails. For, if forced to compare the two processes, then the asymmetry of the (i.) statically preprogr ammed , next to the (ii.) dynamically (i.e., lived) multi - faceted , necessarily refutes prima facie claims of congruency. Yet, is it not possible to deny this claim of inherent incongruence b e- tween the operations evidentially? It is precisely the insight (qu ite literally, in-sight) offered by fMRI readings, which is cited as the final nail in the coffin of free will. How can it be that readings from the machine allow (albeit with some margin of error) predictions of which hand the participant will move 7 - 10 seconds before the actual 'conscious' act? To such a rebuttal, one must again turn to the methodological presu p- position of the experiment. When brain activity in the frontopolar and p a- rietal regions of the brain is being detected 10 seconds prior to the a ction, the key question goes unasked: namely, what is going on within the thoughts of the participant prior to and during those 10 seconds? The reason that this question goes unasked is due to the basic presupposition of the experiments, which is that the free will we want to measure is of a basic, directly knowable kind. It is solely the pushing of buttons, which counts as an immediate and directly knowable moment. The problem with such a presupposition is that the simplification of the self -reporting oper ation whittles the enlivened pa r- ticipation down to a flash of intentional action.12 When looking to the 10 seconds intervening between the onset of cer e- bral activity and the actual action, one understands why investigators forget the phenomenological contex t. After all, the participant is remaining as still as possible in those seconds for the sake of accuracy. Further, she is not in those moments supposed to be 'planning' her act, rather waiting to feel the conscious 'urge' to act. Thus, if complacent with the instructions, she should 12 See Fuchs, 'Verk\u00f6rperte (Heide l- berg 2010), 43, in which he refers to this simplification of the free will as one that presents it as being 'isolated' and 'lightning -like' (' blitzartig '), whic h further focuses the consideration at hand - the free will is set off in a vacuum (isolated) and so simple that it is practically elemental (lightning -like). EXPERIENCE AND E MPIRICISM IN TESTING THE FREE WILL: WHAT PHENOMENOLOGY O FFERS A DISCUSSION O F EMBODIED RELIGION 223 not be filling this temporal span with a mental countdown. And yet, in a phenomenological light, there is one more facet worth mentioning, which (as with the acts above) is required by the context of the experiment. This facet represents a sort of background tacit awareness: The participant, while fulfi l- ling the assigned tasks, should be simultaneously conscious of her role in the experiment. In other words, the experiment demands that the participant maintains in those 10 secon ds the constant and tacit knowledge that she is in an experiment with a pre -determined role to play. Thus, in those ten seconds she is, for the experiment's sake, conscious of her predicament and not da y- dreaming instead about lying in a hammock. By ignorin g this tacit, but n e- cessary consciousness, the investigators forget to be consistent regarding their presupposition. They forget that, even in the absence of visible mov e- ment, phenomenological acts and contents are definitely occurring just b e- low the surfa ce. In our phenomenological analysis, no supernatural material is necessary to explain these contents. A purely descriptive attentiveness finds the supp o- sedly basic action to be multi -faceted. Empirical investigations are important, but must also respect t he inherent complexity of the first -person perspective. Instead of rushing through presuppositions towards the coveted results, one must first honor the context. 5. WHAT PHENOMENOLOGY O FFERS A DISCUSSION OF 'EMBODIED RELIGION '13 With 'honoring the context' in mind, here are a few caveats regarding the following subsections. First, my personal background, along with the background of the discussed author, is a Christian monotheistic one. Second, the jump from the above critique into philosophy of rel igion may seem quite jolting. Yet, I think it is, in truth, quite logical. Finally, my considerations build upon only a fragment of theoretical considerations from a philosopher who has written a substantial corpus. Thus, the following points cannot do justice to the thinker at hand, nor can it offer a positive theory; instead it looks to implications arising out of the above considerations, which offer food for further thought. 13 The notion of 'embodied religion' arises from the conference title of this year's European Soci e- ty for the Philosophy of Religion (ESPR) Conference in Utrecht, the Netherlands. 224 ALEXANDER T . ENGLERT Why is the transition logical? It is logical, because free will is the sine qua non of moral responsibility. From the conception of 'moral responsibility' follows (necessarily) the notion of good and evil. It is then a short jump to religion, in which discourse abounds about an all -good God and our freedom to try and emulate this pa ragon of goodness. Thus, philosophers of religion must take seriously a free will experiment claiming that human actions are actually predetermined, not by the individual or God, but by an unconscious 'readiness potential.' Since this discourse includes ne cessarily talk rience , and phenomenology is the investiga tion of experience , it follows that our transition is well grounded. Moreover, the philosophy of religion cannot help but allow phenomenological considerations into discourse, as long as it welcomes the theme of the individual's religious experience as such. The discussion that follows resonates with a slightly disharmonic rel a- tion to one position maintain ed by Marcel Sarot in this volume . Principally, Sarot's contribution14 is insightful in its adumbration of the role that free will plays both in Christian religion and neuroscience. His denial, however, that the experiments in principle pose any challenge to our belief in free will finds disharmonic resonance with the above critique. 5.1. THE POINT OF DISHARMONY WITH SAROT Let us consider that aspect of Sarot's (quite enlightening paper) that fails to harmonize with the above considerations. The critical juncture deals e x- clusively with his treatment of the limitations of empirical experiments. First, let us consider the point that he wishes to make. Sarot begins by granting empirical experiments their due. Empirical experiments 'shed some light' on the question of free will.15 Specifically, he is willing to accept that science sheds light on 'a l imited class' of actions, which constitute 'random and pointless bodily movements.'16 In other words, the results of the exper i- ments should be accepted, as long as one simultaneously grants that the real class of free actions, namely, 'acts of moral or reli gious significance,' remain unaffected. Sarot accepts the experiments to be valid 'in principle,' but 'in practice' claims that they have no bearing on what matters. 17 14 Marcel Sarot, 'Christian Faith, Free Will and Neuroscience,' 115-119. 15 Sarot, Faith, Free Will and Neuroscience,' 117. 16 Sarot, 'Christian Faith, Free Will and Neuroscience,' 117. 17 Sarot, 'Christian Faith, Free Will and Neuroscience,' 117. EXPERIENCE AND E MPIRICISM IN TESTING THE FREE WILL: WHAT PHENOMENOLOGY O FFERS A DISCUSSION O F EMBODIED RELIGION 225 Reasons abound for doubting in principle such a claim of methodological validity. Briefl y, one could first show that such a presupposition overlooks the inherent incongruence of the compared operations. Yet, even circu m- venting this source of doubt leaves a serious problem, namely, the question of differentiation. How does one differentiate ac ts of fake intention from real intention, if the acts of fake intention, in the end, constitute the real ones? One can attempt, like Anscombe, to argue for a sort of 'swallowing up' of the micro -intentions within the macro -intention 'under which' the micro ones are executed. Such an attempt, however, maintains one form of intention e x- pressed multifariously, rather than two distinct species. Thus, we would co n- clude the opposite of what Sarot concludes , namely, that the experiments are limited not only in pra ctice, but also in principle, because intention makes no sense if reduced to a lightning strike of intention (i. e., extricated of all co n- text). Intention, even in 'pointless' acts, remains principally opposed to co m- plete reduction. Trying to answer the qu estion of where 'real' intention begins and ends poses a serious problem because such a division leads inevitably to dichot o- mies. Such dichotomies, however, may be acceptable for Sarot. I think, ho w- ever, that a dichotomy would remain, which would fail logi cally and which would be unacceptable even for Sarot. First, what sort of a free will is it that Sarot believes in? He writes: 'I d e- fend indeterminism with respect to human choices and actions.'18 If, howe v- er, empirical methods indeed were limited not in terms of 'principle,' but in terms of 'practice' (as he states), then the empirical methods in question, it follows, could (eventually) explain the 'real,' libertarian free will (i. e., the will free of all external determinants). This would, in turn, requ ire that empirical methods could reveal the 'why' of our actions more precisely than any first - person account ever could; they would essentially be capable in practice of finding the determining source. An empirical prescience could reach beyond simple pre dictions as to which hand one will use to press buttons. Accepting empirical research as in principle capable of finding the unconscious dete r- minants of spontaneous acts, would grant the hypothetical possibility of it finding the determinants of libertaria n, intentional acts as well. If this were the case, empiricism would reach beyond pure observation - it could literally discover within the participant the determinants before the late -working 18 Sarot, 'Christian Fait h, Free Will and Neuroscience,' 109. 226 ALEXANDER T . ENGLERT conscious ness itself had the faintest idea. The reasons we addu ce to defend our 'libertarian free will' would become epiphenomena of a compatibilist sort, which is precisely the position Sarot claims to oppose.19 In other words, the dichotomy would cut deeper than that of body and spirit; it would cut between (a) the omniscience of our science (and Creator) and (b) our pse u- do-knowledge. An empirical discovery would (in practice) undercut our own, direct grasp of our intentions. The only way of avoiding su ch a dichotomy is advocating that even 'random and pointless' bod ily movements are in principle irreducible when it comes to complete reduction under physical laws. 5.2. EMBODIED R ELIGION ? In summary, the ph enomenological complexity of experience revealed the problematic nature of experiments that treat it as basic. Following this thread, Sarot's position was discussed with regard to a critical implication taken from my critique. In contrast to Sarot, I advocated the complexity of intention for even the most 'random and pointless bodily movements,' 20 and defended them f rom prima facie reduction. But can we avoid a dualism between the phenomenological on one side and the physical on the other? Avoiding dualisms is a challenge. Conceptions dealing with embodiment, however, attempt to get around dualisms by trea t- ing the per son and her environment as a whole. It is impossible to think of a person living outside of an ecological environment, outside a cultural env i- ronment, or outside of an interpersonal environment. Thus, embodiment carries with it many dimensions, which carry undetermined weight in deve l- oping a person both physically and experientially. Embodiment is a concept used for avoiding dualisms - it introduces instead pluralisms. Our critique above revealed the essential contextual complexity of even unreflective move ments. Now, what does the embodiment hinted at in this critique have to do with religion? At first glance, the connection is nothing explicit . The embodied first -person perspective must not involve religion. A religious person, however, is religious within a context. Faith and doubt, pi e- ty and sin, these words mean nothing in a vacuum, because they, at least as far as they can be considered through experience, also begin and end in expe- rience . An embodied religion, then, in contrast to a purely systematic view of 19 Sarot, 'Christian Faith, Free Will and Neuroscience,' 108-112. 20 Sarot, 'Christian Faith, Free Will and Neuroscience,' 117. EXPERIENCE AND E MPIRICISM IN TESTING THE FREE WILL: WHAT PHENOMENOLOGY O FFERS A DISCUSSION O F EMBODIED RELIGION 227 religion, must incorporate the context of the person's direct experience. Al- though banal, a look towards religious experience wins much from the above considerations. Rather than reveal ing the complexity of simply moral, del i- berative acts, a more fundamental sphere was detailed, in which the di s- course defended the entire, saturated first -person perspective from redu c- tion. Thus, a religious experience wins from an embodied conception beca use value is placed on the experiential stream as such. Or put differently, emb o- died religious experience may play out on a physical stage, but referring to physical laws alone fails to elucidate such an experience's meaning. 228 ALEXANDER T .

Finally , the previously said opens out into showing in how far a movement 'back -to-religion ' implies a 'back -to- CHARLES HARTSHORNE 'S AND MCFAGUE 'S CONCEPTS OF G OD15 In Charles Hartshorne's point of view, God lives in a real, close, rec i- procal and bilateral relationship with each and every one of us. This God - creature -relationship is actually the center of Hartshorne's religious philos o- phy. Unlike classical theism, Hartshorne's neoclassical theism refuses to adopt Thomas Aquinas' idea of God being the 'unmoved mover .'16 In Har t- shorne's process theism, God is viewed as the cosmic power, which perm a- nently interacts wit h the local powers, thus with God' s creatures. God is co n- sidered to be dipolar, meaning that the one God has an absolute, unchanging and abstract pole on one side. Divine attributes l ike God's love, benevolence, God's essence and status as the highest, can be considered as eterna lly u n- changing. However , on the other s ide, God also interacts with God's crea- tures. Thus, the relative and changing pole refers to those attributes that are the concretion of God's abstract attributes. Therefore, the relative pole is the one existing in r elation to God's creatures. This interacting and flexible part of God influences God's creatures just like God is influenced by God's cre a- tures.17 For Hartshorne, 'to be ' means - in the platonic sense of 'dynamis ' - 'to 15 For a n analysis of Harthorne's concept of God, see also: Julia Enxing, Gott im Werden: Die Rel i- gionsphilosophie Charles Hartshornes 2013 (forthcoming)). 16 Cf. Thomas von Aquin, Summa Theologia e / Die deuts esp. Viney point s out that the argument of God's necessary unchangeableness stems f rom the Platonic tradition. In Pl a- to's Politeia each way of changeability is described as a lack of perfection. If one assumes that God is perfect, changeability is thus excluded. Cf. Donald W. Viney, Reading on Philosophy of Religion (2007) (unpublished m anuscript), 3 ; Daniel Dombrowski, 'Hartshorne, Platon und Changes: Die Religionsphilosophie Charles Hartshornes (Regensburg 2012), 53 -72, esp. 54 ; Charles Hartshorne, Man's Vision o f God and the CT 21964 ), 23; Charles Hartshorne, A Social Conception of God (New Haven; London 1967), 36, 143. 17 Cf.

Hartshorne: God, as personal. - Whitehead also assumes a dipolar nature of God. He describes the poles as 'primordial ' and 'cons e-232 JULIA ENXING have some kind of power ' and further: 'to be is to create .'18 Consequently, if God calls other entities into 'being' then those entities are God's co -creators, are the local powers. It follows that God cannot be considered as the only one having power, neither as almighty, without saying that God is just 'one of us.'19 God is superior to us, God cannot be surpassed by any one of us; howe v- er, God can and does constantly surpass Godself. Th is is why Hartshorne r e- fers to the divine as the 'self-surpassing surpasser of all .'20 God has the hig h- est pos sible power, the greatest influence, without being almighty or all - determining. In the process theistic point of view - as Hartshorne represents it - God's way of interacting with God's creatures is through persuasion .21 God's goal for the world consists in increasing harmony and in sight of this goal God persuades and guides the local powers. Furthermore, Hartshorne proclaims a panentheistic God -world -view. Panentheism states that the world is in God, in the same way as everything is in God, without saying that God and the world are identical - like the pantheistic position proclaims.22 quent nature .'

It becomes clear that the classical assumption that God and world are two completel y different parameters and that God stands on the one side while the world stands on the other side; while God is able to infl u- ence the world without being influenced by it, as Anselm of Canterbury states in his Proslogion ,23 is rejected by process theism. Hartshorne himself, but also feminist theologians like Grace Jantzen, Carter Heyward and Sallie McFague express the idea of the world being God's body. However, just like God's creatures have a body - or are bodies, as McFagues suggests in her book The Body of God24 - but are themselves more than pure bodies, God's world is God's body, but in a panentheistic sense, not saying that God and God's body are identical , even though the world can be considered as part of God's identity .25 McFague's theological c osmology is based on two pillars: her renewed theology of creation26 and her body -of-God concept.

Sallie McFague, 'An Earthly Theological Agenda,' in: The Christian Century January 2 -9 (1991), [http://www.religion - 152. 234 JULIA ENXING functions as a collective term for all kinds of bodies. Every entity - even atoms - can be understood as a 'body. ' I assume it being leg itimate to use the term 'creation ' - in the sense of a creatio ex profundis et continua27 - as an equivalent for 'God's body .' At this point, I do not consider it helpful nor n e- cessary, to go deeper into McFague's spiritualization of 'body ,' although I a s- sume that her idea of uniting spirit and body and comprehending body as ultimately related or entangled with spirit, opens up a new perspective that is especially interesting for her feministic approach as she succeeds to demo n- strate.28 However, I would like to stress McFague's idea of God's transce n- dence being immanent in the world respectively in creation. It is through our experience of the world that we experience God's radicalization of the divine immanence.29 Nevertheless, McFague makes a point by saying that all we can see and all we can exper ience is God's back. Thereby, she refers t o Exodus 33.23 b: '...and you will see my back; but my face must not be seen. ' (NIV)30 No one has ever or will ever succeed in seeing God's face. In the consequence, neither theology nor philosophy will find adequate terms to describe God's face; all we can (and should!) do, is turn our attention to the planet, which is a refle ction of God's back. We are 'invited to see the creator in the creation, the source of all existence in and through what is bodied forth from that source .'31 27 Cf. David R. Griffin, 'Process Theology and the Christian Good News: A Response to Classical Free Will Theism,' in: John B. Cobb & Clark H.

Viney, 'The Varieties of Theism and the Openness of God: Charles Hartshorne and Free - Will Theism,' 2 39-245), esp. 203f. There are diverse concepts respectively terms on creation as process theology understands it. While Viney talks about a creatio ex hyle (Viney, The Varieties of Theism and the Openness of God , 204.), Ke l- ler states a creatio ex profundis , cf. Catherine Keller, Face of the Deep: A Theology of Becoming (London; New York 2003), esp. 155 -228; Catherine Keller, \u00d6kumenische Sommerakademie Kremsm\u00fcnster 2005) (Frankfurt am Main; New York 2006), 39 - 57; Catherine Keller, 'Creatio der Monotheismus?

'The implication of this picture is that we never meet God unmediated or unembodied.

GOD'S WORLD GOD'S BODY 235 This concept, of an immanent -transcendent God, the idea that God is - somehow - present in the world, is described as 'embodied .'32 McFague even goes further by talking about 'The Cosmic Christ. '33 In this context, she claims a 'cruciform living ,' 'an alternative notion of the abundant life, which will i n- volve a philosophy of 'enoughness ,' limitations on energy use, and sacrifice for the sake of others. '34 Furthermore, McFague betakes the spirit -body -issue to expla in God's r e- lation to the world. Thereby, God is understood as 'the spirit that is the breath, the life, of the universe, a universe that comes from God and could be seen as the body of God. '35 She uses spirit instead of mind , because other than mind, spirit can be found in all creatures and entities of the universe. Doing so, sh e promotes cosmocentricism instead of anthropocentricism. Moreover, the spirit -body -analogy antagonizes a dualistic world approach as well as an association of the divine with the solely intellectual and controlling part, the one ordering and limiting the universe. Instead, spirit understood as the energizing and enlivening part interweaves every entity and allows for a th e- ology of nature, focusing the God -creature -relationship instead of just the God-man -relationship.36 We are only adequately described, if the spirit -body existence is taken into consideration. Neither our spirit nor our body su c- ceeds in properly characterizing us. Moreover, I assume most readers would agree that they are one person, with a bodily as well as spiritually world - approach, withou t considering it adequate to speak of two entities within one person. Comparably, McFague articulates one God, existing in a bodily d i- 32 Margit Eckholt, Sch\u00f6pfungstheologie und McFague (M\u00fcnchen 2009), 21. 33 Cf. McFague, The Body of God , 102, 179 -191. McFague's idea of the 'Cosmic Christ ' touches the following aspects: salvation occurring in creation, in the body of God (179); the interrelatedness and interconnectedness of creation and salvation (180); the liberation of nature from oppressions ( 'our oppressive practices ') (187); the healing of the and the nonhuman ( dant: Rethinking Theology and Economy for a Planet in Peril (Minn e- apolis, MN 2001), 14. 35 McFague, The Body of God , 144. 36 Cf. McFague, The Body of God , 144f. Hartshorne uses the mind -body -analogy as well as the body -cell-analogy to de scribe the God-world -relation. Cf. 'In sum, then, God's volition is related to the world as though every object in it were to him a nerve -muscle , and his omniscience is related to is [sic!] as though every object were a muscle -nerve . A brain cell is for us, as it wer e, a nerve -muscle and a mu s- cle-nerve , in that its internal motions respond to our thoughts, and our thoughts to its motions. If there is a theological analogy, here is its locus. God has no separate sense organs or muscles, because all parts of the world b ody directly perform both functions for him. In this sense the world is God's body. ' Hart- shorne, Man 's Vision of God , 185; cf. 174 -211. Cf. Viney, The Varieties of Theism and the Openness of God , 205. 236 JULIA ENXING mension - the world - and in one or perhaps uncountable incorporeal d i- mensions. At this point, the phenomenological expert s might not be amused by the undifferentiated usage of the terms 'Leib' and 'K\u00f6rper .' Keeping in mind that myriads of books have been written on that topic, and - to put it very simple - 'K\u00f6rper ' is usually used in a more scientific -physical sense while 'Leib' goes far beyond scientific aspects, I am not aware that either Har t- shorne or McFague emphasize the difference here. My main point in this a r- ticle is to analyze the consequences of the idea that God's world is under s- tood as God's body. I will do so in the next step, before making a point in sa y- ing that - based on the correctness of the arguments presented - living in a close relationship with God, that is living a spiritual life, necessarily implies a life respecting and protecting our environment, God 's world, the embodied God. 2. TAKING THE CONSEQUENC ES INTO ACCOUNT If Hartshorne and McFague are right, th en what we do does not only i n- directly, but directly affect God. On the one hand, Hartshorne and McFague stand in a long tradition of demo nstrating in how far God encounters us in other entities, or, to talk with Bube r, Levinas and Derrida - to only name a few - God is in 'the other .' On the other hand, the process theologian and the ecofeminist theologian accentuate a slightly different point that n evertheless affects us in an e ssential way: God encounters us not only in 'the other ' - in the sense of another human being or animal - but in 'nature .' The eco - theological perspective brings our environment into focus , nature in its mu l- tifaceted presences , thereby bringing man into his position as God's servant, thus the servant of nature, in contrast to his idea of being creation's crowning glory. If one takes the assumption of God's world being God's body seriously, one can provocatively say: ...If God is truly embodied in nature, the n God is not only in big trouble in recent years, moreover, God seems to be the subject of destruction. ...If God is truly embodied in nature, th en we do not only drive 50,000 species per year to extinction, we th en drive God Go dself to extinction. ...If God is truly embodied in nature, the n we deplete God, when we use up natural resources. ...If God is truly embodied in nature, th en we waste God, when we waste water. GOD'S WORLD - GOD'S BODY 237 ...If God is truly embodied in nature, the n we harm God, when we co n- tinue the emission of global warming gases, we expose God's body to a deat h- ly heat shock. Relating to McFague's spirit -body -analogy as one possible way of i m- agining the idea of God's world being God's body, one might say that there is a difference that is not properly taken into consideration here : the difference between God and us. Just because our bodies experience illnesses, harm and pain suggests nothing about God's body having those experiences. The diffe r- ence might be that - unless us - God is perfec t. Therefore God's body has to be immortal, inviolable , always healthy, while we are the incomplete and fal- lible creatures, thus sinning and suffering fro m the consequences. Har t- shorne agree s, using the following example: Just because a house consists of many small rooms does not make the house small.37 Just because we are p a- nentheistically in God, and we are sinners, does not lead to a sinful God. In the same way Hartshorne does not see a conflict considering this imperfect world as God's body. However, in the consequence of Hartshorne's body -cell- analogy, God does not necessarily experience pain in the same way as God's bodily members do, but God suffers just like we - as a whole - suffer, when we, for example, cut our finger or break our leg. It is not jus t the finger or the leg that is suffering, we suffer. Thus, in a sympathetic, bilateral, panentheistic God-creature -relationship, God somehow suffers with God's creatures. Furthermore, considering God's creation as an ontological necessity - as Hartshorne does - leads to the assumption that God necessarily needs a body. This world is contingent, but a world - any world - is necessary.38 God 37 Cf. Hartshorne, The Divine Relativity , 145. 38 'But th e divine fiat must be as good as any other possible one. Thus God is free in what he does, and yet is not free to act in inferior fashion. He is slave to his goodness, if you will. But he can express this goodness as he pleases in any world arrangement tha t is not inferior to any possible other, so far as God determined or might determine it. ' (Hartshorne, The Divine Relativity , 137f.) 'God requires a world, but not the world. By contrast, what the world requires is not simply a God but the one and only pos sible God, the Worshipful One. ' Hartshorne, A Natural Theology for Our Time , 64f. Cf. Har t- shorne & Reese, Philosophers Speak of God , 22; Griffin, Process Theology and the Christian Good News , 12; Griffin, 'In Response to William Hasker,' 247 -253. Hartshorne, 'Das metaphysische System Revolution, ' 9; M\u00fcller, ' Gott - An Inquiry into the Christian Sense of the Presence of God (Leuven 2006), 82. 'Finally, the issue over inco r- poreality is tied up with the issue over creation. [...] Hartshorne argues effectively that God is related to the world in two crucial respects as a human mind is relat ed to its body: (1) God is aware, with max i- mum immediacy, of what goes on in the world, and (2) God can directly affect what happens in the world. On the principle that what a mind (1) is most immediately aware of and (2) has under its direct voluntary con trol is its body, Hartshorne concludes that the world is God's body, and hence that God is not incorporeal. But this analogy can be pushed through all the way only if, as Hartshorne holds, the 238 JULIA ENXING could have had a different body, ma ybe God has one we do not know of, but a body - any body - is presupposed in order to 'furnish the World Soul with awareness of, and power over, its bodily members. '39 At this point, I will br iefly summarize the main statements as well as a r- guments so far: In the first place , God's world can be understood as God's body. Thus, the world is within God, part of God, however, God is not a b- sorbed in the world; God is more than 'world .' God's world is the place of God's interaction with the world. Secondly , God l ives in a close and real rel a- tionship w ith God' s creatures, whereby 'creatures ' is understood in a broad sense embracing all created entities. Thirdly , what we do and what we fail to do influences God, with whom we live in a two -sided -relationship. Fourthl y, even though God's body is unique and cannot be equalized with creatures ' bodies, God's body is severely suffering in those times, if G od is - as Whit e- head puts it - '[...] the great companion - the fellow -sufferer who unde r- stands. '40 3. THE IMPL ICATIONS OF 'EMBODIED RELIGION ' Those assumptions lead us to the concluding statement that believers need to be more aware of their ecological footprints. Moreover, one cannot live in a close rel ationship with God; preach a lif e in harmony with God's will, thereby ignoring nature's dignity. Therefore, Christian religion is inevitably called to accept the challenge of integrating nature - in all its facets - into their gospel. It is provoked to stop tabooing human nature as well as env i- ronmental damage. Because as M cFague states: 'Christianity is the religion of world (some world or other) exists by metaphysical necessity, i ndependent of God's will. Otherwise God will not be corporeal in the strongest sense - essentially corporeal. Of course even if God brings it about by a free act of will that the world exists, we might still, in a sense, regard the world as God's body. But in that case it would be a body that He had freely provided for Himself, one that He could just as well have existed without. He would not be essentially corporeal. If we understand corporeality in this stronger sense, and Hartshorne does espouse it in th is sense, it is clear that it stands or falls along with Hartshorne's position on creation. If the classical doctrine of creation is retained, one can deny essential corporeality, while still agreeing with Hartshorne on relativity, contingency, and pote n- tiality.

GOD'S WORLD - GOD'S BODY 239 the incarnation par excellence . Its earliest and most persistent doctrines focus on embodiment: from the incarnation (the Word made flesh) and Christol o- gy (Christ was fully human) to the E ucharist (this is my body, this is my blood), the resurrection of the body, and the church (the body of Christ who is its head), Christianity has been a religion of the body. Christianity during first-century Mediterranean culture, which was noted for its disparagement of the body and its otherwordly focus, defiantly proclaimed its message of enfleshment. '41 And yet, Christian religion stands in a long tradition of e x- cluding, bashing, concealing and demerging man's bodily needs instead of facing the challeng e of integrating them into a Christian lifestyle. Similarly, it remains true to itself, by defying and neglecting the 'body nature .'42 However, if God is truly embodied in the cosmos , then we urgently need to think about what the actualization of 'embodied religion ' could be.43 Reading this article up to here took approximately 20 minutes.

It argues that the doctrine of the Trinity is closely connected with embodiment, and assesses Soskice's and D'Costa's answers to gender -related questions that have arisen from the connection between embodiment and th e Trinity. The aim of the article is firstly to prove that orthodox interpretations of the doctrine of the Trinity are not essentially exclusive to women, and secondly that the Trinitarian a p- proach provides an intriguing model by which to understand sexual diffe r- ence at the human level. KEYWORDS Trinity, incarnation, embodiment, gender, feminist theology, difference, se x- ual difference, relational subjectivity INTRODUCTION What do embodiment and the Trinity have to do with each other? The doctrine of the Trinity is often seen as the most abstract doctrine in Christian dogma, a doctrine that transcends not only our physical reality but our r a- tionality as well. In the present article, however, I shall argue that the do c- trine of the Trinity is closely connect ed with embodiment, by drawing on the work of Janet Martin Soskice, Professor of Philosophical Theology at the Un i-242 SOILI HAVERINEN versity of Cambridge and fellow of Jesus College, and Gavin D'Costa, Profe s- sor of Catholic Theology at the University of Bristol. Furthermore, I shall a s- sess their answers to gender -related questions that have arisen as a result of connecting the Trinity with embodiment. Common to Soskice and D'Costa is their view that the Trinitarian a p- proach is essential to contemporary assessments of embodiment in a Chri s- tian context. Soskice emphasizes that the connection between embodiment and the Trinity was already very close when the doctrine was first articulated. At the time, the need for a specific doctrinal formulation was practical rather than theoretical. It arose from the belief in God's incarnation, i.e. from the conviction that God was embodied as an individual person in Jesus Christ, as well as from the practical and pastoral questions that the early Church ass o- ciated with this belief. Th e doctrine of the Trinity was a response to the pro b- lem of how it is possible to simultaneously believe that there is only one God, and that Jesus truly is God in a human body. She clarifies the process as fo l- lows: 'The means, the tools at hand, were those of a Greek philosophy but the motives were pastoral and apologetic. The doctrine of the Trinity adds not h- ing extra to the basic Christian confession.'1 Although the notion of embodiment had already played an essential role from early on, gender -related questions concerning the Trinity and e m- bodiment did not arise until contemporary theology got underway in tandem with feminist approaches. Common questions posed by contemporary femi n- ists include the following. 'If God is embodied as a male, what have wome n to do with him? Are men essentially closer to God and are women excluded from divinity due to their gender?' Or, expressed metaphysically: 'How is the ge n- dered state of human being as Imago Dei related to God, and what is the rel a- tion between sexual diff erence at the human level and gender -related imagery in religious language?'2 My aim is to prove firstly that from orthodox interpretations of the doctrine of the Trinity it is possible to find answers to these questions that are not exclusive to women (or men), and secondly that the Trinitarian approach provides an intriguing model by which to understand sexual difference at the 1 Janet Martin Soskice, 'Trinity and Feminism,' in: Susan Frank Parsons (ed.), The Cambridge Companion to Feminist Theology (Cambridge 2002), 135 -150, esp. 136. 2 Soskice, 'Trinity and Feminism,' 138 -139.

Both Soskice and D'Costa reflect on these questions, striving to take the feminist challenge seriously, and to answe r them from within the Christian, mostly Roman -Catholic, tradition. INCLUSION WITHOUT FEMALE D IVINITY The French feminist Luce Irigaray formulates the feminist criticism of the Christian concept of the Trinity in terms of exclusive maleness in the follo w- ing way: Christianity tells us that God is in three persons, three manifestations, and that the third stage of the manifestation occurs as a wedding between the spirit and the bride. Is this supposed to inaugurate the divine for, in, with women? The femal e? Divinity is what we need to become free, autonomous, sovereign. No human subjectivity, no human society has ever been established without the help of the divine... There is no woman God, no female trinity: mother, daug h- ter, spirit.3 Irigaray demands that there be a female god and finds a possible candidate in the third person of the Trinity, the Spirit. She is not entirely alone here, for in early Syriac tradition the Spirit had been styled as feminine, because the gender of this noun in Semitic languages is female - ruha' in Syriac and ru\u00e2h in Hebrew. However, her motive for feminizing the Spirit is not historical or linguistic but rather ideological.4 She suggests that God's incarnation in Jesus Christ should be understood only as a partial incarnation an d that the fem i- nine spirit following him had made the incarnation complete. Only in that way would the Godhead include feminity and provide possibility of subjectiv i- ty for women.5 Gavin D'Costa accept s Irigaray's challenge and offers two compatible soluti ons to the problem she presents. In both, he rejects Irigaray's demand by highlighting that God's incarnation should not be understood as an exclusion of women even though God was incarnated as a man. First, God in fact did not only utilize Christ's male b ody as the instrument of salvation but the female 3 Luce Irigaray, Sexes and Genealogies transl . Gillian C. Gill (New York 1993), 62. 4 Janet Martin Soskice, The Kindness of God: Metaphor, Gender, and Religious Language (Oxford 2007), 112. Soskice, 'Trinity and Feminism,' 143 -144.

The physical motherhood of Mary thus proves that femininity cannot be contrary to divinity. Secondly, he partly agrees with Irigaray's argument that God's incarnation a s the individual male Jesus Christ could be understood as an incomplete incarnation.6 D'Costa , however, rejects Irigaray's view that the incarnation w as com- pleted only in the incarnation of a female spirit, because that would assign sexual difference withi n the Trinity. Instead, the incarnation w as completed only in the life of Jesus' resurrected body - the Marian church - which is add i- tionally depicted as the body of Christ and as his bride. This 'Church -body' has been described as a female body throughout history and will not be co m- plete until the eschaton . Every member - female and male - of the Church, the body of Christ, is a part of the salvific act of the Trinity. According to D'Costa, as members of Christ's body, members of the Church are also co - redeemers with Christ, as is Mary, the first Co -Redeemer. In spite of Irigaray's criticism of this model, women are not excluded, but have their own subje c- tivity by participating in the Trinitarian life as members of Christ's body, without having, however, a sovereign subjectivity. We shall shortly return to the concept of subjectivity later in this article.7 D'Costa also criticized Irigaray's call for feminine divinity, that her model would actually essentialize sexual difference in a way that would be alien to the Christian understanding of both man and woman being created in the image of each person of the Trinity. D'Costa as well as Soskice reject any attempt to assign sexual difference to the Trinity. They both emphasize that God is beyond human gender -limits, in other words he does not lack gender, but surpasses it, and therefore each of the three persons can be described with both male and female imagery. Furthermore, they both remark that in the previously mentioned Syriac tradition the Spirit was consi dered to be inferior to the Father and Son, and therefore feminine. This view is in contradiction with feminist purposes as well as orthodox understandings of the Trinity.8 D'Costa asserts that in assigning gender to the divine per se, Christian i- ty is in danger of idolatry, that is, of univocally assigning qualities from the created world to God. He writes: 'Analogy reminds us that any likeness that indeed exists always does so within a greater unlikeness and difference. To 6 D'Costa, Sexing the , EMBODIMENT AND G ENDER 245 forget this is to be idolatrous and anthropomorphic.'9 He suggests that 'it is in the relationship between gendered difference, not in gender itself, that we find the analogical bridge to the Trinitarian God.'10 Even Christians from other - non-Catholic - denominations, like m y- self, may find D'Costa's points fruitful and worth considering. Although the role of Mary and appealing to Marian dogmas may sound alien, his argument about being members of Christ's body is not far removed from the Lutheran dogma of common priesthood, for example. However, Lutherans would pro b- ably not talk about co -redeemers, but rather co -workers, or they would not say that Christ's incarnation was incomplete. Yet they could agree with D'Costa that men and women are members of the same body, the body of Christ and his Church -bride. According to this understanding, sexual diffe r- ence does not subvert common humanity but is compatible with it. The work of the Holy Spirit in the Church demonstrates the inclusion of both men and women in union with God. And this union is performed bodily in the sacr a- ments, in prayer, and in the Church's proclamation that repeats the unique event of incarnation like an echo. Further, Irigaray calls for a female god in order to establish the auto n- omy and subjectivity of women. In other wo rds, she wishes to change some divine attributes on account of her feminist purposes. But since God is by d e- finition a necessary being, the prime cause and mover of all existence who himself has no cause, would a god whose attributes are defined according to certain needs of certain people be God at all, or rather an idol? God has the desired influence upon culture, societies and the subjectivity of individuals solely as God, as an omnipotent, good, necessary and personal being. By changing the reference to the concept, its influence would be changed as well. It is not evident that any idol could provide help in establishing the subjectiv i- ty of women. Another question is whether Irigaray's ideal of subjectivity and autonomy is even desirable, but we shall re turn to this later. HOW TO INTERPRET THE GENDERED LANGUAGE OF THE TRINITY ? While Gavin D'Costa provided an interpretation of the continuing inca r- nation as an answer to the feminist challenge, Janet Martin Soskice's response 9 D'Costa, Sexing the Trinity , the Trinity , 246 SOILI HAVERINEN focuses on the interpretations of gendered imagery in Christian language. Soskice notes that questions concerning gender and the Trinity are not rel e- vant to feminist theologians who have already cast off the basic elements of the Trinitarian doctrine in their thinking. A ccording to her, the Trinity has essential significance only for those who have a reasonably high Christology, in other words, for those who wish to say 'Jesus is God incarnate .'11 To such persons she gives four reasons for adhering to the Trinitarian doctrine despite its ostensible masculinism. First she notes that the doctrine of the Trinity protects the otherness of God from anthropomorphism. One God with three persons is infinitely different from any human being. God is not a creature, or a male, al though he was incarnated as a man. 'Father' and 'Son' are not to be understood strictly in biological terms.12 Secondly, she sees the doctrine as defeating the main target of the f e- minist critique: covert monarchianism. The indifferent and distant god crit i- cized by feminist theologians is not the God of Scripture or the Trinity but rather the god of deism.13 She argues that the Trinitarian God of Scripture creates from love and is present in his creation. The Christian doctrine of the Trinity describes the wa ys in which God is with us all the way to incarnation, adopting human flesh and dying on the cross, and present among us in the Spirit.14 Thirdly, the Trinitarian doctrine endorses the fundamental goodness and beauty of the human being through the incarnati on. Jesus was true man and true God, and in him God became a fully and truly sexed human being in a real human body.15 But it is precisely this male embodiment of God that is a stumbling block for several feminists. However, if it is complicated for them to accept that God was incarnated as a man, what would the alternative be? What if God had been incarnated as a woman, but every other detail in the bibli cal narrative remained in place? What would change? If God had been born as a little girl from the Virgi n Mary without any contribution from a man, would this alternative not be rather exclusive of men? In that case would there not be a good reason for men to complain that they have no role in God's plan? A female god would have been born as a girl with a fe male body 11 Soskice, 'Trinity and Feminism,' 136 -137. 12 Soskice, 'Trinity and Femini sm,' TRINITY , EMBODIMENT AND G ENDER 247 from a female body, and men would have been completely unnecessary. But unlike that narrative, God, according to the Bible, employed both a female body and a male body to accomplish his salvific act, not, however, by alloca t- ing each an equal role , not by flattening sexual difference, but rather by co n- firming it. I think that it would be appropriate to ask whether the feminist interpretation of the exclusion of women is essentially a failure to recognize the significance of physical motherhood. In addition, D'Costa has noted that feminists probably would not accept a female incarnation either, because J e- sus ended up being violated and crucified. A tortured female savior would i n- stead be seen as affirming phallic violence against women rather than pro- scribing it.16 The fourth point Soskice makes relates to philosophical questions that have been articulated by postmodernists and contemporary feminists. Soskice regards the doctrine of the Trinity as challenging the 'philosophies of One' that constitute the same targets of both feminism and postmodernism. The doctrine of the Trinity moves us beyond the binarism of 'the One' and 'the other ,' where 'the other' is defined only as 'not me' and thus only serves the establishment of 'the One .'17 Soskice notes th at Trinitarian theology was orig i- nally formulated to counter a similar metaphysics of the One which does not allow any genuine otherness but in which the otherness is merely the 'Other of the Same .' The Trinitarian God is unity in difference and relational in hi m- self.18 None of the three persons can be understood as separate or indepe n- dent from the other two. The persons of the Trinity are only in relation to each other in a 'perichoretic outpouring of love.'19 Earlier in this article Luce Irigaray was quoted as calling for divine help in order to establish women's autonomy and sovereignty. In contrast to her view, the doctrine of the Trinity provides a quite different ideal for human subjectivity. As Soskice emphasizes, the persons of the Trinity exist only i n relation to each other, which means that genuine subjectivity is not to be found in distant solitude and autonomy but rather in loving relations with other subjects. This ideal is quite opposite to the feminist ideal of an indepe n- dent emancipated woman w ho could paradoxically be seen as a representation of the Cartesian ideal of subjectivity. 16 D'Costa, Sexing the Trinity , 62. 17 Here Soskice is reflecting particularly on Simon de Beauvoir's & Luce Irigaray's thinking. 18 Soskice, 'Trinity and Feminism,' HAVERINEN According to Soskice, the doctrine of the Trinity reveals that 'to -be' most fully is 'to -be-related' in difference.20 She refers to Augustine's De Trin i- tate where the imago Dei is considered to mean that human beings are created in the image of the Trinity instead of that of the Son, which is a male image. In this way Augustine rejected the implication that women were not created fully in the image of God long before f eminists set out their questions on the same subject.21 Soskice reminds us that it is not possible to avoid masculine terminol o- gy in Christianity 'as long as the New Testament is with us.'22 In contrast to the Old Testament, 'Father' and 'Son' in the New Te stament are very central divine nominations. Trying to replace the Christian language of 'God as F a- ther' would result in a new religion.23 Instead of replacing the language, Soskice is willing to draw attention to the reason why a gendered imagery is so cru cial in biblical writings as well as in the liturgical tradition. She remarks that the gendered imagery found in the Bible mainly involves kinship titles like 'Father' and 'Son ,' and concludes that the main purpose of the writers was not to emphasize sex b ut kinship, a close and loving relationship between God and human beings.24 Furthermore, the way in which gendered nominations are usually applied rules out literal rea d- ings of the imagery. As an example, the image of God as a rock giving birth, with him be ing both the Father and the spouse of Israel, are rather effective in detaching the metaphor from univocal anthropomorphic interpretations.25 CONCLUSIONS Will these answers satisfy feminists who have been worried about the masculinism of the Trinitarian doctrine? Feminists such as Luce Irigaray who wish to find an essential establishment of human sexual difference in the se x- ual difference that occurs at the divine level will certainly be disappointed. The Trinitarian doctrine does not justify assigning se xual difference univocally 20 Soskice, The Kindness of God , 21 'Trinity and Feminism,' 141. 22 Soskice, 'Trinity and Feminism,' 142. 23 Soskice, The Kindness of , 73. 24 Soskice, 'Trinity and Feminism,' 4 -5, 78. 25 Soskice, The Kindness of God , 76, 78 -79. However, she seems to disregard the fact that in the New Testament the designation 'Lord' is used about twice as often as the designation 'Father .' 'Lord' is a strong expression of authority and gender without any associations to kinship. TRINITY , EMBODIMENT AND G ENDER 249 to the Trinity. Instead of that, a feminist could be relieved that the Trinitarian doctrine does not describe divinity as one, or three, distant divine men but rather as one God in three persons, which transcends human gender def ini- tions. The Trinitarian God is present in his creation, especially as being born into this world - in a male body but through a female body. The Trinitarian doctrine asserts that both sexes can be employed as instruments of God's holy work and therefore neither of them as embodied beings is alien to God or e x- cluded from union with him. The most spiritual event of the incarnation was at the same time a thoroughly bodily event. In other words, the doctrine of the Trinity breaks the boundaries between spirit ual and embodied reality. Furthermore, I would suggest that the Trinitarian approach provides an intriguing model for understanding the concept of difference. The difference between the persons of the Trinity is not contrary to their unity but rather a force that draws them to each other in reciprocal love, from which the whole of creation originates. Although we cannot apply divine reality to human life univocally, it can open up for us a potential perspective in which difference is not necessarily seen as separating and alienating. Instead, some forms of di f- ference should rather be understood as being of a connecting nature, and therefore good as such. However, this view does not claim that all differences function this way. Some produce alienation, discr imination and oppression. Perhaps all diffe r- ences are capable of engendering these conditions if misinterpreted and m i- sused, if the goodness or likeness of God is attributed to one part of the diffe r- ence and wickedness correspondingly to the other. But if God as a perfectly good being contains difference within himself, it follows that human diffe r- ences, such as the sexual difference between men and women, can be cons i- dered as essentially good as well, as a part of the richness of divine self - expression. Se xual difference could be seen as a connecting force, not as di s- criminating but as binding humankind together through marriage and fam i- lies, and producing new life. In that case rejecting sexual difference in an a t- tempt to resist discrimination and oppressi on would be a mistake. A more fruitful approach would be to strengthen those interpretations of sexual di f- ference that emphasize both sexes as an imago Dei of the Trinitarian God. 251 14 Celebrating the Neuroscientific Body Sacramentally: Reading the B ody as Sacrament - A Radical Incarnational Theo-logos JOHANN -ALBRECHT MEYLAHN Faculty of Theology, University of Pretoria ABSTRACT Philosophy of r eligion can embrace the discoveries of neuroscience and thereby endorse these scientific texts, whilst offering a prophetic discord with regards to the reading of these texts. Certain neuroscientific discoveries are arguing for a radical immanence or total material embodiment, as everything can be explained via the internal neurological functioning of the body/brain. However, if one understands the body as text, how does this radical embod i- ment differ from the radical immanence of Derrida's famous statement that there is nothing beyond the text? This would open the way to interpreting the radical embodiment or materialism of neuroscience as something inter - and intra -textual with no beyond the text. Yet Derrida's famous statement is part of his auto -deconstr uctive reading of texts within their contexts and thus there is a radical openness towards the other (alterity), because of diff\u00e9rance. The task of philosophy of religion is to challenge the one -dimensional (closed/conclusive) reading of these texts (body as text), and rather argue for the radical openness of texts as something that is internal to the grammar of the text itself. In reading the body as a text, a neuroscientific text, such a rea d- ing remains fundamentally open to various readings thereby not d enying the discoveries of science, but embracing these discoveries as texts in need of reading. It is in the reading of these texts that philosophy of religion can play an important role - not in the traditional sense of bringing to the reading a l-252 JOHANN -ALBRECHT MEYLAHN ternative normative texts, but exploring the structures of texts and in the structural make -up of these texts discovering the role of faith, trust and hope in both the construction and reading of texts. This exploration of the fund a- mental structures of texts will f ocus on Derrida's 'grammar of faith ' and thus celebrate the neuroscientific texts whilst reading them sacramentally. KEYWORDS neuroscience, Derrida, Laruelle, faith, science, postfoundational epistemology, body, t ext In this article I will suggest that Wentzel van Huyssteen's proposal of a postfoundationalist epistemological space can facilitate a respectful and meaningful conversation, or as he argues, a fruitful duet between science and religion .1 In Duet or duel? he follows the developments in evolutionary epi s- temology2 to argue for a postfoundationalist epistemological space where there is an acute awareness and appreciation that no single reasoning stra t- egy can sufficiently house the complexity of human rationality .3 On the question of the development of the human mind/rationality (evolutionary epistemology) and the subsequent arguments for free will, co n- sciousness and responsibility, there are two main streams of arguments that can be broadly identified. The firs t is that everything can be explained bi o- logically4 which can be described as a naturalist argument or as radical bodily immanence. The second stream argues that human rationality is too complex a phenomenon, taking into account the diverse reasoning strat egies that the human mind is capable of. The human mind that can develop reasoning strategies for diverse fields such as science, music and art cannot be e x- 1 J.W. Van Huyssteen, Duet or Duel?

To take this complexity i nto account other metaphors evolved to explain the development of human rationality such as emergence, complexity, creativity, etcetera which transcends purely biological evolution .5 It is clear and all agree that biology is the necessary cause ,6 but where there is disagreement is as to whether biology is the sufficient cause .7 These two different readings can be compared to either a purely intra -textual reading (evolutionary bio l- ogy) alone or an inter -textual reading where evolutionary biology is only one aspect, the necessary cause of human rationality, but certainly not the suff i- cient cause and thus conversation with other disciplines is necessary. To really understand the emergence of the complexity of the human mind var i- ous disciplines enter in an inter -disciplinary conversation or inter -textual reading of the text (body as text) and con text or text (body) in con text (env i- ronment) . Van Huyssteen argues that it is the quest for understanding the co m- plexity of the human mind itself , evolutionary epistemology ,8 which gu ides us towards this space where inter -disciplinary or cross -disciplinary convers a- tions are necessary to understand the complexity of the human mind .9 In this space he proposes a postfoundational epistemology10 which allows for variou s reasoning strategies to interact with each other in conversation. He argues that evolutionary epistemology yields the kind of postfoundationalist, co m- prehensive epistemology that is necessary to respond to the challenges of postmodernity and help us redi scover the resources of human rationality that are shared deeply by both theology and science .11 What Van Huyssteen di s- covers in evolutionary epistemology is a way to think and facilitate the cha l- lenge of a constructive form of postmodernism: 'the need for a more compr e- hensive and integrated approach to the problem of human knowledge .'12 5 See S.

From science there are the metaphors of complexity theory, quantum phy s- ics, emergence, creativity and from theology there are the metaphors of Cre a- tor, intelligent design, etcetera. These metaphors are all acceptable and we l- comed to the table because they are based on reasonable (s ufficient) reaso n- ing strategies that can be mutually respected and accepted by the various sciences towards a postfoundational conversation and these sufficient re a- soning strategies13 allows the various disciplines with their diverse metaphors to sing in th e cross -disciplinary choir. To explain the complex connection between evolutionary biology and cultural evolution, science has offered various immanent metaphors, for e x- ample: complexity, emergence, quantum theory, etcetera . Some of these metaphors might currently be the best theories/metaphors, for example as Helrich14 argues that theoretical physics offers the best mathematical equ a- tions to understand the world and yet it needs to be kept in mind that sc i- ence is not the final mathematical equation with wh ich to understand and interpret the world as was believed in modernity and therefore the space is opened for postfoundational inter - and intra -textual reading of the world or humanity. Helrich argues that theoretical physics certainly seeks such a mathemat ical equation, but he adds that such an equation will never be wri t- ten on a piece of paper and so the search to find the one 'correct ' mathemat i- cal equation with which to comprehend the world and the self is impossible. Wigner argued that mathematics is th e language for formulating the laws of physics with which humanity is able to understand the universe .15 In re- sponse to Wigner and Helrich, the question could be asked: is mathematics the language of the universe? The universe itself is beyond language and be- yond mathematics, because all we have is the text/equation/symbol/sign/ formula as there is no outside text .16 So even though, as Helrich argues, qua n- tum theory certainly seems to be the best mathematical language with which 13 See Van Huyssteen , Duet or Duel? , 34, 129.

CELEBRATING THE NEUROSCIENTIFIC BODY SACRAMENTALLY 255 to understand the universe as it is the most effective tool to understand, it remains a metaphor and therefore the need for postfoundational convers a- tion remains. These different metaphors seek to understand the world and humanity . Some of these metaphors seek to do th is without a return of supernatural arguments or arguments for metaphysical being and others are open to s u- pernatural arguments thereby opening the space for theology to enter into the conversation. Theology can therefore bring to the table her metaphors of God, but to what purpose? Is this a form of apologetics using the gaps or u n- certainties in science to justify faith in God? Is the language of theology, sp e- cifically the Scriptural based theological language, truly useful to help unde r- stand and interpret s cientific challenges? What contribution does theology offer the scientific conversation? What does theology have to offer the scie n- tific discussion on the evolution of humanity? Can the theological concept of the Imago Dei truly contribute to the scientifi c discourse or is the convers a- tion a struggle on the side of theology to identify where exactly in the scie n- tific discussion the image of God would be appropriate: a theology of the gaps? Or is it a unilateral conversation where science offers the paradigm s and the language/metaphors in which to think about certain things, God, creation, miracles, soul, afterlife and the image of God, etcetera and then theology frantically tries to accommodate her metaphors to this scientific language? It can also be argued that this duet is an appeasing time -filler to keep the religions (a powerful force in contemporary culture) on board until science does find some answers that are maybe more useful than the current answers and then what happens to theology? Yet, just bec ause science (evolutionary epistemology) itself points t o- wards a postfoundational inter -textual reading it does not automatically e n- tail an element of the supra -natural text. It does not exclude it, but nor does it include it - certain things cannot yet be explained, but that does not tran s- late into the existence of some supra -natural being or even a metaphysical Being or God. Evolutionary epistemology does not necessarily include supra - natural elements just because it cannot conclusively explain the comple x connection between biological evolution and cultural evolution. Therefore, although one recognises the role of experience , tradition and metaphor in all knowledge there is a bias towards science as offering the u l- timate 'rational language ' or the most sufficient reasoning strategies and therefore all other languages needs to be in response to this rational language that has proven itself through its utility and technological prowess. This bias 256 JOHANN -ALBRECHT MEYLAHN I can accept, but it only accentuates the question: what can theology offer in the postfoundationalist conversation? I will argue that theology does not have much to offer science, because it is not a scientific discourse and thus the concepts such as image of God, creation, God, etcetera are not scientific statemen ts, but utterances of faith. Is Christian theology, as based in Scri p- tures, necessarily about a supernatural Being? Is Christian theology a 'science ' about a metaphysical Being or is Christian theology, as founded in Scripture, a science of faith in respon se to revelation as Karl Barth17 argued . One could argue that Christian theology focusses on the revelation of the Word (Christ) in Scripture. Thus Scripture as the basis for theology does not offer anything concerning science (physics) or anything concerni ng metaphysics, because it was not written as a physical (scientific) or metaphysical treatise, but it is about the Word of God (Christ) as witnessed to in scripture. In other words, it is about God's revelation of God -self in the immanence of Christ in th e his- tory of the world. I would rather propose that Theology (with its focus on the Word made flesh) can embrace the radical immanence of natural science and therefore endorse the scientific text full heartedly and enter into the intra - and inter - discipli nary postfoundational conversation without any attempt to read the Other, as super -natural or metaphysical Being. All we have is the text ,18 hereby not denying the existence of an Other or other as every other is wholly other ,19 but denying that one can make any conclusive statements concerning the other who is also wholly Other. If the insights of linguistic theory are taken into account then both naturalism and supernaturalism are texts seeking to understand the Other who is every other .20 Thus, there is no dualism and there is no duel, but if anything there is One (various texts) and a unilateral duality as both naturalism and supernaturalism unilaterally, in Laruelle's sense, confront - not the Other (because the Other always comes to mind as text), but the future .21 Or as iek argues, that things do not merely appear; they appear to appear, thereby 'concealing the fact that they 17 K.

CELEBRATING THE NEUROSCIENTIFIC BODY SACRAMENTALLY 257 are what they appear .'22 This double framing conceals the fact that things are what they appear. Therefore the immanent reading of science remains inconclusive co n- cerning the other (reality) and it is necessarily grammatically so because of diff\u00e9rance. Every other is wholly other, Derrida argues , and therefore science cannot provide conclusive answers just as there cannot be conclusi ve answers to the question of theism or for that matter on the question of atheism. So at best one is perhaps left with speculative realism as Quentin Meillassoux23 argues. In his speculative realism he has created the space for the possibility of a future God.24 My question is: does theology want to engage in this spec u- lative realism or with the possibility of speculative super -realism somewhere in the future? My answer is, no, and I believe that there is a strong theolog i- cal tradition that would support suc h an emphatic No! A tradition that would argue that the focus of theology is not on that which cannot be known, God, but rather on that which is revealed (Christ) thus embracing the immanent text/s and con texts whilst offering prophetic discord, as these t exts are never final but awaiting final judgement in the time that remains. The Christ event (alone) should be embraced in faith and grace alone. This revelation of the incarnated (immanent), crucified and resurrected Christ provides the herm e- neutical key not only to Scripture, as Luther argues ,25 but I would argue to the postfoundationalist reading of texts and contexts as such. My vision of theology is to disengage from the speculative enterprise of either speculative realism or speculative super -realism a nd rather offer the world a hermeneut i- cal key to read the grammar of texts of the world, and thereby offer an ethos of reading based on, as Laruelle argues, a science of Christ ,26 not in an a t- tempt to answer questions concerning God, but with regards to the questions of the world in the hope of the kingdom that is still to come. The Christ event (narrative) as for example captured in the Carmen Christi (Philippians 2), read together with Derrida's understanding of language, could serve as such a 22 S. iek, 'A Plea for a Return of Diff\u00e9rance (with a minor pro domo sua),' Critical Inquiry 32 (Winter 2006), 235 -236. 23 Q.

This is the contribution that theology can offer the science -religion conversation, and the Scriptures as texts of f aith, hope and love can hermeneutically guide and offer an ethos for inter -disciplinary reading of texts and contexts. Stuart Kauffman, in an interview with Steve Paulson ,27 argues for the need for a s a- cred science. I would argue for the need for a Christ -science, for the reading of texts and contexts at the table of the kingdom to come. One can read the Christ event as the Ereignis of language and as such it is the Ereignis of difference.28 John Schad29 argues that each discourse can be read as an allegory or a re-writing of the other and it is possible because they are intertexts and one cannot read the one without the other. It is as Derrida argue s,30 when one no longer knows what is an example of what then liter a- ture has begun as literature has always already begun. The Christ narrative will be read together with Derrida's understanding of diff\u00e9rance, and the two will interpret each other. W hat makes such mutual interpretation both pos s- ible and impossible is that the grammar of diff\u00e9rance and the trace is best described in the grammar of faith, promise, hope and thus prayer, and these Biblical texts have as their content narratives concerning faith, promise, hope and prayer and therefore they can function as exemplary texts of diff\u00e9rance. These texts' (J ewish -Christian Scriptures) 'truth ' is not their metaphysical or onto -theological reference, but the 'truth ' of language just as the poetic speaking of language was for Heidegger the purest (truest) form of la n- guage .31 For Derrida , it is prayer32 that is the speaking of language .33 Thus one 27 S. Paulson, 'God enough,' Salon.com, Wednesday, Nov 19, 2008 11:40 Am UTC, from HTTP://WWW>SALON>COM/2008/11/19/STUART_KAUFFMAN/ on 05.08.2012. 28 , Literatures 25/3, 1993, 1 , argues that God and speech (one could say God and writing, taking Derrida' arguments into consideration) share the same impossible beginning and th erefore are always already identical, or coextensive. He argues that this becomes apparent in the Johannine Prologue, which he refers to as the Johannine heresy: that God who is Word becomes flesh (text or context). Michael E d- wards reminds one that in Gree k the same word is used to describe speech and Christ ( M. Edwards, Of Making Many Books (London: Macmillan , 1990), p. 179). Robert Scharleman ( R.P. Scharleman, 'The Being of God when God is not being God ,' in: T.J.J. Altizer et al. (eds.), Deconstruction a nd Theology (New York: Crossroads 1982), 102) argues that 'God is what language means and language is what God means.' 29 Schad , 'Hostage of the Word, ' 2. 30 J.

Heidegger, Poetry, Language, Thought , transl. A. Hofstadter (New York: Harper & Row , 1971). CELEBRATING THE NEUROSCIENTIFIC BODY SACRAMENTALLY 259 can say that prayer, faith, promise and hope are the speaking of language. The 'truth ' of these Scriptural texts therefore is not in their reference, but because they are narratives concerning faith, promise, hope and praye r they are exemplary of the grammar of writing and therefore they become exe m- plary texts of language and exemplary texts of texts and of con texts. As e x- emplary texts they are necessary for the understanding and interpreting and opening of con texts - the 'reality ' of the world. The Christ narrative can be used as an exemplary narrative, not to prove the truth of a historical Jesus, but to understand and interpret, deconstruct the texts of the world (con text), by using the Christ narrative to read and re - read the texts of all that is and in that sense discover the 'truth ' of these nar r- atives, irrespective of their reference to which no one has conclusive access, but 'truthful ' in the sense of useful interpretation (deconstruction) of reality (con text) because of their grammar of faith, prayer, promise and messiah to come. In that sense the Christ narrative is perhaps exemplary of the story of language and as story of language it is exemplary of the story of the world (history of the world) .34 It begins with the incarnation of the God, the Logos, who becomes flesh - in other words, God pitches God's tent in human history. God the tra n- scendent becomes immanent in the con text of human history. The Word (transcendental signified) becomes words, texts, writing, diff\u00e9 rance as it e n- ters human history and thus it becomes vulnerable .35 The Word becomes flesh so there is no outside text anymore, only a trace of the Other (Father), of an immemorial past never present and a future always still to come .36 32 Derrida argues that the God of negative theology is worth saving and secondly the prayer of negative theology needs to be translated for everyone (see Derrida, Sauf le nom , 46-48). 33 avoid P. Kamuf & E. Rottenber g (eds.), Psyche: Inventions of the Other Vol II, transl. K. Frieden & E. Rottenberg, (Stanford: Stanford University Press , 2008), 143 -195. 34 John Schad, as already discussed above, interprets the Johannine Prologue in this light. Charles Winquist argues s omething similar when he says that 'The death of God..... is the birth of the Word' (Schad, Hostage of the Word, 2). Schad continues and argues that the Johannine incarnation and the postmodern or poststructuralist situation might be described, it seems, in one and the same way (Schad, Hostage of the Word , 2). 35 '...that Christ, as the Word, does not so much put himself beyond language but rather that he endures all its frailties. Indeed, this very life and ministry - characterized as they are by discontinuiti es, displacements, and misinterpretations - parallels closely the fate, or itinerary, of the Derridean sign' (Schad, Hostage of the Word , 4). 36 See Derrida's discussion on the trace in J. Derrida, Margins of philiosophy , transl A. JOHANN -ALBRECHT MEYLAHN This incarnate Word ( this inscription of writing) becomes vulnerable like a baby in a crib. It becomes vulnerable to the wounding of diff\u00e9rance, the wounding of the other. The incarnate word is opened (wounded, vulnerable) to the tout autre , which is every other .37 Yet it is p articularly vulnerable to the big other (the powers that be), the imperial forces that seek to be or represent the Transcendent as the tran- scendental signified. However, the big other is conscious of the fact that it does not have perfect access to the tra nscendent and that it is not the ult i- mate presentation or representation of the transcendent and therefore knows that its power is only as temporary as the myth survives .38 These forces of the various big others hear of the Word made flesh and they are thr eatened in a dual sense . Firstly they are threatened by the idea of a possible other's attempt at being the transcendental signified (big other) that might be more powerful than they and therefore they need to destroy this potential before it rises to powe r, or second ly they are threatened by the possibility that if it truly is the transcendental signified (the Word) that has become flesh, become con text and text as is inscribed, that would mean that all power will be threatened as all power rests on a foun dational myth that has forgotten that it is a myth and that there is no 'true' legitimization of power on the basis of a transcendental signifier (truth), as there is no tra n- scendental signifier but only a quasi -transcendental that deconstructs .39 How r ight these imperial forces were with regard s to this incarnate word that had entered their con text (history) and thus had fatally wounded their power and authority. This inscription (archi -inscription - incarnation of the Word) had fatally wounded any clai ms to power based on metaphysics: a si n- gle cause our ground. The incarnate Word began his ministry in the context of Palestine, the context of imperial forces (Roman universal imperialism and Pharisaic particular imperialism). His ministry (activity) chall enged and d e- constructed these systems of power and control and thus the animosity grew between the powers that be and Jesus (the incarnate Word - the inscribed 37 Derrida, Sauf le nom , 76. 38 See Derrida's discussion on Walter Benjamin's Critique of Violence in: J. Derrida, 'Force of \"mystical foundation of ' (London: Routledge , 2002), 228 -298. 39 Theodore W. Jennings, Jr. follows a similar path in his book Reading Derrida/Thinking Paul , where he argues that what was exposed was the 'unfounded foundation of the law and thus renders it deconstructable' (see T.W. Jennings, Reading Derrida/Thinking Paul (Stanford: Stanford University Press , 2006), 61). CELEBRATING THE NEUROSCIENTIFIC BODY SACRAMENTALLY 261 text)40. The only solution for these powers that be was to destroy this inscri p- tion that challeng ed or deconstructed their power. Jesus (the i n- scribed/incarnated Word - archi -writing) fundamentally questioned their power as he reinscribed the myths of their power. He fundamentally cha l- lenged the metaphysics of their thinking and their system and there fore he was crucified as the greatest criminal41 by the imperial forces of that time.42 What makes this possible - this semi -translation of the story of Christ into the story of diff\u00e9rance43? It is because diff\u00e9rance , and more specifically deconstruction as an effect of diff\u00e9rance, is impassioned by the messianic (the other still to come) and thus the messianic story fits, the difference b e- ing that the Christian belie ves that the messiah did come and diff\u00e9rance hold s onto the fact that the messiah is always still to come . The crucifixion: It is n ot the sign (the incarnate Word) that is crucified, but the messiah44. Christ is not crucified because of being the incarnate word (writing/diff\u00e9rance), but he is crucified bec ause of the disruption and deco n- struction this writing causes in the text or con text and thereby challenges the powers that be. The Word incarnate, as argued above, translates into speech, signs, the inscription, archi -writin g (flesh) and consequently the undecidabi l- ity of the play of diff\u00e9rance. This play of diff\u00e9rance deconstructed the powers that be and it was because of this ultimate criminality (deconstruction) that Jesus was crucified as he challenged the metaphysical foundations of the a u- thority of t he powers that be by revealing them to be powerless inscriptions and thus re -inscribing them into the play of undecidability. 40 See John Caputo's book, What Would Jesus Deconstruct ?, where he brings the ideas of deco n- struction and diff\u00e9rance into dialogue with the ministry of Jesus and per implica tion the ministry of the church. J.D. Caputo, What Would Jesus Deconstruct? The Good News of Postmodernism for the Church (Grand Rapids, MI : Baker Academic , 2007). 41 See Derrida's discussion on Walt er Benjamin's discussion on the ultimate criminal, in Derrida, Critique of Violence . 42 See 1 Corinthians 2:8, where Paul makes it clear that the agents of the crucifixion were the r u- lers of this age. 43 As Eric Ives argues, deconstruction is not a bad mas ter, but a necessary servant for Christianity (E. Ives, 'Modern historical scholarship and the Christian Gospel ,' The Glass 6 (1972), 65), or as Schad argues, deconstruction is the fate of Christianity (Schad, Hostage of the Word , 7). 44 Jennings also ar gues that the cross is a verdict against the messiah and that the execution of the messiah is exemplary (Jennings, Reading Derrida/Thinking Paul , 65). He argues this in the context of the law -gospel debate in Paul and that the law has to be deconstructed f or justice to be possible. 'That the wedge driven between justice and the law is precisely the execution of the messiah is, of course explicitly affirmed in Galatians (2: 21)' (Jennings, Reading Derrida/Thinking Paul , 64). 262 JOHANN -ALBRECHT MEYLAHN The powers that be responded to this deconstruction, seeking to arrest this undecid ability, trying to arrest the certainty of un certainty that que s- tioned their certainties. It is this grammar that they sought to arrest and d e- stroy so that they could return to their certainties. It is the way, the truth and the life45, which is the grammar of all that is with nothing beyond (text and context), that they hoped to destroy by crucifying Christ. The Messiah (messianic way) was crucified, this way, life and truth was crucified, crossed out, erased. Within the story of the text or in the con text, the messiah was crucified by the two powers according to the legal functio n- ing of the Roman and Jewish law, but theologically it is also argued that God (tout autre ) crucified him and yet it was God who was crucified46. Therefore it was the Other (God) who crucified the messiah so as to save the Oth er (God) and the same. One could argue that the cross is the death of the death of God, which does not translate into the life of God, but maybe the life of God as understood as the endless desertification of language47. Diff\u00e9rance, like God, needs saving from becoming the final Word: the certainty of certainty which would indeed be death namely the end of play as Schad48 argues. If the transcendent (the Word) is incarnate (there is no ou t- side text) and if the Messiah (death of God) rises to power (if diff\u00e9r ance does indeed become the Messiah, a new transcendental signified) then it would be the end of history, namely death: the certainty of certainty and the absolute reduction of the other to the same , of Diff\u00e9rance with a capital D . The world would collapse, as the world that is created ( poeisis ) in and of dif-ference49 would be without dif -ference. Thus the death on the cross of God is not the death of the transcendental signifier as that death already occurred in the incarnation. It is the death of a capitalised Writing or Diff\u00e9rance, the death of the Messiah who came: the death of the death of God. The death on the cross is not the certainty of certainty (death) as Schad argues, but the return of play, and therefore the certainty of uncertainty, the re-inscription of Diff\u00e9rance into diff\u00e9rance so that this play never rises to power. The cross ensures that diff\u00e9rance is only ever a weak force50 (weak messiah) who has no 45 In reference to John 14:6 46 J. Moltmann, The Crucified God (London: SCM Press , 1974), 200 -274. 47 See Derrida, Sauf le nom , 56. 48 See Schad, Hostage and Word , 10ff. 49 See Heidegger, Poetry, Language, T hought , 200. 50 See J.D. Caputo, The Weakness of God: A Theology of the Event (Indianapolis: Indiana Unive r- sity Press , 2006). CELEBRATING THE NEUROSCIENTIFIC BODY SACRAMENTALLY 263 power and yet all power comes from him51: a quasi -transcendental and never the Trans cendental. In a sense one can say the Messiah came and did not come, and Chri s- tians still await him/her (the second coming) - an important aspect in the story of Christ and diff\u00e9rance so that diff\u00e9rance does not become a capitalised transcendental signi fier, but remains, if anything, a quasi -transcendental. Christ, a quasi -Messiah, who came and is still to come and thus opens the space of history in the time that remains. Diff\u00e9rance crucifies (deconstructs) any attempt to be the final judgment (transcen dental signified) and opens the space for the messiah still to come (second coming). The trace of the other who has not been heard, who has no place52, and thus any theology based on the Christ event, that uses the name of God, is haunted by a democracy sti ll to come (hearing the other who has not been heard), by justice still to come (offering the other a place who has no place) and offers hospitality to the unheard, place -less other. In such a context of offering hospitality to the other, of praying for ju stice and demo c- racy still to come, it is impossible to rise to an imperial power. This is exactly where Theology, and specifically the Word of God (Christ), can help and offer an important contribution to the conversation. Theology thus does not provide u s with interesting ideas (metaphors) about the Other that can engage in a fruitful duet with science, because such ideas, as Luther says, can only lead to the devil53, but theology rather provides a hermeneutical key (Christ event) to read the grammar of th e texts rather than speculate about that which is beyond. Theology thus does not sing the duet with science about the Other, but offers the sciences the hermeneutics (science of reading) and ethos for a cross -disciplinary postfoundational conversation. In this article I have sought to propose the postmetaphysical turn t o- wards language in the thoughts of Derrida as a more useful space and maybe theologically 'more suitable space' for theology to engage in the postfound a- tional conversation with the oth er sciences rather than to seek to sing a duet with science on metaphysical or super -natural questions, where the possibi l- ity always remains that the duet turns into a duel. Furthermore t o rather f a- cilitate the space where this postfoundational conversatio n as unilateral dua l- 51 In reference to Jesus' response to Pilate see John 19:11. 52 Matthew 25:45. 53 See Althaus, , 33. 264 JOHANN -ALBRECHT MEYLAHN ity, turns not towards speculation concerning the Other of metaphysics, but towards the future that can only be faced in faith, hope and love - the three gifts of the Spirit54. It is the Christ event that offers and guides such a reading (faith, hope and love) of the texts and contexts of the world towards a more just interpretation (justice understood as offering hospitality towards those who have no voice or place). The task of theology is not to seek to argue for the truth of metaphy sical arguments over against the arguments of science, but rather that theology redefines her ancient role as queen of the sciences who in the past invited the various disciplines to her royal court. Today a more suitable biblical image might be the inclus ive kingdom table of the feast or celebration of commu n- ion where ever more are invited to share the body of texts. At this inclusive table to offer a hermeneutical key (a science of Christ) to read and deco n- struct (crucify) the body of texts in the postfou ndational epistemological space for the multi - or Cross -disciplinary conversation and to drink of the wine of the new covenant of hope, faith and love. Theology is not the Queen of the sciences playing an imperial role as an absolute monarch with regards to the content of the arguments and thereby having the right to determine what is right or wrong, but rather liturgically facilitating the space by prov id- ing the hermeneutical key to unpack the grammar for the conversation and playing, if anything, the role of the court jester or holy fool55 and thereby d e- constructing or crucifying the absolute laws that seek to hold all that is ca p- tive to a single theory or metaphor. This Christ science guided by the metaphor of the sacrament of the table can perhaps provide an ethos for interdisciplinary conversation where every knee will bow at the name of the crucified Christ in humility and acknow l- edgement of the vul nerability of all our knowledge constructions, but in the spirit of hope, faith and love and an openness to the future of the kingdom always still to come. 54 See 1 Corinthians 13.13. 55 See J-A.

Beginning in the second half of the 20th century, US evangelicals have developed biblically based dieting and fitness programs which offer a 'Christian alternative' to the 'secular' fitness and dieting world. These regimens blend elements of bible study and exercise rou- tines, drawing their spiritual authority from divine inspiration. It is not just in well-known liturgical contexts that the presence of God is made sensually pe r- ceivable. The often physically exhausting workout routines are considered as 'spending time with God' and 'taking care of God's temple, your body' and will be analyzed from the perspective of the embodiment paradigm. KEYWORDS devotional fitness, evangelicalism, embodiment, religion and sports, American religion INTRODUCTION The 19th conferenc e of the ESPR was dedicated to 'Embodied Religion' and it was based on the underlying thesis that 'religion is always embodied in various ways.' Setting out from this statement, this paper will present cases of 266 MARTIN RADERMACHER religious embodiment which are peculiar as it is unequivocal for both partic i- pants and researchers that they are dealing with concrete, very practical and corporeal 'in -corporations' of 'theologies of the body.' Beginning in the second half of the 20th century, US evangelicals have developed biblical ly based dieting and fitness programs which offer a 'Chri s- tian alternative' to the 'secular' fitness and dieting world.1 These regimens consciously blend elements of bible studies and exercise routines, drawing their spiritual authority from divine inspira tion. This fashion of religiously disciplining the body mirrors in many ways commonly accepted body sta n- dards of contemporary western societies. Such programs provide evidence of the assumption that the relationship between God and the believer is not just of a spiritual kind but may be phys i- cally enacted. Just as religious frameworks structure issues of sexuality, r e- production and family, they also inform concepts of health and disease. In the case under observation, health is unmistakably associated with a slender and fit body while disease lurks in sugar and fat. The goal of this paper is to illustrate how religion 'does not only change the human mind' but also 'affects the human body,'2 by describing the 'rel i- gious' imperative of exercising and slimming down.3 I will hence present some first ideas from my doctoral thesis which is supervised in the Depar t- ment of Religion at Muenster University. For this purpose, I will start with examples from the field that I observed in the fall of 2011 in the USA (chapt er 2). After that, the embodiment par a- digm will be introduced (chapter 3). I suggest to distinguish concepts of e m- bodiment sensu lato and sensu stricto and then apply the latter in an exe m- plary fashion to the before described phenomena (chapter 4). Most ob servers, academics and non -academics alike, when confronted with devotional fitness, immediately criticize these programs for their se e- mingly na\u00efve attitude towards contemporary slimness ideals and the pote n- tial health hazards inherent to every program in favor of slimming down and losing weight. I wholeheartedly agree with this criticism. In this paper, ho w- 1 Ruth Marie Griffith has, from a historical perspective, extensively dealt with these groups in Born Again Bodies: Flesh and Spirit in American Christianity (Berkeley 2004 ). 2 As the Call for Papers for the ESPR conference phrased it . 3 Gregor Schrettle has analyzed this religious imperative in Gwen Shamblin's organization called 'Weigh Down Workshop,' see Gregor Schrettle, Gwen Shamblin's Dieting Religion and America's Puritan Legacy (Essen 2006 ). DEVOTIONAL FITNESS I N US EVANGELICALISM 267 ever, I will restrict myself to referencing influential critics while focusing on other matters of interest.4 'BOD4GOD,' 'BODY & SOUL,' 'FIRST PLACE 4 HEALTH ' Bod4God is a book5 and weight -loss program published in 2009 and d e- signed by Steve Reynolds, Pastor of Capital Baptist Church in Annandale, VA, in the outskirts of Washington, DC. Reynolds raised considerable interest by the media and his pr ogram was subject to public debates.6 Reynolds, labeled the 'Anti -Fat Pastor' by the media, dealt with serious weight and health issues himself before he discovered that the solution to overweight shall be found in the Bible. A keyword search for the word 'body' produced 179 incidents.7 A subject which is discussed that often in biblical texts, Reynolds concluded, must be of importance in God's eyes. In his book, Reynolds developed 'four keys' to succeed in weight -loss. These keys are: (1) Dedication - 'honorin g God with your body,' (2) Inspiration - 'motivating yourself for change,' (3) Eat and Exercise - 'managing your habits,' (4) Team - 'building your circle of support.' His book, a 'theology of the body,' lays the groundwork for weight -loss oriented competitions calle d 'Losing to Live.' These events originated in Re y- nolds' congregation and have been implemented in other churches in the US as well, e.g. in the Independent Bible Church in Martinsburg, WV, the First Evangelical Lutheran Church in Floresville, TX, and The Journey Church in New York, NY. They take place over a period of twelve weeks and include groups competing against each other about how much weight they lose t o- gether. Every week, on Sundays, the groups get together in the church to ce l- ebrate last week's w inners, to meet their small groups, spend time in prayer and bible study, and learn about healthy living and eating right. 4 See, e.g. Mary Louise Bringle, The God of Thinness: Gl uttony and Other Weighty Matters (Nash- ville 1992) and Lisa Isherwood , The Fat Jesus: Christianity and Body Image (New York 2008) . 5 Steve Reynolds, Bod4God: The Four Keys to Weight Loss (Ventura 2009 ). 6 See e.g. Jacqueline L. Salmon, 'An Almighty Weight L oss,' The Washington Post , January 7, 2008. Likewise, Reynolds has been discussed on the popular TV show 'The View,' hosted by Barbara Walters, Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Hasselbeck und Sherri Shepherd. 7 Reynolds, Bod4God , 22-23. 268 MARTIN RADERMACHER Reynolds cooperates with two large organizations of devotional fitness: 'Body & Soul Fitness' and 'First Place 4 Health.' The first o ne focuses on fi t- ness classes and working out. They have developed fitness routines chore o- graphed to Christian praise music, combined with communal prayer and sharing. 'First Place 4 Health,' on the other hand, is a Christian diet program based on small gr oup meetings and bible study. 'Body & Soul Fitness - Where Faith and Fitness Meet' was developed in 1981 by Jeannie and Roy Blocher from Germantown, MD. Their goal is to 'e n- courage you to pursue both physical and spiritual fitness, wherever you are in the world.'8 They start from the assumption that '[f]itness involves more than just your body' and that 'developing and maintaining a healthy lifestyle is part of being a good steward of this \"physical body\" we've been given.' Ther e- fore they place a major emph asis on exercise classes that are designed to 'help you get (and stay) in shape.' They assume that 'there is more to fitness than a great workout' and hence seek to affect all other areas of life by follo w- ing a 'truly holistic approach to fitness because t here is a tangible connection between the physical and spiritual dimensions of our lives.'9 What are the effects pursued in Body & Soul? First, the program wants to 'energize' participants for 'physical strength and spiritual energy.' They also intend to h elp members 'grow stronger physically' and 'discover God's plan for your life.' Apart from that, and supporting these effects, the program provides information on how to lead and maintain a 'healthy and active life.'10 Lynne Gerber has researched 'First Pla ce 4 Health' extensively in a r e- cent publication.11 Style and rhetoric of this program are strongly reminiscent of popular weight -loss programs such as 'WeightWatchers' with the exce p- tion that, in First Place 4 Health, extensive bible study and scripture me mori- zation play a crucial role. Participants regularly meet over a period of twelve weeks. Getting together as a group and sharing their troubles and worries is considered an important element. Intimacy and mutual trust are nourished and cherished. A centr al 'ritual' is the 'weighing in' right at the beginning of 8 Body & Soul, 'Body & Soul Fitness: Where Faith and Fitness Meet ' [http://bodyandsoul.org/ , ac- cessed July 17, 2011]. 9 Body & Soul, 'Body & Soul Fitness: Where Faith and Fitness Meet .' 10 Body & Soul, 'Body & Soul Fitness: Where Faith and Fitness Meet .' 11 Lynne Gerber , Seeking the Straight and Narrow: Weight Loss and Sexual Reorientation in Eva n- gelical America (Chicago 2012 ). DEVOTIONAL FITNESS I N US EVANGELICALISM 269 each small group meeting. Participants are required to step on the scales and recite a scripture verse.12 One of the first questions proponents of devotional fitness have to deal with is: What does fitness have to do with faith? Among the most common arguments, proponents of devotional fitness programs will often employ the idea that God cares about everything his followers do - 'everything' specif i- cally includes issues of eating and weight. Carol Sh owalter, designer of the '3D' plan (short for 'Diet, Discipline and Discipleship'), e.g., writes on her homepage, 'The Bible says that He cares about sparrows, and even about the hair on your head! So why wouldn't God care about my struggles with ea t- ing?'13 Besides many other arguments which I do not have the space to elab o- rate here, founders and leaders of such programs usually stress that our b o- dies are God's instruments on earth and that Christians can only fulfill their mission if they are physically and spiritually fit. An important argument in favor of Christian fitness programs that is more apt to convince skeptic 'insiders' is the need to evangelize. Reynolds, author of Bod4God does not conceal that this is a prominent intention behind his concept.14 People that usually would not approach a church might non e- theless feel attracted to fitness and healthy living and thus interact more eas i- ly with evangelical milieus than they would usually do. EMBODIMENT AS A PARAD IGM FOR THE STUDY OF RELIGION Embodiment as a terminological figure has been known for quite some time in anthropology, ethnology and the study of religion, yet on a more ge n- eral level compared to the approach I wish to focus on here. For instance, Clifford Geertz's now classical definition of r eligion as a cultural system u n- derstands 'symbols' as 'tangible formulations of notions, abstractions from experience fixed in perceptible forms, concrete embodiments of ideas, att i- 12 This ritual has been analyzed by Lynne Gerber, Carol Showalter & Maggie Davis, ' The 3D Plan: Eat Right, Live Well, Love God,' [http://www.3dyourwholelife.com/lovegod.php , accessed July 17, 2012]. 14 MARTIN RADERMACHER tudes, judgments, longings, or beliefs.'15 Thomas Luckmann, too, thinks of symbols as ' incorporations of a different reality in the ordinary [reality].'16 When Luckmann and Geertz talk of 'embodiment' or 'incorporation,' they harness a version of the concept which I refer to as 'embodiment sensu lato.' Quite certainly, they do not associate 'embodiment' exclusively with the fleshly matter of being, the corporeal reality of human experience. More ge n- erally, they consider symbols as metaphorically tangible concepts that have left the world of 'ideas, attitudes, judgments,' etc. and ha ve been 'objectified' to the extent that they are now a more or less standardized form of everyday communication. The notion of 'embodiment sensu lato' draws attention to the fact that mental or cognitive notions require 'tangible' manifestations, metaphor ically and, in addition, literally, to impact individuals and society. This idea is fu n- damental to the emergence of embodiment as a paradigm. In this restricted use of the term - embodiment sensu stricto - the concept refers to the co n- crete fleshly body, t angible in a very literal sense, and prone to visual, haptic, auditory etc. perceptions. Translating this idea to religion, Matti Kamppinen defines: 'Embodied religion is [...] something that involves actively engaged religious bodies, performing rituals, or otherwise communicating with supe r- natural entities. Embodied religion is religion as it is studied in respectable fieldwork -based ethnography. Embodied religion is not a specific type of rel i- gion, but rather a research setting, where religious bodies are studied by means of interview and participant observation.'17 It is noteworthy, I think, that Kamppinen focuses on the corporeal bodies of both actors and researc h- ers in the 'religious field' and thus acknowledges the role of the scholar's physical presence in the field. With this distinction in mind, it is easier to review the manifold a p- proaches labeled 'embodiment.' Albeit simplified and dichotomized, it may be a useful tool in academic discussions where it is not always made explicit how broad the term ' embodiment' should or should not be understood. The rather diffuse notion of embodiment as something both 'metaphorical ' and 'literal, ' to my mind, impedes efficient inter - and cross -disciplinary comm u- nication, let alone unambiguous interaction with non -academic circles. 15 Clifford Geertz , 'Religion as a Cultural System ,' in: Clifford Geertz , The Interpretation of Cu l- tures: Selected Essays (New York, 2009) , 87-125, esp. 91 -94 (italics added). 16 Thomas Luckmann, unsichtbare Religion 17 Matti Kamppinen , 'The in Religious Studies ,' in: Tore Ahlb\u00e4ck , Religion and the Body (\u00c5bo 2011) 206-215, esp. 209. DEVOTIONAL FITNESS I N US EVANGELICALISM 271 Indeed, when entering the debate beyond academe, 'embodiment sensu stricto' might be an apt point of departure to get across scholarly notions of materialization and objectification of 'purely' mental concepts and ideas. The actual physical body , according to this paradigm, is the inevitable locus of manifestations of non -physical entities. Ideas cannot become tangible if not through and by means of the human body. In extension, the embodiment paradigm challenges exactly this notion of the ' physical' being separate from the 'mental.' In short, a nthropological approaches to the 'body' following the emb o- diment paradigm in its strict sense have two major concerns. (1) They try to overcome classic mind -body -dualisms and (2) they focus on material ity and substance rather than on ideas and notions. Opposing older assumptions that the body is a function of mental processes , e.g., erudite rules of ritual, newer accounts entertain the idea that, vice versa, mental notions might themselves be a function of the body.18 Against older accounts, anthropological work following the somatic turn19 does not uphold the analytic dichotomy of 'body' and 'soul,' or of expe- riences related to the body and those related to the soul. Instead, research inspired by the soma tic turn focuses on the fact that these positions are co m- plementary and mutually dependent. In a new collection on the subject, Anna Fedele and Ruy Llera Blanes propose a 'comprehensive approach to this key point: the significance and agency behind religio us conceptions of the body in their relationship with ideas of the soul. We propose to bring to the forefront of the anthropology of religion the part of the body -soul dichotomy that tended to be neglected or treated as merely accessory in many discussions of religious phenomena: the issue of corporeality in religious contexts.'20 Thomas J. Csordas' work is often reckoned among the most influential in the field of embodiment.21 His seminal article 'Embodiment as a Paradigm for Anthropology'22 argues that 'a pa radigm of embodiment can be elaborated for 18 Catherine Bell, 'Embodiment,' in: Jens Kreinath, Jan esp. 19 The expression 'somatic turn' ( = body ), in this paper, shall refer to the emergence of the embodiment paradigm sensu Blanes (eds.), En- counters of Body and Soul in Conte mporary Religious Practices: Anthropological Reflections (New York, 2011), x-xxvii, esp. x -xi. by J. Csordas, 'Embodiment as a Paradigm for Anthropology ,' Ethos 1 (1990) , 5-47. 272 MARTIN RADERMACHER the study of culture and the self'.23 This paradigm states that the 'locus of the sacred is the body, for the body is the existential ground of culture.'24 A paradigm as a consistent methodological perspective, Csor das su g- gests, should make possible a re -evaluation of existing work and new a p- proaches in empirical research. He explicitly does not try to incorporate the vast multi -disciplinary literature on the body but leans strongly towards ph e- nomenology.25 'This appr oach to embodiment begins from the methodolog i- cal postulate that the body is not an object to be studied in relation to cu l- ture, but is to be considered as the subject of culture.'26 Csordas' central intention is to bring about a collapse of dualities b e- tween mind and body, subject and object.27 'This collapse allows us to inve s- tigate how cultural objects (including selves) are constituted or objectified, not in the processes of ontogenesis and child socialization, but in the ong o- ing indeterminacy and flux of adult cultural life.'28 Accordingly, Csordas tries to 'elaborate a non -dualistic paradigm of embodiment for the study of cu l- ture.'29 Both Maurice Merleau -Ponty and Pierre Bourdieu, whose work Csordas draws on, 'attempt [...] to collapse these dualities, and e mbodiment is the methodological principle invoked by both. The collapsing of dualities in e m- bodiment requires that the body as a methodological figure must itself be non-dualistic, that is, not distinct from or in interaction with an opposed principle of m ind.'30 APPROACHING DEVOTIONA L FITNESS FROM THE P ERSPECTIVE OF THE EMBODIMENT PARAD IGM The contributions to Fedele's and Blanes' Encounters of Body and Soul in Contemporary Religious Practices have drawn attention to the fact that e n- counters of body and soul are central to religious experience and that it is 23 Csordas, 'Embodiment as a Paradigm,' 5. 24 Csordas, 'Embodiment Paradigm,' 39.

DEVOTIONAL FITNESS I N US EVANGELICALISM 273 useful to consider these entities as interwoven and not opposite.31 Following this and recurring on the approaches summarized above, I would like to co n- sider devotional fitness as embodied religious pr actice. In some cases, where there is a proper 'theology of the body,' devotional fitness is highly reflective. In these incidents, founders sometimes think of their programs in terms of embodiment. One has to bear in mind, though, that they apply a conce pt of 'embodiment' which differs from the academic understanding explained above. 'ActivPrayer' is such an example. In their somewhat theologized attempt to explain Christian fitness, they start from the idea that 'Christian fitness (as in physical fitness ) is a natural application of the Christian faith to general health and well -being' and that a combination of Christianity and fitness makes 'perfect sense.' The body 'plays a key role in the Christian faith' b e- cause Christianity is based on the bodily res urrection of Jesus Christ. Ther e- fore, ActivPrayer concludes, 'Christianity is an incarnate religion' and 'being a body' is a central element in a true Christian's life. The body has appetites and desires which should be moderated but it is also an importan t medium and catalyst of spiritual experience, e.g. 'when we experience deep love (of God, or even another human person), we can feel it in our very bodies.'32 The authors conclude that we have to 'understand the embodiment of the human person or the embodi ed nature of our soul' in order to 'open up a door to an entire world of possibilities in Christian fitness.'33 Christian faith, in this case, is considered to be existentially grounded in the body; it is 'e m- bodied' at its very core. This understanding corr elates with scholarly perspe c- tives on the embodiment paradigm which place the body in the center of cu l- ture and society. Devotional fitness therefore becomes a particularly ad e- quate testing ground and research field for theories of embodiment. If we follow the claim that the body is the existential ground of culture34 we will have to understand the body in order to understand culture, or, in Cecil G. Helman's words: '[T]he body is culture - an expression of its basic themes. A full under -standing of any huma n body gives, at the same time, a fuller understanding of the culture embodied within it.'35 31 Anna Fedele Soul Fitness.' J. Csordas, 'Embodiment as Paradigm for Anthropology,' 39. 35 Cecil G. Helman , Culture, Health and Illness (New York, 2000 ), 15. 274 MARTIN RADERMACHER In this case, dealing with evangelical fitness culture, I seek to u nder- stand the role of the human body within this culture in order to understand devotional fitnes s. I would like to demonstrate this approach in a provisional manner with regard to two particular aspects of embodiment. (1) Somatic representations of individuality and collectivity Every kind of sports is set in and shaped by its surrounding social and cultural context. What happens to our bodies happens to society and vice versa . Sports and fitness incorporate and enact social patterns of conduct and clusters of values.36 The fact th at most evangelical fitness classes are based on routines that require neither partner nor opponent is, I hypothesize, linked to the value of autonomy in contemporary US culture.37 Many of these programs do not even require a group gathering and are designe d to be practiced at home i n- dividually learning through media such as books and DVDs, working out in front of the TV, and contemplating upon biblical scripture in solitude and stillness. In contrast to these programs, other designs intentionally incorporat e partner exercises. They explicitly encourage group meetings and appreciate the harmony and friendships nourished in their programs. This is, for i n- stance, the case in the above -described organization First Place 4 Health. The scholar of culture38 may rela te these phenomena to experiences of communitas according to Turner - events that celebrate togetherness and the spirit of community.39 A central feature of these programs is their a t- tempt to build commitment and accountability toward the group. They also stress equality among the group members; even the 'leader' is just 'one on the journey' and not hierarchically superordinated. In short, success is not poss i- ble when you are on your own. Yet again, the central goal and motivation of these programs is not a col- lective one, it is an individual one. Weight -loss can only be achieved by an 36 Thomas Alkemeyer Kultur, Konzepte (Bielefeld 2004 ), 43-78, esp. 60. 37 Out of the vast literature on individualization in (post -)modern times, I reference only, for a general account, Louis Dumont, Individualismus: Zur Ideologie der Moderne (Frankfurt 1991) and, sp e- cifically regarding the USA, Seymour M. Lipset, American Exc eptionalism: A Double -Edged Sword (New York, 1997), esp. 275. 38 E.g. Thomas Alkemeyer , 'Bewegung und Gesellschaft ,' 61. 39 Victor Turner , Das Ritual: Struktur und Anti -Struktur (Frankfurt am Main, 2000 ), 124. DEVOTIONAL FITNESS I N US EVANGELICALISM 275 individual body; it can only become visible in a single body. Programs that, like 'Losing to Live ,' arrange competitions based on collective weight -loss (see above) try to soft en this ambiguity: In fact, success or failure is shared as groups compete with other groups, yet, in every case, both within the group and in the overall competition, winners and losers are not collective bodies - they are individual bodies. To sum up, th e body in these examples reveals and, at the same time, enacts, a central ambiguity of evangelical fitness culture: the longing for co l- lectivity or communitas and for individuality or autonomy at the same time. (2) Somatic representations of contemporary b ody ideals Participants and designers of devotional fitness programs virtually never question the idea that slimness (usually communicated in terms of 'health') is something one should strive for. I cannot go into the depths of the eme r- gence of contemporar y slimness ideals here,40 but it seems unquestionable that the bodies of devotional fitness reveal commonly accepted body ideals in their quest for fitness and slenderness. Michelle Mary Lelwica, who, in her 1999 book Starving for Salvation , has analyzed The Spiritual Dimension of Ea t- ing Problems among American Girls and Women agrees that Christian weight - loss programs incorporate 'prevailing cultural norms of health and beauty.'41 In bodies, and especially in female bodies,42 'the prevailing social order [is] negotiated and reproduced.'43 However, in the special case of devotional fi t- ness, this is not everything: Social norms are not only reproduced, they are, at the same time, reshaped and re -signified, so to speak. A 'healthy' (i.e., slen d- er) body is not only desirable because of the 'mundane' advantages associated with fitness (being popular, attractive, successful etc.). Also, and more impo r- tantly, it becomes 'the visible marker of godliness,' as Griffith concludes in her much acclaimed study on Flesh and Sp irit in American Christianity .44 In other words, the bodies in evangelical fitness programs enact a worldview which is underpinned both 'religiously' and 'secularly,' which implements both fleshly and spiritual matter. 40 See, e.g., Hillel Schwartz's oft -quoted study Never Satisfied: A Cultural History of Diets, Fant a- sies, and Fat (New York 1986). 41 Michelle Mary Lelwica , Starving for Salvation: The Spiritual Dimension of Eating Problems among American Girls and Women (Oxford 1999 ), 77. 42 For the time being, I cannot deal with devotional fitness from the perspective of gender st u- dies, even though this is a useful instrument which will be harnessed for my doctoral thesis. 43 Michelle Mary Lelwica , Starving for Salvation , 182. 44 Griffith, Born Again Bodies , 180. 276 MARTIN RADERMACHER CONCLUSIONS As this paper has shown, the embodiment paradigm sensu stricto with its central premise of the corporeal body as the existential ground of culture is a useful perspective when trying to approach devotional fitness. The co l- lapse of dualities, a central feature of the embodiment par adigm, is not only a goal in methodological discussions of scholarly kind, it is also a distinct fe a- ture of devotional fitness (as the example 'ActivPrayer' has shown, see above). Furthermore, various strands of contemporary spirituality highlight the i m- portance of (re -)uniting body and soul. Actors criticize the outworn dualities of body and soul in Christian theologies and, instead, formulate holistic co n- cepts of body and soul.45 As a result, I may notice that this is a common feature of both conte m- porary spirituality and evangelical fitness. On a more general level, devotio n- al fitness may therefore be seen in the wider context of contemporary spir i- tuality. Take, e.g., Giselle Vincett's and Linda Woodhead's idea of spirituality as presented in their contrib ution to Religions in the modern world . Spiritual i- ty as a meta -term, in their view, shows seven characteristics: (1) 'a value -laden contrast be tween spirituality and religion '; (2) 'emphasis on the importance of inner, subjective, ineffable exp e- rience '; (3) 'authorization of the individual to be the f inal arbiter of spiritual truth '; (4) 'high valuation of \"seeking;\" open and tolerant attitude towards other spiritual \"paths \"'; (5) 'promotion of practical, often embodied, means and techniques for attaining s piritual insight - e.g. meditat ion [or, in this embrace \"progressive\" and liberalism, democracy, self -development [...] '; (7) 'universalistic or \"holistic\" emphasis (i.e., an emphasis on the inte r- connectedness of things).'46 Except for the 'tolerant attitude towards other spiritual \"paths\"' (4) and the 'tendency to embrace \"progressive\" and \"anti -establishment\" causes' (6) most of these traits a re well applicable to describe devotional fitness. It does 45 Anna Fe dele & Blanes Kawanami & Christopher H. Partridge (eds.), Religions in the modern world: Traditions and transformations (London 2009), 319-337, esp. 320. DEVOTIONAL FITNESS I N US EVANGELICALISM 277 not agree with the evangelical worldview to appreciate non -Christian paths to salvation and most currents within US evangelicalism are politically co n- servative and do not embrace democracy. Especia lly the fifth point, however, the 'promotion of practical, often embodied, means and techniques for a t- taining spiritual insight,' gets hold of a central feature of devotional fitness. Slightly modifying the concept of Vincett and Woodhead , devotional fitne ss may nonetheless be considered as a highly embodied form of conte m- porary spirituality, one that poses specific challenges to the researcher and opens new horizons in the study of embodied culture and religion. 278 MARTIN RADERMACHER 279 16 Neurocalvinism Calvinism as a P aradigm for Neuroscience WILLEM VAN VLASTUIN VU University Amsterdam / University of t he Free State Bloemfontein ABSTRACT In order t o assert that the determinism of neuroscience is comparable with that of Calvinism , Dick Swaab , a leading neuroscientist , speaks of 'neuroca l- vinism.' To test this assertion, the author uses the classic view of Calvinism , propounded by Jonathan Edwards , as a conceptual framework . This allows the author to conclude that Edwards has a holist ic understanding of human pe r- sonality, that he defends compatibilism and upholds responsibility and mora l- ity. However, Swaab presents himself as an incompatibilist who has a tende n- cy to deny responsibility and morality. Th us, in the case of Edwards , it is not possible to speak about neurocalvinism. KEY WORDS neuroscience, determinism, necessity, compatibilism, free will, morality, responsi bility 1. INTRODUCTION Neuroscience is very popular among all kinds of people , particularly b e- cause this branch of science promis es to help us to develop an understanding of ourselves . One of the most important and perplexing issues concerning 280 WILLEM VAN VLASTUIN our human identity is the question of the freedom of will.1 It appears that our modern understanding of a human being - charact erized by having auto- nomous free will - is being undermined by neuroscience.2 It is understand a- ble that people are both shocked and , at the same time , hugely intere sted in the consequences of these discoveries, because these discoveries examine what our id entities as human beings are. Among the many questions raised by contemporary research are: can a system of neurons provide for features like freedom to reason and to decide? If our decisions are simply the product of a neuronal state, how can we be held m orally responsible for them ? One of the leading neurobiologists in The Netherlands is Dick Swaab who wrote a very popular book about neuroscience which attracted the i n- terest of thousands of people.3 In this book , he speaks about neuroscience as 'neurocal vinism ,' referring to the doctrine of predestination found in Calvi n- ism.4 In making this reference, he suggests that his approach to neuroscience , and the many consequences that it has for the understanding of human r e- sponsibility, will, personality and morality are comparable with , or are at least related to , the Calvinistic view of human beings, especially in its indic a- tion of a deterministic worldview.5 The suggested relationship between Ca l- vinism and neuroscience demands that a deeper examination of the relatio n- ship between the Calvinistic and neuroscientific understanding s of human beings is conducted . After some methodological clarification, th is paper describes in broad outline Jonathan Edward 's Calvinistic thoughts about free will and determi n- ism in relation to responsibility and morality. Consequently, a n investigation is made as to how Swaab's neuroscience relates to this Calvinistic paradigm. This leads to a conclusion about the 'Calvinistic' character of neuroscience 1 Some current wil bestaat niet. in het brein (Amsterdam wil? Perspecti e- ven op een heikele kwestie (Rotterdam 2011). 2 Much of the contemporary case for the illusory nature of free will is derived from the work of B. Libet, A. Freeman & K. Sutherland, 'Editor's Introduction: The Voli tional Brain,' Journal of Consciou s- 6/8-9 (1999), ix -xxiii, xvi. Cf. T. Bayne, 'Libet and the Case for Free Will Scepticism,' in: R.

In this context some considerations about the relevance of the concepts of freedom and determinism in Calvinism , and what these may add to the body of knowledge on neuroscience , are made . 2. METHODOLOGY Speaking about 'neurocalvinism' and relati ng neuroscience to Calvinism necessarily involves looking at a problem of methodology: can neuroscience be related to theology? Is n't it anachronis tic to compare a theologian of the eighteenth century with a neurobiologian of the twenty -first? Another que s- tion that concerns the broad scope of Calvinistic theology is: can it be spoken of as the Calvinistic theology? Questions such as these demand answers that can only be found at the level of methodology. Firstly, a neurobiologian is talking about 'neurocalv inism '; straight away this justifies the research question about whether Calvinism has some type of relationship with neuroscience. Secondly, given the fact that a neuroscientist is assert ing that neuroscience has implications for philosophy, morality, th e- ology and humanity, it is justified that , from the point of view of philosophy, morality and theology , the claims made by the neuroscientist should be e x- amined . Thirdly, since the turn of this century, there has been such a n enormous increase in the level of cooperation between theologians and ne u- robiologists in understanding the coherence of brains and religion that some people have even sp oken about 'neurotheology .'6 This is not the ultimate proof of the correctness of the relationship between theology an d neuro s- cience, but it is an indication that this cooperation is widely accepted. Fourthly, it can be argued that a relationship exists between theology and neuroscience, because although both academic disciplines look at perso n- hood and identity , they both hold very different views about the problem of the human will. Fifthly, given the fact that the implications of the discoveries 6 Compare www.ibcsr.org and the magazine, Religion, Brain and Behavior ; W.S. Brown, N. Mu r- phy & H. Newton Mahony (eds.), Whatever Happened to the Soul: Scientific and Theological Portraits of Human Nature (Minneapolis 1999); R.J. Russell, N. Murphy, T.C.

Meisinger & G. religious, science is in trouble: On neurotheology from a philosophy of science perspective,' in: Religion 39/4 (December 2009), 319 -324; W. VAN VLASTUIN made by neuroscience can justifiably be looked at from a theological point of view, it is clear that the choice of Calvinism is a given when Swaab's choice is made. A problem in the Calvinistic tradition is that this tradition is not u n- ambiguous about free will and necessity. There is a difference , for example, between the concepts of Calvin ,7 Voetius8 and Edwards.9 In this essay, Jonathan Edward's concept of free will is compared with that of Swaab, because firstly, Edwards opposes the same front of self - determination as Swaab.10 Secondly, Edwards opposes this front because he understands the tendencies of the modern age.11 Thirdly, the fact that E d- wards, despite his deterministic thinking , maintained morality and respons i- bility make it interesting to look at the key -structures of his thought. This leads to the formulation of the central question in this article: does S waab rightly refer to Edwards's Calvinism to underpin his concept of human pe r- sonality in relation to free will? 3. EDWARD S'S CONCEPT OF FREEDO M The Arminians of Edwards's time - as far as he understood - reasoned that determinism and necessity would de stroy freedom, responsibility and morality.12 Edwards's opponents understood human beings as impersonal machine s who acted from necessity and as the links in the chain of cause and effect. To maintain humanity they denied the necessity of human deeds and argued that human beings could not be held responsible for the deeds that they executed out of necess ity. To uphold responsibility and morality, a self - determining will was necessary. 7 See P. Helm , John Calvin's Ideas (Oxford 2004), 157 -183. 8 See A.J.

NEUROCALVINISM : CALVINISM AS A PARADI GM FOR NEUROSCIENCE 283 In this section , the holistic dimension o f Edwards's concept of freedom is explored and his qualification of the concept of freedom is examined in detail. Finally, an investigation is made into how Edwards reconciles dete r- minism on the one hand, with responsibilit y and morality on the other . 3.1 THE HOLISTIC DIMENSIO N OF EDWARDS 'S VIEW Edwards understands the Arminian concept of a self -determining will as follows: These several concepts belong to their notion of liberty: 1) That is, it consists of a self -determining power in the will, or a certain sovereignty which the will has over itself (...). 2) Indifference belongs to liberty in their notion of it, or that the mind, previous to the act of volition, is in equilibrio. 3) Contingence is another thing that belongs and is essential to it; not in the common acceptation of the word, as that has been already explained, but as opposed to all necessity, or any fixed and certain connection with some previous ground or reason of its exi s- tence.13 To achieve this freedom, Arminians isolate the will from the entirety of the human personal ity, which means that the functioning of the will is r e- duced to the moment of choosing and that choosing and willing become a c- cidental occurrences .14 A further consequence of this approach is that it is only the 'pure act ' of the will that values the 'act' of the will, not the habit that caused the act.15 This means that a bad heart could be an excuse for vice, but having a good disposition of the heart would be no reason to speak about virtue . The characteristic of this libertarian concept of free will is in diffe- rence .16 Edwards's deepest motivation for the rejection of this concept is the o- logical. He cannot accept the repudiation of determinism, because he unde r- 13 a certain (extreme) ve rsion of Libertarianism. For more about Libertarianism, see R.H. Kane, 'Libertarianism,' in: Fischer, Kane, Pereboom & Vargas, Four Views on Free Will (Oxford 2007), 5 -43. Kane defends an undetermined free will, 'Responsibility, Luck, and Chance: Reflectio ns on Free Will and Indeterminism, ' Journal of Philosophy 96, 217 -240. See also Joseph Keim Campbell, Free Will (Cambridge 2011); T.J. Mawson, Free Will: A Guide for the Perplexed (Lon don 2011); T. Honderich (ed.), 'The Determinism and Freedom Philosophy W ebsite,' http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/dfwIntroIndex.htm (accessed 2012, July 23). 284 WILLEM VAN VLASTUIN stands th is to be a repudiation of the all -decreeing God.17 Theological aspects of the dispute , such as these, are not included in this essay; however, efforts will be made to examine the anthropological arguments. Edwards's criticism is specifically directed at indifference as a property of the self -determining will: Those notions of liberty of con tingence, indifference and self -determination, as essential to guilt or merit, tend to preclude all sense of any great guilt for past and present wickedness (...). All wickedness of heart is excused as what, in i t- self, brings no guilt.18 Edwards criticizes th is concept of freedom, because its effect is the o p- posite of what is aimed at, namely the denial of responsibility and morality. According to Edwards, to value indifference as virtue contradicts common sense.19 It impl ies that a cold heart and a compassiona te attitude would both be valued equal ly by a friend in need. Another property of this concept of freedom concerns the function of commandments and promises. Because commandments are used to take away the indifference of the will and to influence will, commandments, ac- cording to the Arminian scheme, will undermine freedom, which is against all common sense. This view lead s one to the conclusion of inconsistence, because every appeal to virtue takes away the virtuous character of obedie nce to that appeal.20 Edwards does not only deny that morality and responsibility are bound to the Arminian concept of freedom, but returns the argument ; the Arminian concept of liberty of contingence, indifference and self - determination will destroy morali ty and responsibility instead of promoting it. To promote morality and responsibility, it is necessary to use the concepts of the habitual dispositions of the heart.21 This means that the human will cannot be isolated from the entirety of the human personality: If strict propriety of speech is to be insisted on, it may more properly be said, that the voluntary actions which is the immediate consequence and fruit of the mind's volition or choice, is determined by that which appears most agreeable, 17 WJE 16:722; P. Ramsey, 'Editor's introduction,' WJE 1:25-26. Edwards accepts the comparison with the Stoic worldview, however he rejects this concept because of the lack of freedom, WJE 1:372 - 374. Edwards defends that God chooses what is wise and most fitting, denying the arbitrariness of God's will, WJE 1:375 PARADI GM FOR NEUROSCIENCE 285 than the preference or choice itself, but that the act of volition itself is always determined by that in or about the mind's view of the object, which causes it to appear most agreeable.22 The implication of Edwards's concept is that human will is not to be un- derstood as a source of choices, but as an instrumental function of the h u- man person. The alternative to this instrumental function of the human will is that an indifferent will can make choices that go completely against the strongest incli nations of human personality, which would be absurd. This approach of Edwards coheres with another aspect of his concept. Instead of three hierarchical ly-ordered faculties of the soul , he speaks about two equal faculties, namely mind and will.23 The affecti ons are included in the will, which implies a less intellectualistic and a more voluntaristic and intuitive approach. Edwards denies that the human mind and the will are parts of the human soul, but understands them as being different modes of operation of the same human soul.24 In the background of Edwards's understanding of the status of human will is his worldview. As a child of the Newtonian age , he reason s from a m e- chani stic worldview in which the order of cause and effect form part of the basic struct ures of reality.25 It is important to understand that Edwards a p- plies this mechani stic worldview of cause and effect to his anthropology. This order means that it is absurd to infer that the human will causes itself. E d- wards compares this absurdity with an animal which begat itself and was hungry before it had being.26 In this way, Edwards confirms the absurdity of an uncaused free will and defends the stance that the will is determined by a combination of the object and the mind's view of the object.27 3.2 EDWARDS 'S VIEW OF FREEDOM AND RESPONSIBILITY Edwards formulates a second point of criticism o f the Arminian concept of freedom and necessity: of Jonathan Edwards , 311-318; P. Ramsey shows the relation to John Locke, WJE 1:49. 24 Cf. McClymond & Dermott, Theology of 314. Jonathan Edwards, 445. 286 WILLEM VAN VLASTUIN We are said to be naturally unable to do a thing, when we cannot do it even if we will, because what is most common ly called nature do es not allow it, b e- cause of some impending defect of obstacle that is extrinsic to the will, either in the faculty of understanding, constitution of body, or external objects. Moral inability is seen not in any of these things, but in ei ther the want of inclination or the strength of a contrary inclination, or the want of a sufficient motive in view to induce and excite the act of the will, or the strength of apparent m o- tives to the contrary (...). A woman of great honor and chastity may ha ve a moral inability to prostitute herself to her slave. A child of great love and duty to his pare nts may be unable to be willing to kill his father .28 Edwards distinguishes between natural and moral necessity to explain that the human inability to behave in a moral way can be against our will or in accordance with our will ; natural abilities are against our will, for example, while moral inabilities are not. However, Edwards is not completely clear about the boundar y of the definition of human inabilities, although his posi- tion does have the potential to distinguish moral necessity from other nece s- sities. In this way, Edwards qualifies the concept of necessity as maintain ing responsibility as a category on the one hand , and as maintain ing freedom as a categ ory on the other. This also leads to a redefinition of freedom: But I would observe one more thing concerning what is vulgarly called liberty, which is the power and opportunity for one to do and conduct himself as he will (...). Let the person come to his v olition or choice of how he will, yet, if he is able, and there is nothing in the way to hinder his pursuing and executing his will, the man is fully and perfectly free, according to the primary and co m- mon notion of freedom.29 In Edwards's view the Principl e of Alternative Possibilities is not a pre- requisite condition for the maint enance of freedom and responsibility, but the conscious voluntariness of human volition is a sufficient condition for it.30 For example: if a boy finds himself in a place where there is only one girl to bond with, and he loves this one girl, he loves her freely. Apparently, Edwards unites freedom and responsibility in the same way as the Arminians in his context do. If free will cannot be saved in a certain way, responsibility is los t. This approach implies that human beings are r e- sponsible for their moral ly bad behavior if natural inability was not the ca use 28 WJE 1:156 -160. Edwards was among those who work ed out this distinction . See P. Ramsey, 'Editor's Introduction,' WJE CALVINISM AS A PARADI GM FOR NEUROSCIENCE 287 of it, and if they behaved voluntarily in this bad way. Behind this viewpoint is the conviction that moral inability is ultimat ely qualified as unwillingness and for unwillingness there is no excuse.31 Edwards's view coheres with the distinction between human being s before and after the fall ; sin did not d e- stroy human will as a faculty, but changed its orientation. Despite sin , hum an will remained free but , because of the sinfulness of the heart , human beings are not free to choose good. The reverse is also true. The eschatological d i- mension of the work of the Spirit implies that believers' experience the hig h- est liberty that coheres with the necessity of virtues.32 In this way, Edwards clarifies his concept of freedom by distinguishing between moral and natural inability or necessity. This distinction gave him the opportunity to uphold freedom as a guarantee for morality and re spons i- bility. 3.3 CONCLUSION Edwards denied the dismissal of determinism, he accepted the Arminian conjunction between free will on the one hand and morality and responsibil i- ty on the other, and he offered his own concept of freedom in which he a p- pears to be a compatibilist, reconciling determinism and free will.33 In his attack on the Arminian concept of a self -determining will, Edwards designed an alternative holistic concept of the human soul in which understanding and will contribute equally to human id entity. In response to the Arminian concept of necessity, Edwards qualified necessity by making a distinction between moral and natural inability. In Edwards's understanding, freedom exists in the willingness of our will. In this way, Edwards could maintai n de- terminism and necessity on the one hand, while maintaining human fre e- dom, responsibility and morality on the other. Against the reproach that determinism and necessity would dehumanize human beings , reducing them to machine s, Edwards replied that the e xis- tence of human understanding and will upholds humanity. At the same time he clarifie d that the reproach actually attacks Arminians, who hold that a 31 WJE 1:307 -308. In the tradition after Edwards , the 'Exercisers' saw evil as concentrated in the will only. See McClymond & Dermott, Theology of Jonathan Edwards , 608. 32 WJE 1:364. Edwards sees the Christian life as an eschatological life, WJE 4:236 -237. 33 Edwards is a classic compatibilist. The new compatibilism (of Harry Frankfurt) makes a di s- tinction between first -order and second -order desires. If th e first -order desires are in control of the second -order desires, there is freedom. 288 WILLEM VAN VLASTUIN human being is less than machine, because the so -called machine of Edwards is led by human intelligence, while their human will is led by nothing at all.34 4. ASSESSMENT OF SWAAB 'S VIEW How does Swaab's view of free will compare to that of Edwards ? Accor d- ing to Swaab , our complete personality is controlled by billions of brain cells. Every choice , even religio us choice, can be related to the functioning of a part of the human brain. In other words, if the brain does not function, the h u- man spirit does not function. Because the functioning of human spirit can be described and explained in physical t erms, human will is controlled by phys i- cal laws. This explains the deterministic character of Swaab's understanding of human will. The difference between Edwards' s determinism and that of Swaab is that Edwards' s determinism has a metaphysical character while Swaab's physical determinism lacks this metaphysical dimension . The sim i- larity between Edwards and Swaab is that both accept the physical order of cause and effect. However, Edwards' s approach was not on the level of brain science; E d- wards's concept is open to Swaab's concept of physical determinism, knowing Edwards's acknowledgement of the physical order of cause and effect. With- out being explicit about the definition of free will or justifying the use of a certain definition, it can be determined that Swaab reacts against the unde r- standing that free will is described as the possibility of deciding or making choices without intern al or extern al restrictions. Given this understanding of free will , he denies the possibility of a complete freedom of the wi ll; he does not, however , define the word 'complete.' Both Edwards and Swaab deny the libertarian concept of human free will, which proposes that the ultimate decision about our existence, willing and acting is taken in an isolated abstract human will. Although Swaab misses the finer anthropological distinctions that Edwards makes about the relation ship between will and understanding, Edwards and Swaab agree that human will has to be understood and determined by the human personality, education and environ ment. At first glance, Edwards and Swaab seem to agree because t hey both oppose the same front . However , a more detailed examination reveals the differences between both views . Edwards is a comp a- tibilist, while Swaab is an incompatibilist, and as such, their view s are parallel 34 WJE 1:371. NEUROCALVINISM : CALVINISM AS A PARADI to soft determinism and hard determinism respectively. Swaab denies that a deterministic worldview coheres with the free will of human being s,35 while Edwards accepts and defends free will. Edwards understands human free will as human willingness in choosing and acting, relating free will to human consciousness. Swaab understands free will against the background of the Principle of Alternative Possibilities as an interpretative paradigm for f ree will, and he lacks the conceptual fram e- work to understand free will as an awareness of voluntarily choosing. On the one hand, he gives the impression that conscious willingness is no more than a product of unconscious neural brain processes; on the oth er hand, he is bound to this impression, because he understands consciousness as the result of unconscious processes which are control led by physical laws .36 The fact that Edwards and Swaab both defend the coherence of free will and responsibility ,37 and tha t Swaab denies the freedom of will, implies that Swaab tends to deny responsibility in social life.38 He illustrates this problem with several examples. Can a pedophile be responsible for his sexual orient a- tion as this orientation is caused by his genetic b ackground and the irregular development of his brain ? Parallel with his accept ance that a homophile orientation is not a choice, Swaab suggests that it is also acceptable to view kleptomania and other forms of aggressive and delinquent behavior as beh a- vior that is exhibited without choice , with all the consequences this has for accountability and responsibility. From Edwards's perspective , Swaab makes the same mistake as the A r- minians do by not distinguishing between moral and natural inability. Lack of th is distinction explains the lack of human freedom and the lack of any possibility of justifying morality and responsibility. While Edwards would blame Swaab for projecting the structures of natural ability and inability upon the moral dimension of human li fe, Swaab would reply that morality has to be understood in physical terms, namely neural processes. In this context, it is significant that Swaab denies the human soul.39 He argues that a 'psychon' does not exist, but a 'neuron' does. Dying means that brains stop functioning. He does not see any reason to think that the soul is anything more than the functioning of billions of brain cells and thinks that 35 Swaab, Wij zijn , 357. 290 WILLEM VAN VLASTUIN the universal belief in the existence o f the soul is based on anxiety about death and the desire that hu mans have to be reunited after death. Thus Swaab argues from the point of view of reductionism , in which the working of the soul is reduced to the functioning of brain cells.40 This leads to the overall conclusion that Swaab has a monistic materialistic und erstanding of human personality . Swaab's physical determinism has led him to conclude that physics is the all -embracing reality of the human being and that phys i- calism is 'all' (the position that only physical matter is needed to account for everything that exists in nature); a sure sign of this can be seen in the title of his bestseller: We are our brain. Here, the core of the difference between Edwards's and Swaab's views is explained. Edwards can accept physical determinism, but Swaab cannot a c- cept metap hysical determinism. Edwards accepts physical determinism as the natural order of cause and effect in which humanity participates, without reducing human being to physics. In Edwards's understanding of reality, the metaphysical world bears the physical rea lity. As an example: the physical world is for Edwards like a map of the world, while the reality of the world cannot be explained in terms of the map. All is physics, but physics is not all. This means that Edwards's worldview cannot be characterized as physicalism, but must be understood as metaphysicalism. Edwards's metaphysicalism made him reject the Arminian reproach that Calvinists understand the human being as a machine; the same meta - physicalism would analyse Swaab's concept of the human being as a machine. So an answer has been derived for the central question of this essay: does Swaab rightly refer to Edwards's Calvinism to underpin his concept of human personality in relation to free will? The answer is n o. 5. CONCLUSION AND CONSID ERATIONS Table 1. Comparison of Edwards's and Swaab's understanding of determi n- ism and free will Perspective Edwards Swaab Metaphysics? Yes No Physical determinism? Yes Yes 40 Cf. B. Keizer, Waar blijft de ziel? (Rotterdam 2012), 61 CALVINISM AS A PARADI GM FOR NEUROSCIENCE 291 Libertarian understanding of will? No No Compatibilism? Yes No Freedom of will? Yes No Responsibility and morality? Yes No Table 1 illustrates the comparability of Edwards's and Swaab's unde r- standing s of physical determinism and the libertarian understanding of will. Edwards and Swaab differ on all other points ; while Edwards is a compatib il- ist , Swaab is not. Edwards 's position allows the possibility of speak ing about freedom of will, while Swaab denies it. Responsibility and morality are integral to the structure of Edwards's concept of human personality, while Swaab's concept denies any space for them . These differences go back to an acceptance or rejection of metaphysics. We can conclude that Swaab's 'ne u- rocalvinism' and Edwards' Calvinism are not compatible. Swaab 's approach brought us into contact with physicalism , a stance that under stands reality as a closed physical system. While reductive - physicalism can easily be attacked, this is not the case with non -reductive physicalism whose main tenet is that the mind operates at a higher level of complexity and cannot be directly reduced to physical conditions, implying that mental states are a byproduct of the physical state of the brain. Does this reveal that there is some openness here to the concept of the human soul? Scientists, philosophers and theologians are afraid of a Cart e- sian dua lism of soul and body. While a concept of the human soul cannot be developed within Cartesian dualism, this does not indicate that we do not have to think about the concept of the human soul. This research indicates that we are not to be enclosed in physic alism. Edwards's distinction between metaphysics and physics offers a midway between physical monism on the one hand and Cartesian dualism on the other,41 namely a duality within a coherent reality which guarantee s human freedom, responsibility and moral i- ty.42 41 For Edwards' s criticism of Descartes, cf.

CHONG H O YU Azusa Pacific University ABSTRACT Two seminal experiments in neuroscience indicated that brain activities were detected by EEG or fMRI before the participants were aware of their decisions. The findings suggested that free will is an illusion. It is assumed that conscious decision is a nec essary condition for free will. However, the history of science is full of examples about how problem -solving emerged from unconsciousness, such as Kekule's benzene ring and polymerase chain reaction. The author su g- gests that free will should be viewed as a continuum with self -imposed co n- straints, rather than being equated with the absence of any constraint or phy s- ical disposition. KEYWORDS continuum, atheism, materialism, naturalism, history of science , free will, physical tendency, determinism NEUROSCIE NTIFIC CHALLENGE OF FREE WILL Since the 1980s two seminal studies in neuroscience have been provo k- ing debates regarding free will and determinism. In a study that utilized 294 CHONG HO YU Electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor the brain waves of subjects, Libet, Gleason, Wright and Pearl discovered the state of 'readiness potentials ' (RP), which are the activation s of specific areas of the cerebral cortex prior to the participants' conscio us decision of moving their finger. To be fair to Libet, he realized that there is a small window of opportunity for the conscious mind to overrule the action. This implies that we have 'free won't' instead of free will.1 The central idea of Libet is that unconscious processes initiate our co n- scious experiences .2 However, quite a few subsequent writers, such as Daniel Wegner, took Libet's experiment to advocate the notion that conscious will is just an illusion.3 In a similar thread, Haynes and his colleagu es utilized functional ma g- netic resonance imaging (fMRI) to monitor patients as they were asked to make a decision. They found that brain activities had already occurred before the participants made the conscious decision of pushing a left or right bu t- ton. Haynes's research team stated that they could predict what a participant would do six to ten seconds before that participant is aware of his or her choice.4 Soon, Brass, Heinze, and Haynes explicitly stated, ' The impression that we are able to freely choose between different possible courses of action is fundamenta l to our mental life. However, it has been suggested that this subject ive experience of freedom is no more than an illusion and that our actio ns are initiated by unconscious mental pro cesses long before we become aware of our intention to act.'5 The objective of this paper is to explain why the common interpretation of these two experiments fails to deny free will, and to offer an alternate e x- planation: free will is a continuum, and th us any physical disposition or co n- straint detected by neuroscience does not necessarily constitute evidence against free will. On the contrary, exercising free will is making self -imposing constraints , as indicated by the adage, 'You make habits and habits make 1 Benjamin Libet.

When habits are formed, our behaviors work similar to an 'auto -pilot' mode. Specifically, our actions are driven by unconscious tendencies, which have been previously developed in a conscious mode. ATHEISM AND NATURALIZATION O F MIND On the b asis of the findings of neuroscience, Sam Harris, one of the 'four horsemen ' of the New Atheism, declared that free will is nothing but an ill u- sion and wishful thinking.6 By the same token, Jerry Coyne stated, 'I'm star t- ing to realize there are striking pa rallels between belief in God and belief in free will. There is no evidence for the existence of either, and plenty of ev i- dence against both. Belief in both makes people feel better .'7 Determinism does not necessarily go hand in hand with atheism while the notion of free will is not inherent in religion. This is exemplified by both Buddhism and Christianity. Buddhism embraces the doctrine that a coherent self is illusory. The so -called 'self' is a result of a tentative composition of fleeting elements. Sinc e there is no authentic self, there is, consequently, no genuine will.8 Further, within the Christian community there have been d e- bates regarding Calvinism and various schools that advocate free will .9 None- theless, as mentioned in the beginning, atheism an d the rejection of free will seem to form a strong association (e.g. Sam Harris, Jerry Coyne). The histor i- cal root of this connection could be traced back to as far as the 18th century. Long before Harris and Coyne, D'Holbach (1723 -1789) had asserted that free will was an illusion. So -called the concept of ' choice ' could not provide any escape from the causal chain that stretches back to our birth. According to Nichols, D'Holbac h is arguably the best example of a hard determinist from the early period of modern philosophy. As a naturalist (materialist), D'Hol - bach supported psychological determinism, the philosophical view that all mental processes are determined by prior psychol ogical or physical events. It is his conviction that nature consists of substance and motion only, hence 6 Sam Harris, Free Will (New York: Free Press, 2012), 5. 7 Adam Fetterman, 'Free Will is the New God,' Social Psychology Eye (2001) [http://socialpsychologyeye.wordpress.com/2011/06/14/free -will-is-the-new-god/ ]. 8 Shaun Nichols, Great Philosophical Debates: Free Will and Determinism (Chantilly, VA: Teac h- ing company 2008), 46. 9 Roger Olson, Against Calvinism (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan 2011). 296 CHONG HO YU everything in nature, including the human mind, is subject to and can be e x- plained by physical laws.10 This 'naturalization ' of the mind is echoed by q uite a few modern sch o- lars. The 'astounding hypothesis' proposed by Crick is a typical example: 'Your joys and your sorrows, your memories and your ambitions, your sense of personal identity and free will, are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast as sembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules. As Lewis Ca r- roll's Alice might have phrased it: \" You're nothing but a pack of neurons .\"'11 Additionally , according to Bloom and Weisberg, the 'common sense ' that the mind is fundamentally different from the brain comes naturally to children. Preschool children accept that the brain is responsible for some aspects of mental life, such as solving math problems. But at the same time , they deny that the brain has something to do with loving one's brother. To Bloom and Weisberg, the mind is simply the brain, and therefore they are resentful that this type of 'nonscientific ' concept, grounded in common -sense intuitions, is transmitted by seemingly trustworthy sources.12 To people who subscribes to the materialis tic and natural worldview, free will is considered mystical or even supernatural. Nothing can go beyond materials; everything must be explained by physical laws formulated by science. Apparently, the advent of neuroscience provides evidence to support the view that the mind is the brain and free will is illusory. However, the a r- gument based upon the Libet and Haynes experiments has two major logical flaws. First, it assumes that a conscious decision is a necessary condition for free will. The title of Wege ner's book even equates free will with conscious will. It seems that i f the conscious awareness of the action and the brain a c- tivity associated with the action do not happen simultaneously, we are not considered free to choose our action. Second, if our th ought is limited by a certain physical disposition, there is no free will either. The counter - argument given by the author is anchored by the definition of free will d e- rived from classical compatibilism, the view that free will and determinism are fully co mpatible.13 According to classical compatibilism, free will is not the opposite of indeterminism, in which nothing can restrict our mind.

FREE WILL AS A CONTINUUM WITH SELF-IMPOSING CONSTRAINTS ARE UNCONSCIOUSNESS , FREE WILL COMPA TIBLE? 297 ther, free will implies that our minds are free from external coercion only. But the presence of internal compulsion, including our desire and disposition, does not negate free will. ARE INTENTIONS ALWAYS CONSCIOUS ? Marcel wrote, 'Many psychologists seem to assume that intentions are by their nature conscious.'14 Bargh and Morsella call it 'conscious -centric b i- as.'15 They pointed out that until quite recently in the history of science and philosophy, mental life was viewed as mostly conscious in essence. This view is manifested by Desc artes' cogito (I think therefore I am) and Locke's 'mind first' cosmology. In reality, a ctions resulting from unconscious thought might precede the conscious mind. In other words, action precedes reflection. Sim i- larly, Schlosser argued that actions yielded from free will are not always co n- sciously initiated. Every conscious event may have unc onscious precursors.16 Mele illustrated the unconscious mode of intentions by using an ever y- day example: He goes to his office almost every morning. When he intentio n- ally unlocks his office door, he's operating in the auto -pilot mode. He does not need a con scious decision to unlock it. However, if he hears a fight in the office, then he might pause for a moment to decide whether he should co n- tinue to keep his door unlocked or leave.17 Mele criticized that Libet and his followers were confused between urge (wa nting, wish, or desire), intention, and decision. In Libet's experiment, the participants' physical tendency to move a finger might be considered a desire, but it is not an intention at all. As explained before, there is a subtle difference between intenti on and dec i- sion, and the former does not require full consciousness.18 In Mele's view, the readiness potentials discovered by Libet should be treated as an urge, not an intention or a decision. In addition, Mele pointed 14 Anthony Marcel, 'The Sense of Agency: Awarene ss and Ownership of Action,' in: Johannes Roessler & Naomi Eilan (ed s.), Agency and Self -Awareness: Issues in Philosophy and Psychology (Oxford: Clarendon Press 2003), 48 -93, esp. 60. 15 John A.

This preparation might have created the so -called readiness potentials. Interestingly enough, Schlosser offered a similar counter -argument: the subjects in Libet's e xperiments made a conscious decision to participate in the study and follow the instruction. Schlosser called it 'distal intention ' because the action following the intention is not immediate. However, the conscious decisions made at the beginning of the study 'work their way ' into the motor control system.19 Schlosser argued that most of our decisions have two components: what to do a nd when to do. The former is more important than the latter because the when -decision, concerned with how to implement a what -decision, is made after the what - decision. The author of this article would like to use this example: if a woman says 'yes' to her boyfriend's proposal, this is certainly a what -decision. What happens next is concerned with deciding when the wedding and the hone y- moon will take place. In a sense the wedding and the honeymoon are 'pre- determined ' by the what -decision earlier. Following this line of reasoning Libet's study at best implies that certain when -decisions are tied to physical dispositions, but not what -decisions.20 The history of science is full of examples about how innovations and problem -solving emerge from unconsciousness. Many times the scientists made a conscious commitment to solve a particular problem, and this dec i- sion 'worked its way ' into the unconscious side of the mental structure. For example, Kekule found the solution to the problem of the structure of a be n- zene m olecule while watching the snake -like dance of fire in his fireplace. Indeed, the solution did not pop up 'suddenly. ' Long before the vision at the fireplace, Kekule had seen a gold ring consisting of two intertwined snakes biting their own tails. By citin g the example of the benzene ring, Seifert, Meyer, Davidson, Patalano and Yaniv speculated that the final steps on the road to insight may be subconscious.21 Had the brain of Kekule been scanned by modern medical equipment, we would have observed that befor e Kekule solved the problem, the image of the snake had already activated certain se c- tions of his brain. However, it is problematic to say that Kekule should not be Seifert, David E. Meyer, Natalie Davidson, Andrea L. Patalano & Ilan Yaniv , 'Demy s- tification of Opportunistic Assimilation and the Prepared -Mind Perspective,' in: Janet Davidson & Robert Sternberg (eds.), The Nature of Insight (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press 1995), 65 - 124. FREE WILL AS A CONTINUUM WITH SELF-IMPOSING CONSTRAINTS ARE UNCONSCIOUSNESS , PHYSICAL TENDENCY , AND FREE WILL COMPA TIBLE? 299 praised for the discovery because it is 'determined ' by his brain or the gradual built -up o f the solution is unconscious. The invention of the polymerase chain reaction by molecular biologist Kary Mullis followed a similar path. Mullis said, 'The revelation came to me one Friday night in April, 1983, as I gripped the steering wheel of my car an d snaked along a moonlit mountain road into northern California's redwood country .'22 Again, it is unlikely that the solution emerged 'suddenly. ' Like the participants in Libet's experiment, Mullis had decided to conduct research in biotechnology and this d istal what -decision 'worked its way ' into his cogn i- tive system. But unlike Libet's subjects, Mullis virtually had no control of the when -decisions. Rather, certain areas of his brain had definitely been act i- vated to pave the way for the solution. FREE WI LL IS NOT FREE OF INTERNAL COMPULSION To a certain extent the study conducted by Haynes and his associates is a more serious challenge to free will than Libet's study . The former has no component relating to response readiness, and thus the counter -argume nt based on distal what -decisions and when -decisions becomes irrelevant. In Haynes et al.'s experiment, subjects could decide to choose pressing one of two buttons with either the left or the right index finger. However, at most Haynes's study implies tha t our decision is confined or influenced by our physical condition of the brain. Haynes could predict a left or right button press with 60% accuracy only. In other words, there is a 40% chance that the subject could override the physical tendency. Indeed i t is harder to defend absolute determinism than free will. The probability that X will happen or X will be 'chosen ' must be 100% in order to call the event 'pre-determined. ' However, if there is just 1% probability that X will not ha p- pen, it has left suffi cient room for free will to act . Consider this hypothetical scenario: There is a country that has been ruled by a dictator for more than half a century. In this nation information is tightly filtered and controlled. As a result, all citizens are brainwashe d to unconditionally support the regime. The population of this nation is 10 million, but out of these 10 -million people there are a few dissident s who dare to promote democracy, liberty, and h u- 22 Sunny Auyang, 'Chance and the Prepared Mind in Dr ug Discovery,' Creating Technology: Eng i- neering and Biomedicine (2012) [ http://www.creatingtechnology.org/biomed/chance.pdf ]. 300 CHONG HO YU man rights , and speak against the regime. One may argue that the majority of these people are 'pre-determined ' to be submissive, and they have 'no choice. ' But as long as there is the probability that one out of a million people could choose otherwise, free will prevails. In p robability and statistics there are many different f orms of distributions, such as C hi-square distribution s, t- distribution s, F-distribution s, and Poisson distribution s. In short, every event has a distribution and even extreme cases (outliers). Uniform ou tcomes across all the members in a sample or a population are not realistic. Natura l- ists or materialists maintain that everything is subject to natural or physical laws. Following this line of reasoning, probability and statistical laws, which tell us that not everyone has exactly the same respon se or action, are also part of natural law. Haynes demonstrated that our will or mind has a physical basis, but his notion is indeed fully compatible with the philosophy of 'embodied mind .'23 In other words, free wil l should not be equated with the absence of any co n- straints or influences, including our bodily constraints. Simply put, the n o- tion of embodied mind rejects the mind -body dualism that has been prev a- lent in the Western culture for several centuries, and fac ulty psychology that has been misguiding psychologists for a century. Lakoff and Johnson wrote, 'The architecture of your brain's neural network determines what concepts you have and hence the kind of reasoning you can do .'24 In this view, our pe r- ception is equated with our conceptualization, and vice versa. Take our concept of colors as an example. The perception of color is based on human internal neural structures and the external physical cond i- tions (e.g. wavelength). We perceive that a banana is yellow even under di f- ferent lighting conditions.25 This color consistency results from our brain's ability to compensate for variations in the light source. As a photographer, this author is well -aware of the interactive nature of our perception. If we take an in door photo under fluorescent bulbs without a flash unit, the pi c- ture will be flooded with green light. There is nothing wrong with your ca m- era. In fact, the camera sensor and lens capture the exact lighting. In a room we 'see' white light instead of green because our brain compensat es for the 'incorrect ' color. In short, our color concepts have a strong physical base.

FREE WILL AS A CONTINUUM WITH SELF-IMPOSING CONSTRAINTS ARE UNCONSCIOUSNESS , PHYSICAL TENDENCY , AND FREE WILL COMPA TIBLE? 301 though the theory of embodied mind did not arise from the context of the free will -determinism debate, it is still highly relevant in the s ense that our mind is never independent from our physical configuration. But does it mean that we are not free? It depends on how we define free will. One of the classical definitions of free will is that it requires the absence of constraint (coercion and interference). But this definition does not specify whether the source of coercion and interference is internal or external. If my action is caused by external compulsion, I have no free will. For example, if I am a slave , my labor is not freely chosen. B ut what if I am an alcoholic who is driven by my internal urge to indulge in binge drinking? Did I lose my free will? Am I still responsible for my obsession? The same question can be asked about drug addicts, compulsive gamblers, and even psycho -killers. By common sense we might say, 'They are still responsible for what they did in spite of their internal compulsion or physical disposition though they may not be fully responsible. ' Yamada (personal communication) went even fu r- ther to assert that 'free wil l has more to do with the ability to overcome or nullify constraints and to institute and enforce new constraints, than it does with the absence of constraints. ' When the author talked to several recovered or recovering gamblers during a short term mission trip in Panama, it was observed that many gamblers and ex -gamblers go back and forth between the old and new lifestyles. The most effective way to overcome obsession is not trying to free oneself from the constraint by will alone. Rather, the person must build a new healthy habit as a replacement of the old one. In short, e x- ercising free will is making self -impos ed constraints, a new type of internal compulsion. You make habits and habits make you! Hence, free will might not be as dichotomous as most peop le thought (either your choice is totally free or your behaviors are totally determined). Rather, it should be viewed as a continuum between two polarities. In Haynes 's experiments on the average there is a 40% chance that you could do otherwise, but there is a distribution or within -group variance. Some people might have a high degree of internal compulsion and some may have a wea k- er one. In the perspective of within -subject distribution and free will/deter - minism being a part of a continuum, perhaps free will and determinism are compatible. 302 CHONG HO YU DISCUSSION In summary, if we do not confine free will to conscious decisions and e x- tend free will to boundless freedom without any internal disposition and compulsion, then it seems that Libet's and Haynes' s studies cannot decisively negate the existence of free will. Nonetheless, by recognizing that our mind is embodied and our will is influenced by the neural structures, free will and determinism are better considered as a continuum instead of a dichotomy. The challenge to free will introduced by Libet and Haynes is not new. Its scientific root can be traced back to as early as the 17th century. Based on Newtonian physics, French scientist Laplace claimed that everything in the universe is determined by phy sical laws. If there is an intellectually powerful being (called Laplace's demon) that can fully comprehend Newtonian law, and knows the position and momentum of every particle in the universe, then he could definitely predict every event in history. Origi nally Laplace's determinism was applied to the realm of extended, spatial, material su b- stance s only. Later this type of determinism was expanded to the realm of psychological events. Under determinism, there is only one necessary ou t- come in the causal chai n.26 Interestingly enough, like the bond between modern determinism and atheism, Laplace's determinism is also associated with a naturalistic tendency. When Laplace presented his scientific theory to Napoleon, Napoleon wondered how God could fit into the theory. Laplace answered, 'I have no need of that hypothesis.'27 Today determinism and this type of alleged predictive power switch the foundation from physics to neuroscience. However, later the probabilistic worldview of quantum mechanics overshadows the L aplace demon. Accor d- ing to quantum mechanics, there are infinite possible universes. Physicists found that in the subatomic world, events are not the inevitable and unique solution to single -valued differential equations, but are the random expre s- sion of a probability distribution. The present state limits the probability of future outcomes, but does not determine a definite fixed result .28 Heise n- berg's uncertainty principle shows us that we cannot measure the position and the momentum of a particle at the same time, and thus Laplace's demon is physically impossible. Laplace's view emerged at the dawn of modern phy s- ics (Newtonian mechanics) and needless to say, his assertion was premature 26 Ian Hacking, The Taming of Chance (Cambridge, UK: CUP, 1992). 27 Rouse Ball, A Short Account of the History of Mathematics (Mineola, NY: Dover, 1908/2010). 28 Roy Weatherford, The Implications of Determinism (New York: Routledge, 1991). FREE WILL AS A CONTINUUM WITH SELF-IMPOSING CONSTRAINTS ARE UNCONSCIOUSNESS , PHYSICAL TENDENCY , AND FREE WILL COMPA TIBLE? 303 and over -simplistic. Bluntly speaking, neuroscience is a fairly new di scipline, and after all, Libet and Haynes only studied a very simple form of awareness and decision -making: moving the finger. However, if someday neuroscie n- tists could predict whether a college graduate would continue on to graduate study or which stock a n investor would buy, then we would have to take a fresh look into this area of study. For now any bold statements or strong inf e- rences out of these experiments should be interpreted with caution.29 29 Special thanks to Dr. Walter Yamada, Mr. Craig Jentink, Mr. Paul Cords, Miss.
