Under the direction of the State, Local Education and Local Government Insurance committees, this division of the Department of Finance and Administration manages insurance benefits for more than 140,000 employees and 26,000 Medicare eligible retirees and their families from public sector organizations in Tennessee. At the end of 2014, the state-sponsored plans provided health insurance coverage to more than 308,000 individuals. The data presented here demonstrate program, statistical and financial trends for the plans. The financial statements reflect the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. While the state group insurance program sponsors the coverages and programs reviewed in this report, we work in partnership with 13 contractors and a number of other state agencies to deliver services to program members. The results reported here reflect their contributions and the leadership of the Insurance Committees. Sincerely, Laurie Lee, Executive Director Larry B.

Authorization Number 317238, 100 copies, November 2015. This public document was promulgated at a cost of $4.43 per copy.2 0 14 A n n u Al R e p o Rt 1Benefits Administration operates within the State of Tennessee's Department of Finance and Administration. The division admin - isters health, dental, vision, life and long-term care insurance coverages for more than 308,000 public sector employees, retirees and their eligible dependents. In addition to insurance coverages, the division also adminis - ters an employee assistance program and integrated disease management and wellness programs. These related programs complement insurance programs by educating employees and their families about prevention and behaviors that can affect their mental and physical health. State group insurance program participants include state govern - ment and higher education employees, as well as employees of local school systems and local government agencies who choose to participate in one of the state-sponsored plans. Various quasi- governmental and nonprofit agencies receiving state support may also elect to participate in the local government plan. In 2014, the state offered all members two health insurance options \u2014 the Partnership PPO and Standard PPO. Both PPOs are available statewide and members have the choice of two medical insurance carriers \u2014 BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee or Cigna. Overview Enrollment Highlights Total Group Health Lives 274,117 Employees: State Partnership PPO 48,459 State Standard PPO 21,286 Local Education Partnership PPO 32,402 Local Education Standard PPO 13,866 Local Education Limited PPO 9,130 Local Government Partnership PPO 4,766 Local Government Standard PPO 3,730 Local Government Limited PPO 3,959 Total Employee Group Health 137,598 Optional Dental Coverage 82,642 Optional Life Insurance Products 83,194 Optional Long-Term Care Coverage 2,746 Optional Vision Coverage 46,435 Retiree Medicare Supplement 34,307A third option is available to participants in the local education and local government plans. The Limited PPO is a high-deduct - ible plan. It is also available statewide with claims and networks administered by either BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee or Cigna. The division contracts separately with CVS/caremark for prescrip - tion drug coverage and Magellan Health for behavioral health services for all plan options. The PPOs cover the same services, treatments and products with one important difference \u2014 members who choose the Partner - ship PPO must agree to a partnership promise. The promise requires members to take certain steps to maintain or improve their health. In return, these members pay lower premiums, copays, coinsurance, deductibles and have lower out-of pocket maximums than those choosing the Standard PPO. In addition to health insurance, participants in all three plans may enroll in optional dental coverage choosing either the preferred dental plan administered by Delta Dental of Tennessee or the prepaid plan administered by Assurant Employee Benefits. Vision coverage is available to all state plan members. Members in the local education and local government plans are also eligible, if coverage is offered by the employing agency. Vision coverage is administered by EyeMed. Medicare supplement coverage is available to Medicare eligible retirees who participate in the TN Consolidated Retirement System and certain state and local education plan members who participate in an optional retirement plan. Coverage is administered by the POMCO Group. State employees are provided with basic term life and accidental death and dismemberment coverage, in addition to optional term life and accidental death, underwritten by Minnesota Life. Long-term care insurance is available to all state plan employees, retirees and eligible family members through MedAmerica Insurance Company. This coverage is also available to local education and local government plan members, if offered by the employing agency.I n t Ro d u c t Io n Source: State of Tennessee and Partner Vendors2 2 0 14 A n n u Al R e p o RtThe authorization for providing group insurance benefits for public officers, state, local education and local government employees and retirees is found in Chapter 27 of Title 8, Tennessee Code Annotated. The benefit plans authorized by this legislation are governed separately by three committees identified as the State, Local Education and Local Government Insurance Committees. Each committee represents the interests of the employer(s) and their employees and retirees in financially separate benefit plans.

Our Mission: Deliver comprehensive, affordable, dependable and sustainable benefits Our Vision: Healthy members; peace of mind oVerVieW Benefits Administration continues to deliver value to our members by implementing conservative and accountable plan design and fiscal policy in order to sustain a market competitive benefit. Specifically, the division has a consistent focus on four key levers to deliver value: Purchasing \u2014 Ensure we obtain best pricing through competi - tive procurements that leverage the state's purchasing power and vendor core competencies Plan design \u2014 Balance plan design with value-based incen - tives for management of chronic disease Population health \u2014 Build data-driven health management and wellness supports into the plan design to raise member accountability for health behaviors and improve health outcomes Pay for value \u2014 Increase the accountability of contractors and providers so that we pay for improved quality and competitive cost, not volume For the period July 1, 2013, to June 2014, all four plans continued to perform better than projected and have an esti - mated total available solvency reserve above the target solvency reserve set for calendar year 2014. The year over year premium increases for the State, Local Education and Local Government Plans from 2010 - 2014 have averaged 3.7 percent, 3.2 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively, for each of the plans, well below the industry average. The plans continue to reap the benefits of the integrated popula - tion health strategy introduced with the Partnership PPO through consolidated disease management, lifestyle management and wellness services. Evidence of these improvements includes reduced inpatient, outpatient and emergency department utili - zation and increased preventive screening rates. We continue to evaluate the impact of the Partnership PPO incentives and population health contract to determine the overall value of this investment to our plans and our members. KeY actionS in 2014 purchasing In 2014, the Insurance Committees approved the following contract awards and amendments. All contracts were competi - tively procured: CVS/caremark for pharmacy benefits management services \u2014 As pharmacy costs continue to outpace average medical inflation, the consolidation and competitive procurement of pharmacy is a key lever in cost control University Community Health Services for clinic development and management \u2014 This contract provides clinic services for state plan members in the Nashville area. While the clinic is located in middle Tennessee, as a self-funded plan, any cost savings from this clinic benefit all state plan members Group purchasing of voluntary products helps keep premiums low through leveraging our purchasing power and competi - tive procurement EyeMed contract amendment with a one-time premium increase of 2.4 percent effective 2015 through the term of the contract (2017) \u2014 this is a voluntary, optional benefit for health plan members Delta Dental and Union Security contract extensions for 2015 with a 2.1 percent premium increase \u2014 these are voluntary, optional benefits for health plan members Minnesota Life for optional term contract amendment to revise the definition to cover dependents from the time of live birth \u2014 this is a voluntary, optional benefit for state plan members pLan DeSiGn Benefits changes Benefits changes for the Partnership and Standard PPOs in 2014 were minimal and largely reflected requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) for member cost sharing: Per individual copay maximum out-of-pocket were unchanged for the Partnership and Standard PPOs. Charges included in the copay out-of-pocket maximum expanded to include emer - gency room, chiropractic and urgent care in-network visits A pharmacy out-of-pocket copay maximum per individual was added for Partnership, Standard and Limited PPOs For the Limited PPO, pharmacy and medical out-of-pocket maximums were combined Additional benefit changes to the Limited PPO ensured that pricing more closely reflected the product's actuarial value and expected selection/underwriting risk in 2014. The plans also implemented a preferred specialty pharmacy plan design for use of growth hormones. \u00bb \u00bb \u00bb 2 0 14 A n n u Al R e p o Rt \u0018I n t Ro d u c t Io n LOOkinG Back new plan and carrier options In addition to overall healthcare cost pressures faced by employers, federal reform presents additional challenges to our local education agencies. The PPACA requires large employers to provide affordable coverage that meets \"minimum value\" for all eligible employees or pay penalties. For some local educa - tion agencies, PPACA requirements may increase the number of people who are required to be covered under insurance, as well as the employer contribution to ensure the coverage is affordable. Benefits Administration received both written and verbal requests from fiscal directors and others at local education agencies to offer an affordable coverage option to provide relief for those agencies struggling to comply with employer \"shared respon - sibility\" payments. In response to these concerns, the Local Education Insurance Committee approved the Limited PPO as an additional option within the portfolio of products offered by the local education plan to employees. The Insurance Committees approved adding Cigna's LocalPlus network in middle Tennessee in addition to the existing BlueCross BlueShield Network S and the Cigna Open Access Plus (OAP) Network, which provides improved pricing over their OAP network. The addition of Cigna's LocalPlus Network increased choice with no member disruption, as the existing network options remained. pLan fUnDinG premium increases Each year staff recommends to the State, Local Education and Local Government Insurance Committees what the division believes are appropriate insurance premiums to sufficiently fund the plans. Sufficient funding is required to pay claims expenses, pay administrative and program fees to various contractors and establish sufficient reserves to account for claims incurred but not yet reported and claims fluctuation. The premium rate increases implemented in 2014 were recommended by the division's consulting actuary, Aon Hewitt, and are based on historical costs per contract, assumptions about expected future cost increases, regulatory requirements and salary increases. Premium increases for 2014 were: State Plan: 5.5 percent Local Education Plan: 5.6 percent Local Government Plan: 5.3 percent Medicare Supplement Plan: 0 percent premium incentives Benefits Administration continues to seek benefit design options that improve value to our members while offering affordable and sustainable benefits. In 2011 we introduced the concept of premium incentives to engage members in both their personal health choices and their health purchasing decisions. The PPO surcharge for the Standard PPO incents member selection of the Partnership PPO, which is designed to improve member health status. The network surcharges reflect the wide price varia - tion among provider networks and encourage our members to consider less costly providers. For 2014, there were no changes to the existing premium surcharges.operationS Benefits Administration made key investments in personnel to improve our clinical expertise and risk management functions with the addition of a director of clinical services, an epidemi - ologist and a HIPAA compliance officer. In our call center we continue to focus on automated solutions, such as knowledge base software and expanded use of employee self-service functionality, to improve efficiency and quality of our customer service. In addition, Benefits Administration provided support to all of our agencies in understanding the impact of the employer responsibility requirements of the PPACA. onGoinG cHaLLenGeS While our strategies have been able to keep premium increases low over the last five years, absent any changes in our plans, our actuarial consultants forecast a return to a higher medical trend, due to the rapid growth in pharmacy trend and the improved economy. To address this continued cost challenge, Benefits Administra - tion began to research Consumer Driven Health Plan (CDHP) designs. This exploration included conversations with medical carriers, our member agencies and internal state partners to determine interest in a CDHP with Health Savings Account (HSA) for introduction in calendar year 2016. We continue to focus on increased accountability of all stake - holders to help solve the challenge of increasing healthcare cost: Through plan design and financial incentives, increasing member accountability for taking steps to reduce health risks and take charge of their own health; Improved carrier and provider accountability to adhere to best practices and to pay for value of healthcare, not volume; and Care with designing and conducting competitive procurements to ensure best value in purchasing and benefit design As this report demonstrates, as a result of our procurement, plan design and plan management, the plans continue to see below market premium increases and improvements in member preventive care and appropriate utilization. \u0018 2 0 14 A n n u Al R e p o Rtp Ro gR Am An d S t AtI StIcAl I n f o RmAtIo n Partnershi P PPO The state group insurance program has been facing unparal - leled financial challenges, even as we worked to continue to provide comprehensive, affordable, dependable and sustainable health benefits for all of our plan members. The three insurance plans paid out more than $1.36 billion in healthcare claims in 2014. Excess disease burden is one of the principal drivers of the growth in costs in the public sector plans. Plan members prevalence of chronic conditions such as coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis is higher than the national and state averages for individuals with insurance. Members also have a higher utilization than other comparable populations such as the insured residents of the nation's southeastern region as a whole. To address this issue, we developed the Partnership PPO in 2011, which rewards members who agree to take responsibility to engage in maintaining or improving their health with lower costs. During 2014, all Partnership PPO members were required to complete the Healthways Well-Being Assessment (online health questionnaire), complete a biometric screening and keep their contact information current with their employer. Tobacco users were asked to enroll in a tobacco cessation program and the plan required members to participate in coaching and/or case management, if an opportunity to improve their health was identified by the wellness vendor. Because health costs and premium increases are linked to overall plan member health, the Partnership PPO provides a financial incentive for members to exercise responsibility for their own health and well-being. A total of 202,847 or 72 percent of members were enrolled in the Partnership PPO, 67,055 or 24 percent were enrolled in the Standard PPO and 10,760 or 4 percent in the Limited PPO.

Partnership PPO members have been proactive about receiving regular screenings to detect and prevent chronic disease. For plan year 2014, Partnership members' screening rates met or exceeded rates observed in the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) for breast cancer, cervical cancer and diabetes HbA1c. The screening rate for colon cancer was slightly below the HEDIS rate but has improved over 2011. HEDIS results are gathered from health plans nationally and are widely accepted benchmarks. partnership Standard limited HedIS (2014)2 0 14 A n n u Al R e p o Rt 7p Ro gR Am An d S t AtI StIcAl I n f o RmAtIo n Partnershi P PPO Utilization Trends All Options Partnership Standard Limited active and r etiree <65 including Dependents 2010 2014 % chg 2014 % chg 2014 % chg Admissions per 1000 70 59 - 16.1% 69 - 1.4% 47 - 32% Outpatient Facility Visits Per 1000 1,761 1,362 - 22.7% 1,371 - 22.1% 544 - 1.4% 376 - 32% ER Visits per 1000 243 209 - 14.1% 277 13.8% 233 - 4% Patients per 1000 Complications 13 12 - 11.3% 13 2.0% 9 - 32% Readmissions per 1000 5 3 - 37.5% 4 - 11.1% 3 - 40% Source: TruvenIn addition to the Partnership PPO's higher screening rates, there are fewer Partnership PPO patients per 1000 with diagnoses of coronary artery disease, hypertension or osteoarthritis than in the Standard PPO. When combined, members in all healthcare options experienced a drop in the rates of chronic disease from 2010 to 2014. From 2010 to 2014, diagnosis rates of heart disease, depres - sion, hypertension and osteoarthritis declined across all three healthcare options.Members in the Partnership PPO experienced healthcare utiliza - tion rates lower than those experienced by the public sector plans in 2014 across all indicators, with the exception of physician office visits and a negligible increase in pharmacy. The office visit increase, however, signals a more appropriate use of primary and preventive care, which helps with early disease detection. As the Partnership PPO is in its fourth year, these early indicators are encouraging signs that the integrated wellness program is having a positive impact on healthcare utilization.Patients Per 1000 Select Chronic Disease Categories Source: Truvenpartnership Standard limitedDecline in Rates Per 1000 Select Chronic Disease Categories Source: Truven2010 plan Year 2014 plan Year\u0018 2 0 14 A n n u Al R e p o RtPayments by Service Category Source: TruvencOmBined PLans Per Medical Claims Source: Cost Claims Source: Truvenmember planEnrollment Demographics Source: Truvenmale female The largest age group was persons between the ages of 50 and 59 \u2014 54,715 persons or 19.5 percent.

Funds were appropriated to pay part of the premiums for participating employees beginning January 1, 1986. School systems within the state may join the local education plan or must provide alter - native coverage that is equal or superior to the state-sponsored program. At 2014 year end, 133 school systems and educational co-ops were participating in the local education plan. Plan enroll - ment was 55,398 \u2014 a decrease from 57,272 in 2013. Dental insurance is available as an option to participants in the local education plan, if offered by their agency. Participa - tion in dental coverage decreased by almost 1 percent. Vision insurance is also available to local education plan members, if their agency chose to participate. A total of 9,554 individuals enrolled in coverage. There were 369 individuals enrolled in optional long-term care coverage. Total premium payments were $427,000 and paid claims were nearly $42,000.

The program involves two elements: the sponsorship of Medicare supplement coverage and the provision of financial support for participating retirees. The division offers a single Medicare supplement plan (The Tennessee Plan) that complies with standard plan requirements established by the National Association of Insurance Commis - sions (NAIC). The Tennessee Plan matches the NAIC level D benefits.The state's financial support is based on a retiree's length of service. Retired teachers and state employees received $50 per month for 30 or more years of service; $37.50 for 20 to 29 years of service and $25 per month for 15 to 19 years of service. This support is provided to Medicare supplement participants and to retired teachers in school districts which sponsor employee medical plans and permit Medicare-eligible retirees to continue coverage during retirement. The Tennessee Plan ended the year with 34,307 members. The Tennessee Plan is self-insured, meaning that the state, rather than an insurance company, is financially responsible for paying the plan's expenses. Claims are administered by the POMCO Group. POMCO's customer service center received more than 12,000 calls in 2014. The customized web portal provides members access to claim information, copies of explanation of benefits forms and direct links to other helpful sites.Enrollment by Years of Service Source: State of Tennessee20-2\u0018 21%1\u0018-1\u0018 \u0018%<1\u0018 & dependents \u00181% \u00180+ 42%2 0 14 A n n u Al R e p o Rt 2\u0018p Ro gR Am An d S t AtI StIcAl I n f o RmAtIo n Partners fOr heaLth weLLness PrOGram The ParTNers for Health Wellness Program is available at no cost to all state group insurance program members, eligible spouses and dependents age 18 and over.

Members enrolled in the Partnership PPO are required to complete certain wellness activities as part of the partnership promise. Wellness participation is an optional benefit for Standard and Limited PPO members. In 2014, 93 percent of Partnership PPO members completed the Healthways well-being assessment (online health ques - tionnaire) taking the first step toward improved well-being. Each year, Healthways summarizes members' well-being assessment results in aggregate form to help determine the key drivers of our population's health. Here are some of the 2014 findings: 25 percent of plan members have three or more health risks (e.g., body mass index 30 or greater, tobacco user, no exercise, stress, unhealthy eating, high cholesterol, high blood pressure) More than 40 percent of active plan members and pre-65 retiree plan members have a body mass index classified as 30 or greater, which is considered obese 72 percent said they want to lose weight 77 percent want to focus on eating more fruits and vege - tables 51 percent want to work on coping better with stress 6 percent self-reported they are smokers \u2014 other national data sources indicate the smoking rate in Tennessee is 24 percent, suggesting that our membership smoking rate is underreported 47 percent of members feel that personal problems or finan - cial stress interfere with their ability to concentrate at work Some of our most prevalent self-reported conditions are: migraines, acid reflux/heartburn, chronic back pain, depres - sion, diabetes, asthma and high cholesterol Only 55 percent get the recommended exercise of 30 minutes or more, 3 days a week A total of 58,220 plan members participated in a health coaching program. Coaches give members one-on-one support and encouragement over the phone. They help members create a custom plan to address their health needs, reach their goals, better understand their health conditions and learn to manage their overall health and well-being. Members have reported a variety of health coaching success stories. \"Working with health coaches to make changes in my lifestyle helped me to get off blood pressure medication.\" \u2014\"Jane\" lost 10 pounds and has been able to come off her blood pressure medication \"I'm very glad that the call came when it did since I have been tobacco free for almost one month.

I only eat grilled or baked chicken and grilled or baked seafood. I also only eat healthy fruits and vegetables every day. I also no longer drink soft drinks and only drink water. The other extremely healthy activity I have taken on is exercising on a daily basis.\" \u2014\"Karen\" took part in challenges to maintain her steps (increased walking to 5 times a week and increased exercise) Wellness challenges To support and encourage healthy behaviors, members can participate in online wellness challenges. Challenges create friendly competition among co-workers while boosting morale and teamwork. More than 5,000 people participated in one of the four quarterly challenges: True Colors (focused on healthy eating), Step It Up (focused on physical activity), Make the Cut (focused on weight lost) or Go For 10 (focused on physical activity). Each challenge included a chatter board where participants could offer support and encouragement to one another as well as share tips and ideas. Many used the chatter board to share successes and post comments about their experiences. \"I THOROUGHLY enjoyed the colors challenge. No counting or worrying\u2014just eat lots of different colors.\" \u2014\"Anne,\" March 2014, True Colors \"This was my first time to participate and it was awesome!

The rows of the table are defined as follows: (1) This line shows the total of each fiscal year's earned contribution revenues and investment revenues. (2) This line shows each fiscal year's other operating costs of the fund including overhead and claims expense not allocable to individual claims. (3) This line shows the fund's incurred claims and allocated claim adjust - ment expenses (both paid and accrued) as originally reported at the end of the first year in which the event that triggered coverage under the contract occurred (called policy year); some of these amounts are unavailable. (4) This section shows the cumulative net amounts paid as of the end of successive years for each policy year; some of these amounts are unavailable. (5) This section shows how each policy year's incurred claims increased or decreased as of the end of successive years; some of Supplementary Information \u2014 Active Employees Ten-Year Claims Development Informationthese amounts are unavailable. This annual reestimation results from new information received on known claims, reevaluation of existing information on known claims, as well as emergence of new claims not previously known. (6) This line compares the latest reestimated net incurred claims amount to the amount originally established (line 3) and shows whether this latest estimate of claims cost is greater or less than originally thought. As data for individual policy years mature, the correlation between original estimates and reestimated amounts is commonly used to evaluate the accuracy of net incurred claims currently recog - nized in less mature policy years. The columns of the table show data for successive fiscal and policy years. Beginning with fiscal year 2007, the plan is reported in accordance with the Governmental Accounting Standards Board's Statement No. 43. Therefore, for accounting and financial reporting purposes, the table below only includes active employees of the local education plan; retirees of the plan are no longer included in the 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 column disclosures below.LOcaL educati On PLanf InAn cI Al S t At e m e n t S2 0 14 A n n u Al R e p o Rt \u00181Statements of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Fund Net Position \u00180-jun-14 \u00180-jun-1\u0018 operating revenues Premiums $ 108,811 $ 105,972 total operating revenues $ 108,811 $ 105,972 operating expenses Medical and mental health claims $ 94,246 $ 90,221 Administrative services 729 1,269 Contractual services 5,916 4,866 total operating expenses $ 100,891 $ 96,356 Operating income (loss) $ 7,920 $ 9,616 non-operating revenues Interest income $ 23 $ 1 total non-operating revenues $ 23 $ 1 Change in net position $ 7,943 $ 9,617 Net position, July 1 21,323 11,706 net position, June 30 $ 29,266 $ 21,323Statements of Net Position \u00180-jun-14 \u00180-jun-1\u0018 assets Cash $ 34,794 $ 27,630 Accounts receivable, net 709 803 total assets $ 35,503 $ 28,433 Liabilities Accounts payable and accruals $ 6,220 $ 7,076 Unearned revenue 17 34 total liabilities $ 6,237 $ 7,110 net position Unrestricted $ 29,266 $ 21,323 total net position $ 29,266 $ 21,323LOcaL GOvernment PLanf InAn cI Al S t At e m e n t S\u00182 2 0 14 A n n u Al R e p o RtStatements of Cash Flows \u00180-jun-14 \u00180-jun-1\u0018 cash flows from operating activities Receipts from fund members $ 110,733 $ 107,347 Payments to insurance companies and healthcare providers (102,923) (96,554) Payments for state services (669) (1,269) net cash from operating activities $ 7,141 $ 9,524 cash flows from investing activities Interest received $ 23 $ 1 net cash from investing activities $ 23 $ 1 net increase in cash $ 7,164 $ 9,525 Cash, July 1 27,630 18,105 cash, June 30 $ 34,794 $ 27,630 reconciliation of operating income to net cash from operating activities Operating income (loss) $ 7,920 $ 9,616 Adjustments to reconcile operating income to net cash from operating activities Changes in assets and liabilities: Change in accounts receivable $ 94 $ (188) Change in accounts payable (856) 126 Change in unearned revenue (17) (30) net cash from operating activities $ 7,141 $ 9,524LOcaL GOvernment PLanf InAn cI Al S t At e m e n t S2 0 14 A n n u Al R e p o Rt \u0018 \u0018Supplementary Information \u2014 Active Employees 200\u0018 200\u0018 2007 200\u0018 200\u0018 2010 2011 2012 201\u0018 2014 (1) Required contribution and investment revenue earned 6,010 6,135 6,645 (3) Estimated claims and expenses, Six years * Seven years later 90,514 86,974 * Eight years later 90,514 * Nine years later * (5) Reestimated net incurred claims and expenses: End Six years * Seven years later 90,514 86,974 * Eight years later 90,514 * Nine years later * (6) Increase (decrease) in estimated net incurred claims and expenses from end of policy year (45) (84) 1,972 338 142 (386) (141) (490) 0 * * Data not availableThe table below illustrates how the local government group insur - ance fund's earned revenues and investment income compare to related costs of loss and other expenses assumed by the local government group insurance fund as of the end of each of the last ten years.
