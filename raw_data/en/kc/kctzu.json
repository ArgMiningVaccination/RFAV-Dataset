In The State of the World's Children 1998, UNICEF the only United Nations agencydedicated exclusively to children spells out a simple but most pressing truth. Sound nutritioncan change children's lives, improve their physical and mental development, protect their healthand lay a firm foundation for future productivity. Over 200 million children in developing countries under the age of five are malnourished.For them, and for the world at large, this message is especially urgent. Malnutrition contributes tomore than half of the nearly 12 million under-five deaths in developing countries each year.Malnourished children often suffer the loss of precious mental capacities. They fall ill more often.If they survive, they may grow up with lasting mental or physical disabilities. This human suffering and waste happen because of illness much of it preventable: becausebreastfeeding is stopped too early; because children's nutritional needs are not sufficiently under-stood; because long-entrenched prejudices imprison women and children in poverty. The world knows what is needed to end malnutrition. With a strong foundation of cooperationbetween local communities, non-governmental organizations, governments and internationalagencies, the futureand the lives of our children can take the shape we want and they deserve,of healthy growth and development, greater productivity, social equity and peace.

II The silent emergency /t is implicated in more than half ofall child deaths worldwide aproportion unmatched by any in-fectious disease since the Black Death.Yet it is not an infectious disease.Its ravages extend to the millionsof survivors who are left crippled,chronically vulnerable to illnessand intellectually disabled.It imperils women, families and,ultimately, the viability of whole soci-eties. It undermines the struggle of theUnited Nations for peace, equity andjustice. It is an egregious violation ofchild rights that undermines virtuallyevery aspect of UNICEF's work forthe survival, protection and full devel-opment of the world's children.Yet the worldwide crisis of malnu-trition has stirred little public alarm,despite substantial and growing scien-tific evidence of the danger. More at-tention is lavished on the gyrations ofworld stock markets than on malnutri-tion's vast destructive potential oron the equally powerful benefits ofsound nutrition, including mountingevidence that improved nutrition,such as an adequate intake of vitaminA and iodine, can bring profound ben-efits to entire populations.Malnutrition is a silent emergency.But the crisis is real, and its persis- Photo: Improved nutrition brings profoundbenefits. A Bolivian girl holds a piece of bread.tence has profound and frighteningimplications for children, society andthe future of humankind.Malnutrition is not, as many think,a simple matter of whether a child cansatisfy her appetite. A child who eatsenough to satisfy immediate hungercan still be malnourished.And malnutrition is not just a silentemergencyit is largely an invisibleone as well. Three quarters of the chil-dren who die worldwide of causesrelated to malnutrition are what nutri-tionists describe as mildly to moderatelymalnourished and betray no outwardsigns of problems to a casual observer.Malnutrition's global toll is alsonot mainly a consequence of famines,wars and other catastrophes, as iswidely thought; in fact, such eventsare responsible for only a tiny part ofthe worldwide malnutrition crisis. Butsuch emergencies, like the ongoingcrises in the Great Lakes region ofCentral Africa and in the DemocraticPeople's Republic of Korea, oftenresult in the severest forms of malnu-trition. Meeting food needs in thesesituations is essential, but so is protect-ing people from illness and ensuringthat young children and other vulner-able groups receive good care.Child malnutrition is not confinedto the developing world. In someindustrialized countries, widening in-come disparities, coupled with reduc-1More attention is lavished onthe gyrations of world stockmarkets than on malnutrition'svast destructive potentialor on the equally powerfulbenefits of sound nutrition. 9 Reducing malnutrition should he an urgentglobal priority; inaction is a scandalousaffront to the human right to survival.A malnourished child with his motherin Afghanistan. 10tions in social protection, are havingworrying effects on the nutritionalwell-being of children.Whatever the misconceptions, thedimensions of the malnutrition crisisare clear. It is a crisis, first and fore-most, about death and disability of chil-dren on a vast scale, about women whobecome maternal mortality statisticspartly because of nutritional deficien-cies and about social and economiccosts that strangle development andsnuff out hope.Malnutrition has long been recog-nized as a consequence of poverty. Itis increasingly clear that it is also a cause.In some parts of the world, notablyLatin America and East Asia, therehave been dramatic gains in reducingchild malnutrition. But overall, theabsolute number of malnourished chil-dren worldwide has grown.Half of South Asia's children are mal-nourished. In Africa, one of every threechildren is underweight, and in sev-eral countries of the continent, the nu-tritional status of children is worsening.Malnourished children are muchmore likely to die as a result of a com-mon childhood disease than thosewho are adequately nourished. Andresearch indicates a link between mal-nutrition in early lifeincluding theperiod of foetal growthand the de-velopment later in life of chronic con-ditions like coronary heart disease,diabetes and high blood pressure, giv-ing the countries in which malnutri-tion is already a major problem newcause for concern.The most critically vulnerablegroups are developing foetuses, chil-dren up to the age of three and womenbefore and during pregnancy andwhile they are breastfeeding. Amongchildren, malnutrition is especiallyprone to strike those who lack nutri-tionally adequate diets, are not pro-tected from frequent illness and donot receive adequate care.12Illness is frequently a consequenceof malnutritionand malnutrition isalso commonly the result of illness.Malaria, a major cause of child deathsin large parts of the world, also takesa major toll on child growth and de-velopment. In parts of Africa wheremalaria is common, about one third ofchild malnutrition is caused by malaria.The disease also has dangerous nutri-tional consequences for pregnantwomen. In addition, pregnant womenare more susceptible to malaria, andchildren born to mothers with malariarun a greater chance of being bornunderweight and anaemic.There is no one kind of malnutri-tion. It can take a variety of forms thatoften appear in combination and con-tribute to each other, such as protein-energy malnutrition, iodine deficiencydisorders and deficiencies of iron andvitamin A, to name just a few.Many involve deficiencies of `rni-cronutrients'substances like vita-min A and iodine that the human bodycannot make itself but that are needed,often in only tiny amounts, to orches-trate a whole range of essential physi-ological functions.Each type of malnutrition is the re-sult of a complex interplay of factorsinvolving such diverse elements ashousehold access to food, child andmaternal care, safe water and sanitationand access to basic health services.And each wreaks its own particu-lar kind of havoc on the human body.Iodine deficiency can damage in-tellectual capacity; anaemia is a kill 585,000 womenannually; folate deficiency in expec-tant mothers can cause birth defects ininfants, such as spina bifida; and vita-min D deficiency can lead to poorbone formation, including rickets.Vitamin A deficiency, which af-fects about 100 million young chil-dren worldwide, was long known to cause blindness. But it has become in-creasingly clear that even mild vita-min A deficiency also impairs theimmune system, reducing children'sresistance to diarrhoea, which kills2.2 million children a year, andmeasles, which kills nearly 1 millionannually. And new findings stronglysuggest that vitamin A deficiency is acause of maternal mortality as well,especially among women in impover-ished regions (Panel 1).At its most basic level, malnutri-tion is a consequence of disease andinadequate dietary intake, which usu-ally occur in a debilitating and oftenlethal combination. But many moreelementssocial, political, economic,culturalare involved beyond thephysiological.Discrimination and violence againstwomen are major causes of malnutrition.Women are the principal providersof nourishment during the most cru-cial periods of children's develop-ment, but the caring practices vital tochildren's nutritional well-being in-variably suffer when the division oflabour and resources in families andcommunities favours men, and whenwomen and girls face discriminationin education and employment.A lack of access to good educationand correct information is also a causeof malnutrition. Without informationstrategies and better and more acces-sible education programmes, the aware-ness, skills and behaviours neededto combat malnutrition cannot bedeveloped.There is, in short, nothing simpleabout malnutritionexcept perhapsthe fact of how vast a toll it is taking.Of the nearly 12 million childrenunder five who die each year in de-veloping countries mainly from pre-ventable causes, the deaths of over6 million, or 55 per cent, are eitherdirectly or indirectly attributable tomalnutrition (Fig. 1).Some 2.2 million children die fromdiarrhoeal dehydration as a result ofpersistent diarrhoea that is often ag-gravated by malnutrition.And anaemia has been identifiedas a contributing factor, if not a prin-cipal cause, in 20 per cent to 23 percent of allpost-partum maternaldeaths in Africa and Asia: an estimatemany experts regard as conservative.If there were no other conse-quences of malnutrition, these horrificstatistics would be more than enoughto make its reduction an urgent globalpriorityand inaction a scandalousaffront to the human right to survival.But the issue goes beyond childsurvival and maternal mortality andmorbidity. Malnourished children,unlike their well-nourished peers, notonly have lifetime disabilities andweakened immune systems, but theyalso lack the capacity for learning thattheir well-nourished peers have.In young children, malnutritiondulls motivation and curiosity and re-duces play and exploratory activities.These effects, in turn, impair mentaland cognitive development by reduc-ing the amount of interaction childrenhave both with their environment, andwith those who provide care.Malnutrition in an expectant mother,especially iodine deficiency, can pro-duce varying degrees of mental retar-dation in her infant.In infancy and early childhood,iron deficiency anaemia can delaypsychomotor development and impaircognitive development, lowering IQby about 9 points.Anaemic pre-schoolers have beenfound to have difficulty in maintainingattention and discriminating betweenvisual stimuli. Poor school achieve-ment among primary school and ado-lescent children has also been linkedto iron deficiency.'Low-birthweight babies have IQsthat average 5 points below those of 013Fig. 1Malnutrition and childmortality If a child is even mildly underweight, the mortalityrisk is increased.

I I Panel 1Vitamin A supplements savepregnant women's lives Each year, nearly 600,000 womendie worldwide from pregnancy-related causes. Prenatal vitaminA supplements will help reduce thismassive toll, according to prelimi-nary results from a major new study.By measuring the impact of lowweekly doses of the vitamin on thehealth and survivalof pregnantwomen in southern Nepal, the studyfound that deaths among women re-ceiving either low-dose vitamin A orbeta-carotene supplements droppeddramatically, by an average 44 per cent.Like many parts of the developingworld, Nepal has a notoriously highmaternal mortality rate125 timesthat of the United Statesand vita-min A deficiency is common, par-ticularly among pregnant women.Night-blindness, long ignored by themedical establishment and viewedby women as a routine consequenceof pregnancy, but in reality a worry-ing sign of vitamin A deficiency, de- 12velops in 10 to 20 per cent of preg-nant women.Researchers from Johns HopkinsUniversity in the United States andthe National Society for Eye Healthand Blindness Prevention in Nepal,supported by the United StatesAgency for International Develop-ment (USAID) and Task Force Sightand Life, based in Switzerland, con-ducted the study to see whethermaternal, foetal or infant mortalitycould be lowered by providing wo-men of childbearing age one low-dose vitamin A capsule each week.Night-blindness and anaemia in wo-men in the study and birth defectsin their infants were also carefullyinvestigated.Approximately 44,000 young mar-ried women, nearly half of whom be-came pregnant during the study,were given either vitamin A supple-ments' or placebos. The supplementswere in the form of either pure vita-14min A or beta-carotene, the vitaminA-active ingredient found in fruitsand vegetables that the body con-verts to vitamin A.Among the women receiving purevitamin A there were 38 per centfewer deaths and among those re-ceiving beta-carotene there were 50per cent fewer deaths, during preg-nancy and the three months follow-ing childbirth, than among womenreceiving no supplements.b Anaemia,which is usually associated with irondeficiency and which is known to bea contributing cause of maternaldeaths, was a surprising 45 per centlower in the women receiving sup-plements who were not infected withhookworm.Women suffering from night-blindness (an inability to see at duskor in dim light) were found to bemore likely to get infections, to beanaemic and underweight and tobe at greater risk of death. Night-blindness was reduced by 38 percent and 16 per cent, respectively, inthe vitamin A and beta-carotenegroups, leaving questions about themost appropriate mix of nutrients,and the amounts needed, to preventthe condition. No reduction in foetalorinfantmortality throughsixmonths of age was apparent in chil-dren born to women in the study.The scientists have not yet com-pleted analysing the effects of sup-plements on the different causes ofmaternal deaths. However, deathsfrom infection are one importantcause of high maternal mortalityrates, and vitamin A is known to beessential for the effective functioningof the immune system that reducesthe severity of infection.The results of this study indicatethat where vitamin A deficiency iscommon, the regular and adequate intake of vitamin A' or beta-carotene by women during theirreproductive years can markedlyreduce their risk of pregnancy-related mortality. Adequate intakeof vitamin A may also dramaticallyreduce anaemia in pregnant wo-men if combined with deworming.This study helps highlight theurgent need to improve the nutri-tion of girls and women as part ofa multi-pronged approach to re-duce the tragedy of maternal mor-tality in the developing world andopens the way to new preventionstrategies that can be widely im-plemented in the near future. NOTESa. The low-dose supplements contained7,000 Ng of retinol equivalents A, or a similaramount of beta-carotene, which isapproximately equivalent to a woman'sweekly requirement.b. Deaths were reduced from 713 per100,000 pregnancies in the group ofwomen not receiving supplements to 443and 354 deaths per 100,000 respectivelyin women receiving the weekly vitaminA and beta-carotene supplements.c. Although found in many foods,vitamin A has powerful biological effectsand care is essential to prevent themisuse of supplements, especially bypregnant women. High-dose (200,000 IU)vitamin A supplements of the typeroutinely provided at four to six monthlyintervals to young children in developingcountries should never be taken bywomen of childbearing age because ofthe risk of possible harm to a developingfoetus. High-dose supplements may,however, be safely given to womenwithin eight weeks following childbirth.Low-dose weekly vitamin A supple-ments, like those given in this study,and even lower-dose daily supplementscan be taken by women during theirreproductive years with little risk tomother or foetus and with considerablebenefit wherever deficiency is likely.

Andchildren whowere not that lower than breastfed children.The depletion of human intelli-gence on such a scalefor reasonsthat are almost entirely preventableis a profligate, even criminal, waste.Robbed of their mental as well asphysical potential, malnourished chil-dren who live past childhood facediminished futures. They will becomeadults with lower physical and intel-lectual abilities, lower levels of pro-ductivity and higher levels of chronicillness and disability, often in soci-eties with little economic capacity foreven minimal therapeutic and rehabil-itative measures.At the family level, the increasedcosts and pressures that malnutrition-linked disability and illness place onthose who care for them can be devas-tating to poor familiesespecially tomothers, who receive little or no helpfrom strained social services in devel-oping countries.And when the losses that occur inthe microcosm of the family are re-peated millions of times at the societallevel, the drain on global developmentis staggering.In 1990 alone, the worldwide lossof social productivity caused by fouroverlapping types of malnutrition nu-tritional stunting and wasting, iodinedeficiency disorders and deficienciesof iron and vitamin Aamounted toalmost 46 million years of productive,disability-free life, according to onereckoning.'Vitamin and mineral deficienciesare estimated to cost some countriesthe equivalent of more than 5 per centof their gross national product in lostlives, disability and productivity. Bythis calculation, Bangladesh and Indiaforfeited a total of $18 billion in 1995.4Malnourished children's low resis-tance to illness diminishes the effec-tiveness of the considerable resourcesVitamin and mineraldeficiencies are estimatedto cost some countries theequivalent of more than5 per cent of their grossnational product in lost lives,disability and productivity. 13 Panel 2What is malnutrition? Malnutrition is usually the re-sult of a combination of in-adequate dietary intake andinfection (Fig. 6). In children, malnu-trition is synonymous with growthfailuremalnourished children areshorter and lighter than they shouldbe for their age. To get a measure ofmalnutrition in a population, youngchildren can be weighed and mea-sured and the results compared tothose of a 'reference population'known to have grown well. Meas-uring weight and height is the mostcommon way of assessing malnutri-tion in populations.Although many people still referto growth failure as 'protein-energymalnutrition,' or PEM, it is now rec-ognized that poor growth in childrenresults not only from a deficiency ofprotein and energy but also from aninadequate intake of vital minerals(such as iron, zinc and iodine) and vi-tamins (such as vitamin A), and oftenessential fatty acids as well. Theseminerals are needed in tiny quantities,on the order of a few thousandths ofa gram or less each day. They are con- 14a'a sequently called micronutrients. Mi-cronutrients are needed for the pro-duction of enzymes, hormones andother substances that are required toregulate biological processes leadingto growth, activity, development andthe functioning of the immune andreproductive systems.All of the minerals that the bodyneeds calcium, phosphorous, iron,zinc, iodine, sodium, potassium andmagnesium, for examplehave tocome either from the food we eat orfrom supplements. While the bodymanufactures many of the complexorganic molecules it needs from sim-pler building blocks, the vitaminsA, the B complex, C and so on arenot synthesized. Vitamin D is excep-tional in that it can be made in theskin, providing a person has sufficientexposure to direct sunlight.While micronutrients are neededat all ages, the effects of inadequateintake are particularly serious duringperiods of rapid growth, pregnancy,early childhood and lactation. We arelearning more every day about theimportance of micronutrients for the16physical and the cognitive develop-ment of children.While widespread moderate mal-nutrition may not be obvious unlesschildren are weighed and measured,some severely malnourished chil-dren develop clinical signs that areeasily observedsevere wasting (ormarasmus) and the syndrome knownas kwashiorkor, with skin and hairchanges and swelling of arms andlegs. Despite years of research, thereasons why some children developkwashiorkor and why others developmarasmus remains a mystery. Whatis clear is that left untreated, childrenwith either condition are at high riskof dying from severe malnutrition,and that both kwashiorkor and mares-mus can be prevented by ensuringan adequate intake of nutritious foodand freedom from repeated infec-tions. Less severe forms of malnutri-tion also cause death, mostly becausethey weaken children's resistance toillness (Fig. 1).The1990 World Summit forChildren out deficiencies ofthree micronutrientsiron, iodine,and vitamin Aas being particularlycommon and of special concern forchildren and women in developingcountries. Recently, knowledge of theprevalence and importance of zinc forchild growth and development hasplaced it in that league as well. VitaminD deficiency is now recognized as amajor problem of children in countriessuch as Mongolia, the northern partsof China and some of the countries ofthe Commonwealth of IndependentStates that have long winters.Throughout this report, the termmalnutrition is used to refer to the con-sequences of the combination of aninadequate intake of protein energy,micronutrients and frequent infections.

And investments inbasic education by governments andtheir partners are compromised bymalnutrition's pernicious effects onbrain development and intellectualperformance.Iodine deficiency and iron defi-ciency anemia, which threaten mil-lions of children, are especially worri-some factors as countries strive toimprove their educational systems.Iron-deficient children under theage of two years show problems withcoordination and balance and appearmore withdrawn and hesitant. Suchfactors can hinder a child's ability tointeract with and learn from the envi-ronment and may lead to lower intel-lectual abilities.'Severe iodine deficiency in uterocan cause the profound mental retar-dation of cretinism. But milder defi-ciencies also take an intellectual toll.In the republic of Georgia, for in-stance, a widespread iodine defi-ciency, recently detected, is estimatedto have robbed the country of 500,000IQ points in the 50,000 babies born in1996 alone.6Many children suffer from multi-ple types of malnutrition, so numberstend to overlap. But it is reliably esti-mated that globally 226 million chil-dren are stuntedshorter than theyshould be for their age, and shorterthan could be accounted for by anygenetic variation (Panel 2). Stuntingis particularly dangerous for women,as stunted women are more likely toexperience obstructed labour and arethus at greater risk of dying while giv-ing birth. Stunting is associated with along-term reduction in dietary intake,most often closely related to repeatedepisodes of illness and poor-quality diets.A study in Guatemala found thatseverely stunted men had an averageof 1.8 fewer years of schooling thanthose who were non-stunted, whileseverely stunted women had, on aver-age, one year less. The differences areimportant since every additional yearof schooling translated into 6 per centmore in wages' (Panel 3).Some 67 million children are esti-mated to be wasted, which meansthey are below the weight they shouldbe for their heightthe result of re-duced dietary intake, illness, or both.About 183 million children weighless than they should for their age. Inone study, children who were severelyunderweight' were found to be two toeight times more likely to die withinthe following year as children of nor-mal weight for their age.'More than 2 billion people prin-cipally women and children areiron deficient,' and the World HealthOrganization (WHO) has estimatedthat 51 per cent of children under theage of four in developing countriesare anaemic.\"In most regions of the developingworld, malnutrition rates have beenfalling over the last two decades, butat markedly different paces (Fig. 2).The exception is sub-Saharan Africa,where malnutrition rates began in-creasing in most countries during theearly 1990s, following the regionaleconomic decline that began in thelate 1980s. As government budgetsshrank, basic social services andhealth services were hit particularlyhard. Per capita incomes also de-clined, affecting people's ability topurchase food.In the United States, researchersestimate that over 13 million childrenmore than one in every four under theage of 12have a difficult time get-ting all the food they need, a problemthat is often at its worst during the lastweek of the month when families'social benefits or wages run out.\"Over 20 per cent of children in theUnited States live in poverty, moreIron-deficient children underthe age of two years showproblems with coordinationand balance and appear morewithdrawn and hesitant. Suchfactors can hinder a child'sability to interact with andlearn from the environmentand may lead to lowerintellectual abilities. 15 Panel 3Stunting linked to impaired intellectual development Malnutrition early inlifeislinked to deficits in children'sintellectual development thatpersist in spite of schooling and im-pair their learning ability, accordingto a recent study in the Philippines.The study analysed stuntingwhich is low height for age and abasic indicator of malnutritionamong more than 2,000 children liv-ing in metropolitan Cebu, the Phil-ippines' second largest city. Nearlytwo thirds of the children studiedwere stunted. Those stunted earliestin life, before six months of age, werethe most severely stunted by agetwo, the study found. The same chil-dren scored significantly lower on in-telligence tests at 8 and 11 years of agethan children who were not stunted.The study holds profound impli-cations on a global level: 226 millionchildren under age five in developingcountries, nearly 40 per cent of thisage group, suffer from moderate orsevere stunting. \"High levels of stunt-ing among children suggest that therewill also be long-term deficits in men- The effects of stuntingIn a non-verbal intelligence test given to eight-year-olds in the Philippines, scores stronglycorrelated with children's level of stunting atage two.

At age two,these children were nearly 11 cen-timeters (5 inches) shorter than chil-dren who were not stunted. The IQscores of the severely stunted chil-dren at eight years of age were 11points lower than those of the chil-dren who were not stunted.When the children in the studywere tested again at age 11, thosewho had been most severely stuntedat age 2 still scored lower on the in-telligence test than children who hadnot been stunted, although the gapwas narrower at about 5 IQ points.Children who were severely stuntedNearly 40 per cent of all children under five inthe world are stunted due to malnutrition. Manyof them will also face challenges in school asa result. Here, a contrast in stature is apparentbetween two girls the same age in Bangladesh. also had significantly lower scores onlanguage and math achievement tests.Most of the children in the studywere from poor families, and theirdiets, and those of their mothers, werebelow the nutritional levels recom-mended by the Philippine Govern-ment. They came from densely pop-ulated, poor urban communities, fromnewly settled areas on the outskirts ofthe city and from rural communities.This study underscores the impor-tance and lasting impact of nutritionin the crucial months of infancy andbeginning before birth with soundmaternal nutrition. Infants denied astrong start in life face problems inmaking up the lost ground, and theimpact on their own developmentand that of their societies can be alasting one. than double the rate of most other in-dustrialized countries.'In the United Kingdom, childrenand adults in poor families face healthrisks linked to diet, according to a re-cent study that cited high rates ofanaemia in children and adults, andof premature and low-weight births,dental diseases, diabetes, obesity andhypertension.'In Central and Eastern Europe,economic dislocations accompanyingthe transition to market economiesand major cutbacks in state-run socialprogrammes are having a more pro-found effect on the most vulnerable.In the Russian Federation, theprevalence of stunting among chil-dren under two years of age increasedfrom 9 per cent in 1992 to 15 per centin 1994.'5 And in the Central Asian re-publics and Kazakstan, 60 per cent ofpregnant women and young childrenare now anaemic.The effects of malnutrition alsocross generations. The infants ofwomen who are themselves malnour-ished and underweight are likely to besmall at birth.Overall, 60 per cent of women ofchildbearing age in South Asiawhere half of all children are under-weightare themselves underweight.In South-East Asia, the proportion ofunderweight women is 45 per cent; itis 20 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa.The power of goodnutritionThe devastation of malnutrition ishard to overstate, but so is the coun-tervailing power of nutrition. Not onlyis good nutrition the key to the healthydevelopment of individuals, familiesand societies, but there is also grow-ing reason to believe that improvingthe nutrition of women and childrenwill contribute to overcoming some ofthe greatest health challenges facingthe world, including the burden ofchronic and degenerative disease, ma-ternal mortality, malaria and AIDS.The most obvious proof of thepower of good nutrition can be seen inthe taller, stronger, healthier childrenof many countries, separated by onlya generation from their shorter, lessrobust parents, and by the better dietsand more healthful, nurturing envi-ronments they enjoy.Strongerchildrengrowintostronger, more productive adults. Well-nourished girls grow into women whoface fewer risks during pregnancy andchildbearing, and whose children setout on firmer developmental paths,physically and mentally. And historyshows that societies that meet women'sand children's nutritional needs alsolift their capacities for greater socialand economic progress (Fig. 3).Approximately half of the eco-nomic growth achieved by the UnitedKingdom and a number of WesternEuropean countries between 1790 and1980, for example, has been attributedto better nutrition and improved healthand sanitation conditions, social in-vestments made as much as a century Even in countries or regions wherepoverty is entrenched, the health anddevelopment of children and womencan be greatly protected or improved(Fig 4). In parts of Brazil, for example,the percentage of underweight childrenplummeted from 17 per cent in 1973 tojust under 6 per cent in 1996, at a timewhen poverty rates almost doubled.Much has already been achieved.For example, 12 million children everyyear are being spared irreversiblemental impairment from iodine defi-ciency because of iodized salt. Andmore than 60 per cent of young chil-dren around the world are receivingvitamin A supplements.Some effects of even severe malnu-trition on a child's mental developmentApproximately half of theeconomic growth achieved bythe United Kingdom and anumber of Western Europeancountries between 1790 and1980, for example, has beenattributed to better nutritionand improved health andsanitation conditions, socialinvestments made as muchas a century earlier. 17 Fig. 2 Trends in child malnutrition, by region The chart shows trends in malnutrition in 41 countries, in four regions, coveringover half of children under five years old in the developing world.

Rates have been adjusted for age; data for some countries reflectrates for Latin America and the Caribbean1995Peru can be at least partially reversed. Theintelligence of severely malnourishedchildrenwas foundtoimprovemarkedly, for example, when healthcare, adequate food and stimulationwere provided continually.'And there is increasing evidencethat good nutrition helps the body re-sist infection; that when infection oc-curs, nutrition relieves its severity andseriousness; and that it speeds recovery.Thirty years ago, most peoplecould readily accept the notion that a`good diet' was beneficial to overallhealth. But the idea that specific nutri-ents could help fend evenmore outlandishly, help of 'fringe science'.Today, clinical trials andstudies, the fringe is edging closer tothe mainstream, as nutrition scientists aswell as immunologists, paediatriciansand gerontologists test the implica-tions for public policy of large-scaleinterventions to improve nutrition andits effects on an array of critical phys-iological processes.Malnutrition, reflected in the poorgrowth of children and adolescents andthe high prevalence of low-birthweightbabies, already has well-known ef-fects on a child's capacity to resist ill-ness. It is thus reasonable to arguethat in the global fight to reduce child-hood death and illness, initiatives toimprove nutrition may be as powerfuland important as, for example, immu-nization programmes.There are now numerous scientificstudies that suggest, but do not yetprove, that vitamin A deficiency in amother infected with the human im-munodeficiency virus (HIV) may in-crease her risk of transmitting thevirus to her infant.Early in the next millennium, it isthought that between 4 million and 5million children will be infected withHIV. The majority, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, will acquire the infec-tion directly from their mothers.Although it will take another year ortwo to be absolutely sure, improvingthe vitamin A status of populationswhere both HIV infection and vitaminA deficiency are common may makesome contribution to reducing thetransmission of the virus.The right to goodnutritionHowever far-reaching the benefits ofnutrition may be, ensuring good nutri-tion is a matter of international law,articulated in variously specific lan-guage in international declarationsand human rights instruments datingback to the adoption of the Declara- Fig. 3 From good nutrition to greater productivity and beyond Good early nutrition is most likely to result where there is economic growth, especially equitable growth; whensocial services become affordable and accessible; and when adequate investment is made in human resources,including the empowerment of women. Good nutrition, in turn, contributes to greater productivity and thus toeconomic growth.

Adoptedafter World War I by the League ofNations through the efforts of Britishchild rights pioneer Eglantyne Jebb,the Declaration marks the beginningof theinternationalchildrightsmovement and is also the first inter-national affirmation of the right tonutrition. The Declaration affirmsthat \"the child must be given themeans needed for its normal devel-opment, both materially and spiritu-ally\" and states that \"the hungrychild should be fed.\"1948: Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights. This human rightslandmark, adopted by the UnitedNations General Assembly, proclaimsin article 25 that \"everyone has theright to a standard of living adequatefor the health and well-being of him-self and of his family, including food,clothing, housing and medical careand necessary social services ....\"This article also affirms that \"mother-hood and childhood are entitled tospecial care and assistance.\"1959: Declaration of the Rights ofthe Child. Adopted unanimously bythe United Nations General Assem-bly, the Declaration states in principle4 that children \"shall be entitled togrow and develop in health\" and thatchildren \"shall have the right to ade- 20quate nutrition, housing, recreationand medical services.\"1966: International Covenant onEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights.Adopted by the United Nations andratified by 137 States as of mid-September 1997, this Covenant wasthe first to spell out States' obliga-tions to respect people's economic,social and cultural rights. Article 11affirms the right of everyone to anadequate standard of living, includingadequate food, and the \"fundamen-tal right of everyone to be free fromhunger.\" The Covenant also man-dates States parties to take steps torealize this right, including measures\"to improve methods of production,conservation and distribution of food.\"1986: Declaration on the Right toDevelopment. Article 1 of the Dec-laration, which was adopted by theUnited Nations General Assembly,proclaims that the right to devel-opment \"is an inalienable humanright,\" with all people entitled to par-ticipate in and enjoy economic, so-cial, cultural and political develop-ment \"in which all human rights andfundamental freedoms can be fullyrealized.\" Article 8 calls for all Statesto ensure equal opportunity for all inaccess to health services and food.1989: Convention on the Rights ofthe Child. The most widely ratifiedhuman rights treaty, the Conventionestablishes as international law allrights to ensure children's survival,development and protection. Article24 mandates States parties to recog-nize children's right to the \"highestattainable standard of health\" and totake measures to implement thisright. Among key steps, States aremandated to provide medical assis- 22tance and health care to all children,with an emphasis on primary healthcare; combat disease and malnutri-tion, within the framework of pri-mary health care, through the pro-vision of adequate nutritious foods,and safe drinking water and ade-quate sanitation; and provide fami-lies with information about the ad-vantages of breastfeeding.Ratifications: 191 States as of mid-September 1997, with only two coun-triesSomalia andtheUnitedStatesyet to ratify.1990: World Declaration and Planof Action on the Survival, Protectionand Development of Children. Theunprecedented numbers of worldleaders attending the World Summitfor Children committed themselvesto \"give high priority to the rights ofchildren\"in the Summit's WorldDeclaration. The Summit's Plan ofAction set out the steps in 7 majorand 20 supporting goals for imple-menting the Declaration. Reducingsevere and moderate malnutrition byhalf of 1990 levels among under-fivechildren by the end of the century isthe main nutrition goal.The 7 supporting nutrition goalsare: reduction of low-weight births toless than 10 per cent of all births;reduction of iron deficiency anaemiain women by one third of 1990 levels;virtual elimination of iodine defici-ency disorders; virtual elimination ofvitamin A deficiency; empowermentof all women to exclusively breast-feed their children for about the firstsix months; institutionalization ofgrowth monitoring and promotion;and dissemination of knowledge services to increase foodproduction to ensure household foodsecurity. tion of the Rights of the Child in 1924(Panel 4).Under the 1979 Convention on theElimination of All Forms of Dis-crimination against Women, for ex-ample, States parties must ensure thatwomen receive full and equal accessto health care, including adequate nu-trition during pregnancy and lactation.And the 1990 World Summit forChildren, with a Plan of Action thatrecognized the devastating effects ofmalnutrition on women and their chil-dren, set specific nutritional goals forchildren and women, including accessto adequate food during pregnancyand lactation; the promotion, protec-tion and of breastfeeding practices; growthmonitoring with appropriate follow-upactions; and nutritional surveillance.But the right to nutrition receivesits fullest and most ringing expressionin the 1989 Convention on the Rightsof the Child, whose 191 ratificationsas of late 1997 make it the mostuniversally embraced human rightsinstrument in history.Under theConvention, whichcommits States parties to realize thefull spectrum of children's political,civil, social, economic and culturalrights, virtually every government inthe world recognizes the right of allchildren to the highest attainable stan-dard of health, to facilities for thetreatment of illness and for the reha-bilitation of healthspecifically in-cluding the right to good nutrition vital components: food, healthand care.Under the Convention's pre-eminentguiding principle, good child nutritionis a right because it is in the \"best in-terests of the child.\"Article 24 of the Convention spec-ifies that States parties must take \"ap-propriate measures\" to reduce infantand child mortality, and to combatdisease and malnutrition through theuse of readily available technologyand through the provision of adequate,nutritious foods and safe drinking water.The world is obligated to easechild malnutrition on the basis of in-ternational law, scientific knowledge,practical experience and basic morality.The ravages caused by malnutri-tion on individuals, families and soci-eties are preventable. The measuresneeded to reduce and end it are be-coming increasingly well understood.And the gains for humanity fromdoing soin essenceA child's and tissues, blood,brain and bones are formed, and intel-lectual and physical potential isshaped, during the period from concep-tion through age three.Since human development pro-ceeds particularly rapidly for the first18 months of life, the nutritional statusof pregnant and lactating mothers andyoung children is of paramount im-portance for a child's later physical,mental and social development. It is notan exaggeration to say that the evolu-tion of society as a whole hinges onthe nutrition of mothers and childrenduring this crucial period of their lives.The healthy newborn who devel-ops from a single cellroughly thesize of the period at the end of thissentencewill have some 2 billioncells and weigh an average of 3,250grams.'

By the timeof birth, a child will have 100 billion23Fig. 4 Poverty and malnutrition inLatin America and the Caribbean Malnutrition in Latin America decreased from anestimated 21% in 1970 to 7.2% in 1997, whilethe rate of poverty, measured by income level,fluctuated only slightly over the last threedecades, dropping from 45% in 1970 to 44% in1997. These trends show that the reduction ofmalnutrition is not solely dependent on increasesin income. In Latin America, the gains in reducingmalnutrition are attributed at the underlying levelto good care practices and access to basic healthservices, including family planning, andwater/sanitation services; and at the basic levelto women's empowerment in terms of theireducation and the cash resources they control. so 40Per cent of families withincome below poverty Trends, reasons and lessons', presentedto the Workshop on the Changing Conditions of the Child inLatin America and the Caribbean, University of Notre Dame,South Bend (USA), 26 September 1997, based on ACC/SCN,'Update of the Nutrition Situation 1996', Summary of resultsfor the Third Report on the World Nutrition Situation,ACC/SCN, Geneva, 1996,and ECLAC, Social Panorama ofLatin America 1996, Santiago (Chile), 1996. 21 Women need rest and protection fromoverwork during pregnancy. As long as theunequal division of labour so common aroundthe world persists, the caring practices vital tothe nutritional well-being of children willsuffer. In Niger, a pregnant woman carriesseveral large howls of sorghum. 22neurons, linked by synapses, the com-plex nerve junctions that begin form-ing in the 13th week of gestation.\"Proliferating most rapidly afterbirth, in large part because of thestimulation and care a child receives,millions upon millions of these junc-tions will be forged by the time ahealthy child reaches the age of twoand a half. Physical, mental andcognitive development depend onthese communication links betweenneurons. Without them, messageswould dead-end, muscles would notflex, and the complex processes ofthought and learning would not bepossible.Growth during the foetal stage de-pends on how well nourished awoman was before pregnancy, as wellas how much weight she gains whileshe is pregnant. Gains in weight areessential for the development of newmaternal and foetal tissues, and formaternal body maintenance and energy.Since the foetus relies entirely onthe mother for nutrients, pregnantwomen not only need to gain weightbut also must maintain an optimal in-take of essential nutrients such as ironand iodine.But fulfilling these interlockingfood, health and care needs can be astruggle for many women in the de-veloping world, where economic,social and cultural factors may be abarrier to good nutrition.Currently about 24 million low-birthweight babies are born everyyear, which is about 17 per cent of alllive births. Most are born in develop-ing countries, where the main causeof low birthweight is not prematurebirth, as itis in the industrializedworld, but poor foetal growth.Low-birthweight babies, definedas weighing less than 2.5 kilograms,are at greater risk of dying than infantsof average weight. If they survive,they will have more episodes of ill-24ness, their cognitive development maybe impaired, and they are also morelikely to become malnourished. Evi-dence is also mounting that low birth-weight predisposes children to a highrisk of diabetes, heart disease andother chronic conditions later in life.The measures that are essentialfor an expectant mothercare andrest, a reduced workload and a well-balanced diet that affords ample en-ergy, protein, vitamins, minerals andessential fatty acidsare equally im-portant when a woman is breastfeed-ing her child.Breastfeeding perfectly combinesthe three fundamentals of sound nutri-tionfood, health and careand isthe next critical window of nutritionalopportunity after pregnancy. Whilenot all children are breastfed, it re-mains an important protection forchildren (see also page 47).Because breastmilk contains allthe nutrients, antibodies, hormonesand antioxidants an infant needs tothrive, it plays a pivotal role in pro-moting the mental and physical devel-opment of children.Breastfed infants not only showbetter immune responses to immuni-zations, but their intake of breastmilkalso protects the mucous membranesthat line their gastrointestinal and res-piratory thus shielding themagainst diarrhoea and upper respira-tory tract infections.'In countries where infant mortalityrates are high or moderately high,a bottle-fed baby in a poor communityis 14 times more likely to die fromdiarrhoeal diseases and 4 times morelikely to die from pneumonia than ababy that is exclusively breastfed.\"Breastfeeding also has cognitivebenefits. In one study, breastfed sub-jects generally had IQs that wereabout 8 points higher than childrenwho had been bottle-fed, and higherachievement scores as well.\" Nutri- tionists theorize that the effect may bethe result of the growth-promotinglong-chain fatty acids of breastmilk.It may also be related to the fact thatbreastfed infants have fewer infectionsand, as healthier infants, they take agreater interest in their environmentand thus learn more than ill infants.However, for mothers infectedwith HIV, breastfeeding's enormousvalue as a bulwark against malnutri-tion, illness and death must be weighedagainst the 14 per cent risk that theymay transmit the virus to their infantsthrough breastmilkand the vastlygreater risk, especially in poor com-munities with inadequate water andsanitation, that feeding their childrenartificially will lead to infant deathsfrom diarrhoeal dehydration and res-piratory infections.During the second half of a child'sfirst year, synaptic growth in the pre-frontal cortex of the brain, the seat offorethought and logic, consumes twicethe amount of energy required by anadult brain. Much of this synapticgrowth is believed to result from thecaring stimulation that an infant andyoung child receivesthe nurturing,feeding and learning play in whichparents engage their children.After about six months, for opti-mal growth and development, a childneeds to be fed frequently with energy-rich, nutrient-dense foods. The failureto make such investments at the righttime can never be remedied later. Anadequate intake of micronutrients,especially iodine, iron, vitamin A andzinc, remains crucial. Spotlighting the causesAn understanding of the complex andsubtle causes of malnutrition is im-portant to appreciate the scale anddepth of the problem, the progressachieved to date and the possibilitiesfor further progress that exist.Malnutrition, clearly, is not a simpleproblem with a single, simple solu-tion. Multiple and interrelated deter-minants are involved in why malnutri-tion develops, and a similarly intricateseries of approaches, multifaceted andmultisectoral, are needed to deal withit (Fig. 5).Immediate causesThe interplay between the two mostsignificant immediate dietary in-take and illnesstends to create avicious circle: A malnourished child,whose resistance to illness is com-promised, falls ill, and malnourish-ment worsens. Children who enterthis malnutrition-infection cycle canquickly fall into a potentially fatalspiral as one condition feeds off theother (Fig. 6).Malnutrition lowers the body'sability to resist infection by under-mining the functioning of the mainimmune-response mechanisms. Thisleads to longer, more severe and morefrequent episodes of illness.Infections cause loss of appetite,malabsorption and metabolic and be-havioural changes. These, in turn, in-crease the body's requirements fornutrients, which further affects youngchildren's eating patterns and howthey are cared for (see also page 27).Underlying causesThree clusters of underlying causeslead to inadequate dietary intake andinfectious disease: inadequate accessto food in a household; insufficienthealth services an unhealthful en-vironment; and inadequate care forchildren and women.U Household food securityThis is defined as sustainable accessto safe food of sufficient quality andquantityincluding energy, proteinand micronutrientsto ensure ade-25A complex interplay of factors such ashousehold access to food, women's status,caring practices, disease and access to safewater, sanitation and basic health servicesaffect a child's nutrition.

The framework shows that causes ofmalnutrition are multisectoral, embracing food, health and caring practices. They are also classified as immediate (individual level), underlying (household or familylevel) and basic (societal level), whereby factors at one level influence other levels. The framework is used, at national, district and local levels, to help plan effectiveactions to improve nutrition. It serves as a guide in assessing and analysing the causes of the nutrition problem and helps in identifying the most appropriate mixtureof actions. firrUnn..IlWif,.f';tt4 -11111111..

For instance, there maybe abundant food available on themarket, but poor families that cannotafford it are not food secure.For the poor, therefore, householdfood security is often extremely pre-carious. Agricultural production varieswith the season and longer-term envi-ronmental conditions. Families sell-ing crops may find themselves paidfluctuating prices depending on a va-riety of factors beyond their control,while those who need to buy foodmay encounter exorbitant prices.Families living on the edge of sur-vival have few opportunities to buildup sufficient stocks of food, or to de-velop alternatives that would cushionthem in times of hardship. So whilepoor families may have adequate ac-cess to food for one month, what is es-sential is access that is consistent andsustainable.Women have a special role to playin maintaining household food secu-rity. In most societies, they are solelyresponsible for preparing, cooking,preserving and storing the family'sfoodand in many societies theyhave the primary responsibility ofproducing and purchasingit. ForFig. 6Inadequate dietary intake/disease cycle Inadequate dietary intake and infection operate in a vicious cycle that accounts for much of the high morbidityand mortality seen in developing countries. When children don't eat enough or well enough, their immunesystem defences are lowered, resulting in greater incidence, severity and duration of disease.

According to the UnitedNations Development Programme(UNDP), access varies widely, but inas many as 35 of the poorest countries30 to 50 per cent of the population mayhave no access to health services at all.\"In Africa, the programme knownas the Bamako Initiative was launched27 25 Panel 5Growth and sanitation:What can we learn from chickens? poultry farmers have known forsome time that a chicken livingin a dirty environment is achicken that grows poorly. Even if itis not overtly sick all the time, it gainslittle weight.Is there a message here about thegrowth of children? Because growth,like other nutrition outcomes, is deter-mined most immediately by diet andillness status, the answer, at least inpart, may be yes. Infectious illnesswhich spreads more easily in unsani-tary conditionsleads to poorer di-etary intake and poor use of thenutrients ingested. This,in turn,leads to lower resistance to infection,and so on, in a vicious diet-infectioncycle (Fig. 6).Now studies suggest that an un-sanitary environment may have ef-fects beyond those associated withparticular bouts of illness. Research-ers believe that children living insuch conditions may suffer from afairly constant, low-level challenge totheir immune systems that impairs 26their growth, as has been shown indomestic fowl. Dr. Noel Solomons ofthe Centre for Studies of SensoryImpairment, Aging and Metabolismand colleagues suggest that alongwith classifying children as healthy(having noclinicalillness)andacutely infected (with signs of illnessreadily detectable), there is also acategory of \"inapparently infected.\"Children who are inapparently in-fected have no signs of clinical illnessbut do have abnormal levels of someimmunological indicators. Such in-apparent infections and the chroniclow-level stimulation of the immunesystem associated with life in unsan-itary conditions may mean thatnutrients go to support the body's im-mune response rather than growth.Poverty occurs in both South Asiaand sub-Saharan Africa, but rates ofmalnutrition, especially stunting, aremuch higher in South Asia. A num-ber of hypotheses have been ad-vanced to explain this difference, andone is that it is due to poorer sanita-28tion and hygiene practices, the muchgreater population density and de-gree of overcrowding in South Asia.Certainly, the dangers posed bypoor access to potable water are wellknown. A recent review of data col-lected by the Demographic and HealthSurveys, a USAID-supported project,indicates that health and nutritionbenefits from improved sanitation,especially improved excreta dis-posal, may be even greater thanthose associated with better accessto safe water alone.A group led by Dr. ReynaldoMartorell of Emory University (US)has designed a study to shed light onthe relationship between sanitationand growth stunting. This studywould follow 800 children in two lo-cations in South Asia and 800 morein two locationsin sub-SaharanAfrica from the time their mothersbecome pregnant to when they aretwo years old and would collect awide range of information on sanita-tion, hygiene practices and other as-pects of the household environment.The children's growth would be meas-ured frequently along with indicatorsof feeding practices, diet quality, ill-ness and many other factors. UNICEFis helping to secure funds for thisstudy.Establishing a link between sani-tation conditions and child growth ina cause-and-effect way will go a longway to clarifying priorities for actionin this area. Such a link will alsoreveal just how useful the 'dirtychicken' model is for understandingstunted growth among children.

It is a strategy for improvinghealth services by moving their con-trol, management and even some oftheir financing out of central jurisdic-tion and into communities.Now in place in a number of coun-tries in Africa, the Initiative's princi-ples are being adopted and adapted inother regions as well. The results arepromising: The supply of basic drugsin health centres is more consistent,and management committees, com-posed of village residents, help ensurethat people pay reasonable fees forbasic services and that the funds gen-erated are well used.Nevertheless, the fact remains thatmany people do not have access tohealth care and may be further de-terred from seeking timely and appro-priate care by user fees for health careservices.The additional challenge of creat-ing a climate where preventive healthand nutritional care components arealso integrated into the Bamako modelis harder to realize. Because they areless tangible to communities, preven-tive health and nutrition services arealso often less in demand than cura-tive care. Prevention, nonetheless, isvital and cost-effective.In terms of environmental health,the lack of ready access to a safewater supply and proper sanitationand the unhygienic handling of foodas well as the unhygienic conditionsin and around homes, which causemost childhood diarrhoea, have sig-nificant implications for the spread ofinfectious diseases.Moreover, when is handledunder unhygienic conditions and theenvironment is unhealthful, litteredwith animal and human wastes, youngchildren are also more prone to infec-tion by intestinal parasites, anothercause of poor growth and malnutrition(Panels 5 and 20).Also, women and children are usu-ally responsible for fetching the waterneeded for domestic use, a task thatdrains considerable time and energy.Depending on how much the distanceto the water source is shortened, it hasbeen estimated that women couldconserve large reserves of energy, asmany as 300 to 600 calories a day.\"Progress has been made in improv-ing access to safe water. But morethan 1.1 billion people lack this funda-mental requirement of good nutrition.\"As for sanitary waste disposal, theworld is actually losing ground, withthe rate of coverage falling in bothurban and rural areas. Only 18 per centof rural dwellers had access to adequatesanitation services at the end of 1994,\"and overall some 2.9 billion peoplelack access to adequate sanitation.\"LI Caring practicesExperience has taught that even whenthere is adequate food in the houseand a family lives in a safe and health-ful environment and has access tohealth services, children can still be-come malnourished.Inadequate care for children andwomen, the third element of malnutri-tion's underlying causes, has onlyrecently been recognized and under-stood in all its harmful ramifications.Care is manifested in the ways achild is fed, nurtured, taught andguided. It is the expression by individ-uals and families of the domestic andcultural values that guide them.Nutritionally, care encompasses allmeasures and behaviours that trans-late available food and health re-sources into good child growth anddevelopment. This complex of caringbehaviours is often mistakenly as-sumed to be the exclusive domain ofmothers. It is, in fact, the responsibil-ity and domain of the entire familyExperience has taught thateven when there is adequatefood in the house and afamily lives in a safe andhealthful environment andhas access to health services,children can still becomemalnourished. 27 The introduction ofcomplementary foods is acritical stage. A child willbe put at increased risk ofmalnutrition and illness ifthese foods are introducedmuch before the age of sixmonths, or if the preparationand storage of food in thehome is not hygienic. 28and the community, and both mothersand children require the care of theirfamilies and communities.In communities where mothers aresupported and cared for, they are, inturn, better able to care for youngchildren.Among the range of caring behav-iours that affects child nutrition andhealth, the following are most critical:Feeding: As we have seen, exclu-sivebreastfeedingfor aboutsixmonths, and then continued breast-feeding with the addition of safe,high-quality complementary foodsinto the second year of life, providesthe best nourishment and protectschildren from infection.The introduction of complemen-tary foods is a critical stage. A childwill be put at increased risk of mal-nutrition and illness if these foodsare introduced much before the ageof six months, or if the preparationand storage of food in the home isnot hygienic.On the other hand, a child musthave complementary foods at the six-month point, since breastmilk nolonger meets all nutritional needs.Delaying the switch-over much be-yond six months of age can cause achild's growth to falter.From about 6 months to 18 monthsof age, the period of complementaryfeeding, a child needs frequent feed-ingat least four times daily, de-pending on the number of times achild is breastfed and other factorsand requires meals that are both densein energy and nutrients and easy todigest.The foods a family normally eatswill have to be adapted to the needs ofsmall children, and time must bemade available for preparing themeals and feeding children.Good caring practices need to begrounded in good information and30knowledge and free of cultural biasesand misperceptions. In many cultures,for instance, food and liquids arewithheld during episodes of diar-rhoea in the mistaken belief that doingso will end the diarrhoea. The practiceis dangerous because it denies thechild the nutrients and water vital forrecovery.Other behaviours that affect nutri-tion include whether children are fedfirst or last among family members,and whether boys are fed preferen-tially over girls. In a number of cul-tures and countries, men, adult guestsand male children eat before womenand girls.The level of knowledge about hy-giene and disease transmission is an-other important element of care. Itinvolves food preparation and storage,and whether both those who preparethe food and those who eat it washtheir hands properly before handling it.Ideas concerning appropriate childbehaviour are also important. If, forinstance, it is considered disrespectfulfor a child to ask for food, feedingproblems can occur.Protecting children's health: Sim-ilarly rooted in good knowledge andinformation is the caring act of seeingthat children receive essential healthcare at the right time. Early treatmentcan prevent a disease from becomingsevere.Immunizations, for example, haveto be carried out according to a spe-cific schedule. Sound health informa-tion needs to be available to commu-nities, and families and those caringfor children need to be supported inseeking appropriate and timely healthcare.Therapeutic treatment for a se-verely malnourished child inthehospital is far more expensive thanpreventive care. According to a 1990US Department of Agriculture study, nutrition investments for pregnantwomen were very cost-effective:Every $1 spent on prenatal nutritioncare yielded an average savings ofabout $3 in reduced medical costs forthe children during the first twomonths after birth.\"A study in Ghana has also foundsavings in health care costs: Childrenreceiving vitamin A supplementsmade fewer clinic visits and had lowerhospital admission rates than childrennot receiving the supplement.Support and cognitive stimulationfor children: For optimal develop-ment, children require emotional sup-port and cognitive stimulation, andparents and other caregivers have acrucial role in recognizing and re-sponding to the actions and needs ofinfants.The link between caring stimula-tion and malnourished children is alsoimportant: Several studies have foundthat malnourished children who weregiven verbal and cognitive stimulationhad higher growth rates than thosewho were not.\"Breastfeeding affords the bestearly occasion to provide support andstimulation. It enables mothers andtheir infants to develop a close emo-tional bond that benefits both. Allchildren needand delight inthekind of play and stimulation that is es-sential for their cognitive, motor andsocial development.Verbal stimulation by caregivers isparticularly important for a child'slinguistic development. Ill or mal-nourished children who are in painand have lost their appetite need spe-cial attention to encourage them tofeed and take a renewed interest intheir surroundings during recovery.In addition to improved nutrientintake, optimal cognitive developmentalso requires stimulation of, and regu-lar interaction with, young children.The quality of these actions can be en-hanced through education of parentsand other caregivers. Child-to-childprogrammes, for example, can pro-vide simple resources to older chil-dren to improve the care, develop-ment and nutritional well-being oftheir younger siblings.Policy makers need to recognizethe significance of such measures andactions and take them into accountwhen devising policy and programmes.But the timing must be carefullyplanned: Many early child develop-ment activities concentrate on chil-dren who are age three and olderwhen the focus should be on childrenup to the age of three and should linkcare, good feeding and psychosocialactivities.Care and support for mothers: Aslong as the unequal division of labourand resources in families and commu-nities continues to favour men, and aslong as girls and women face discrim-ination in education and employment,the caring practices vital to the nutri-tional well-being of children will suffer.Women, on average, put nearlytwice the hours of men into familyandhouseholdmaintenance.InBangladesh, India and Nepal, for ex-ample, girls and women spend threeto five hours more a week than boysand men in tasks such as carrying fueland growing and processing food.'They then spend an additional 20to 30 hours a week performing otherunpaid household work. If the bur-dens they carry are not better andmore equitably distributed, both theyand their caring role will suffer.The elements of care most critical forwomen during pregnancy and lactationinclude extra quantities of good-qualityfood, release from onerous labour, ad-equate time for rest, and skilled andsensitive pre- and post-natal healthcare from trained practitioners.4 4 pExclusive hreastfeeding for the first six monthsof a child's life not only provides the bestnourishment and protection from infection,but also enables mothers and their infants todevelop close emotional bonds. A womanbreastfeeds her three-month-old baby inthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. 29 Panel 6Breastmilk and transmission of HIV Breastfeeding confers enormousbenefits, preventing malnutri-tion and illness, saving livesand money. It is also, however, oneway an HIV-positive mother couldtransmit the virus to her infant. Achild stands the greatest riskbelieved to be 20 per centof verti-cal or mother-to-child transmissionduring the time of late pregnancyand childbirth. There is an additional14 per cent risk that an infant will be-come infected through breastmilk.This risk of infection throughbreastfeeding needs to be weighedagainst the great dangers posed byartificial feeding:In communitieswhere sanitation is inadequate andfamilies are poor, death from diar-rhoea is 14 times higher in artificiallyfed infants than in those who arebreastfed. If HIV-positive women andthose who fear HIV (without actuallybeing infected) were to abandonbreastfeeding in large numbers, with-out safe and reliable alternatives forfeeding their children, the ensuinginfant deaths from diarrhoea and res-piratory infections could vastly out-number those from HIV.The dilemma facing an HIV-positivewoman who does not have easy ac-cess to safe water, who does nothave enough fuel to sterilize feedingbottles and prepare alternatives tobreastmilk, or who cannot afford tobuy sufficient formula to ensure herchild's nutrition is a wrenching onethat no mother can solve on her own.Support for women facing this dilem-ma is imperative, as the Joint UnitedNations Programme on HIV/AIDS(UNAIDS) made clear in 1996. Thefollowing measures are importantstarting points:Pregnant women should have ac-cess to voluntary and confidential 30counselling and testing to deter-mine their health status. If theyare HIV positive, they should re-ceive appropriate treatment toreduce the risk of vertical trans-mission. If they are HIV negative,health education is vital to helpthem and their partners remainthat way.HIV-positive mothers should beinformed of the risks of both verti-cal transmission through breast-feeding and infections associatedwith artificial feeding in their localenvironment. Each woman shouldbe assisted by HIV counsellors orhealth professionals to under-stand these risks and then makeher own decision.If an HIV-positive mother has ac-cess to adequate breastmilk sub-stitutes that she can preparesafely, then she should considerartificial feeding. Other alterna-tives include wet-nursing by anHIV-negative woman, which maybe acceptable in some cultures.Heat treatment of expressed breast-milk (62.5\u00b0C for 30 minutes) de-stroys the virus, which may be agood choice for some women.When mothers who test positivefor HIV choose not to breastfeedbut are unable to or cannot affordfeeding alternatives, help will beneeded from a range of parties, in-cluding governmental and partneragencies. Attention must be paidto the needs of the most disad-vantaged women, which includeimproved water and sanitationand attentive family health care.These measures should be part ofan integrated strategy to reduce ver-tical transmission since breastfeed-ing is only a small part of the prob-lem. Access to voluntary, confidentialtesting and counselling is key to anystrategy to reduce vertical transmis-sion. Access to a range of prenataland obstetric care measures associ-ated with reduced transmission riskis also essential.Studies now in progress will soongive a better understanding of themechanisms, timing and risks of ver-tical transmission. It may be possiblein a few years to offer all women low-cost, easily delivered services thatwill minimize or even eliminate therisk of vertical transmission. For now,access to the testing, counselling, in-formation and other services notedabove should be high priorities. The AIDS pandemic has intro-duced new and volatile considerationsand aspects of care into already sensi-tive areas of human behaviour and in-teraction. High priority should begiven to improving access to servicesthat help minimize the risk of HIVtransmission to women before, duringand after pregnancy, as well as to theirpartners (Panel 6).Cultural norms and misconcep-tions affect the care women receiveduring pregnancy. In some culturallyconservative communities in parts ofAsia, for example, fish, meat, eggsand fat are not part of the diets ofpregnant women because it is fearedthey will make a baby too large anddifficult to deliver. Research shows,however, that better maternal diet canimprove the birthweight of children inmany cases without causing signifi-cantly increased head circumferenceof the newborn, which is the factormost likely to put small women at risk(Panel 7).The adjustment of workload is an-other aspect of the care accordedwomen during pregnancyand onewith powerful ramifications.A survey in one village in theGambia, for example, found that evenduring periods of relatively low sea-sonal agricultural activity, womengained on average just 5.5 kilogramsduring pregnancyonly about halfof the recommended weight gain thatwomen need to sustain their develop-ing foetus.\"Reductions in a woman's workloadduring pregnancy, combined with morefood of good quality, improve the nu-tritional status of a woman and herunborn child and reduce the risk thatthe child will have a low birthweight.In Viet Nam, when men assumedsome of their pregnant wives' respon-sibilities during the third trimester ofpregnancy, women rested more, andtheir infants weighed more at birth.In Indonesia, infants born to womenwho received a food supplement did notweigh more at birth, but they developedbetter during the first year of life.The fact that women are usuallythe primary caregivers does notmean that men, families and commu-nities are exempt from care-givingresponsibilities.The often oppressive and demand-ing patriarchal environment in whichmillions of women live must give wayto an equal partnership in whichwomen enjoy autonomy and the senseof accomplishment that comes frombuilding skills and capacities.At the same time, girls need to befree from pressures to marry early. Astudy in West Africa, for example,found that nearly 20 per cent of girlsin rural areas of the Gambia andSenegal and 45 per cent of girls inNiger marry before the age of 15.Figures such as these underscorethe great need for girls and women tobe involved in major personal deci-sions, including not only their marry-ing age but also how closely the birthsof their children will be spaced.Adolescent pregnancy is a majorrisk factor for both mother and infant,as the girl may not have finishedgrowing before her first pregnancy,making childbirth dangerous.The infant of a very young mothermay have low birthweight (Fig. 7).Higher risks anaemia, childbearing inadolescence.A number of measures are essen-tial, therefore, to enable women andgirls to develop their skills and abilities.These include ensuring their access tofamily and community resources,such as credit, and to education andinformation.The often oppressive anddemanding patriarchalenvironment in whichmillions of women livemust give way to anequal partnership. 31 Panel 7High-energy biscuits for mothers boostinfant survival by 50 per cent ooP'\"oosoowowowowowor_ .. .7.0\"400 oli'to 0 In the Gambia, well-targeted inter-ventions to improve the nutrition ofpregnant women are making a dif-ference in the birthweight of their ba-bies, and at the same time sharplyreducing the risk of babies dying dur-ing, or shortly after, birth.A large, controlled study in thecountry's rural West Kiang region hasdetermined that the number of low-birthweight babies fell by nearly 40per cent and that stillbirth and peri-natal mortality rates in infants werealmost 50 per cent lower when preg-nant women received a daily rationof locally prepared, energy-rich bis-cuits.Theseremarkableresultsstrengthen the argument for provid-ing food supplements to pregnantwomen to reduce low birthweight.\"The study clearly demonstratesthat improved maternal nutrition, de-liverable through a primary healthcare system, can have highly benefi-cial effects when efficiently targeted 32at women in genuine need,\" saysone of the study's authors, Dr. SanaCeesay, of the Dunn Nutrition Centreaffiliated with the University of Cam-bridge, which has been working inpartnership with the Gambian HealthDepartment. The findings were pub-lished in the British Medical Journalin September 1997.UNICEF estimates that each yearover 24 million babies are bornbelow the low-birthweight thresholdof 2.5 kg, and that 95 per cent ofthese births occur in the developingworld. Low birthweight puts infantsat a greatly increased risk of neonataldeath and is an important cause ofpoor growth and development inlater childhood. It can be due to anumber offactors,includingawoman's small size, uterine infec-tions, smoking, low oxygen levels inthe blood (due to excessive work orhigh altitude) and malarial infection.However, when all these factors are34equal, the incidence of low birth-weight is higher in economically de-prived mothers than in affluent ones.The most likely explanation forthe difference is that inadequatematernal nutrition suppresses foetalgrowth. It has often been difficult,nevertheless, to show real benefits toinfants from improvements to amother's diet during pregnancy. Thestudy in the Gambia provides suchevidence.In this part of West Africa, previ-ous studies had indicated that preg-nant womenchallenged as manywomen are by the high energy de-mands of water and fuel collection,agricultural work and child-care ac-tivities but also by the energy andother nutrient needs of pregnancydid not eat enough or well enough tomeet all these needs. The growth oftheir babies was thus threatened.The five-year, prenatal supple-mentation trial covered 28 villages inone region of the Gambia. In the in-tervention villages, pregnant moth-ersreceiveddailyhigh-energygroundnut-based biscuits, providing1,000 kcal/day on average after 20weeks of pregnancy. The biscuitswere made from local ingredientsand were baked by two village bak-ers in traditional clay ovens. Womenin control villages received anti-malarials, iron/folate supplementsand antenatal care as did women inthe intervention villages, but they didnot receive the biscuits during preg-nancy. Field workers weighed all thewomen in the study at regular inter-vals, and weighed and measured allinfants at delivery.The biscuit supplement caused ahighly significant increase in birth-weight, reducing the numbers of in-fants classified as low birthweight by39 per cent. Particularly noteworthy was the reduction in low birth-weight occurring in births duringthe annual 'hungry season', whenbirthweights normally are lowerthan in the harvest season, as aresult of poor maternal nutritioncombined with hard seasonalagricultural work. (It is unlikelythat food supplements wouldhave the same impact on preg-nant women who are not chroni-cally energy-deficient.)In addition to these remarkablebenefits, this study refutes theidea prevailing in some circlesthat improving the diet of preg-nant women will cause them tosuffer higher rates of obstetricalcomplications because of thelarger size of their newborns.Birthweight was indeed higher inthe children of women who re-ceived the biscuits, but head cir-cumference, which is the factormore closely related to pelvic dis-proportion inbirth, was onlyslightly greater. The rate of obstet-ric complications of this kind wasnot higher in the supplementedwomen. Photo: A healthy newborn sleepspeacefully in the Gambia.Basic causesIt is often said that poverty at the fam-ily level is the principal cause of childmalnutrition. While it is true that alack of resources and malnutritionoften go hand in hand, this statementtells only part of the story.Many poor families do in fact re-ceive adequate nutrition, and malnutri-tion is found in many better-off families.The broader explanation lies with-in a fuller understanding of the differ-ent types of resources necessary forgood nutrition, and of the factors thataffect families' ability to access andcontrol these resources.The three components of nutri-tionfood, health and careinter-act closely intheir influence onfamily life. Often efforts to fulfil oneprecondition for good nutrition com-pete for the same resources requiredto fulfil another condition.For example, if a woman has tospend excessive time in producingfood to achieve household food secu-rity, her ability to provide adequatechild care can be compromised. The re-sult may be malnutrition in her youngchild.Political, legal and cultural factors atthe national and regional levels maydefeat the best efforts of householdsto attain good nutrition for all members.These include the degree to whichthe rights of women and girls areprotected by law and custom; the po-litical and economic system thatdetermines how income and assets aredistributed; and the ideologies and poli-cies that govern the social sectors.For example, where it is known andappreciated by everyone in societymen and boys, women and girls,teachers and religious leaders, doctorsand nursesthat women in the latestages of pregnancy need rest and pro-tection from overwork, families aremore apt to receive the social supportthey need to ensure this protection.3How women are valued and treated in society,including their level of education, affects theirability to feed and care for their children.A first-grader in Colombia takes lunchbefore class begins. 33E 34Fig. 7Intergenerational cycle of growth failure The cycle of poor nutrition perpetuates itself across generations. Young girls who grow poorly becomestunted women and are more likely to give birth to low-birthweight infants. If those infants are girls, they arelikely to continue the cycle by being stunted in adulthood, and so on, if something isn't done to break thecycle. Adolescent pregnancy heightens the risk of low birthweight and the difficulty of breaking the cycle.Support is needed for good nutrition at all these stages infancy, childhood, adolescence and adulthoodespecially for girls and women. *owLow weight andheight in teenagers Source: ACC/SCN, Second Report on the World Nutrition Situation: Vol. I: Global and Regional Results, ACC/SCN, Geneva, 1992.

Middle-income countries were the biggest re-cipients of the private investments andloans: Two thirds went to them andone third to low-income countries. The two regions of the world with thehighest rates of childhood malnutri-tionsub-Saharan Africa and SouthAsiareceived only $1.6 billion and$5.2 billion respectively.And although bright spots exist interms of investment and trade in sub-Saharan Africa, the problems of thecontinent's economies remain stark,including relatively low levels of in-ternal demand and the import quotasindustrialized countries impose onAfrican manufactured goods.At the same time, developingcountries overall owed more than$2 trillion in external debt in 1995.Sub-Saharan Africa, for example,paid $13.6 billion in debt servicing in1995nearly double what it spenton health services. And developingcountries bear by far the greatest pro-portion of the global burden of dis-ease, which drains their human andeconomic resources.One potentially optimistic note inthis dismal picture of declining aidflows and increasing debt is the new`Heavily Indebted Poor Countries(HIPC) Debt Initiative' launched bythe World Bank and the InternationalMonetary Fund in 1996. This initia-tive is designed to assist poor coun-tries to achieve sustainable levels ofdebt based on an established trackrecord of implementing social andeconomic reform and on the conditionadditional resources are channelled tobasic social services. Bolivia, BurkinaFaso and Uganda will benefit fromthe initiative only in April 1998 orlater. More generous and timelydebt-relief would enable these coun-ties and others that will hopefullysoon qualify to release resources toreduce malnutrition.If the basic causes of malnutritionare to be addressed, greater and bettertargeted resources and improved col-laboration, participation and dialogueare needed. Awareness and informa-tion must be generated: between sec-tions of national governments; betweengovernments; with all developmentpartners, donors, UN agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs)and investors; and above all with thosewhose circumstances are rarely under-stood or noticed, the poor themselves.Action against malnutrition is bothimperative and possible. The world,as the next part of this report explains,has already accumulated a wealth ofexperience and insights on whichprogress can be built.Increased awareness and education about thecauses of malnutrition are essential if theproblem is to he successfully addressed.A health card in her hand, a woman holdsher baby at a UNICEF-assisted healthcentre in Syria. 35 N 5\"*:,....1.4:V5'5540. .S. 382tiEST COPY AVAILABV 4,_uc E aApproaches that work To succeed, the fight againstmalnutrition must be wagedon many fronts.Actions as diverse as improvingwomen's access to education, fortify-ing staple foods with essential nutri-ents, enhancing the spread of practicalinformation and increasing govern-ment social-sector spending have allled to improved nutrition in a numberof countries. The challenge is in de-vising overall strategies that addressspecific nutrition problems.The range of factors necessary fornutrition improvement was exploredin a recent study by the United Nations,'which confirmed that there is no oneformula to follow but that certain ele-ments are essential.For example, the empowerment ofwomen is of central importance to im-proving nutrition of both womenthemselves and their children. This in-cludes legislative and political effortsto combat discrimination against andexploitation of women and measuresto ensure that women have adequateaccess to resources and care at all lev-els of society. Improving educationfor girls and women is also vital. Photo: Growth monitoring is a powerful toolto protect children's nutrition and to empowercommunities. A child is weighed at a healthcentre in Ethiopia.The United Nations report hadthis is to say about the followingspecific factors involved in improv-ing nutrition.Nutrition and economic growth:Most countries in which nutrition hasimproved over the last two decadesalso enjoyed relatively high rates ofeconomic growth over a sustainedperiod. Nonetheless, the relationshipis not completely straightforward.Incountrieswhere economicgrowth has resultedin increasedhousehold income and resource ac-cess for the poor, the nutritional pay-off has been large. In Indonesia, forexample, economic growth from 1976to 1986 was accompanied by a 50 percent rise in the income of the poorest40 per cent of the people. Improve-ments in nutrition have been relativelyconstant throughout the economicboom, although they could have beeneven better.Household food insecurity oneof the key underlying causes of mal-nutritionis often the pivotal pointin the relationship between economicgrowth and nutritional status. Poorhouseholds spend a large proportionof their income on food. While poorhouseholds do not always use incomeincreases to raise their calorie con-sumption significantly, in many coun-tries greater income has led to in--1r39The empowerment of womenis of central importance toimproving nutritionof both women themselvesand their children. 37 Panel 8UNICEF and the World Food Programme The World Food Programme(WFP), the food aid organiza-tion of the United Nations sys-tem, began operations in 1963 and isnow the largest such organization inthe world. WFP responds to foodneeds associated with emergenciesand development, often working withthe other two Rome-based agencies,the Food and Agriculture Organiza-tion of the United Nations (FAO) andthe International Fund for Agricul-tural Development (IFAD).WFP provides three broad cate-gories of food aid: emergency rationsfor victims of natural and man-madedisasters (Food-For-Life); food aiddistributed through health clinics,schools and other community cen-tres to particularly vulnerable groups(Food-For-Growth); and food rationsprovided in exchange for work on de-velopment projects (Food-For-Work).In all three categories, much of WFP'swork is linked to the priorities andefforts of UNICEF.The link between the two sisteragencies goes beyond organizationalcoordination. Their work is comple-mentary, and they share commongoals. Both recognize that childrenare at once the most vulnerablegroup in societyand yet the futureof every community. Together, thetwo agencies have the tools to attackmalnutrition, helping to ensure ac-cess to adequate nutrition, with food,health and care, and to fight with aunified voice for the elimination ofhunger.In crisis situations requiring Food-For-Life assistance, UNICEF and WFPcollaborate to provide therapeuticand supplementary feeding to savethe lives of young children duringemergencies, as occurred in the re-cent past in the countries of formerYugoslavia. They also share logistics 38capacity, for example in Uganda,where WFP stored UNICEF's healthkits and supplementary feeding sup-plies, subsequently transporting themto Rwanda during the sudden returnof refugees in late 1996. And they co-operate in making joint assessmentsof the problem of inadequate nutri-tion and priority needs for addressingit, as in the case of the DemocraticPeople's Republic of Korea, where anutrition assessment was completedin September 1997. In southern Sudan,the two agencies, together with NGOsand counterparts, lead an annualneeds assessment mission, which notonly examines food security but also'health security', based on nutritionalstatus and access to health services.UNICEF and WFP also work to-gether on post-conflict projects, suchas the demobilization of child sol-diers. In Bukavu, in eastern Demo-cratic Republic of the Congo, WFPprovides food to a centre set upby UNICEF to help children whofought in the civil conflict reintegratein society.Food-For-Growth, the cornerstoneof one of WFP's major priorities, isparticularly close to the concerns ofUNICEF. This type of food aid isdesigned to provide assistance tomothers and children and other vul-nerable groups at critical times intheir lives. In Zambia, UNICEF workedclosely with WFP in 1994 to ensurethat a food supplement, aimed at pre-venting malnutrition in young chil-dren during prolonged drought, wasappropriately formulated and fortified.The high-energy protein supplementwas used as part of a coordinatedprogramme to provide both food andhealth care to children judged to beat particularly high risk of malnutrition.In Madagascar, UNICEF and WFPwork together to rehabilitate schools4uin the poorer regions of the south.UNICEF provides school kits andequipment, and WFP contributesschool meals.The two agencies also work to-gether on Food-For-Work projectswhen such aid dovetails with UNICEFmandates. In Malawi, for example,following the introduction of free pri-mary education in 1994, WFP andUNICEF later designed a school feed-ing programme with the aim of'Keeping kids in school'. Mothers ofschoolchildren are 'paid' a food allo-cation in exchange for the prepara-tion of school meals. creased consumption of higher-qualityfoods that tend to be rich in proteinand micronutrientsthe vitaminsand minerals needed in very small butregular amounts to assure nutrition.But while economic growth mustbe understood as a frequent contribu-tor to nutrition improvement, it is nota necessary condition for it. A numberof countries, such as the UnitedRepublic of Tanzania in the case de-scribed below, have achieved wide-spread nutrition improvement withoutsignificant overall economic growth.Nutrition and thestatus ofwomen: A major conclusion of theUnited Nations report is that in coun-tries where nutrition improvement haslagged behind economic growth, so-cial discrimination against women iscommon. In Pakistan, for example,widespread discrimination againstgirls and women is behind high levelsof illiteracy among women and girls,a very high fertility rate and lower fe-male life expectancy. Child malnutri-tion rates in Pakistan are among thehighest in the world, as is the propor-tion of low-birthweight infants, at 25per cent.Some experts place the majorblame for the very high child malnu-trition and low birthweight through-out much of South Asia on suchfactors as women's poor access to ed-ucation and low levels of employ-ment, compared with other regions.On the other hand, women inThailand, where nutrition has im-proved remarkably in the last twodecades, have very high literacy, highparticipation in the labour force, and astrong place in social and household-level decision-making.Nutrition and social-sector spend-ing: Investment in health, education,sanitation and other social sectorsespecially with emphasis on access ofwomen and girls to these servicesis among the most important policytools for improving nutrition.As a child survival and develop-ment measure, UNICEF has cham-pioned the 20-20 Initiative theallocation of at least 20 per cent ofgovernment spending to basic socialservices to be matched by 20 per centof donor funding in these areas. Thevalue of such investment is becomingincreasingly apparent. For example,there is evidence from Sri Lanka anda number of other countries that in-creases in spending on public healthservices are more strongly associatedwith reduced infant mortality and bet-ter nutrition than are overall increasesin income.After Zimbabwe achieved inde-pendence in 1980, explicit policieswere followed to redress the lack ofaccess of many communities to basicservices. As a result, there were vastimprovements in health services andimmunization, family planning and arange of educational services for thepoorall of them important deter-minants of the improvements in nutri-tion that the country has enjoyed.The approaches described aboveare all essentialand driven by theright of children and women to ade-quate services and resources.Actions that are more directed tonutrition improvement as a principaloutcomeimproving the quality ofstaple foods through fortification, im-proving local-level nutritional surveil-lance capacity, protecting women'sright to breastfeed, sharing informationon better complementary foodsmay have a more rapid and focusedeffect on nutrition.A number of these more direct ap-proaches that have worked are de-scribed below.41Spotlight WORLD FOODSUMMIT The World Food Summit, in which 186countries participated, was organized bythe Food and Agricultural Organization ofthe United Nations (FAO) in Rome inNovember 1996. The Summit was animportant contribution in the effort torefocus international attention on theneed to tackle the problems of both foodinsecurity and malnutrition. The Summit'sPlan of Action focused on ways of achiev-ing sustainable food security for all, oneof the necessary conditions for goodnutrition. The Plan of Action called for an enablingsocial and economic environment toachieve food security and drew attentionto the special contribution that womencan make to ensuring family and childnutrition, the importance of breastfeedingand the particular importance of givingpriority to children, especially girls. Otherobjectives related to the need to reduceinequality and poverty and the need forparticipatory and sustainable rural devel-opment policies and for trade policiesconducive to the achievement of foodsecurity for all. A commitment was madeto realize the rights of all to adequatefood and to freedom from hunger. 39 Panel 9Triple A takes hold in Oman Over the last 27 years, Omanhas made great strides inchild survival and develop-ment. Child mortality dropped from215 per 1,000 live births in 1970 to 25in 1995. School enrolment, particu-larly among girls, has increased dra-matically. Revenues from oil haveprovided an economic foundationOman's GNP per capita in 1995 was$4,820but these gains would nothave been possible without theGovernment's commitment to im-proving people's lives.Progress has been slower, how-ever, in terms of child nutrition. TheMinistry of Health, with support fromUNICEF, has been working to ad-dress this challenge since 1993. children's nutritional status,a ofgrowth monitoring, counselling andnutrition was devised. Aparticular focus is 105 villages of AlDakhiliya, an arid, rocky region inupper-central Oman where a 1995survey found that nearly one third ofthe children under the age of fivewere underweight.The results to date are impressive.Since the project's inception, therehas been a significant drop in thenumber of underweight children, ac-cording to an appraisal in 1996. Later 40the same year another appraisal de-scribed the project as well focused,effectively managed and clearly build-ing a momentum towards nationwidenutritional improvement. Motivation,commitment and participation werehigh among mothers and communityvolunteers.

Triple A is an iterative repeats the cycle of reassess-ment, re-analysis and re-action, lead-ing to regular modifications and im-provements in the approaches taken.True to this model, the people ofthe small villages and nomadic orsemi-nomadic settlements of AlDakhiliya were involved from thevery start, attending meetings toidentify the problems, discuss solu-tions and select from among them-selves the volunteers who would becentral to the effort.Every month throughout the re-gion, at public meetings or duringvisits to homes, these volunteersweigh children and chart their growth,referring severely underweight chil-dren to health care centres. They ad-vise families on how to feed childrenand to improve caring practices, onhow to keep children healthy andmanage illness when it occurs andon how to space births. They also re-inforce other public health activities,encouraging pregnant women toregister early for antenatal care, forexample, and helping in communityimmunization campaigns and na-tional health days.4'Regional trainers were brought into teach the volunteers about the in-cidence and causes of malnutrition,and how to improve and support ap-propriate feeding and caring prac-tices, using the triple A methodologyto solve problems. A programme co-ordinator at the regional level linksthe communities with programmesupport structures at the nationallevel and supervises, monitors andtrains trainers. There are programmecoordinators at the district level aswell. Finally, back-up support for thevolunteers is provided by teams ofhealth staff from nearby health centres.A nutritional monitoring systemhas also been created: At the monthlyweighing sessions, the volunteers fillout forms for all children, recordingtheir age and weight. The informa-tion on the nutritional status of all thechildren in a village goes on the formvolunteers send every month to thedistrict health supervisor, who then re-ports the status of the district's chil-dren to the regional coordinator.The tangible change for familiesand children in Al Dakhiliya has beenso positive that the programme isbeing expanded to additional vil-lages in the region and has been in-troduced in another five regions ofthe country.

Dramatic results fromsmall beginningsIn villages across Tanzania, a seem-ingly modest process began in theearly 1980s when villagers, many ofthem in poor and remote areas, beganto track the weight of their children.With financialsupport from theGovernment of Italy and day-to-daytechnical support from UNICEF, theChild Survival and Development(CSD) Programme began in five dis-tricts in the Iringa region, eventuallyreaching more than half the popula-tion of the country.The result was the virtual disap-pearance of severe malnutritionand striking reductions in mild andmoderate malnutrition. The lives ofthousands of children were saved.These improvements were accom-plished against the backdrop of previ-ously high mortality and malnutritionrates among young children thatbegan to climb in Tanzania followingthe economic decline in the 1970s and1980s. Of crucial importance was theGovernment's continued commit-ment, even during this difficult period,to policies worked out with the fullparticipation of communities andfamilies. This approach that was toprove one of the greatest strengths ofthe CSD Programme.A community-wide pictureA major feature was community-basedgrowth monitoring, which allowed theparents and other community mem-bers to assess the nutritional well-being of their own and other childrenin the village. The results could thenbe compared with figures for neigh-bouring villages and those throughoutthe country.These assessments provided abaseline at the start of the programmeand were repeated every three monthsthereafter to follow the progress of in-dividual children. When the resultsfor all the children in the village wereadded together, they provided a con-crete measure of nutritional well-beingand development for the whole com-munity. These quarterly weighing ses-sions sparked the participation notonly of fathers and mothers, but alsoof the whole community in analysingwhy children were malnourished andwhy some seemed to thrive while othersdid not.An improved understanding of thefactors involved in the nutritionalwell-being of their children in turnhelped the villagers to plan and initi-ate actions that would contribute tobetter growth and overall child health.Subsequent weighingsessionshelped parents and villagers evaluatethe results and effectiveness of the ac-tions taken and consider new or modi-fied actions. In this way, continuouscycles that combined assessment,analysis and actionthe 'triple A'approachwere nutrition the programme villages(Fig. 8; Panels 9 and 10).The steps the villagers took wereaimed atincreasing feeding fre-quency; encouraging better use ofbasic health services; healthworkers, including skilled birth treatment of diarrhoea andother illnesses; strengthening house-hold technology to improve the por-ridge made for young children;reducing vitamin and mineral defi-ciencies; supporting activities such assmall animal husbandry and homegardening; and improving sanitation.From bystandersto participantsThe simple tool of growth monitoringallowed the villagers to make betteruse of their own creativity and re-sources, to express their requests for4,3Fig. 8 Better nutrition throughtriple AThe 'triple A' cycle of Assessing a problem,Analysing its causes and taking Action based onthis analysis can be used at all levels of society tocreate processes whereby people's right to goodnutrition is fulfilled.

But on a recent Saturdayafternoon, 40 mothers, their childrenand community leaders affiliated withthe Brazilian Child Pastorate gath-ered under the trees outside a parishhall. The community leaders set thechildren one by one on a scale, re-cording their weight in notebooksand consulting with the mothers onany nutrition or health problems. Theweighing over, the occasion turnedfestive. Community leaders broughtout trays of home-baked cakes andcookies; the yard filled with conver-sation and laughter and the happyshrieks of children at play.The Child Pastorate's success inprotecting the health and develop-ment of poor children in Brazil is def-initely cause for celebration. ThePastorate estimates that in the com-munities where the programme is inplace, the malnutrition rate amongchildren under five does not exceed 428 per cent, compared to 16.3 per centnationally as found in a 1996 Dem-ographic and Health Survey applyingthe same criteria*. Additionally, theChild Pastorate estimates that the in-cidence of low birthweight babies is6 per cent in communities it assists,while the incidence is 9.2 per centnationally.The Child Pastorate is one of thelargest NGOs in the world devoted tochild health, nutrition and develop-ment. Its aim is to empower the poorboth to improve their children's livesand to participate in transformingtheir communities and their country.The National Conference of Brazil-ian Bishops founded the NGO in1983, with efforts beginning in onecommunity in Parana state. Now theChild Pastorate operates in 22,000communities, in cities large and small,as well as in rural areas, and serves2.1 million families, including over 3.1million children under the age of sixand nearly 144,000 pregnant women.The Pastorate's nearly 83,000 com-munity volunteers, mainly women,are the backbone of the programme,working directly with 10 to 20 fami-lies in their neighbourhoods. \"Theyare like shepherds, looking after theircommunities,\" says Dr. Zilda ArnsNeumann, a paediatrician and thenational coordinator of the NGO sinceits inception. Community leaders aretrained in basic child and maternalnutrition and health skills, includingmonitoring growth, tracking immu-nizations, supporting breastfeeding,treating diarrhoea with oral rehydra-tion detecting Pastorate makes nutrition acommunity issue: Families get help, *Percentage of children below the 10th per-centile of the National Center for Health Sta-tistics (US) reference weight-for-age standard.44encouragement and support fromneighbours in improving their chil-dren's well-being. Community lead-ers visit the homes of children whoare malnourished, monitoring theirweight frequently and referring fami-lies to local health facilities if neces-sary. They screen pregnant womenfor indications of malnutrition andrefer them to medical facilities forprenatal care and delivery, and afterbirth, support for breastfeeding is amain priority. Families also learnhow to prepare nutritious meals withlow-cost ingredients that are avail-able locally.

The fourth is 'cele-brate' (rejoice in the gains made inchildren's nutrition and health).The Child Pastorate uses its part-nershipswith the Government atall levels, with other NGOs and withthe mediato maximum effect,planning budget and activities tocomplement those of the Ministry ofHealth. It works through municipalcouncils to help maintain public ser-vices in communities, from the qual-ity of tap water to health services toeducation.The broadcast media are strongallies. Nutrition and health messagesdeveloped by the Child Pastorate areaired on a 15-minute radio pro-gramme, Viva a Vida (Enjoy Life),once or twice a week by 910 radiostations. Since 1995, the Child Pas- torate has received about one quar-ter of the proceeds of the annualfund-raising television campaign'Crianca Esperanca' (Child Hope),sponsored by UNICEF and GloboTV, to assist municipalities withhigh infant mortality rates through-out the country. The Pastorate es-timates that in the campaign'sfirst year, malnutrition declinedby 14 per cent in the municipali-ties featured on the programme.The Child Pastorate is able tooperate at low cost, in part be-cause of the considerable effortsof its volunteers and the logisticalnet provided by the CatholicChurch. Training, transportationand other support for the pro-gramme's community leaders areamong the main expenses. TheChild Pastorate received assis-tance from UNICEF in its earlyyears. Since 1987, the BrazilianMinistry of Health has providedsupport, with additional fundsraised from the private sector.

While food is obviously essen-tial for good nutrition, the success ofthe Tanzanian approach suggestedthat an overall lack of food at thehousehold level was not the majorcause of malnutrition in young chil-dren and pregnant women in the vil-lages. Less tangible, but singularlyimportant, was the transformation thatmany communities underwent. Frompassively enduring economic declineand marginalization, villagers becameactive participants for change, formu-lating and carrying out policies thatled to better lives for their childrenand themselves. A major feature ofthis transformation was the emer-gence of women as central players,making decisions at both the commu-nity and household levels, with localsupport in the form of start-up financingfor their income-generating activities.Two other factors underpinnedthe success of the programme: univer-sal education, including adult educa-tion, and a high level of politicalmobilization in Tanzanian villagesthat provided an organized system ofcommunication.Despite setbacks,durable progressThe Tanzanian experience was hardlyperfect. When decisions are madethrough a repetitive, collective pro-cess, false starts and mistakes are in-evitable. Gains also have been difficultto sustain in some areas. But durableprogress has been made: Commun-ities have actively taken up the fightagainst malnutrition, and they havecollected and analysed informationthemselves. The sense of power andcommitment gained through such aprocess is not quickly relinquished.45When women are respected and manageresources in a community, their own andtheir children's nutritional status improves.Women in Bangladesh gain experiencethrough their own small businesses. 43 Panel 11Rewriting Elias's story in Mbeya My name is Elias. I am two-and-a-half years old and I live on the outskirts ofMbeya with my mother, father, two older brothers and an older sister.We are poor and our house has no toilet. My mother gets up early to fetchwater from the river since our house has no tap. Then she goes to her farmplot, leaving me with my sister, Sophia, who is seven. Sophia collects fire-wood and does other chores for my mother, so she doesn't have much timeto spend with me.When my mother returns from her plot, she cooks a meal, usually maizeporridge. Last year my mother grew enough maize, but this year she had tosell some to get money to buy other things. Now she says she doesn't knowwhat we will eat when our maize stock runs out.When I was younger, my mother breastfed me. Since she stopped, I haveoften been ill with fevers and diarrhoea. When I last had a fever, the nurse atthe dispensary said it was probably malaria. My mother bought medicine butI didn't get better. Now I feel very ill and I don't have much energy.From a drama staged by HANDS' community organizers Elias's story is a cautionary taleof how poor sanitation, the ces-sation of breastfeeding, diseaseand poverty converge all too often inmalnutrition or even death for youngchildren. The Health and NutritionDistrict Support (HANDS) project ishelping people in Mbeya, a largeurban centre in south-west Tanzania,rewrite this tale with a healthier,happier ending for their children.Launched by the Tanzanian Govern-ment in 1992 with support from theUnited Kingdom Overseas Develop-ment Administration, HANDS' suc-cess has been impressive.Moderate malnutrition in chil-dren fell to 22 per cent in 1995 from33 per cent in 1992, and severe mal-nutrition dropped to 0.4 per cent 44 46from 3.3 per cent in areas whereHANDS operates. In contrast, mal-nutrition increased by 7 percentagepoints among children under five inMbeya as a whole.In the same period, in HANDS'areas, the percentage of pregnantwomen with anaemia declined from37 per cent to 33 per cent, and the in-cidence of low birthweight was alsoreduced. Ninety-nine per cent of chil-dren between the ages of one andfive were fully vaccinated, up from 86per cent. The proportion of house-holds with access to safe water in-creased from 60 to 96 per cent, andthose with pit latrines from 75 to 92per cent. In all, about 125,000 peoplebenefited directly and indirectly.An important strategy of HANDSlies in careful targeting: The projectfocuses on areas with the highestlevels of child malnutrition and infec-tious diseases, lowest levels of do-mestic sanitation and most limitedaccess to health facilities. Equally im-portant, the community has been in-timately involved, from planningthrough implementation and man-agement, with evaluation. The pooridentified their priorities and becamepartners with government staff inimplementing a range of health-enhancing development activities.Donor support has been critical inproviding training, essential equip-ment and transport. An investmentwas also made in council and com-munity development funds, enablingthe council to improve health ser-vices and access to safe water, up-grade sanitation and promote house-hold hygiene in targeted areas.Revitalized maternal and childhealth services in the communitynow are responsible for child vacci-nation, antenatal and post-natal care,family planning, diarrhoea! disease control, treatments for commonchildhood illnesses and growthpromotion activities. Health andnutrition education activities arestronger and focus on children'svulnerability during the periodwhen complementary foods arebeing introduced, on the nutri-tional needs of pregnant womenandon home-based oral rehydra-tion therapy. support well-being new serveover 50,000 people, and threehealth centres were upgraded,now reaching 80,000 people. Af-fordable latrines and basic hygieneare promoted, and innovative workis being done on low-cost publictoilets.Thanks to seminars, formaltraining and drama sessions runby Tanzanian women lawyers, therights of women and children arehigher on the public agenda. Asubsequent survey found that fa-thers are making greater contribu-tions to child welfare.The HANDS project is now in asecond phase: Tanzanians havereplaced international staff, andproject management lies withlocal committees. Thecommitment and participation oflocal government staff and com-munity members indicate that theproject is sustainable.

Virtuallythe same community-based approachthat had proven successful in Iringaand elsewhere in Tanzania was intro-duced in Mbeya. The improvement inthe nutritional status of children there,again carefully monitored and docu-mented, independently confirms thevalidity of this approach.Nor is the community learning ap-proach used in Tanzania by anymeans unique. In the heart of theSahel, villagers in the Maradi regionof Niger, with support from UNICEFand bilateral donors, have also begunto record their children's weight on aregular basis. These villagers facemany obstacles that communities inTanzania did not havelittle rainfalland a very short growing season,much less experience with participa-tory development, less support fromthe central level and a history ofvillage-level decision-making that ex-plicitly excluded women. But malnu-trition has been significantly reduced,and the scale of their activities seemson track to rival that of Tanzania(Panel 12).In Thailand,another success storyOnthe other side of the globe, Thai-land has achieved stunning improve-ments in the nutrition of millions ofits children through a combination ofapproaches, aided by a booming econ-omy. The Thai Government estimatesthat malnutrition of under-five chil-dren fell from about 51 per cent in1982 (measured as a proportion ofunderweight children) to about 19 percent in 1990, and that severe malnu-trition virtually disappeared duringthat period. At the local level, growth47Thailand has achievedstunning improvements inthe nutrition of millions ofits children through acombination of approaches,aided by a booming economy. 45 Panel 12Women in Niger take the lead against malnutrition Better seeds and fertilizer, adiesel-powered mill and twodonkey carts: With these mod-est improvements, women in KwarenTsabre, a village in central Niger, arelessening their workloads and begin-ning to overcome the widespreadmalnutrition threatening their children.The problems seemed intractablejust a few years ago. Over half theyoung children in the village of 680inhabitants were underweight, andmany showed signs of serious vita-min A deficiencywhich can lead toblindness and death.Progress is being made thanks toa close partnership between thecommunity and district-based gov-ernment agents, founded on the peo-ple's own assessment and analysis oftheir situation. The problems wereacute: As in many villages in theheart of the Sahel region in WestAfrica, Kwaren Tsabre of staple lacked richness and diversity; 46J women were grossly overworkedand had little access to education andinformation; and health services wereremote and often of poor quality.Because women were most seri-ously and directly affected, it wasnecessary to put them at the centreof decision-making and have thembenefit from the new initiatives. Village Wo-men's Committeewas formed,with members trained by govern-ment agents in the district. The firststep, as Zouera, the first President ofthe Committee, explained, was toidentify actions that could bringabout measurable improvements innutrition.\"We realized that because ourworkdays were so longbetween14 and 17 hourswe couldn't carefor our children as well as we wantedto,\" she said. Getting a loan for adiesel mill to relieve the women ofthe arduous task of hand-poundingsorghum and millet was one re-48sponse. Another was to purchasetwo donkey carts to reduce the hoursspent carrying wood and water. Bothmill and carts save time and generateincome: The villagers of KwarenTsabre and their neighbours frommiles around agreed to pay modestfees to grind grain and use the carts.With technical help, better irriga-tion and improved seeds and fertil-izer, staple crop yields have nearlytripled and new vitamin A-rich foodsare also being produced, includingamaranth and baobab leaves. Thewomen incorporated these vitamin Asources and small amounts of oilinto their usual meals and soonbegan noticing a decrease in night-blindness (a symptom of vitamin Adeficiency) among their children.Women inneighbouring villageshave reported that night-blindnesshas also been reduced among preg-nant women.Zouera and her colleagues in theCommittee also decided, in consulta-tion with government technical staff,to set up a cooperative cereal bank.This bank purchases and stores grainsafely after the harvest and givespoor families a place to buy grain atreasonable prices during pre-harvestseasons, when they cannot affordthe market price.In a short time, the cereal bankpaid for itself and even turned aprofit. \"With this money we're subsi-dizing other activities, such as thedistribution of peanut butter as acomplementary food for very youngchildren who are still breastfeeding,\"Zouera said. The Committee alsogives a small cash bonus to thewomen who supervise the regulargrowth monitoring of children. Themonitoring enables women to seefor themselves what is happeningwith their children, and they can use the information to analyse and acton problems in their own homesand community.Children's malnutrition rates inKwaren Tsabre have fallen by10 percentage points in a shorttime between 1995 and 1996. Andthis is only the beginning. Poor-quality and inaccessible healthservices are still a problem and animpediment to further gains againstmalnutrition.But the women of KwarenTsabre now know that they havethe tools and a process for ad-dressing even that difficult prob-lem with the help of their partners.Multiply the achievements ofKwaren Tsabre by the 326 villagesacross the Maradi Province ofNiger into which this programmehas spread, and one begins to seevictory emerging in the age-oldbattle against child malnutrition.

Community participation, in vary-ing degrees, was part of all Thaiprogrammes.There is general recognition thatmore needs to be done in Thailand,but these remarkable gains are a solidfoundation for the future.Protecting, promotingand supportingbreastfeedingVirtually all of the community-basedprogrammes that have resulted in re-ductions in malnutrition have focusedon improvements in infant feeding,especially the protection, promotionand support of breastfeeding.While community-based supportfor breastfeeding is a major achieve-ment, even the efforts of communitieswell aware of the central importanceof breastfeeding can be foiled bylarger economic and institutionalpressures.The advertis-ing manufacturersof breastmilk substitutesmostlyinfant formulahas been a in the fight to protect andpromote breastfeeding. While infantformula is an important product forthe minority of children who for some.447 .:4Keeping babies close to their mothers isfundamental in a baby-friendly hospital.A mother and child in Brazil 'room in'. 48reason are not, or cannot be, breast-fed, sales and promotional activitiesaround it have sometimes been basedon untrue claims of its value com-pared with that of breastmilk.Promotional activities, such asproviding free or subsidized suppliesof infant formula, bottles and teats inmaternity wards, have also under-mined the best intentions and the con-fidence of new mothers to breastfeed.In 1981, the World Health As-sembly, which consists of the healthministers of almost all countries, re-sponded vigorously to inappropriatepromotional efforts of the infant-foodindustry by adopting the InternationalCode of Marketing of BreastmilkSubstitutes, drafted by WHO, UNICEF,NGOs and representatives of the in-fant food industry.'The Code establishes minimumstandards to regulate marketing prac-tices by setting out the responsibilitiesof companies, health workers, gov-ernments and others and providesstandards for the labelling of breast-milk substitutes. Among its provi-sions are that health facilities mustnever be involved in the promotion ofbreastmilk substitutes and that freesamples should not be provided topregnant women or new mothers.Progress has been relatively slowin translating the Code's minimumprovisions into national laws. As ofSeptember 1997, only 17 countrieshad approved laws that put them intofull compliance with the Code. Train-ing and development of model legis-lation are now accelerating action inthis area. Support from the Govern-ment of Sweden has enabled UNICEFto provide greater technical assistanceon Code implementation and otherlegal aspects of breastfeeding support.A recent report, Cracking theCode, by the Interagency Group onBreastfeeding Monitoring, based inthe United Kingdom, highlights the5work that remains to be done. It docu-ments widespread violations Of theCode by multinational companies infour countries: Bangladesh, Poland,South Africa and Thailand.The Baby-FriendlyHospital InitiativeAs to community-based efforts to protect, promote andsupport breastfeeding and to promul-gate the Code, UNICEF and WHO in1991 began an intensive effort to trans-form practices in maternity hospitals.The Baby-Friendly Hospital Ini-tiative (BFHI), as the effort is called,brought a structured programme tobreastfeeding support and, in just sixyears, has helped transform over 12,700hospitals in 114 countries into centresof support for good infant feeding.These baby-friendly hospitals arehavens of protection for breastfeed-ing, where women and children arenot subject to advertising and promo-tional activities for infant formula orfeeding bottles, and where they canreceive effective and well-informedhelp for a sound start to breastfeeding.BFHI has a simple but thoroughapproach. Through a WHO-UNICEFtraining programme that has beentranslated into the official languagesof the United Nations and into manyothers, the professional staffs of ma-ternity hospitals are trained in lacta-tion management and support. Staffmembers, along with the directors ormanagers of their health facility, makea commitment to fulfil the initiative's`Ten steps to successful breastfeed-ing' (see sidebar). These include pledg-ing to ensure that women and new-borns can remain together all the timeand that women must be free to beginbreastfeeding promptly after birth andto continue exclusive breastfeedingon demand during their hospital stay.Step 10 calls for setting up breast-feeding support groups that new mothers can rely on. Hospitals can be awarded`baby-friendly' status only when spe-cially trained independent evaluatorshave ensured that all 10 steps are met.It is hard to overestimate the suc-cess of BFHI. More than a millionpeople are working to implement itsprogramme, and the overall pace ofhospital certifications has not slowed.Patterns of declining breastfeeding,particularly in urban have beenreversed in country after countryfollowing BFHI implementation(Panel 13).The success of the initiative canalso be measured in the health ofyoung children. In Panama, the Min-istry of Health reported a 58 per centreduction in respiratory infections anda 15 per cent decline in diarrhoea ininfants in just one year in a singlebaby-friendly facility, the AmadorGuerrero Hospital. In north-easternBrazil, Acari Hospital credits BFHIwith dramatic cost savings from de-creased hospitalization of infants andreduced case fatality among them. Inthe first two years of BFHI implemen-tation at the Central Hospital ofLibreville in Gabon, it was estimatedthat there was a 15 per cent reductionin cases of neonatal diarrhoea, a 14per cent reduction in dehydration andan 8 per cent reduction in mortality.LI Successes outside thedeveloping worldBFHI is not just for non-industrializedcountries.An evaluation in the Republic ofMoldova, once part of the formerSoviet Union near the Romanian bor-der, showed an average reduction inall neonatal infections in four baby-friendly hospitals from about 18 percent to 7.5 per cent in two years of theprogramme. The neonatal infectionrate in the hospital that had been certi-fied as baby-friendly the longestdropped from 23 per cent to 3.4 percent. Rates of breastfeeding initiationin the country rose appreciably, andrates of continued breastfeeding at 6and 12 months were significantlyhigher over the period of implementa-tion of the programme.Similar results are being reportedfrom Asia and Latin America, andsome countries are in the process ofconducting extensive evaluations ofBFHI's impact. In the United States,there is an active BFHI programme,and 11 hospitals have been declaredbaby-friendly.BFHI was conceived by a smallgroup of experts with vision and lead-ership and was tested, modified andthen introduced globally. But it couldnot have succeeded without the en-gagement of local institutions andcommunities. Local NGOs have playeda significant role in the promotion andsustenance of BFHI in many coun-tries. And an international NGO, theWorld Alliance for Breastfeeding Ac-tion (WABA), founded in 1991, hashelped solidify actions in support ofthe initiative and breastfeeding beyondthe hospital through its work in network-ing, information sharing and advocacy.National breastfeeding commit-tees, though often established prior toBFHI, were energized by the initia-tive's concrete achievements. Paedi-atric and obstetric professional asso-ciations have endorsed the programmeand have been educated by it.BFHI has also helped establishbreastfeeding firmly on the politicalagenda. The challenge for the futureis to use the political energy behindBFHI to ensure that breastfeedingpromotion and support extend beyondhospital walls and that breastfeedingsupport groups become a constant prior-ity for communities and governments.1:1 Complementing breastfeedingGood infant feeding includes not onlysupport for breastfeeding but also en-Spotlight TEN STEPS TOSUCCESSFULBREASTFEEDING Every facility providing maternity servicesand care for newborn infants should: 1.Have a written breastfeeding policythat is routinely communicated to allhealth care staff.2.Train all health care staff in skillsnecessary to implement this policy.3.Inform all pregnant women about thebenefits and management of breast-feeding.4.Help mothers initiate breastfeedingwithin a half-hour of birth.5.Show mothers how to breastfeedand how to maintain lactation evenif they should be separated fromtheir infants.6.Give newborn infants ordrink other than breastmilk, indicated. 7.Practise rooming-inallow moth-ers a 8.Encourage breastfeeding on demand.9.Give no or pacifiers(also or soothers) tobreastfeeding infants.10.Foster the establishment of breast-feeding support groups and refermothers to them on discharge fromthe hospital or clinic.In addition, facilities should refuse to ac-cept free and low-cost supplies of breast-milk substitutes, feeding bottles andteats. From Protecting, Promoting and SupportingBreastfeeding: The special role of maternity services:A Joint WHO/UNICEF Statement (WHO, 19891 andThe 19921 49 Panel 13BFHI: Breastfeeding breakthroughs Smiling at her infant in her arms,Elba Diaz awaits Juanito'ssix-month check-up at a pri-mary health care centre in southernSantiago. Her third child draws noth-ing but compliments from healthworkers, unlike Ms. Diaz's first twochildren, who were not so healthy.The difference is that Juanito bornat the Barros Luco Hospital, one of 19baby-friendly hospitals in Chile isthe only child she has been able tobreastfeed exclusively.\"Immediately after Juanito wasborn,\" recalls Ms. describehow blissful Iwas, feelinghiswarmth and looking at his flushedface so close to me. I began nursinghim at the breast while we were stillin the delivery room, and he was be-side me always, receiving only mybreastmilk.\"In Chile, breastfeeding supportand counselling for mothers have ledto enormous health benefits for tens 50of thousands of children like Juanitoin little more than a decade. In 1985,only 4 per cent of infants were exclu-sively breastfed for the first sixmonths of their lives. Remarkably,only a year after the Baby-FriendlyHospital Initiative (BFHI) was launchedin 1991, a study of 9,200 infants na-tionwide showed that the rate hadrisen to 25 per cent. And preliminaryresults of a national survey in 1996suggest that the exclusive breast-feeding rate for the first six months isnow about 40 per cent.What lies behind this transforma-tion? Training is an important part ofthe answer. With support from theNGO WellstartInternational andUNICEF, trainingmaterials wereadapted, and in just four health workers learned to helpwomen breastfeed effectively. Strongsupport from the Ministry of Healthwas another UNICEF pro-vided sustained advocacy. The wasexpanding primary health trained staff offer breastfeed-ing education and support. \"The staffacquainted me with breastfeedingduring my pregnancy,\" said onemother. \"The first week after deliv-ery, I joined a group session at theclinic to share my concerns withother breastfeeding mothers. I feelvery secure, having easy access toprofessional advice on any breast-feeding questions.\"These achievements in Chile havebeen replicated across the worldthrough BFHI and related efforts. InCuba, only about 63 per cent of new-borns were breastfed exclusively atthe time they left the hospital in 1990.Now, six years after BFHI was intro-duced, an estimated 98 per cent ofnewborns are exclusively breastfedwhen they leave the maternity ward.And morestrikingly,about 72per cent of those infants are exclu-sively breastfed through four monthsof age, up from 25 per cent in 1990.All 44 hospitals handling over 1,000deliveries a year and 42 per cent ofsmaller hospitals in the country arebaby-friendly.In1996, Cuba ex-tended the baby-friendly programmeto the community level by putting itinto practice at small communityhealth centres attended by familydoctors.On the other side of the globe,China had over 6,300 baby-friendlyhospitals at the end of 1996. Thanksto BFHI and some regulation of themarketing of breastmilk substitutes,48 per cent of infants in urban areasand 68 per cent in rural areas arenow exclusively breastfed for four months, a 1994 survey found. Justtwo years earlier, the rates were10 and 29 per cent respectively.Considering that about 20 millioninfants are born each year inChina, this represents a remark-able accomplishment.Iran, which began promotingbreastfeeding in the 1980s, hasheld training workshops for over30,000 health professionals eachyear between 1991 and 1996 afterBFHI was introduced. The nationalsupport has led to a leap in the ex-clusive breastfeeding rate from 10to 53 per cent in that period. Anadded windfall is the more than$50 million that the country savesannually, as infant formula im-ports dropped by 75 per cent from48 million tins in 1991 to 12 mil-lion in 1996.Because of the many benefitsofbreastfeedingsinceBFHIstarted, it is impossible to calcu-late the lives saved and thosemade betterthough they cer-tainly number in the millions. It isdifficult to imagine any other wayin which these results could havebeen achieved so effectively andin such a short time. Baby-friendlyhospitals have surely made theworld a friendlier place for babiesand their families. Photo: A woman breastfeeds her newbornat a hospital in China.

WHO and UNICEF re-cently brought together a group ofinternationally renowned scientistsand programme practitioners familiarwith these problems, and a consensusreport will soon be published that willoffer technical guidance for improv-ing complementary feeding.Targeting specificnutritional deficienciesIn assessing nutrition problems andimplementing programmes to attackthem, it is not possible to separateprotein-energy malnutrition from vit-amin and mineral deficiencies. Inte-grated community-based programmesthat have achieved reductions in over-all malnutrition have usually done soby addressing both micronutrient andprotein-energy deficiencies. But amongthe kinds of malnutrition identified atthe 1990 World Summit for Children,progress has been more rapid in re-ducing some deficiencies than others.Grains of salt: Reducingiodine deficiency disordersThe reduction in iodine deficiency,the world's leading cause of prevent-able mental retardation, is a global .3174J 3The reduction in iodinedeficiency, the world'sleading cause of preventablemental retardation, is aglobal success story byany standard. 51 Panel 14Tackling malnutrition in Bangladesh Anew project in Bangladeshis helping to reduce malnu-trition among children andmothers by improving caring prac-tices,supportingbreastfeedingand empowering women and theircommunities.Some 56 per cent of Bangladeshichildren under five suffer from mod-erate and severe malnutrition, 21per cent of whom are severely under-weight, and studies show that morethan 70 per cent of pregnant andbreastfeeding women are also mal-nourished. Protein-energy malnutri-tion is the main problem but, as oftenhappens, it occurs together with suchconditions as iron deficiency anaemiaand vitamin A deficiency. In Bangla-desh, lack of food is not the maincause of malnutrition; the lack ofproper caring practices for childrenand pregnant women is an importantcontributing factor.Recognizing that malnutrition ishindering national development, the 52Government has formulated a Na-tional Nutrition Policy and launcheda nationwide nutrition interventionprogramme, the Bangladesh Inte-grated Nutrition Project. The initia-tive aims to address malnutritiondirectly and help promote fastersocio-economic development.Community nutrition promotersare the backbone of the project.Earning about $12 a month, they aretrained for two months, includingone month on the job. They learnhow to understand the causes andsigns of malnutrition and techniquesfor its treatment and prevention.They canvass their communities,persuading mothers to bring theirchildren to the Community NutritionCentres for monthly weighing andgrowth monitoring, and explainingthe importance of child care, includ-ing children's needs for exclusivebreastfeeding in the first six months;the need for smaller, more frequentand nutritious meals up to age three;.54and for extra feeding during and afterillnesses to prevent malnutrition.Marium Begum, one of the nutri-tion promoters, has already startedto achieve results in her village.During growth monitoring sessionsat her Community Nutrition Centre,situated in one of the homes in hervillage, Ms. Begum could see thatShewli, a one-year-old girl, was suf-fering from severe malnutrition. Ms.Begum explained to Shewli's mother,Shamsun, how to give her daughtera special locally made diet supple-ment. She also helped Shamsun tounderstand that she had been unableto breastfeed because she had notbeen eating enough herself. Fol-lowing local tradition, Shamsun wasaccustomed to eating last, after serv-ing food to her family, and there wasoftenlittle food left. Ms. Begumexplained how to re-lactate that is,to lactationafterithasstopped for ar-ranged for counselling atthe Community Nutrition Centre.Improving the nutrition of adoles-cent girls and pregnant and lactatingwomen is another priority of the pro-ject. The nutrition promoters urgewomen to use iodized salt in theirhouseholds to prevent iodine defi-ciency disorders, and to use oral re-hydration therapy when a child hasdiarrhoea to prevent dehydration.They discuss the use of vitamin Aand iron supplementation.Special diet supplements are pro-vided to malnourished women andchildren. Village Women's Groups,comprising up to 11 volunteers ineach community, buy ingredients forthe supplementa carefully weighedmixture of rice, lentils, molasses andoilat local markets to prepare andpackage them. Each member of thegroup earns about $10 per month through the sale of packets to thenutrition centres.The Ministry of Health andFamily Welfare, with the assis-tance of the Bangladesh RuralAdvancement Committee (BRAG,has established nearly 1,000 Com-munity Nutrition Centres in peo-ple's homes, each operating sixdays a week. The centres cover65,000 children and 16,000 preg-nant and lactating women. By theyear 2001, the goal is to have8,000 community nutrition pro-moters reaching 100,000 pregnantor lactating women and 500,000children under the age of two.In the case of Shamsun, herdiet has improved with the guid-anceandencouragementofMarium Begum.

Thisachievement, which began to showsignificant results beginning in 1992,involved a coordinated internationaleffort to change diets in a subtle butimportant wayan approach thathas had an impact on probably morepeople worldwide than any previousnutrition initiative.A diet deficient in iodine exerts itssaddest and most significant effect onthe developing embryo, starting ataround 12 weeks after conception. In-adequate iodine results in insufficientthyroid hormone, which in turn leadsto a failure of normal growth of thebrain and nervous system. The resultis all too often a child born with a life-time disability.The practice of using iodized saltas a safe, cheap and effective way tocombat iodine deficiency disorders(IDD) had a long track record by1992. It was introduced in Switzer-land in 1922, in the United States in1924, and in the Andean countries ofSouth America in the 1950s and 1960s.Among the goals adopted at theWorld Summit for Children, the vir-tual elimination of IDD was regardedby UNICEF as one of the most ac-hievable. Universal salt iodizationall salt destined for both human andanimal consumptionwas the ob-vious strategy to advance the attackon IDD.Getting the job done, a continuingeffort, is a process that uses the 'tripleA' approachassessment, analysisand actionon a global scale.In some countries, the ofiodine deficiency was known, but rig-orous assessmentsusing such indi-cators as goitre prevalence and urinaryiodine excretionwere needed toconvince policy makers and salt pro-ducers of the need for action. The nextstep was to analyse these results,along with the workings of com-mercial salt networks and the organi-55Rapid gains in salt iodization worldwidedemonstrate the effectiveness of public- andprivate-sector cooperation in combatingnutritional deficiencies. In Bolivia, a manseals a packet of iodized salt. 53 UNICEF estimates thatnearly 60 per cent of alledible salt in the world isnow iodized, and amongcountries in the world withrecognized IDD problems,all but seven have passedappropriate legislation toensure universal iodization. 54zation of the salt industry. Using ad-vocacy and attention to legal detail, itwas also necessary to pass appropri-ate legislation to ensure correct levelsof salt iodization, and to protect io-dized salt producers by eliminatingnon-iodized salt from the market.Actually getting iodine into saltsupplies was another matter. The taskwas addressed in ways that rangedfrom relatively easy adaptations byresource-rich major industrial saltproducers that supply whole countries,to providing support for small producersto enable them to iodize salt without lossof income. Quality control and evalu-ation of the impact of salt iodizationremain continuing challenges. Thanksto support from many quarters, all ofthese steps have been realized in ashort time in an extraordinary numberof countries. UNICEF estimates thatnearly 60 per cent of all edible salt inthe world is now iodized, and amongcountries in the world with recog-nized IDD problems, all but sevenhave passed appropriate legislation toensure universal iodization.Of the countries that had IDDproblems in 1990, 26 now iodize over90 per cent of their edible salt or im-port that proportion if they are not saltproducers. Another14countriesiodize between 75 per cent and 90 percent of their salt. As late as 1994, 48countries with established IDD prob-lems had no programmes at all. Ofthese, 14 now iodize more than halftheir salt (Fig. 9).At the level of children and theirfamilies, these results, though still in-complete, are improving lives by thethousands. It is estimated that up until1990, about 40 million children wereborn each year at some risk of mentalimpairment due to iodine deficiencyin their mothers' diets. By 1997, thatfigure was probably closer to 28 mil-lion'still too many, but represent-ing a clear and rapid decrease.56The number of children born eachyear with cretinism is difficult to esti-mate, but in 1990 it was on the orderof 120,000. It is probably about halfthat now.It is impossible to measure the im-pact of IDD on miscarriages, whichare rarely well reported in health sta-tistics, but the improvements are surelynoticeable by affected women and theirfamilies. In highly iodine-deficientareas, infant mortality was long knownto be elevated, but recent research nowindicates that increasing the iodine in-take of young infants to adequate levelsmay improve their survival to a fargreater degree than previously ex-pected, probably through improve-ments in their immune systems.The gains in salt iodization cameabout largely because of the work ofan alliance of responsive and knowl-edgeable partners. WHO, in collabo-ration with UNICEF and the Inter-national Council for the Control ofIodine Deficiency Disorders (ICCIDD),not only helped raise awareness of theimportance of IDD but also worked toensure scientific consensus and infor-mation on standards for: levels of saltiodization, the safety of iodized salt inpregnancy, and indicators for moni-toring and evaluation. UNICEF, WHOand ICCIDD also provided technicaland financial support for many stepsof the process.Kiwanis International, a global ser-vice organization, provides fundingsupport and continues to educate itsgrass-roots membership about IDD(Panel 15).The Government of Canada was amajor player in all stages of this work,supporting UNICEF programmes inmany countries and supporting theOttawa-based Micronutrient Initia-tive, which in turn has extended tech-nical support and funding to fieldprogrammes, including the develop-ment of monitoring guidelines. In Fig. 9Iodine deficiency disorders and salt iodizationIodine deficiency disorders (IDD) were still a major public health problem in many parts of the world in 1990.

The 73-year-oldRev. Wildman, a veteran Kiwanisleader, is determined to expand theirnotion of neighbourhood to includethe global village.He has added his preacher's voiceto the Kiwanians' first internationalservice project: the campaign to wipeout one of the world's most devastat-ing nutritional problemsiodinedeficiency disorders (IDD). Kiwanis 56leaders have brought to this globaleffort the fund-raising muscle of their600,000 members in 83 countries.An estimated 28 million babiesare born each year at risk of mentalimpairment due to insufficient iodinein their mothers' diets. Hundreds ofthousands of children and adults suf-fer the debilitating effect ofiodine deficiency: a condition knownas cretinism.Rev. Wildman's challenge has beento make club members in his areacare about villagers in remote regionsof Africa, Asia and Latin America. Inmany developing countries, lack ofiodine has taken a horrendous toll onchildrenfrom physical deformitiesto mental retardation. Iodization oftable salta method of fortificationnow taken for granted in industrial-ized nations and costing less than 5cents per person per year can ridthe world of this tragedy.Before he speaks, Rev. Wildmanplaces on the podium a poster-sizedcopy of a cherished photo of a tiny58boy named Abdul Alimwhom hemet in a 1994 visit to a village inBangladesh. Abdul is an eight-year-old in a four-year-old's deformed andmalfunctioning body. He is pro-foundly mentally retarded and deafand is held by a young man from thevillage because he cannot walk.Rev. Wildman describes Abdul'sdisabilities and the severe hardshipshis care places on a village economy.The picture of this small child bridgesgeographical and cultural divides, andsoon his audiences are ready to climbon the IDD campaign bandwagon.When Kiwanis International join-ed the campaign against IDD in 1994,they pledged to raise $75 million byJuly 1998. Since then, they have be-come a key part of the campaign,with over $20 millionraised orpledged so far for programmes inover 50 countries through Kiwanians'efforts. UNICEF estimates that thiscontribution has saved around 3 mil-lion children from irreversible mentalretardation.Kiwanis leaders like Rev. Wildmanhave been shrinking the distance be-tween their home towns and placeslike Abdul Alim's tiny village in Bang-ladesh, and the concept of thinkingglobally while acting locally is takinghold in creative ways around theworld.The Kiwanis Club of Ried imInnkreis in Austria staged a perfor-mance of the Chinese Dance andAcrobats Ensemble, for example,raising $9,000 for the IDD campaign.Kiwanians in Atikokan in Ontario(Canada) brought in the Jolly Ukran-ians, a folk group, netting the cam-paign $2,000. Kiwanis Clubs in thePhilippines are supporting the cam-paign in their own country, whereiodine deficiency is still a threat,through community education pro- jectsand thedistributionofiodized salt.Kiwanians in the Netherlandshave pledged to raise $600,000through the sale of salt pots and aphoto essay book. HongKongKiwanians took in $10,000 for thecampaign by obtaining sponsor-ships for completing a rugged 60-mile hike. The Kiwanis Club ofBergerac (France) donated pro-ceeds from a masked ball, whileKiwanians in Christchurch (NewZealand) raised $1,300 with abowling tournament. The KiwanisClub of Spanish Town (Jamaica)convinced a local salt factory toiodize salt, sponsored IDD educa-tion events and set up an IDDprevention billboard on a majorhighway.The 95-member Kiwanis chap-terinRockford,Illinois,Rev.Wildman's home town, has man-aged to more than double its orig-inal goal of $30,000 through fund-raising efforts large and small.When Kathleen Sullivan was re-cently installed as the chapter'snew president at a dinnerban-quet, instead of buying expensiveflower arrangements for eachtable, Ms. Sullivan decided onhome-madecentrepiecesan-chored with boxes of salt. \"Themoney saved went to the IDDcampaign,\" says Ms. Sullivan,\"and when I was making thesecentrepieces with my daughters, Iexplained what IDD was doing tochildren just like them. I like to be-lieve they have a better view of theworld because of the campaign.\" Photo: Checking for signs of iodinedeficiency, a nurse examines the thyroidgland of a woman at a UNICEF-assistedhealth centre in Myanmar.1995, UNICEF estimated that over 7million children were born free of themental impairments ofIDDlargelybecause of the Canadian contribution.Partly because of Canada's earlyand unambiguous support to combat-ingIDD,other donors and govern-ments in affected countries were drawninto the battle. The approximately $20million invested by the Governmentof Canada catalysed other investors.Total investment by public- and private-sector partners in this effort since1986 is now estimated to exceed$1 billion.'In country after country, advocacyfor salt iodization legislation has broughttogether teachers, consumer groups,women's groups and health profes-sionals. Primary schoolchildren bythe millions are armed with test kitsthat enable them to check whether thesalt in their homes is iodized andto get a valuable chemistry lesson inthe process. In Indonesia, for exam-ple, the enormous challenge of saltiodization in a country of almost 14thousand islands, with highly decen-tralized salt production, is being over-come by a coalition that includesmillions of the country's schoolchild-ren and teachers.The elimination of IDD as a publichealth problem is, of course, not com-plete, and momentum must not belost. But the effort has already had re-sults beyond these tangible benefits inthe lives of individuals.The fight against IDD has broughtto the attention of policy makers andcommunities the importance of goodnutrition in ensuring the physical andmental development of children andpopulations. It has opened the door toaccelerated work on other nutrient de-ficiencies with public health signifi-cance. It has demonstrated the valueof public- and private-sector partner-ships in pursuit of a well-defined goalin favour of children.r-J0- A drop of testing solution added to a pinchof salt indicates whether iodine is present. 57 At a day-care centre in Viet Nam, babies eatvitamin A-rich vegetables grown in communitygardens. 58The success of the drive for univer-sal iodization of salt shows that thediets of children, women and familiesworldwide can be changed in smallbut very beneficial ways in just a fewyears as a result of concerted global,national and local action. It is impera-tive that this experience be built uponin attacking some of the other nutri-tional deficiencies that can begin im-pairing the development of a childeven before birth.Capitalizing onvitamin A's benefitsAlthough the value of vitamin A forprotecting children against blindnesshas been known for decades, vitaminA's amazing ability to strengthen re-sistance to infection and reduce thechances of children dying has only re-cently won general acceptance by thescientific and medical establishment.Following a dramatic report fromIndonesia in 1986 of a 34 per cent re-duction in pre-school child mortalitywith vitamin A,5 seven additionallarge studies were carried out over thenext seven years. Most of these studies,involving more than 160,000 Africanand Asian children, reported large andsignificant reductions in mortalitywhen children were given additionalvitamin A through supplements orfortified food products. When theseresults were combined statistically in1993, it was firmly established thatvitamin A supplementation couldreduce child mortality by about 23per cent where there is a risk of defi-ciency.' These conclusions, strength-ened further by evidence that thevitamin has an even greater life-saving effect on children with measles,brought widespread acceptance thatmeasures to prevent vitamin A defi-ciency could have an enormous im-pact on child survival.Adequate vitamin A status doeslittle to prevent children from being60infected but has a major effect on re-ducing the severity of illness, espe-cially persistent diarrhoea, dysentery,measles and malaria (Panel 18). Vita-min A's power to reduce the severityof illness was clearly evident inGhana, where periodic distribution ofthe vitamin led to a reduction in localclinic attendance by 12 per cent andhospital admissions by 38 per cent.'Vitamin A can thus have a double-barrelled effect: It not only reducesthe severity of illness and saves livesbut also may ease the demand onoften overworked health workers andfacilities.The effect of the discovery of vita-min A as a child survival tool led torenewed global interest in updatingknowledge about the extent and pub-lic health significance of vitamin Aand other micronutrient deficiencies.Numerous surveys of clinical and sub-clinical vitamin A deficiency have ledto an estimate that in 1990 there wereover 100 million young children inthe world at risk from the deficiencybecause of inadequate diets, althoughtoday the immediate risk for many ofthese children has been diminished byeffective interventions, including reg-ular vitamin A supplements.Some countries still lack good as-sessments, but vitamin A deficiency,its underlying causes and its conse-quences for health and survival are muchbetter understood now than ever before.The age-old condition of maternalnight-blindness has finally come to berecognized as a major public healthproblem. Long ignored by both af-flicted women and the medical estab-lishment, maternal night-Blindness isnow recognized to be widespread,with an estimated 1 million to 2 mil-lion pregnant women affected at anygiven time in South Asia alone.Women describe how they are able tosee adequately during the day butafter sunset are unable to move about and carry out their household chores.They consider it a common problemof pregnancy that goes away once thechild is born. But recent work inNepal shows that women with night-blindness during pregnancy are sixtimes more likely to have been nightblind in a previous pregnancy' andthat the condition is a marker for aconstellation of risk factors, includingdietary vitamin A inadequacy and de-ficiency; iron deficiency anaemia;protein-energy malnutrition; increasedmorbidity during pregnancy; andmortality (Panel 1).Combining a varietyof approachesSeveral approaches exist to preventvitamin A deficiency, each with itsown strengths and limitations, butwhich can be highly effective if ap-plied in complementary ways. Theseinclude vitamin A supplements (com-monly administered in capsule form),fortification of food and gardening orother methods to improve diets.Vitamin A can be boosted throughhomestead gardening or adapting foodpreservation or preparation methodsthat can enhance retention. And forti-fying food with vitamin A has becomeincreasingly feasible as fortifiable foodspenetrate the markets of the poor in anumber of countries. These food-basedapproaches combine increased vita-min A supply with nutrition educationthat promotes the consumption ofvitamin A-rich foods by young women.Periodic supplementation that pro-vides high-dose vitamin A capsulesboth to children from 6 months to5 years and beyond, and to mothers assoon after childbirth as possiblehas proved to be a very valuable inter-vention, offering immediate help tochildren who are at risk of vitamin Adeficiency in situations where food-based options are limited. Expertsestimate that periodic high-dosesupplements for young children havethe potential of eliminating 90 percent of blindness and other ocularconsequences of vitamin A defi-ciency and about 23 per cent of mor-tality in early childhood wherever thedeficiency is common.Successes insupplementationIt is a major global achievement thatby mid-1997, some 30 years after thefirst vitamin A supplementation pro-grammes began in India, the policy ofproviding children with periodic high-dose supplements has been adopted inall but 3 of the 38 countries whereclinical vitamin A deficiency still ex-isted, and in all but 13 of the addi-tional 40 countries with documentedsubclinical deficiency.At least 35 countries also routinelyprovide vitamin A supplements withimmunizations during 'national im-munization days'. And many coun-tries link vitamin A supplementationto regular immunization activities orto periodic deworming of children, asin India and Mauritania.Overall, UNICEF estimates thatmore than half of all young childrenin countries where vitamin A defi-ciency is known to be common re-ceived high-dose vitamin A capsulesin 1996, compared to about one thirdin 1994 (Fig. 10). This includes suchlarge countries as Bangladesh, India,Nigeria and Viet Nam. Between 1993and 1996, UNICEF purchased nearlya half-billion high-dose vitamin Acapsules that were distributed in 136countries, helping to bring or keepvitamin A deficiency under control.At roughly 2 cents per capsule andperhaps 20 to 25 cents per delivereddose, few other child health or nu-tritioninterventionsareascost-61Fig. 10 Progress in vitamin Asupplementation programmes In the 78 countries where vitamin A deficiency is arecognized public health problem, supplementationprogrammes are on the rise. 01020304050607078Number of countriesCountries where policies to supplementpost-partum mothers are in place iteE911996 01020304050607078Number of countriesCountries where young children routinelyreceive vitamin A supplements et--1,16111.1. 0102030405060Number of countriesCountries where more 500/0 vitamin Source: UNICEF/MI/Tulane University, 'Progress in A deficiency 59 Iron deficiency anaemia isprobably the most prevalentnutritional problem in theworld...and progress inreducing its prevalence andimpact has been slower thanmight be hoped. 60effective in reducing mortality anddisability throughout life as vitamin Asupplements.Breastmilk nearly always providesenough vitamin A to protect a childfrom severe deficiency, even if thismeans that the child's mother becomesdeficient. However, both mothers andinfants can be protected against defi-ciency if mothers receive a high doseof vitamin A soon after they give birth.Some 50 countries have adopted apolicy of routine high-dose supple-ments for women soon after child-birth, which protects their children forabout six months. New informationon the impact of vitamin A deficiencyon women's health makes post-partumsupplementation an even greater pri-ority (Panel 1).j Sugar fortification:A sweet successSeveral countries have chosen anotherroute to improved vitamin A status oftheir populations: fortifying the sugarsupply.Guatemala has led the developingworld in fortifying sugar with vitaminA since the mid-1970s. Despite nearlya decade of civil disturbance and alapse in fortification for several yearsin the early 1980s, an evaluation of 82villages in 1990 concluded that sugarfortification had brought vitamin Adeficiency under control among Gua-temalan children.Sugar is also being fortified inparts of Bolivia, Brazil, El Salvador,Honduras and the Philippines, andZambia is planning to begin fortifica-tion in 1998, with other countrieslikely to follow or to find other staplefoods to fortify with vitamin A. ThePhilippines, for example, has success-fully tested and fortified a local, non-refrigerated margarine with vitamin Aand is testing the impact of fortifyingthe wheat flour used in its nationalbread, pan de sal.6 2The success of fortification de-pends on a number of factors: Thoseat risk of the deficiency must con-sume the fortified food regularly andin great enough quantities to make adifference, the fortification must notalter the palatability of the product forconsumers and it must not put the prod-uct out of their financial reach. If theseconditions are met, this can be a veryeffective approach, as the Guatemalanexperience has shown. Supplementationmay be an important complementarystrategy for fortification if fortified foodsdo not reach all affected individuals.Countries also need to ensure thatsugar fortification programmes do notpromote increased consumption ofsugar but are aimed at informing con-sumers that whatever sugar they doconsume should be fortified.j Improving diets toboost vitamin AIn many countries, vegetable garden-ing around the home and food preser-vation and preparation methods thatenhance the vitamin content of thediet have been promoted as a meansof improving vitamin A intake. InWest Africa and Haiti, for instance,drying of mangoes has extendedaccess to this important vitamin Asource beyond the months of themango season.In Bangladesh, home gardens offruits and vegetables have been adoptedby families of low socio-economicstatus in one fifth of the country in re-cent years, the result of systematic in-troduction of village nurseries, theavailability of low-cost seeds, and re-liable extension services. This workhas been supported by the NGOHelen Keller International. Initialevaluations suggest that this pro-gramme has curbed the incidence ofnight-blindness, especially in familiesthat grow and consume a variety ofvegetables. This is one of relatively few such projects where careful eval-uations have made it possible toassess the impact of activities onvitamin A status.There is evidence that eating a va-riety of foods rich in carotene theprecursor form of vitamin A found infruits and vegetablescoupled withsome vitamin A from animal sourcescan alleviate moderate to severe vitaminA deficiency in children and women.The absence of more evidence thatgardening projects improve vitamin Astatus may be because of the low avail-ability of some carotenoids in plantfoods for the body, the lack of com-plementary fats and animal foods inthe diet, or inadequate evaluationmethods. In addition, it is not clearwhich vegetables or fruits are most ef-fective in improving vitamin A status.This question is an important researchchallenge.Promoting increased consumptionof vitamin A through animal foodsmay be possible in some countries. Arecent project in Central Java (Indo-nesia), supported by Helen KellerInternational, the Micronutrient Ini-tiative and UNICEF, promoted theconsumption of eggs, which are af-fordable, to reduce vitamin A defi-ciency. As a result, egg consumptionincreased and vitamin A status im-proved significantly among youngchildren in this project (Panel 16).Helen Keller International also suc-cessfully promoted increased con-sumption of vitamin A-rich liver bychildren in Niger, where animal prod-ucts are relatively accessible in someregions.Responding to anaemiaIron deficiency anaemia is probablythe most prevalent nutritional problemin the world. Over half the women indeveloping countries and a large per-centage of young children suffer fromit,9 and progress in reducing its preva-lence and impact has been slower thanmight be hoped. As with vitamin A,several approaches have been pursued.The consequences of anaemia forpregnant women and their newbornchildren are often disastrous. The con-dition puts women at higher risk ofdeath because of the greater likeli-hood of haemorrhage in childbirthand other factors, and their newbornsface a high risk of poor growth anddevelopment. Many countries haveadopted policies to ensure that womenwho seek prenatal care have access todaily iron supplements to help themmeet the very high needs of preg-nancy and childbirth. UNICEF is amajor supplier of iron/folate tablets.A total of 2.7 billion were provided to122 countries from 1993 to 1996.However, since many pregnantwomen enterpregnancyalreadyanaemicand it is difficult to re-solve pre-existing anaemia duringpregnancymore attention is beingpaid in some countries to improvingthe iron and folate status of girls andyoung women before their first preg-nancy. There is evidence from small-scale trials that in cases where it isdifficult to reach young women withdaily iron/folate supplements, ensur-ing weekly or twice-weekly supple-mentation inbuilding stores.'\u00b0 supplementation over severalmonths resolved the anaemia in over80 per cent of adolescent girls in acommunity where anaemia was highlyprevalent. Similar results have beenreported from other countries.Fortification of foods with ironis also an effective means of address-ing anaemia. Wheat flour and flourproducts are the most common vehi-cles for iron fortification in placeswhere they are widely consumed andcentrally processed, particularly inLatin America and the Middle East(Panel 17).6CAP\"'\"ki-Jr Vitamin A supplementation reduces theseverity of illness and the risk of death inchildren in areas where the vitamin isdeficient, resulting in dramatic increases inchild survival. In Mali, a girl holds a mango,a good source of vitamin A. 61 Panel 16Indonesia makes strides againstvitamin A deficiency A One of the greatand stillevolvingnutritional suc-cess stories is the progressmade by Indonesia towards eliminat-ing vitamin A deficiency. Two decadesago, in this nation of islands with apopulation of 200 million the fourthhighest in the worldthe problemwas serious. High levels of vitamin Adeficiency, which can cause blind-ness and damage the immune sys-tem, greatly increasing the risk ofillness and death, affected more than2 million Indonesians.The Government, in cooperationwith UNICEF and other internationalpartners, tackled the problem throughthe distribution of high-dose vitaminA capsules to children ages one tofive, reducing deficiency levels dra-matically. The rate of severe vitaminA deficiency has declined by morethan 75 per cent, according to a na-tional survey in 1993, sparing theeyes, health and lives of millions ofchildren. Blindness among children 62due to vitamin A deficiency was elim-inated in 1994.Indonesia has not fully solved thevitamin A problem, however. Severedeficiency remains a problem in threeprovinces, and the survey also foundthat approximately half of all childrenunder five had inadequate levels ofvitamin A. Studies among school-children and breastfeeding womenin West Java have shown mild andmoderate deficiency to be prevalent.In response, the Indonesian Gov-ernment has set the goal of eliminat-ing vitamin A deficiency by the year2000, using four strategies. The firstis continued distribution of vitamin Acapsules to children ages one to fivethrough posyandu (community healthposts), an effort which reached 60-70per cent of children in this age groupin 1993-1994. The second strategy isdistribution of high-potency vitaminA capsules to mothers after they givebirth, which will require special ef-forts, as only 35 per cent of births64occur under medical supervision.The other strategies are food fortifi-cation with vitamins and minerals,including vitamin A (which is alreadyunder way by noodle manufacturers),and promotion of increased con-sumption of foods rich in the vitamin.In support of this effort, the Gov-ernment, with assistance from HelenKeller International, the Micronu-trient Initiative and UNICEF, haslaunched the Central Java Project toimprove vitamin A intake amongchildren in this region in the first twoyears of life.The project undertook three majorefforts beginning in 1996, with theIndonesian system of posyandu andits cadre of midwives and birth atten-dants at the centre. First, a supple-mentation programme was launchedto give one high-potency vitamin Acapsule to all new mothers duringthe first month after delivery, alongwith two doses of deworming pills,to improve their health and nutrition.Ensuring mothers' adequate intakeof vitamin A also ensures that babiesreceive the amount they need throughbreastfeeding.In the first six months of the pro-ject, nearly 20 per cent of new mothersin Central Java received vitamin Acapsules, almost double the rate inthe previous two years. The goal ofthe project is to reach at least 80 percent coverage.A second element of the project isa large-scale social marketing cam-paign to promote consumption offoods rich in vitamin A, focusing oneggs and dark green leafy vegeta-bles. Research found, for example,that while a number of vitamin A-richfoodssuch as eggs, liver, spinach,cassava leaves and papaya areavailable year-round, few mothers orcommunity leaders recognized these as good sources of vitamin A.Therefore a series of radio andtelevision spots, posters, banners,advertising and one-on-one coun-selling methods were developedto publicize the benefits forpregnant and breastfeeding womenand for children between the agesof 6 and 24 months in particularof eating eggs and vitamin A-richfoods.Third, a nutritional surveillancesystem was instituted to provideinformation on nutritional status,food consumption patterns andupdates on the effectiveness ofthe project.Thus far, the project clearly hasimproved the understanding ofnutrition and diet patterns in Cen-tral Java. Within three months ofthe start of the social marketingcampaign, egg consumption byboth children and mothers hadincreased, correlated with highervitamin A levels.Vitamin A capsules will con-tinue be an important measurebecause people's diets are still notsufficiently high in the vitamin.But the project has demonstratedthat enriching diets through eggs,an available and rich source of vit-amin A, is an important and sus-tainable step towards ensuringthat mothers and children receivethe vitamin A that they need tohelp them live and grow.

A 1996 evalua-tion showed large reductions in theprevalence of anaemia in children andadolescents following the fortifica-tion, even though during this periodthe country was suffering from a gen-eral economic decline.\"At a meeting in 1996, countries ofthe Middle East and North Africamade a joint commitment to fortify-ing wheat flour with iron as a princi-pal strategy for anaemia reduction inthe region, where wheat is a staple.Anaemia is made worse by someillnesses, particularly hookworm in-fection. Malaria is also a major causeof anaemia, although this is not di-rectly related to iron losses. In severalcountries, deworming of schoolchil-dren has been shown to reduce theprevalence and severity of anaemia.'2Preventing malaria and improving itscurative treatment, which are priori-ties of UNICEF and WHO for 1998and beyond, will undoubtedly go along way to reducing anaemia in chil-dren and adults alike.Improving basic healthservicesThe nutritional well-being of childrenaround the world has benefited greatlyfrom the enormous achievementssince 1990 in improving children'saccess to basic health services, bothcurative and preventive.The success of child immunizationprogrammes has been a major boostto child health. Immunization alsoprotects vitamin A levels, which plum-met during acute measles infections.So, the spectacular achievement ofover 90 per cent immunization cover-age in 89 countries and over 80 per centin another 40 countries by 1996including a 79 per cent global measlesimmunization rate\"means that formillions of children, vitamin A levels65The nutritional well-beingof children around the worldhas benefited greatly fromthe enormous achievementssince 1990 in improvingchildren's access to basichealth services, bothcurative and preventive. 63 Panel 17Making food enrichment programmes sustainable Fortification of food staples withiron, vitamin A, iodine and othermicronutrients is the most cost-effective, sustainable option for elim-inating micronutrient deficiencies.Salt iodization, reaching an additional1.5billion consumers worldwidesince 1990 and sparing millions ofbabies from mental retardation eachyear, is testimony to how successfulfortification programmes can be.But as positive as the end resultsare, fortification is a complex under-taking that requires government andindustry to commit to working to-gether as partners. Recent experienceshows that fortification succeeds whenproducers are involved from the startin formulating regulations and inresolving the marketing and techni-cal issues that can make or break aprogramme.It's the law: Effective legislation isa basic requirement, helping to setgoals and define roles of food pro-ducers, the health and nutrition au-thorities and scientific institutions.Without such a framework, a pro-gramme is more vulnerable to weakimplementation, uneven results and 64possible failure. That was the experi-ence of South Africa, where a maize-enrichment programme launched in1983 without compulsory legislationwas pronounced a failure after 10years. Efforts are now being made toreview the programme, with a focuson legislation and the role of the foodindustry.Even then, legislation must be en-forced and supported by policies.Guatemala passed a law in 1975mandating that sugar be fortifiedwith vitamin A. Not only was the lawunenforced but the programme alsoquickly fell apart for lack of the for-eign exchange needed to purchasethe vitamin and because producerswere not convinced of the pro-gramme's effectiveness. A decadepassed before fortification was re-sumed, after the Institute of Nutritionof Central America and Panama(INCAP) and UNICEF worked withproducers to explain the importanceof fortification, provided technicalassistance and helped them obtainvitamin A at below-market prices orthrough donation. Guatemala's Min-istry of Health now enforces the law:66Producers whose sugar shows lowlevels of vitamin A in random testsare first warned and then are eitherfined or shut down.Pricing and marketing: Start-upcosts of equipment and training canbe high, but these are primarily one-off. Costs of the fortificant, labourand equipment maintenance are re-current. Fortifiers' competitive posi-tion in the market place can befurther eroded by price controls ortaxation, and governments can playa helpful role in these areas. WhenBrazil's Government removed pricecontrols and reduced a value-addedtax on milk, for example, dairy pro-duction received a boost and fortifi-cation of milk became more attrac-tive to producers.Laws can eliminate the price ad-vantage enjoyed by non-fortifiedproducts. In1997, Oman bannedlocal production and importation ofwhite wheat flour not fortified withiron and folate, and Bolivia mandatedthat all wheatlocal, imported ordonatedbe fortified with iron, folicacid and vitamin B complex.Yet government intervention doesnot always succeed in lowering coststo workable levels. In Indonesia, ef-forts to fortify monosodium gluta-mate (MSG) with vitamin A wereunsuccessful because technical prob-lems of maintaining vitamin stabilityand colour consistency were toocostly to solve. In the Philippines, itwas so expensive to develop fortifiedmargarine that only one multina-tional corporation carried throughwith it.Questions of quality: Fortificationcan have commercial consequences,since any change in the way a prod-uct tastes, looks or smells can hurtsales and market share. For example,when Venezuela in the late 1980s de- cided to fortify maize flour withferrous fumarate (iron), in producttests the flour turned from its fa-miliar white to grey. Sensing thatconsumers would not buy theproduct, producers baulked. Thesituation was resolved in 1992,when the National Institute ofNutrition allowed producers tofortify with a blend of iron compo-nents that did not change thecolour of the flour.Follow-up: Itis vital to keeptabs on the process to ensure thatfortified products maintain po-tency standards and reach con-sumers. Chile began fortifyingwheat flour with iron in the early1950s, but it was not until 1967that a system for monitoring andquality control was established,and only in 1975, when a nationalsurvey revealed the iron status ofthe population, that thepro-gramme's efficacy from that pointon could begin to be evaluated.Commitment and coordina-tion: \"Authorities must be con-vinced of the need to makefortification compulsory. And toeliminate any possible resistance,producers must be convinced offortification's benefits,\" says JorgeDavid, head of the Latin AmericanMillers Association (ALIM).In 1996, Bolivia became thefirst country certified to have vir-tuallyeliminatediodinedefi-ciency as a public health problem.The phenomenal success stemsfrom legislation that expressed apublic policy decision to iodizeand 13 years of coordinated workby salt producers, the Govern-ment and international coopera-tion agencies. Photo: In Ghana, workers gather salt tobe taken to a processing plant for iodization.undisturbed by measles episodes willcontinue to help protect them fromillness.Programmes to improve hygieneand sanitation are also likely to be ofcrucial importance almost everywherethere is malnutrition in impoverishedcommunities. Improved water sup-plies or support to food productionmay also be very critical, dependingon local circumstances. Analyses inseveral countries have found that thestrongest predicting factors for mal-nutrition are lack of safe water, inade-quate sanitation and high fertility rates.Each year over 1million morechildren are saved from death throughthe use of oral rehydration therapy(ORT).\" ORTpromotion includes sup-port for continued feeding during as well as the use oforal rehydration salts (ORS) to pre-vent and treat dehydration. Continuedprogress is needed in diarrhoea pre-vention, treatment, nutritional man-agement and cure to ensure that growthlost during diarrhoea episodes is rapidlycaught up, but the achievements so farhave been of great nutritional benefitto millions of children. Similarly, thegains already achieved in access tosafe water and sanitation facilitieshave translated into nutritional bene-fits around the world. Millions morechildren than before have been able toavoid plunging deeper into the spiralof infection and poor dietary intakebecause so many illness episodes areprevented or readily cured.An especially important advancein the health world has been the revi-talization of basic health servicesthrough such measures as the BamakoInitiative, the set of policy measureslaunched by African governments in1987 in response to the rapid deterio-ration of public health systems inAfrica in the 1970s and 1980s. Nowoperating in other regions, the BamakoInitiative measures have meant that ,rij AL Diarrhoea, often in conjunction withmalnutrition, claims the lives of 2.2 millionchildren each year. Increased use of ORTas well as improvements in hygiene andsanitation are helping stem the toll.In Syria, a woman gives her baby oralrehydration solution. 65 There is no single, globallyapplicable solution to theoverall problem, and there isno substitute for assessmentand analysis done with thefull and active participationof the families mostthreatened by nutritionalproblems and most familiarwith their impact and causes. 66health centres in remote areas vir-tually abandoned in the 1980s for lackof basic drugs and supplies areagain thriving and serving the com-munities whose active involvement intheir management has helped resusci-tate them. The results have been strik-ing. In addition to ensuring access tobasic curative services, the initiativehas sustained increased coverage ofimmunization and other preventiveactivities. In Guinea, for example, pre-natal care coverage went from lessthan 5 per cent before the initiative toalmost 80 per cent in the mid-1990s.With WHO and other partners,UNICEF is committed to acceleratedaction in malaria control, includingthe promotion of insecticide-treatedbednets and support for improveddrug use in malaria treatment. A com-bined programme for prevention programmes and Tanzania included importanteducation, information and communi-cation components. In some cases, thisincluded reinforcing classroom educa-tion, as in Niger, where literacy andother non-formal instruction to womenin participating villages only served tohighlight the need to improve formaleducation for their children, especiallytheir daughters. One donor agencyinvolved in supporting community-based programmes in Niger, in fact,encouraged the inclusion of formaleducation for girls as part of the activi-ties meant to improve nutrition.68School-based programmes in casessuch as this, as well as non-formalprogrammes for youth and adults,such as literacy and parent educationcourses, are a useful complement andsometimes a principal vehicle forother activities promoting better nu-trition. It is easy and usually very ap-propriate to ensure that curricula usedin these programmes include strongnutrition components.Schools, teachers and educationprogrammes can serve as mobilizersof community participation in manyways, such as through village educa-tion committees and parent-teacherassociations. These can also serve as aresource for nutrition and help orga-nize relevant community-based as-sessment, analysis and action as wellas promote good practices and shareinformation concerning nutrition.In the Lao People's DemocraticRepublic, for example, early child-hood development volunteers in thecommunity and parents are mobilizedthrough participatory processes todevelop, among other skills, betternutrition practices, both traditionaland modern. The essential role ofteachers and schoolchildren in pro-moting the use of iodized salt and eventesting its quality in Indonesia wasmentioned earlier. In this case, mes-sages about salt iodization and itsimportance have even been formallyincorporated into teacher trainingcourses across the country.Eight useful lessonsWhat have these success stories shown?While there is no single prescription,these eight points bear noting.1. Solutions must involvethose most directly affected.Malnutrition has many causes andmanifests itself in several ways. Thereis no single, globally applicable solu- tion to the overall problem, and thereis no substitute for assessment andanalysis done with the full and activeparticipation of the families mostthreatened by nutritional problemsand most familiar with their impactand causes. People who suffer orwhose children suffer from malnutri-tion cannot be passive recipients ofprogrammes. If they are not the mainplayers in problem assessment andanalysis, then actions to reduce mal-nutrition are likely to be inappropriateor unsustainable.2. A balance of approachesis necessary.A central challenge for nutrition pro-grammes, as well as other develop-ment efforts, is finding a balance ofapproaches that work. Processes in-volving assessment, analysis and ac-tionthe triple A approachareessential for formulating appropriate`bottom-up' solutions, particularlywith respect to the ways in which pro-grammes are organized, managed andmonitored. But there are some aspectsof resolving malnutrition that can beappropriately formulated at higherlevels, using wide and more 'top-down' application of appropriatestrategies and technologies, based onthe best scientific knowledge and themost effective technologies available.UNICEF experience indicates thatfor many problems, a combination oftop-down and bottom-up actions maybe best. BFHI was formulated as aglobal strategy, but its success hastaken many forms, depending on theengagement of national and local in-stitutions and groups.Vitamin A supplementation wassuggested by the mortality reductionit enabled in many places and endorsedglobally as a strategy, but its applica-tion has depended greatly on existinghealth measures and the involvementof community-based institutions.Salt iodization has been enhancedby consumer advocacy and legislativechange at the local and national levelsand by the fact that communities pre-viously affected by IDD can see andfeel a difference.The essence of a triple A approachis not necessarily to establish newcycles but, as much as possible, tobuild upon existing ones. Assessment-analysis-action cycles are the logicalsteps everyone tries to follow in orderto cope with their problems better. Byunderstanding how nutritionally use-ful mechanisms work and where theweaknesses are, a nutrition programmecan build upon and improve existinggood practices, rather than estab-lishing new systems and proceduresthat may be difficult to accept andadopt, and are therefore difficult tosustain.In the case of the Tanzanian CSDProgramme, there were many compo-nents but the main focus was to im-prove people's capacity to assess theproblemthrough growth monitor-ingand thereby help them makebetter use of their resources.3. Nutrition components workbetter in combination.Because malnutrition is the result of somany factors, it is not surprising thatit has been attacked most effectivelyin situations in which several sectorsand strategies have been brought to bear.Combining improved infant feed-ing, better household access to foodoverall and improved and more acces-sible health services and sanitation isclearly more effective in reducingmalnutrition where food, health andcare are a problem than any of thesemeasures taken alone. In support ofthese various approaches that work,relevant social services health,education, communication and socialmobilizationmust be more clearlyfocused on nutrition. This is not done6 9Community -hased growth monitoring is acentral component of the triple A approach.A child's growth chart is updated during agrowth monitoring session in Mauritania. 67 4Governments, communities and families needto work together to fulfil their children'srights to good nutrition. In Cambodia,a girl carries her baby sibling. 68by creating new 'nutrition projects' inthese areas, but rather by incorporat-ing nutrition components in ongoingcommunity-based activities. Exper-ience shows the usefulness of build-ing such nutrition components into allprogrammes, wherever possible.The impact on nutrition of health,education and other social servicesshould also be monitored, with the re-sults used both for a better under-standing of nutrition problems and asa means to motivate policy makers,programme staff and communitiesthemselves to increase their efforts toreduce malnutrition. Based on the mon-itoring of nutrition impact, viable andsuccessful programmes should be re-designed so as to have the best effect.Communication plays a special rolein nutrition programmes in armingparents, educators and other care-givers not only with basic nutrition in-formation but also with the ability tomake informed decisions and theskills and knowledge needed to takeaction to support improved nutritionin their communities.Communication should be carriedout simultaneously at various levels toinclude parents, other family mem-bers, teachers, volunteers and com-munity leaders who can in turn teachand support good practices. In addi-tion, personnel of provincial and dis-trict health offices, staff in agriculture,rural development and education it-self, media representatives, researchersand persons in positions of power ofany kind must be reached and theirhelp enlisted.4. Progress hinges oncontinuing research.All of these gains against malnutritionhave depended upon programmati-cally relevant research, but more isneeded. Both motivated researchersand processes to support such researchare needed. For example, it took the70urging of United Nations agencies andfinancing from the Government ofCanada to ensure an analysis of the mor-tality impact of vitamin A deficiency.There is a need for more researchto improve programmes that affect thehardest-to-reach people, and for de-termining the effectiveness of feasibleinterventionsfor example, how toencourage increased consumption ofgreen leafy vegetables. Research in-stitutions, both industry-based andacademic, need to include the poorand their day-to-day nutrition prob-lems on the research agenda.5. Food production isimportant but not enough.As was demonstrated in the Tan-zanian programmes of Iringa andMbeya, nutrition can be improvedeven in rather poor communities with-out increasing overall food availabil-ity. Increasing food production isoften necessary, but it is never enoughto ensure improvement in nutrition.Programmes that aim to increasefood production countrywide or in partsof countries should not claim that nu-trition will be improved in young chil-dren and women unless other specificand focused measures are imple-mented to better their situation.6. Everyone has an obligationto child rights.Children have a valid claim to goodnutrition. The government has anobligation and many other membersof society and the community, in-cluding parents, have duties to real-ize the child's right to good nutrition.All of these groups need to becomeaware of the nutrition problem, itscauses and consequences, the possi-bilities of solutions, and their obliga-tion to respect, protect, facilitate andfulfil child rights. They need to knowwhat to do and how to do it. Advo-cacy, information, education and training are all important strategiesto create or increase this necessaryawareness.7. Community and family-based involvement is vital.Children's rights give them validclaims on society. In order for poorpeople to carry out their duties to-wards children, the poor must be rec-ognized as key actors rather than aspassive beneficiaries.All available resources, even thosecontrolled outside the community,should be used to support processeswithin households and the communitythat contribute to improved nutrition.Such processes involve decisions aboutthe use of resources and the monitor-ing of the impact of these decisions.As described above, householdsand communities learn how to searchfor better solutions through the processof assessing the existing situation,analysing the causes and acting asavailable resources permit. Community-based monitoring is important in therepeated assessment of the evolvingsituation. Analyses by the communityand by all supporters outside the com-munity are facilitated by an improvedunderstanding of the causes of the nu-trition problem.Outside support includes advo-cacy, information, education, trainingand direct service delivery. Govern-ment and NGO staff may work out-side the community, but should be infrequent contact with the community,functioning as facilitators. They shouldfocus their support and dialogue oncommunity mobilizers: people whoare a part of the community and enjoyits trust and respect.There is no pre-defined package ofinputs or services that can work.Instead, the community is constantlylearning about the best mix of inter-ventions, a mix that can changesignificantly over time. Communitydevelopment means that desirableoutcomes, such as good nutrition, areachieved through participatory andsustainable processes. A combinationof top-down advocacy and mobiliza-tion and a bottom-up demand for sup-port will ensure that both communityand government feel ownership ofsuccessful changes.8. Government policies mustreflect the right to nutrition.Some national policies affect nutritiondirectly, such as salt iodization or im-munization programmes, for exam-ple. Others, like income and pricepolicies, affect nutrition indirectly.With the ratification of the Con-vention on the Rights of the Child,governments have the obligation torespect, protect, facilitate and fulfilthe rights enshrined in the Conven-tion. All policies should therefore beanalysed in terms of their real andpotential impact on the right to goodnutrition.The most important strategies fornutrition include those for food, health,breastfeeding, education, and waterand sanitation, and national nutritioninformation systems should be estab-lished to provide valid data about theirimpact. Policies should be based onknowledge from relevant research andbe constantly evaluated for their realimpact on nutrition in communities.Nutrition information systems shouldbe as decentralized as the existingadministrative systems, starting withcommunity-based monitoring. 69 I i!It 41\u00b0- Bringing science to bear Science and technology willnever solve all of the problemsassociated with the inadequatefood and care and the lack of healthservices and sanitation that lead tochildhood malnutrition. But the suc-cesses stemming from breakthroughsbeing made and insights reached havestirred new hope for healthier, moreproductive lives for both children andadults. This section describes some ofthe crucial scientific advances that arehelping to shape specific interven-tions to reduce malnutrition or thatmay do so in the future.Some of this knowledge, such asthe strengthening effect of vitamin Aon the immune system, is well estab-lished; other knowledge is just emerg-ing and is worth watching. Some ofthe new science is likely to accelerateefforts to reduce malnutrition, and atthe same time generate new under-standing of how reducing malnutritionin childhood or during the prenatalperiod may lessen chronic disease inadulthood and the onerous public healthburden it causes. There are also new Photo: Over a million pre-school-agechildren suffer from vitamin A deficiency,which affects immune-system functioning.Vitamin A supplementation is estimated tolower a child's risk of dying by 23 per cent.In Bangladesh, a boy receives a vitamin Acapsule.tools to tackle the essential task of nu-tritional assessment and new waysthatagriculturalscience can bebrought to bear on the problem.Nutritionally acquiredimmune deficiencyIt is estimated that the immune sys-tems of some 23 million peopleworldwide have been damaged byHIV.' It is less well known that mal-nutrition impairs the immune systemsof at least 100 million young childrenand several million pregnant women,none of them infected by HIV. But un-like the situation with AIDS, the`cure' for immune deficiency due tomalnutrition has been known for cen-turies: It is achieved by ensuring anadequate dietary intake containing allessential nutrients. Today, more isbeing learned about the specific roleof individual nutrients in the function-ing of the immune system, knowledgethat will help in the design of inter-ventions that can improve the situationin the near future. This knowledgealso reinforces the importance of striv-ing to ensure that everyone in theworld has access to a diet that is ade-quate in both quality as well as quantity.Scientists have known for sometime that malnutrition and infectionare connected. A 1968 monograph byWHO, entitled achieved by ensuringan adequate dietary intakecontaining all essentialnutrients. 71 Fig. 11Measles deaths and vitaminA supplementation In three separate trials of children hospitalized withmeaslesone as early as 1932deaths amongchildren given high-dose vitamin A supplementswere significantly lower than among children notsupplemented. The consistent results suggest thata change in vitamin A status can rapidly alter basicphysiological functions concerned with cellularrepair and resistance to infection, 16141210 64 2d 019321987United KingdomTanzaniaUNon-supplementedSupplemented 1990South Africa Source: Alfred Sommer and Keith P. West Jr., Vitamin ADeficiency: Health, survival and vision, Oxford UniversityPress, New York, 1996. 72tion and Infection', was one of the firstcomprehensive statements of some ofthese links.The threat that vitamin A defi-ciency poses to the lives of youngchildren has already been described.Within a few years, the scientific com-munity went from calling the fact thatvitamin A supplements could reducechild mortality \"too good to be true\"to calling it \"too good not to be true.\"But the many ways vitamin A defi-ciency increases child deaths were notwell understood until recently. Nowthe results of a dozen field studies,conducted in Brazil, Ghana, India,Indonesia, Nepal and elsewhere, indi-cate that supplementing the diets ofchildren who are at risk of vitamin Adeficiency can reduce deaths fromdiarrhoea. Four of the studies that fo-cused on diarrhoea showed that deathswere reduced by 35-50 per cent. Thevitamin can also halve the number ofdeaths due to measles' (Fig. 11).In Bangladesh, breastfed infantswhose mothers were given a single oralhigh-dose supplement of vitamin Ashortly after giving birth had signifi-cantly fewer days of sickness becauseof respiratory infections and febrileillnesses during the first six months oflife than did infants born to unsupple-mented mothers from the same socio-economic group in the same area?Zinc is another micronutrient thathas long been known to be essentialfor the growth and development ofcells and for the functioning of theimmune system. However, becausezinc deficiency is extremely difficultto measure, little attention was paiduntil recently to the possibility that itmight impair child health and devel-opment (Fig. 12).Trials in Bangladesh, India andIndonesia have already shown reduc-tions of about one third in the durationand severity of diarrhoea in childrenreceiving zinc supplements and a7 4median 12 per cent decline in the inci-dence of pneumonia.' In these investi-gations, zinc supplements did themost good for those children whostarted out the most malnourished.A study recently completed inLima (Peru) found that the benefits ofzinc supplementation on immunitycan begin even before birth. Re-searchers from the Johns HopkinsSchool of Public Health in Baltimore(US) and the Instituto de Investi-gacion Nutricional in Lima have beenadding zinc to the iron and folatesupplements of pregnant women andtesting its impact on the health of theirnewborn children, including its effectson immune system activity. Initialanalysis shows that antibody levelsjust after birth are higher in the chil-dren of zinc-supplemented mothersthan in those receiving a placebo.Zinc supplementation appears soeffective in reducing the incidence ofdiarrhoea and pneumonia in poorcountries that one scientist, RobertBlack of Johns Hopkins University,has suggested that zinc supplementsare as significant a public health inter-vention for diarrhoea reduction as im-provements in water and sanitation.And major new research indicates thateven the effects of malaria, a deadlyenemy of both children and adults, maybe lessened by zinc and vitamin A(Panel 18).Iron deficiency can also damagethe immunity of a growing child,impairing the body's ability to killinvading pathogens and leading toincreased iron-deficientpopulations.' In studies in Egypt,anaemic children had longer andmore severe episodes of diarrhoeathan did their iron-fortified peers.Basic science is now able to ex-plain why these astonishing resultsoccur. Thus far, zinc and vitamin Aare the two micronutrients that haveproved to be the most closely linked with the proper functioning of thebody's front-line defences. These twomicronutrients help maintain thephysical barriers of skin and mucosathat prevent micro-organisms frominvading the body, as well as enhanc-ing the activity of leukocytes such asNK (natural killer) cells and macro-phagesscavenger cells that engulf,then destroy, foreign pathogens suchas bacteria throughout the body.Equally important, low dietaryconsumption of zinc and vitamin Areduces the number and impairs and These produceantibodies and T-cells that, in turn,are responsible for eliminating virus-infected host cells. They also producebiochemicals known as cytokines,which further promote B-cell andmacrophage activity. At the sametime, an adequate intake of zinc isnow understood to be necessary inorder for both vitamin A and iodine todo many of their vital jobs.Nutrition and AIDSThe role of nutrition in preventing in-fection is now being investigated asone possible way to help reduce thetransmission of AIDS. Vitamin A mayform part of the arsenal needed tocombat HIV, which is expected to in-fect between 4 million and 5 millionchildren by early in the next century,most of them in sub-Saharan Africa.These children will mainly be in-fected by their mothers.The routes of mother-to-childtransmission of HIV, also known asvertical transmission, are threefold:during pregnancy, during labour anddelivery, and through breastfeeding.Scientists have been exploring thepossibility of reducing vertical trans-mission in all three routes since 1994.They have tried to block intrauterinetransmission by giving women dosesof the antiretroviral drug Zidovudineduring pregnancy. The drug has beenshown to reduce mother-to-child trans-mission of HIVbut at hundreds ofdollars per course, it is prohibitivelyexpensive for most people in the devel-oping world. Less expensive methodsof antiretroviral therapy during preg-nancy, such as administering Zido-vudine for shorter periods or usingcheaper drugs, are now being tested inHaiti, sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Asia.Two other treatments during preg-nancy are also under investigation.These involve either intravenous therapywith purified anti-HIV antibodies, orsupplementation with vitamin A. In a1994 study of HIV-infected women inMalawi, it was found that 32 per centof those who were vitamin A deficientduring pregnancy had passed HIV onto their infants. In contrast, only 7 percent of FIW-infected women with suf-ficient levels of vitamin A did so. Thestudy concluded that vitamin A-deficient women were thus four and ahalf times more likely to infect theirchildren.'Also, a 1995 study from Kenyareported that the concentration of HIVin breastmilk is higher in vitamin A-deficient mothers than in those withgood vitamin A status. Another study,also from Kenya, has shown that HIV-positive women who are also vitaminA deficient were five times morelikely than non-vitamin A-deficientwomen to shed HIV-infected cells intheir reproductive tracts, a factor thatmay be an important determinant ofboth sexual and vertical transmissionof AIDS. However, some experts havesuggested that these results may havecome about not because of the influ-ence of vitamin A on HIV transmis-sion, but because poor vitamin Astatus and high rates of infectionoccur together for other reasons.75Fig. 12Zinc supplementation andchild growth (Ecuador, 1986) Zinc's importance in ensuring normal growth anddevelopment is underlined in a 1986 study ofEcuadorian pre-schoolers with low zinc intake.

At least 300 million peo-ple worldwide endure its recurrentfevers, malaise, anaemia and risk ofseizures or coma. Malaria kills from1.5 million to 2.7 million people an-nually. It is the sixth leading cause ofdisability among children under fouryears of age in the developing world.Some 600,000 young children die ofmalaria alone each year; over 1 mil-lion die of malaria in conjunctionwith other illnessesa rate of onechild every 30 seconds.Many approaches have alreadybeen tried to combat the disease.However, the parasite that causesmalaria is no longer vulnerable to 74some of the most powerful anti-malarial compounds available. For atime, the widespread use of pesti-cides in the 1950s managed to sup-press the Anopheles mosquito thattransmits the parasite, but it, too, hasdeveloped resistance.Arming the body to defend itselfthrough immunization is one ap-proach to preventing the disease.But vaccines are difficult to developsince the parasite moves betweenorgans, changingits appearancefrom stage to stage and hiding fromthe immune system in a place thatthe immune system doesn't check:inside red blood cells. Consequently,the best vaccines to date have man-aged to protect only around 30 percent of test populations from infection.However, naturally acquired resis-tance does develop over time as peo-ple are repeatedly exposed to theparasite. A recent study by the JohnsHopkins School of Public Health andthe Papua New Guinea Institute ofMedical Research investigated the76ability of vitamin A and zinc to helpboost such natural resistance.Nearly 800 children under the ageof five were enrolled in the study. Allof the children lived in an area ofnorth-western Papua New Guineawhere malarial infection is common.The parasite that is responsible forthe disease can be found in the bloodof over 40 per cent of under-fives inthe region, and it is the major causeof death among children from theage of six months to four years.In controlled trials, regular vita-min A and zinc supplementation ap-peared to be complementary indecreasing the burden of malaria inchildren. According to Dr. AnurajShankar of Johns Hopkins Univer-sity, chief researcher of the study,vitamin A reduced by more than athird the febrile illnesses due to mildto moderately high levels of malariaparasites in children and significantlyreduced spleen swelling, an indicatorof chronic malaria. However, it hadlittle influence on the worst cases,where children had a very high num-ber of parasites in their blood.Zinc, on the other hand, helpedblunt the severity of the worst cases.As a result, there were over a thirdfewer malaria cases seen at healthcentres among those given zinc thanamong those given a placebo. In addi-tion, overall clinic visits by those chil-dren who had received zinc decreasedby a third, and signs of other infec-tions (cough and diarrhoea, for exam-ple) were reduced by 20-50 per cent.The Papua New Guinea experi-ence shows that vitamin A and zincstatus in children may be as im-portant in reducing malaria as othercommonly used malaria-control tech-niques, such as insecticide sprayingand the use of insecticide-treatedbed nets. And the cost is minimal: A year's supply of zinc supple-ments costs $1 per child, with anadditional 10 cents for vitamin Acapsules.A second study is under way inthe Peruvian Amazon to measurethe effectiveness of vitamin A andzinc in boosting the efficacy ofantimalarial drugs. Peruvian sci-entists at the Loreto Departmentof Health and colleagues fromJohns Hopkins are studying morethan 1,000 children who are suf-fering from malaria to see if a short,five-day course of zinc or vitaminA in conjunction with antimalarialdrugs improves their health. Somechildren are receiving both themicronutrients, in the hope thatthe zinc-vitamin A combinationwill be more effective, as zinc isknown to promote vitamin A me-tabolism in the body.Despite the surge of interna-tional interest in malaria fromboth the public sector and privateindustry and the promise that vit-amin A and zinc may hold, fund-ingfor researchinto diseaseprevention and treatment unfortu-nately remains meagre. Currently,funding levels run at roughly $42per malaria death, compared with$3,274 for each AIDS fatality. Photo: Women and their children waitoutside a UNICEF-assisted health centrein the Peruvian Amazon, where malaria isa major health concern.Based on the findings of the firststudiesand to demonstrate whetherthe connection between vitamin A andHIV transmission is causal fourclinical trials were begun recently toexamine HIV transmission rates inwomen who have received vitamin Asupplements during the second or thirdtrimester of pregnancy. Results fromthese studies, conducted in Malawi,South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabweon a total of nearly 3,000 HIV-infectedwomen, are expected soon.Using nutrition toreduce maternaldeathsMaternal mortality is a tragedy insocial, economic and public healthterms. WHO and UNICEF have notedthat of the 585,000 yearly maternaldeaths around the world, the vast ma-jority are preventable. About 80 per centof these deaths are the result of fivedirect obstetric causes: haemorrhage,infection, obstructed labour, unsafeabortion and a convulsive disorder inlate pregnancy called eclampsia.'Asalreadynoted,obstructedlabour is more likely to occur amongwomen who were stunted in child-hood (Fig. 13). It is estimated thatanaemia may be responsible for asmuch as 20 per cent of maternal mor-tality, particularly those deaths fromhaemorrhage and possibly infection.Anaemia also increases the risk ofmorbidity and mortality associatedwith any major surgical intervention,including Caesarean section.Programmesalreadyexisttoreduce anaemia in pregnant women.More work is needed, however, notonly to make iron/folate supplementa-tion programmes more effective, butalso to improve the treatment and pre-vention of malaria and hookworm.Both of these are conditions that alsocontribute to maternal anaemia.7Fig. 13 Maternal height andCaesarean delivery (Guatemala,1984-1986) The importance of good nutrition for girls andwomen is affirmed in a mid-1980s' study ofpregnant Guatemalan women, which found thatthe risk of having an intrapartum Caesareandelivery was 2.5 times higher in short mothersthan in tall mothers. Short stature in women isoften a consequence of poor growth in earlychildhood. Jose Villar, 'How domaternal and newborn size affect intrapartum Caesarean delivery?' (draft).185 75 Spotlight: Vitamin A Impact of deficiencyVitamin A deficiency makes children es-pecially vulnerable to infection and wors-ens the course of many infections.Supplementation with vitamin A is esti-mated to lower a child's risk of dying byapproximately 23 per cent. The deficiencyis also the single most important cause ofblindness among children in developingcountries. Who is affectedOver 100 million pre-school-age childrensuffer from vitamin A deficiency. VitaminA deficiency is also likely to be wide-spread among women in their reproduc-tive years in many countries. What vitaminAdoesVitamin A, stored normally in the liver, iscrucial for effective immune-system func-tioning, protecting the integrity of epithe-lial cells lining the skin, the surface of theeyes, the inside of the mouth and thealimentary and respiratory tracts. Whenthis defence breaks down in a vitamin A-deficient child, the child is more likely todevelop infections, and the severity of aninfection is likely to be greater.Depending on the degree of the defi- 'ciency, a range of abnormalities also ap-pears in the eyes of vitamin A-deficientchildren. In the mildest form, night-blindness occurs because the rods in theeye no longer produce rhodopsin, a pig-ment essential for seeing in the dark. Inmore severe forms, lesions occur on theconjunctiva and the cornea that if leftuntreated can cause irreversible damage,including partial or total blindness. SourcesVitamin A is found as retinol in breastmilk,liver, eggs, butter and whole cow's milk.Carotene, a precursor of vitamin A that isconverted to retinol in the abdominalwalls, is found in green leafy vegetables,orange and yellow fruits, and red palm oil. 76Even if an adequate nutritional sta-tus were achieved in adolescent girlsand women before their first preg-nancy, this would never eliminate theneed for good medical care in preg-nancy and childbirth. But some day itmay help reduce the tragic burden ofmaternal mortality and the need forcertain medical interventions. Someof the connections between nutritionand maternal mortality suggestedbelow are not yet definitively demon-strated or part of programme activi-ties, but they hold great promise forthe future. A few are especially worthmentioning:Even given the many known bene-fits of good vitamin A status, it isnonetheless remarkable to find thatimproving the vitamin A status ofpregnant women whose intake of thevitamin is low also dramatically re-duces maternal mortality (Panel 1).Deadly infections in pregnancy, as inchildhood, find a formidable adver-sary in vitamin A. The use of low-cost, low-dose vitamin A capsules aswell as improvements in diet make ithighly probable that this new re-search will be easily incorporated intoprogrammes.Zinc deficiency, increasingly rec-ognized as widespread among womenin developing countries, is associatedwith long labour, which increases therisk of death. Severe zinc deficiencyis also believed to impair foetal devel-opment in a number of ways. Zinc isimportant for the synthesis of hor-mones and enzymes essential tochildbirthespecially estrogen-dependent functions such as expulsionof the placenta and proper contractionof uterine muscles during birth aswell as for immune-system develop-ment. A number of studies around theworld have found that zinc supple-mentation has reduced complicationsof pregnancy. Several studies areunder way that will soon help definethe impact of improved zinc status onpregnant women.It has long been known that iodinedeficiency in women increases therisk of stillbirths and miscarriages.And there is evidence that, in highlyiodine-deficient areas, another resultof this deficiency may be increasedmaternal mortality through severehypothyroidism.A recent study in the United Statesshowed that calcium supplementationdid not reduce the risk of hyperten-sion in pregnancy that could result indeath, but a number of experts havesuggested that supplementation mightreduce this risk in areas where womenare especially calcium deficient.Folate deficiency, now well knownto induce neural-tube birth defects ifit is present during the first month ofpregnancy, may also represent a riskfor maternal morbidity and mortality,as well as increase the risk of lowbirthweight.The clear message emerging fromthese connections is that improvingwomen's nutritional status by in-creasing their intake of micronutrientsas well as their overall food consump-tion, and by taking steps to reducetheir workload and improve theiraccess to health caremay offerconsiderable, low-cost benefits in re-ducing maternal deaths. But there isstill no international consensus on thebenefits to be gained by supplementa-tion during pregnancy with nutrientsother than iron and folate.The real challenge is to reachwomen well before they becomepregnantindeed, to help adoles-cent girls achieve the best nutritionalstatus possible before they enter theirreproductive years. This would notonly help reduce maternal mortalitybut would also reduce the prevalenceof low birthweight, the risk of birthdefects and the rates of stillbirths andearly infant mortality. All of these re- main scientific and programmaticchallenges, along with the imperativeof ensuring that women's health ispositioned high on the health anddevelopment agendas of all countries.Breastfeeding:Good for mothers'health tooIn addition to the nutritional status ofadolescent girls and women, there isanother important connection betweennutrition and maternal mortality. Anumber of studies have shown a stronglink between the early initiation ofbreastfeeding and reduced risk ofpostpartum haemorrhage.Initiating breastfeeding immedi-ately following birth, as most womendo in baby-friendly hospitals, stimu-lates the contraction of the uterus andreduces blood loss. For this reason,the continuing spread of the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative shouldalso contribute to the reduction ofmaternal mortality.In recent years, research has alsodemonstrated that this immediatepost-partum benefit is by no meansthe only way in which breastfeedingcan improve women's health. A re-cent large-sample study in the UnitedStates demonstrated that women whobreastfed their children had a lowerrisk of breast cancer in the pre-menopausal period, and the longerthey breastfed, the lower the risk!These results show that protecting,promoting and supporting breastfeed-ing has benefits for women that go be-yond the remarkable effects, alreadywell understood, that protect theirchildren from illness and death.Prevention of chronicdiseasesChronic degenerative diseases arelargely regarded as diseases of afflu-ence. In industrialized countries, im-provements in living standards andhealth care have led to increased lifeexpectancy, allowing people to livelong enough to develop such chronicillnesses. Chronic diseases are alsoassociated with the sedentary lifestyleand over-abundant diet prevalent inmany industrialized nations.Arguments are being made, how-ever, that these chronic diseases inlarge measure may also be diseases ofpovertyparticularly poverty earlyin life and during foetal development.The hypothesis is particularly intrigu-ing in light of the fact that ischaemicheart disease is projected to be theworld's leading cause of death anddisability in the year 2020.9Professor David Barker and hiscolleagues at Medical ResearchCouncil Epi-demiology in Southampton (UK),first raised the \"foetal origins of adultdisease\" hypothesis over a decade ago,noting a link between low birthweightand the incidence of cardiovasculardisease among middle-aged men andwomen born in the United Kingdom.'Since then, over 30 studies aroundthe world have indicated that low-birthweight babies who were not bornprematurely have a higher incidenceof hypertension later in life than thosewith a normal birthweight,\" indepen-dent of their social class and suchadult risk factors as smoking, drink-ing and overeating.Low birthweight, as well as thin-ness at birth, has also been correlatedwith glucose intolerance in childhood'2and non-insulin dependent diabetes inlater life.'Professor Barker and his colleaguesspeculate that maternal dietary imbal-ances at critical periods of devel-opment in the womb can trigger aredistribution of foetal resources, af-fecting a foetus's structure and metab-olism in ways that predispose the7 9Spotlight: Zinc Impact of deficiencyZinc deficiency in malnourished childrencontributes to growth failure and suscep-tibility to infections. Zinc deficiency isalso thought to be associated withcomplications of childbirth. Who is affectedDataon the prevalence of zinc deficiencyare unavailable, as there is no reliablemethod of determining zinc status at thepopulation level. Zinc deficiency is likelyto be a public health problem, however,in areas where overall malnutrition isprevalent; it is now recognized as suchin many countries. What zinc doesZinc promotes normal growth anddevelopment. It forms part of themolecular structure of 80 or more knownenzymes that work with red blood cellsto move carbon dioxide from tissues tolungs. Zinc also helps maintain an effec-tive immune system. Severe zinc defi-ciency causes growth retardation,diarrhoea, skin lesions, loss of appetite,hair loss and, in boys, slow sexualdevelopment. Zinc has now beenshown to have a therapeutic effecton diarrhoea cases. SourcesBreastmilk has small amounts of zincthat are readily absorbed. Other sourcesinclude whole-grain cereals, legumes,meat, chicken and fish. Vegetables andfruits contain little zinc but when eatenwith cereals may increase the bio-availability of zinc in cereals. 77 Spotlight: Iron Impact of deficiencyIron deficiency anaemia, the most commonnutritional disorder in the world, impairsimmunity and reduces the physical andmental capacities of populations. In infantsand young children, even mild anaemiacan impair intellectual development.Anaemia in pregnancy is an importantcause of maternal mortality, increasingthe risk of haemorrhage and sepsisduring childbirth. Infants born to anaemicmothers often suffer from low birthweightand anaemia themselves. Causes includeblood loss associated with menstruationand parasitic infections such as hookworm,but an inadequate intake of iron is themain cause. Who is affectedNearly 2 billion people are estimated tobe anaemic and even more are irondeficient, the vast majority of them women.Between 40 and 50 per cent of childrenunder five in developing countriesand over 50 per cent of pregnantwomenare iron deficient. What iron doesThe body needs iron to produce haemo-globin, the protein in red blood cells re-sponsible for carrying oxygen. Iron is alsoa component of the many enzymes essen-tial for the adequate functioning of brain,muscle and the immune-system cells.A certain amount of iron is stored inthe liver, spleen and bone marrow. Irondeficiency develops as these stores aredepleted and there is insufficient ironabsorption. In anaemia, the iron deficiencyis so severe that the production ofhaemoglobin is significantly reduced.The main symptoms and signs are pale-ness of the tongue and inside the lips,tiredness and breathlessness. Deficienciesof folic acid, vitamin A, ascorbic acid,riboflavin and various minerals can alsocontribute to anaemia. SourcesIron is found in liver, lean meats, eggs,whole-grain breads and molasses. 78individual to later cardiovascular andendocrine diseases. The correlationbetween low birthweight and latercardiovascular disease and diabetesmay arise from the fact that nutri-tional deprivationinutero'pro-grammes' a newborn for a life ofscarcity. The problems arise when thechild's system is later confronted by aworld of plenty.\"In central India, an ambitious studyhas been funded by UK Welhome Trustand coordinated by Dr. Ranjan Yajnikat the King Edward Memorial Hos-pital Research Centre in Pune (India)and Dr. Caroline Fall at the MRCEnvironmental Epidemiology Unit. Itis exploring the impact that a mother'snutrition may have on the develop-ment of diabetes, high blood pressureand coronary heart disease in her off-spring when they reach adulthood.The results could resolve some of theuncertainties about causation of chronicillness, offering nutritional informa-tion relevant to both developing andindustrialized countries.The study has followed over 800women through pregnancy, monitor-ing growth, maternal weightgain and biochemical indicators of nu-tritional status:5 The nutritional valueof the women's daily food intakeincluding calorie, protein and micro-nutrient contentwas measured andrecorded. Within 24 hours of birth,both infant and placenta were weighedand other body measurements made.16Almost one third of the nearly 800 in-fants born during the study were clas-sified as low birthweight, under 2.5 kg.\"An interesting early finding suggeststhat birthweights are most strongly as-sociated with the size of the mothernot just her weight gain during preg-nancy, a well-known determinant ofnewborn size, but also her weight,height, percentage of body fat andhead circumference before conception.The weight and body mass index ofU00 umany of the women before pregnancysuggested chronic undernutrition. Thestudy also suggested that women'sdiet during pregnancy did not appearto have influenced foetal size substan-tially, although regular consumptionof two particular itemsgreen leafyvegetables and dairy products wasassociated with larger birth size. Theseearly findings lend support to thepremise that building a sturdy babydepends on good nutrition for the ex-pectant mother throughout her life.The children from the Pune studyare growing up in a society of increas-ing urbanization and prosperity. Urbandwellers in India are already fivetimes more likely to develop diabetesthan their rural relatives:8 and thosewho have migrated to industrializedcountries like the United Kingdom diein significantly larger numbers fromcoronary heart disease than theirindigenous white counterparts.'9In 1999, the first of the children inthe study will be tested for signs ofglucose intolerance and insulin resis-tance; these are early hints of diabetesthat have already been noted in chil-dren of low birthweight in Pune.'Soon after, blood pressure monitoringwill begin in an effort to look for ini-tial signs of hypertension. As thestudy progresses, findings can be re-lated back to birth size, foetal growthand maternal diet before and duringpregnancy. From an undertaking of thismagnitude, clear evidence may emergeabout the importance of improvingmaternal nutrition as a means of pre-venting chronic later-life disease inchildrenbefore these children havechildren of their own.New ways to reducemalnutrition deathsin emergenciesThe sheer extent of mild and moderatemalnutrition makes these conditions responsible for much more sicknessand death globally than does severemalnutrition. But a severely malnour-ished childusually defined as under70 per cent of the median weight-for-height reference or having oedema(water retention and swelling) at leastin the feetis at very high risk ofdeath, and requires prompt and inten-sive care in a health facility.Until recently, health professionalsdealing with severe malnutrition inemergency situations or in large hos-pitals in poor countries had beenusing an approach practised for years.The protocol was to treat infectiousconditions, correct rehydration andfeed, at least in the early stages, withhigh-energy milkusually a com-bination of dried skim milk, veg-etable oil and sugar. In the last fewyears, however, with the help ofWHO and the benefit of the experi-ence of a number of NGOs specializ-ing in this field, the new protocol isimproving the treatment of severemalnutrition.While the new protocol retainssome elements of former standardpractices, there are significant changes.The milk now recommended for theearly stages of therapeutic feeding,for example, is enhanced by the addi-tion of both oil and a vitamin andmineral mix, which addresses thespecial micronutrient imbalance thataccompaniesseveremalnutrition.Called gives grammes, themilk optimizes the chance for rapidweight gain and the eventual recoveryof a severely malnourished child.Another important change is a newrecommendation calling for modifica-tion of the standard oral rehydrationsalts (ORS) to address the specialelectrolyte needs of severely malnour-ished children. The use of standardORS has been known to increase riskof heart failure and sudden deathamong certain severely malnourishedchildren. The revised ORS reducesthat risk. Known as ReSoMal (rehy-dration solution for malnutrition), itcontains more potassium and differ-ent concentrations of elements fromthose in standard ORS.The new protocol for the care ofthe severely malnourished also em-phasizes elements that have beenknown by nutrition workers for sometime, but perhaps not well enough tobe integrated into regular practice.These include the need for rapid at-tention to clinical factors, such as lowbody temperature (hypothermia) andlow body sugar (hypoglycaemia), aswell as to less strictly medical factorssuch as meeting malnourished chil-dren's great needs for emotional sup-port, intellectual stimulation and play.Experienced emergency nutrition per-sonnel working in places such as theGreat Lakes region of Central Africaand the Democratic People's Republicof Korea have adopted this methodand noted how quickly it helps reducemortality. One challenge is to ensurethat supplies of the appropriate high-energy milk and rehydration solutionare steady and sufficient (Panel 19).New ways to measuremalnutritionMuch of the new knowledge de-scribed above will contribute to effec-tive actions to reduce malnutritionand related conditions. But even whenactions are effective, assessing theirimpact is often difficult. Measuringmalnutrition initially can also poseproblemsand make it difficult toplace the issue on the policy and pro-gramme agenda.There is thus a need for assessmentand analysis techniques that are lowin cost, produce rapid results and areeasy to use and understand. Here aresome of the promising new tools:Spotlight: Iodine Impact of deficiencyIodine deficiency is the single mostimportant cause of preventable braindamage and mental retardation, most ofthe damage occurring before birth. It alsosignificantly raises the risk of stillbirthand miscarriage for pregnant women. Who is affectedThe successful global campaign to iodizeall edible salt is reducing the risk associ-ated with this deficiency, which threat-ened 1.6 billion people as recently as1992. Nevertheless, it is estimated that43 million people worldwide are sufferingfrom varying degrees of brain damage;there are an estimated 11 million overtcretins. Some 760 million people havegoitres. What iodine doesIodine is needed by the thyroid gland fornormal mental and physical development.Most commonly and visibly associatedwith goitre (a swelling of the neck as theenlarged thyroid works to collect iodinefrom the blood), iodine deficiency takes agraver toll in impaired mental acuity.Persons suffering from IDD face a rangeof serious impairments including cretinism,spastic diplegia (a spastic paralysis of thelower limbs) and dwarfism. Less severedeficiencies in both adults and childrencan mean the loss of 10 to 15 intelligencequotient (IQ) points, as well as impairedphysical coordination and lethargy. SourcesIodized salt is the best source of iodine.Sea fish and some seaweed also containiodine, although sea salt does not. 79 Panel 19Protecting nutrition in crises When refugees stream into acountry, when families losetheir homes, fields andcrops in war or disaster, when chil-dren cry from hunger, it is not sur-prising that food can seem like theonly priority and the only answer toaverting widespread malnutrition.But in emergencies as well as inother situations, food, health andcare are all crucial to saving lives.Access to basic health services andwater and sanitation facilities is es-sential in emergencies not only tokeep children alive, but also to pro-tect their growth and development.To prevent outbreaks of measles,mass immunization usually alongwith the distribution of vitamin Asupplements has become standardpractice in emergencies. In Haiti, forexample, a measles vaccination cam-paign in 1994-1995 reached almost 3million children, helping end an epi-demic that began when the countrywas in the midst of civil unrest. 80J.'.111 Preventing death and malnutri-tion from cholera and other diar-rhoea) adequatesanitation, rehydration therapy of children's lives in therecent emergencies in Rwanda andSomalia. This is standard practice inthe current emergency in Burundi,for example.Breastfeeding is an important ele-ment of nutrition-related 'care' inemergencies. There has been markedprogress in this area as governmentsand agencies become increasinglysensitive to supporting women's abil-ity to breastfeed. Workers with someNGOs that specialize in preventingmalnutrition in times of crisis havehad success in recent years in pro-moting relactationhelping womenwho may have been separated fromtheir children to begin breastfeedingagain after having stopped.Sometimes infant formula mustbe used in emergenciesfor in-stance, when young children havebeen separated from their mothers.In these cases, all UN agencies work-ing in emergencies and many NGOshave committed to supplying onlygenerically labelled (no brand name)formula, to prevent commercial ex-ploitation of emergency situations.During the conflict in Bosnia andHerzegovina, UNICEF and other UNagencies jointly urged that infant for-mula distribution be severely limited,and relief organizations subsequentlyended mass distribution programmesin January 1995. UNICEF and WHOstrongly promoted breastfeeding,targeting health workers and joiningwith local health professionals dur-ing and after the war to develop a na-tional policy on infant feeding.Children ages 6 to 18 months,pregnant women and women whoare breastfeeding all need energy-dense, nutrient-dense foods. In emer-gencies, the approach to meetingthese special needs varies. Agenciesthat are part of the International Fed-eration of Red Cross and Red Cres-cent Societies, for example, try toprovide a family ration to meet every-one's requirements, including thoseof children and pregnant and breast-feeding women. The World Food Pro-gramme and some other agenciesgenerally distribute a ration that meetsminimum needs and, in addition, theycover vulnerable groups with supple-mentary feeding programmes. Thecomparative benefits of the two ap-proaches need to be evaluated.Triple Aassessment, analysisand actionis an essential approachin emergencies as well in other sit-uations. Monitoring children's nutri-tional status, with weight-for-heighta commonly used indicator, is crucialduring emergencies to help target re-sources and reach the most affected. Early warning systems andemergency preparedness are cost-effective means to prevent mal-nutritionin emergencies. TheUnited Nations Department ofHumanitarian Affairs' early warn-ing system draws on the work ofsimilar systems within and out-side the United Nations in prepar-ing comprehensive assessmentsof potential emergency situations,and UNHCR and other agencieshave set up rapid deploymentmechanisms for emergencies.Nonetheless, early warning sys-tems and emergency planningand preparedness remain sadlyunderfinanced, a shortfall that en-dangers children in particular whencrises loom. Photo: Health workers vaccinate twogirls at a camp for unaccompaniedRwandan refugee children in theDemocratic Republic of the Congo.A simplified way to look for vitaminA: Population-level surveys of vitaminA status have been a particular chal-lenge. In the past, when it was thoughtthat the main impact of vitamin A defi-ciency was damaged eyes and blind-ness, population surveys of vitamin Astatus involved examining children'seyes for early signs of damage. Nowthat it is understood that this deficiencyhas lethal consequences on a subclinicallevelthat is, at levels of deficiencythat do not yet show up as damage tothe eyemore sensitive methods ofdetecting its presence are needed.Most of the national or regional vi-tamin A surveys that have been con-ducted in recent years have usedblood retinol as the principal indicatorof vitamin A status. There are somedifficulties with the interpretation ofthis indicator, and it is expensive anddifficult to collect and analyse thevenous blood samples needed forthese surveys.A new technique that promises tobe easier, cheaper and less invasive is`dark adaptometry'. This method,which has been tested and found ef-fective in several field situations,'takes advantage of the fact that in veryearly stages of vitamin A deficiencythe ability of the pupil of the eye toconstrict under illumination is im-paired. By flashing a simple hand-held light at one pupil and coveringthe other, the degree of impairment ofthe pupillary reflex can be estimated.It is hoped that this simple method,which is non-invasive, will becomewidely available soon.'Dipsticks' for iodine deficiency:Iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) canbe assessed in populations by palpat-ing goitres, but this method requires ahigh level of training and is less use-ful as goitres begin to disappear withbetter access to iodized salt.8381 r. Interaction and stimulation are essential tosound nutrition as well as intellectual andemotional development. In China, a boydelights in his meal and the attention ofhis aunt. 82Since iodine excreted in the urineis a good indicator of iodine con-sumed, IDD can be reliably detectedby analysing urine samples. Manycountries have undertaken urinary io-dine surveys, which involve collectingsamples, preserving them carefullyand sending them to a laboratory foranalysis in a central location.A new technique may eliminatesome of those steps and much of thecost. A reagent-treated testing strip or`dipstick' now being developed willsimplify the procedure by allowingthe iodine content of urine to beanalysed and read directly on the spotwithout transporting samples to a lab-oratory. It is hoped that this tool willsoon be available for field surveys. Improved test kits for iodized salt:Simple iodized salt test kits havehelped make salt-testing a communityaffair. Anyone can use the small plas-tic bottles of test solution that causesalt to turn blue if it is iodized, andsome countries have distributed thesekits to schoolchildren, teachers andcommunity workers. The test kits,however, have a limited shelf life, andthey do not distinguish very sensi-tively among levels of salt iodization.Work is now under way to improve thetest kit in both these respects and makeit an even more useful assessment tool.Computerizing anaemia surveys:Thanks to computer chips, assess-ment of anaemia at the populationlevel is becoming easier. There havebeen methods for some time to assessperipheral blood (from a fingertip, forexample) without sending the sam-ples to a laboratory, but some of themare slow and inaccurate.Portable electronic haemoglobi-nometers are now available, however,that enable blood to be drawn easilyfrom a finger into a small cuvette thatis inserted directly into a machine that84gives a digital read-out of the precisehaemoglobin level in a few seconds.The wider use of these machines inpopulation surveys will help to raiseawareness of the enormous magni-tude of the anaemia problem.New ways toenrich dietsThere are many ways to enhancefoods to improve the content of the vi-tamins and minerals that are so impor-tant for the well-being of children andtheir families. Food fortification isone very important way of doing this,and has already helped overcomemicronutrient deficiencies in manyindustrialized countries and somedeveloping ones.But many of the world's poorestpeople eat locally grown crops thatcannot be fortified. Agricultural sci-entists are now demonstrating thatstaple crops can be modified in sev-eral ways at the breeding stage, withgreat nutritional benefit.The grains and tubers on whichthe vast majority of people in the de-veloping world depend have certaininherent shortcomings nutritionally.For one thing, these staples tend notto provide all the minerals and vita-mins needed to ensure good nutri-tion. In addition, cereals, dependingon several factors, including the de-gree to which they are refined, con-tainsubstances that impede the`bioavailability' of some importantmineralsthe ability of the body toabsorb and use them. The most im-portant of these substances is knownas phytate, a molecule containingphosphorus. Micronutrients usuallycome from non-staple foods ani-mal products, vegetables and fruits.But the poorest populations oftencannot afford these foods and dependon the grains and tubers they can af-ford. This fact helps explain the high prevalence of some micronutrientdeficiencies.Agricultural research has turned tothe science of plant breeding to im-prove this situation. The goal is to de-velop staple food crops that containhigher quantities of essential mi-cronutrientsor lower amounts ofphytate. In this connection, work iscurrently being done in the UnitedStates to develop low-phytate grainfoods for animal consumption. Suchgrains hold nutritional promise forpeople as well, according to the re-sults of a recent study, which foundthat human volunteers absorbed ironat a significantly higher rate fromfoods prepared using a new low-phytate strain of corn than from anolder higher-phytate strain.\"The Consultative Group on Inter-national Agricultural Research, madeup of 17 internationally funded agri-cultural research centres, is trying toraise farm productivity and food con-sumption in developing countries.The group is now coordinating aglobal effort to increase the micronu-trient content of five major staple foodcrops: rice, wheat, maize, beans andcassava. The aim is to breed plantsthat load high amounts of vitaminsand minerals into their edible partsand also into their seeds, allowingthem to enrich themselves for subse-quent harvests without changing theirtaste, texture, or the ease with whichthey are grown.In developed countries, such cropshave already been successfully pro-duced: high-zinc wheat, for example,is being grown in Australia. Estimatesare that it will take 6 to 10 years tobreed comparable new plants in de-veloping countries. Scientists believethat they will not only improve thedaily dietary intake in the developingworld but willalso significantlyincrease crop yields because thesemicronutrient-dense plants have bettergermination and more resistance to in-fection at the vulnerable seedling stage.More effective actionfor nutritionimprovementThe technical advances described inthis report, whether new research onnutrition and illness or better ways todetect problems, are not magic bul-lets. They will contribute to sustain-able improvement in nutrition only ifthey sharpen the ability of people, in-cluding the poor, to assess and analysethe causes of malnutrition aroundthemand to plan and carry out ap-propriate responses.Recent advances in the fields ofsocial science and communicationwill also help accelerate and sharpenpeople's ability to take control ofactions to reduce malnutrition.Actions described here to improvechild nutrition and thereby improvegrowth, resistance to illness and cog-nitive development need to be cou-pled with other highly effectivelow-cost interventions that have al-ready been proven to prevent diseaseand improve child development.Some of these have yet to bewidely exploited. For example, in-testinal worms, which contribute topoor growth and development, can becombated through routine dewormingusing low-cost drugs that are bothvery safe and highly effective (Panel20). And child deaths from malariacan be reduced through the use of in-secticide-impregnated mosquito nets.These measures have not received ad-equate global attention and resources,even though every child has a right totheir benefits.Actions to prevent malnutrition inyoung children also need to be linkedto efforts to promote early child de-velopment through stimulating playand early learning, and by strengthen-85Spotlight: Folate Impact of deficiencyFo late deficiency causes birth defects inthe developing foetus during the earliestweeks of pregnancybefore mostwomen are aware that they are pregnant.Folate deficiency has been found to beassociated with a high risk of pre-termdelivery and low birthweight, though it isnot clear that this would hold in all popu-lations. Folate deficiency also contributesto anaemia, especially in pregnant andlactating women. Who is affectedAlthough data are not abundant, in severaldeveloping countries women in theirreproductive years have been found tohave very high rates of folate deficiency.Young children are also likely to be at risk. What folate doesThis B vitamin helps in the formation ofred blood cells. Folate also regulates thenerve cells at the embryonic and foetalstages of development, helping to pre-vent serious neural tube defects (of thebrain and/or spinal cord). SourcesFolate is found in almost all foods, butthe best sources are liver, kidney, fish,green leafy vegetables, beans andgroundnuts. 83 Panel 20Progress against worms for pennies Asked to name the most wide-spread diseases, few peoplewould think of including worms.Yet, helminth (worm) infections areindeed one of the most commonand neglectedof diseases, affect-ing more than 30 per cent of theworld's people. Health, productivityand physical and mental capacitymay all suffer.Children in developing countriesare the most severely affected, par-ticularly those between the ages of 5and 14, in whom intestinal worms ac-count for up to 12 per cent of totaldisease burdenthe largest singlecontributor. While the impact ofworms on health and growth is com-monly believed to be most signifi-cant in children after they reach theage of five, a new study in India linksworm infection with growth falteringin children between one and fouryears old.As many as 150,000 children dieeach year from intestinal obstructionand other abdominal complicationscaused by large adult worms. In mil-lions more, worms are a significantcause of malnutrition, stunting growthand causing severe anaemia, dysen-tery, delayed puberty and problemswith learning and memory. In 1990,an estimated 44 million pregnantwomen were infected with hook-worm; their foetuses, therefore, wereat risk of retarded intrauterine growth,prematurity and low birthweight.Transmission is insidiously easy,especially where hygiene and sanita-tion are inadequate. A child walkingbarefoot can pick up hookworm; byputting a dirty finger in her mouth,she may ingest roundworm eggs. Itis not uncommon for a child to carryup to1,000 hookworms, round-worms and peoplehave roundworms, making it thethird most common human infectionin the world. Whipworm infects 1 bil- 84 8 6lion people, including nearly one thirdof all children in Africa. More than 1.3billion people carry hookworm intheir gut, and 265 million people areinfected with schistosomes, the para-sites that cause the debilitating dis-ease of schistosomiasis.Worms affect nutrition in severalways, ingesting blood and leading tothe loss of iron and other nutrients.Worms also cause the lining of theintestines to change, which reducesthe surface membrane available fordigestion and absorption. As a result,fat, certain carbohydrates, proteinsand several vitamins (including vita-min A) are not absorbed properly.Lactose intolerance and poor use ofavailable iron can also result.Treatment is simple and relativelyinexpensive. A single dose of anti-worm medicine such as Meben-dazole costs as little as 3 cents andcan eliminate or significantly reduceintestinal worm infections. The totalcost of treatment programmes is typ-ically $1 to $2 per year per person.Controlled experiments inIndia,Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar andTanzania have proved that the ther-apy works for months at a time.UNICEF, WHO and the World Bankhave identified pre-school and school-age children, women of childbearingage and adolescent girls as thosewho would benefit most from wormcontrol programmes.The benefits are impressive. Aninnovative study in Kenya in 1994,which used motion detectors on thethighs of school children, found thatridding the youngsters of high levelsof hookworm improved physical ac-tivity. Dewormed children reportedbetter appetites and an end to ab-dominal pains and headaches. Withinnine weeks, the treated group showedbetter growth, weight gain (both in terms of fat deposits and musclemass), physical activity and ap-petite than the untreated group.Numerous studieshave alsonoted the mental and cognitive ef-fects of anaemia in children in-fected with worms, with intellec-tual performance improving aftertreatment.In a large-scale study done inIndia in 1996, two groups of chil-dren ages one to four years re-ceived twice-yearly vitamin A sup-plements; one group was alsogiven deworming tablets. At theend of the trial, the children in thegroup given worm treatmentwere on average 1kg heavierthan the children who were nottreated. The study shows not onlythat mass deworming can im-prove the weights of young chil-dren in areas where worms arecommon, but it also opens up thepractical possibility of combiningworm treatment with vitamin Asupplementation in areas at risk.Some believe that dewormingis not a satisfactory solution be-cause it must be repeated in theabsence of improved sanitation,hygiene and health education,and reinfection occurs deworm-ing reduces helminths' drain onchildren's development at criticaltimes in their lives, at least untilthe causes and conditions of envi-ronmental contamination and in-fection are successfully addressed.

Learning andmemory suffer Here, a girl attendsschool in India.ing interaction with parentsand peers.The parents of young children every-where need regular contact withpeople who can help check their chil-dren's growth and development andcan provide advice and support onbreastfeeding and complementaryfeeding. In many communities, par-ents and caregivers will also needboth advice on and access to supple-ments of vitamin A, iron, iodine andother micronutrients. Support in theseareas might best be provided throughestablished formal institutionshealth centres, clinics or pre-schoolcentres (Panel 21). But where such fa-cilities do not exist or do not function,children cannot wait for them to bebuilt or staffed.Communities must receive over-all support in their efforts to ensurethat all families have access to basicpreventive actions to improve thenutrition of children and pregnantwomen. This includes strengthenedhealth services to prevent and treatdisease, and increased support tostimulate early child learning, careand development.None of the preventive and sup-portive actions to promote child growthand development described in this re-port require a doctor or nurse or atrained educator. Communities can behelped to organize themselves to pro-vide or administer these services, andin most communities, groups that cantake on these responsibilities alreadyexist.Communities canalsobehelped to assess their own priorityproblems and can learn to monitor theeffectiveness of their actions, re-designing their own programmes ac-cordingly. Combined with the use ofeffective low-cost technologies, theadoption of these measures could re-sult in rapid improvements not only inchild survival but also in child devel-opment, nutritional status and learn-ing capacity.87A girl enjoys an ear of corn in the UnitedStates, where researchers have developed anew strain of corn that increases the body'sability to absorb iron. 85 Panel 21Child nutrition a priority for the new South Africa Under apartheid, South Africahad a highly sophisticatedmedical research infrastruc-ture that served the white minority,pioneering heart transplants, for ex-ample. Yet the majority of the peoplewere left with poor health and nutri-tion care. The advent of democraticrule in 1994, however, changed allthat. The Government is now reori-enting the health system to theneeds of the majority, and child nu-trition is a priority.Establishing a community-levelnutrition monitoring system is an im-portant part of this effort, and onearea where this approach is takingshape is the Bergville district ofKwaZulu-Natal Province. Child healthand nutrition problems in the prov-ince are among the most challengingin the country. Over half the children 86live in poverty, nearly 40 per centhave vitamin A deficiency, up to onequarter of the children in rural areasare stunted, and iodine deficiency isa problem in mountainous areas. Tenper cent of children ages six monthsto five years suffer from anaemia,which is also prevalent among preg-nant women, and low birthweight iscommon.In the Bergville district, with apopulation of 120,000, a network ofcommunity health workers and healthassistants is being trained as part ofthe new Child Survival Programme.The approach, based on regularweighing of young children in theirhomes to monitor growth, is similarto that used successfully in other de-veloping countries during the pastdecade. Health workers will use theweighing sessions to discuss chil-8 6dren's growth with their families, re-inforcing positive trends and ex-ploringreasons behind falteringgrowth to devise solutions. To carryout the programme, the number ofcommunity health workers in the dis-trict will be expanded significantly.The main objective is to cover allfamilies, including the poorest andmost marginalized.Community participation in plan-ning and operating health services isat the core of the programme. Com-munity members formed a healthforum in 1994, which serves as thesteering committee of the Child Sur-vival Programme. The group hashelped establish a district hospitalboard and local committees to su-pervise health workers and has or-ganized workshops on the newprogramme.Since 1996, resources for healthcare have been channelled more eq-uitably to disadvantaged provincessuch as KwaZulu-Natal, and this willhelp finance the improved health ser-vices. The University of Natal inPietermaritzburg is taking a leadingrole in supporting child growth mon-itoring in the Bergville district. In ad-dition, World Vision of South Africa,an NGO which has been active inthe district since 1980, has helped laythe groundwork for the programmethrough various community devel-opment projects. These include localleadership training, skills training forwomen's groups, support for a pre-school and cr\u00e8che programme andcooperation with the health servicein addressing malnutrition.The new system for monitoringgrowth is sorely needed, accordingto a recent survey, which found thatwhile most mothers had a health ser-vices card for monitoring child growth,many of the cards were either left blank or were incomplete. Thesurvey also found that very littlenutritional counselling had ac-companied growth new programme facesmany difficulties: arestretched, personnel must betrained and there must be out-reach into communities. Nonethe-less, the new partnerships beingforged between government, theuniversity, NGOs and communi-ties represent an approach thatholds promise for the future.A major effort to tackle vitaminA deficiency is also under way.Within months after the new Gov-ernment took office, the SouthAfrican Vitamin A ConsultativeGroup launched the country'slargest-ever nutrition survey, cov-ering nearly 20,000 households.The survey found that one third ofchildren ages six months to fiveyears are vitamin A deficient or onthe borderline. The Governmentand non-governmental partnersare gearing up to address the prob-lem. Steps planned include givingvitamin A supplements to youngchildren and to mothers shortlyafter giving birth, fortifying staplefoods with vitamin A and encour-aging the production and con-sumption of vitamin A-rich foods. Photo: In South Africa, community healthworkers weigh children and discussgrowth promotion with their families.It has often been said that meetingthis challenge is a matter of politicalwill. In a $28 trillion global economy,the problem is surely not a lack of re-sources. But it may be more useful tosee the challenge as a matter of politi-cal choice. Governments in poor andrich countries alike may choose toallow children to be intellectually dis-abled, physically stunted and vulnera-ble to illness in childhood and laterlife. This is the price of doing little ornothing to ensure good nutrition.But governments could instead re-solve to move to consolidate lessonsalready learned about reducing mal-nutrition. They could do everythingpossible to mount massive actionsthat can clearly succeed and that canbe implemented by communities them-selves. And they could encourageresearch on, and implementation of,new and better actions.For the well-being and protectionof children and the human develop-ment of the world, the course of ac-tion is clear. 89Governments could insteadresolve to move to consolidatelessons already learned aboutreducing malnutrition. Theycould do everything possibleto mount massive actions thatcan clearly succeed and thatcan be implemented bycommunities themselves. 87 References The silent emergency 1.Gillespie, Stuart, 'Increased MaternalMortality Risk', section 5.1 in MajorIssues in EffectiveApproaches for the Prevention andControl of Iron Deficiency: Anoverview prepared for theMicronutrient Initiative draft).

GENERAL NOTE ON THE DATA PAGE92EXPLANATION OF SYMBOLS PAGE92UNDER-FIVE MORTALITY RANKINGS PAGE93REGIONAL PAGE124 91 General noteon the data Explanation ofsymbols 92Four major changes have been made to thestatistical tables in The State of the World'sChildren 1998 report.First, the less populous countries, whichwere previously presented in a separate table,have been merged into the main tables. Eachof the eight tables now lists 193 countries.Second, only independent, sovereign coun-tries are listed; these include all countriesthat are members of the United Nations andall countries that have ratified the Conventionon the Rights of the Child.Third, countries are now listed alphabeti-cally in each table rather than in descendingorder of their under-five mortality rate (U5MR).However, because this rate is a crucial indicator,countries ranked in order of their U5MR arelisted on the page opposite this note. Everytable also includes a column providing theU5MR rank of each country. The index tocountries, which appeared before table 1 inprevious reports, has been eliminated.Fourth, the regional summary for eachtable now appears with its relevant table.The data presented in these tables areaccompanied by definitions, sources and ex-planations of symbols. The tables are derivedfrom many sources and thus will inevitablycontain a wide range of data quality. Officialgovernment data received by the responsibleUnited Nations agency have been used when-ever possible. In the many cases where thereare no reliable official figures, estimatesmade by the responsible United Nationsagency have been used. Where such interna-tionally standardized estimates do not exist,the tables draw on other sources, particularlydata received from the appropriate UNICEFfield office. Where possible, only comprehen-sive or representative national data havebeen used.Data quality is likely to be adverselyaffected for countries that have recently Since the aim of this statistics chapter is toprovide a broad picture of the situation ofchildren and women worldwide, detailed dataqualifications and footnotes are seen as moreappropriate for inclusion elsewhere. Onlythree symbols are used to classify the tabledata.94suffered from man-made or natural disasters.This is particularly so where basic countryinfrastructure has been fragmented or majorpopulation movements have occurred.Data for life expectancy, total fertilityrate, crude birth and death rates, etc. are partof the regular work on estimates and projec-tions undertaken by the United NationsPopulation Division. These and other interna-tionally produced estimates are revisedperiodically, which explains why some of thedata will differ from those found in earlierUNICEF publications.In addition, the statistical tables in thepresent report contain new data from recentMultiple Indicator Cluster Surveys. Thesesurveys were carried out in 1995 and 1996 bymore than 60 countries worldwide as ameans of assessing the progress made forchildren in the context of the goals of theWorld Summit for Children.Two new indicators have also been intro-duced. 'Per cent of routine EPI vaccinesfinanced by government', the first of thesenew indicators, appears in table 3. This indi-cator reflects a country's capacity to immu-nize children as an integral part of its healthcare system. It replaces the previous indica-tor entitled 'per cent of population with accessto health services', which although of interestto many has been eliminated because of thepoor quality of the data.'Per cent of population below $1 per day',the second new indicator, can be found intable 6. This indicator is now used by theWorld Bank and is a more explicit monetarymeasure of international poverty than the in-dicator it replaces. Previous reports definedabsolute poverty as the income level belowwhich a minimum nutritionally adequate diet,plus essential non-food requirements, wasnot affordable. Indicates data are not available. xIndicates data that refer to years or periodsother than those specified in the columnheading, differ from the standard defini-tion, or refer to only part of a country. yIndicates that survey data were used forestimating net primary school enrolment(in table 4 only).

FromUNICEF's point of view, in particular, there is aneed for an agreed method of measuring thelevel of child well-being and its rate ofchange.The under-five mortality rate (U5MR) isused in table 8 (next page) as the principal in-dicator of such progress.The U5MR has several advantages. First,it measures an end result of the developmentprocess rather than an 'input' such as schoolenrolment level, per capita calorie availability,or the number of doctors per thousand popu-lationall of which are means to an end.Second, the U5MR is known to be the re-sult of a wide variety of inputs: the nutritionalhealth and the health knowledge of mothers;the level of immunization and ORT use; theavailability of maternal and child health ser-vices (including prenatal care); income andfood availability in the family; the availabilityof clean water and safe sanitation; and theoverall safety of the child's environment.Third, the U5MR is less susceptible than,say, per capita GNP to the fallacy of the aver-age. This is because the natural scale doesnot allow the children of the rich to be onethousand times as likely to survive, even if theman-made scale does permit them to haveone thousand times as much income. In otherwords, it is much more difficult for a wealthyminority to affect a nation's U5MR, and ittherefore presents a more accurate, if far fromperfect, picture of the health status of the ma-jority of children (and of society as a whole).For these reasons, the U5MR is chosen byUNICEF as its single most important indicatorof the state of a nation's children. That is whythe tables rank the nations of the world not inascending order of their per capita GNP but indescending order of their under-five mortalityrates.The speed of progress in reducing theU5MR can be measured by calculating its av-erage annual reduction rate (AARR). Unlikethe comparison of absolute changes, theAARR reflects the fact that the lower limits toU5MR are approached only with increasingdifficulty. As lower levels of under-five mor-tality are reached, for example, the same ab-solutereductionobviously represents agreater percentage of reduction. The AARRtherefore shows a higher rate of progress for,say, a 10-point reduction if that reduction hap-pens at a lower level of under-five mortality.(A fall in U5MR of 10 points from 100 to 90represents a reduction of 10 per cent, whereasthe same 10-point fall from 20 to 10 repre-sents a reduction of 50 per cent).When usedin conjunction with GNPgrowth rates, the U5MR and its reduction ratecan therefore give a picture of the progressbeing made by any country or region, and overany period of time, towards the satisfaction ofsome of the most essential of human needs.As table 8 shows, there is no fixed rela-tionship between the annual reduction rate ofthe U5MR and the annual rate of growth inper capita GNP. Such comparisons help tothrow the emphasis on to the policies, priori-ties, and other factors which determine theratio between economic and social progress.Finally, the table gives the total fertilityrate for each country and its average annualrate of reduction. It will be seen that many ofthe nations that have achieved significant re-ductions in their U5MR have also achievedsignificant reductions in fertility. 12 123 Table 8: The rate of progress Under-5mortalityUnder-5mortalityrateAverage annualrate of 116 27 6.6Moldova, Rep. of 1028852322.63.06.5-8.23.32.51.91.41.7Monaco 175 6127 125 Table 8: The rate of progress 38 6.54.8Saint Lucia 127 22 10.1 3.9Saint Vincent/Grenadines 123 23 77210100533.74.06.2 0.28.35.93.91.72.6San summaries Sub-Saharan AfricaMiddle East and North AfricaSouth AsiaEast Asia and PacificLatin CaribbeanCEE/CIS and Baltic StatesIndustrialized countriesDeveloping countriesLeast developed countriesWorldCountries in each region are listed page 122.Under-5mortalityrateAverage annualrate indicators Main data sources Under-five mortality rate - Probability of dying between birth and exactly five yearsof age expressed per 1,000 live births.GNP per capita- Gross national product (GNP) is the sum of gross value added by allresident producers, plus any taxes that are not included in the valuation of output, plus netreceipts of primary income from non-resident sources.

largely a silent and invisible emergency, exacting a terrible tollon children and their families. The result of multiple causes, including a lackof food, common and preventable infections, inadequate care and unsafe water,it plays a role in more than half of the nearly 12 million deaths each year ofchildren under five in developing countries, a proportion unmatched since theBlack Death ravaged Europe in the 14th century. Malnutrition blunts intellectsand saps the productivity and potential of entire societies.
