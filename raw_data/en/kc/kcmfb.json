A Plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycle was utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of IV C in cancer patients. Results: A total number of twenty (N=20) charts of participants who received IV C therapy for different types of cancer were reviewed. There were fourteen females (N=14, 70%) and six males (N=6, 30%) who underwent the therapy. Seven (N=7, 35%) of the patients received IV C/Traditional and thirteen (N=13, 65%) received IV C only.
