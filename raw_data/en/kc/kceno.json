A brief history of sound therapy Tibetan singing bowl massage is based on the [principles of Indian Ayurvedic medicine](https://www.mandira-ayurveda.at/en/ayurvedic-medicine-tcm/), which has been using sound therapy for over 5,000 years. Even back then, there was an awareness of the effect of sound on body and mind, and many peoples believed that sound was the source of humanity's creation. This distinctive form of Ayurvedic therapy originated in Tibet, the Roof of the World. Monks used the bowls in religious ceremonies in much the same way that we use church bells. Realising that the deep and powerful sounds had a profound effect, they began using singing bowls outside the temple for meditation, deep relaxation, and to help find inner peace. Chakras: energy healing and harmony According to [Ayurvedic teaching](https://www.mandira-ayurveda.at/en/ayurvedic-medicine-tcm/) on the Chakras, the flow of the body's seven energy centres is essential for health. The Chakras must be balanced, otherwise the human body is vulnerable to disorders and illnesses. This is where the singing bowl massage comes into its own: when things are off balance - which can happen all too easily in our fast-paced world - the comforting sounds of the bowls can help us to restore balance and experience energy healing. What happens during a singing bowl massage? To start, a bowl is placed at the soles of the feet and gently struck. You can feel the vibration throughout your body. Performed while you are fully clothed, additional bowls are placed along the body's Chakras and also struck - the more relaxed you are, the more intensely you perceive the sound. The effect is intense, as it not only relaxes the muscles, but also awakens mind, body and soul as your entire being reacts to the sounds. As every cell in the body vibrates, the effect is deeply relaxing. This can manifest in a pleasant feeling of warmth flooding the body. When the body is relaxed, the mind can relax too. One effect leads to another as it also activates the body's self-healing powers and balances disharmony. Uses of singing bowl massage The sounds of this ancient Tibetan treatment primarily promote deep relaxation, so it is especially suitable for people who struggle to relax and as a result exhibit symptoms such as: According to the Ayurvedic teachings, the serene sounds of the singing bowls have a positive effect on both the body and mind. Tibetan singing bowl massage is more than just a physical experience; the holistic approach of Tibetan medicine also incorporates the mind and soul. This type of energy healing is a component of Ayurveda, which forms the medical basis for this Tibetan massage. The treatment also has a positive effect on: Is singing bowl massage suitable for children? Children are particularly sensitive to voices and sounds, and can therefore feel the positive effects of sound therapy very intensely. Sound therapy can be used to enhance concentration, perception and creativity. ARE THERE SIDE EFFECTS? In the vast majority of cases, singing bowl massage only has positive effects.
