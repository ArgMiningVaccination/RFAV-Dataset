Yet policies which seek to reach that objective have involved harsh law-enforcement and even militarisation. These end up affecting the most vulnerable people who use drugs, subsistence farmers involved in illegal crop cultivation and small-scale traffickers because they are easier to apprehend than are wealthy and well-connected people. The collateral damages are human rights and lives - those of the most vulnerable and those of the voiceless. To quote the Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights (May 2018), in a world that is meant to be more inclusive and where no one should be left behind, 'people who use drugs are not left behind. They are left outside' . A decade ago, the international community reiterated its aspiration to achieve a drug-free world. Yet over that decade, available data shows that the production, sale, and consumption of currently illegal drugs are soaring. So are the harms related to current policies, with dramatic increases in overdoses, prison overcrowding, HIV and hepatitis transmission, a more revenue-generating and increasingly violent illegal market, and in the condoning by some of extrajudicial killings against people who use drugs - killings that often take place in broad daylight. Ten years after the world's governments adopted at the UN the Political Declaration and Plan of Action on drugs, there is still little discussion on how to evaluate the impact of current policies, or on how to analyse the results of the policies implemented during this period. In 2014, there was a mid-term High-Level Review of the Political Declaration and Plan of Action. It resulted in a new negotiated document that reiterated the commitments, without providing any such 'High-Level Review' . Two years later, the 2016 UNGASS on drugs provided another opportunity to review the current approach, to no avail. Although progress was made in bringing in more visibility to issues related to health, human rights and development, the resulting Outcome Document failed to recognise the harmful consequences of the war on drugs approach. The international community is meeting again at a Ministerial Segment at the Commission on Narcot - ic Drugs in March 2019 to decide upon a common strategy for the next ten years. But how can we plan the future without a serious and far-ranging assessment of the past's errors and successes? How can we quantify the unintended consequences of drug control policies when they are not evaluat - ed? Up until now, no comprehensive evaluation has been carried out either on progress towards achieving the 2009 targets or on the consequences of the past decade in global drug control on human rights, health, security, development, the environ- ment, and on the lives of the millions of affected people worldwide. Furthermore, there is little appetite among countries for such a review from the UN, proving once more that drug policy remains mostly an ideological issue rather than a societal topic that needs to be addressed based on evidence, dialogue, and building consensus. In that vacuum, I welcome this Civil Society Shadow Report in which the International Drug Policy Consortium which provides us with an excellent overview of the progress and the lack of it made in the last decade, as well as highlighting the challenges and opportunities ahead - using all existing government-based and UN-based data, along with scientific and grey literature. What we learn from the shadow report is compel- ling. Since governments started collecting data on drugs in the 1990s - based on the seizures of illegal substances, on the arrests of people who use drugs and their admission to treatment ser - vices, and on the eradication of illegal crops - the cultivation, consumption and illegal trafficking of Credit: Global Commission on Drug Policy Rt Hon Helen Clark Taking stock: A decade of drug policyTaking stock: A decade of drug policyii Member of the Global Commission on Drug Policy Former Prime Minister of New Zealand, 1999-2008 Former Administrator of the United Nations Devel- opment Programme, 2009-2017drugs have reached record levels. Moreover, current drug policies are a serious obstacle to other social and economic objectives: progress on combating the HIV epidemic had been significant in the last 20 years, but is now stalled among people who inject drugs; prison overcrowding has worsened, with a fifth of the world's inmates being arrested for drug-related offences and mostly for drug use alone; and the 'war on drugs' has resulted in mil- lions of people murdered, disappeared, or internally displaced. As the situation stands today, the major Sustainable Development Goals that concern gen- der equality, the protection of the environment, socioeconomic development, and the reduction of violence and corruption will not be achieved for an important part of the population because of current drug policies. But there is still hope for a better outcome and for the international community to do better during the 2019 high-level meeting. While the possibility of building a new negotiated political declaration and plan of action is unlikely with the lack of any monitoring and assessment apart from the current Shadow Report, the Vienna-based consensus that Rt Hon Helen Clarkhas driven countries to agree on the paths to control drugs is breaking, both at the multilateral and at the regional levels. It is our hope, at the Global Commission on Drug Policy, that the next decade in global drug policy will align with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to alleviate the pain and suffering of millions of people affected by current drug policies, with the objective of leaving no one behind. By providing the most comprehensive assessment of the past lost decade, I am certain that this Civil Society Shadow Report will greatly contribute to the global drug control debates and ensure that the coming decade will be better embedded in the international community's priorities of human rights, development, peace and security. 1 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade

The important role of civil society in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of global drug policies is recognised in the 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action on drugs, as well as in the Outcome Document of the 2016 United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on drugs. It is in this spirit that the International Drug Policy Consortium (IDPC) has produced this Shadow Report, to contribute constructively to high-level discussions on the next decade in global drug policy. Background In 2009, the international community agreed on a 10-year global drug strategy with the adoption of the 'Political Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem' . Article 36 of the Political Declaration es- tablished 2019 'as a target date for states to elimi- nate or reduce significantly and measurably' the illicit cultivation, production, trafficking and use of internationally controlled substances, the diversion of precursors, and money-laundering. As this target date is fast approaching, member states have agreed to hold a two-day Ministerial Segment at the 62nd Session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) to take stock of progress made and delineate the global drug strategy for the next decade. Both the mid-term review of the 2009 Political Declaration in 2014 and the 2016 UNGASS were missed opportunities for an honest and objec - tive review of the successes and failures of global drug policies since 2009. Only a few months away from the 2019 high-level event, no comprehensive review of the impacts of drug policies worldwide has yet been undertaken. This Civil Society Shadow Report seeks to fill this gap, firstly by assessing the progress made, or lack thereof, against the objec - tives set in the 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action. Secondly, the Report considers whether global drug policy has contributed to, or under - mined, the broader priorities of the UN of protect - ing human rights, advancing peace and security, and promoting development. Evaluating progress made against the targets included in Article 36 of the 2009 Political Declaration Target 1: Eliminate or reduce significantly and measurably 'the illicit cultivation of opium pop - py, coca bush and cannabis plant' . Data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) shows no reduction in the global scale of cultiva- tion of opium, coca and cannabis between 2009 and 2018. Over this period, cultivation has in fact increased by 125% for opium poppy and by 30% for coca bush. As for cannabis, although recent global estimates are unavailable, the UNODC concluded that cultivation was reported in 145 countries in the period 2010-2016, with no sign of reduction. Target 2: Eliminate or reduce significantly and measurably 'the illicit demand for narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances; and drug related health and social risks' . The overall number of people aged 15 to 64 who used drugs at least once in 2016 is estimated at 275 million, representing a 31% increase since 2009. The main drug of choice remains cannabis, followed by opioids and amphet - amines. The UNODC estimates that the global HIV prevalence among people who inject drugs has remained stable at 11.8%, as has the global prev - alence of hepatitis C at 51.9% and tuberculosis at Key conclusions Data from the Shadow Report show that the targets and commitments made in the 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action have not been achieved, and in many cases have resulted in counter- productive policies. The Shadow Report highlights the urgent need to conduct more comprehensive and balanced research and evaluations on the impacts of drug policies worldwide, taking into account government data, but also academic research and civil society findings. The Shadow Report concludes that mem- ber states should identify more meaning- ful drug policy goals and targets in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the UNGASS Outcome Document and international human rights commitments.

Although tighter national, regional and global policies and regulations have been adopted to counter money-laundering, the amount of money laundered globally each year amounts to US$ 800 million to 2 trillion, representing 2 to 5% of global GDP - with a quarter of overall revenues of transnational organised crime proceeding from drug sales. The global drug market is currently estimated to turnover between US$ 426 and 652 billion. Of this, well over half of the gross profits generated are channelled into money-laundering, and less than 1% of the total amount of money being laundered is seized. Assessing progress made towards the 2009 Plan of Action against the broader priorities of the United Nations This section of the Shadow Report assesses progress made towards selected actions of the 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action. Progress is evaluat - ed against the broader UN priorities of protecting human rights, promoting peace and security, and advancing development. Protecting human rights Over the past decade, overly punitive drug policies focusing on eradicating the illegal drug market have been associated with wide-ranging human rights violations and threats to public health and order. These abuses have had dire implications on the lives of marginalised people and communities worldwide. The right to life: At least 3,940 people were executed for a drug offence over the past decade, 8%. Meanwhile, the number of drug-related deaths reached 450,000 in 2015, with a third to half of those related to overdoses, and the rest associated with HIV and hepatitis C. Target 3: Eliminate or reduce significantly and measurably 'the illicit production, manufacture, marketing and distribution of, and trafficking in, psychotropic substances, including syn- thetic drugs' . Available UN data shows ongoing production and use of methamphetamines across the world with an expanding market in North and West Africa, North America, East and South East Asia and Oceania. In parallel, between 2009 and 2017, over 800 new psychoactive substances (NPS) have emerged on the global drug market, while the UN- ODC states that the illegal use of prescription drugs has reached record levels in various parts of the world, especially North America. Target 4: Eliminate or reduce significantly and measurably 'the diversion of and illicit traffick - ing in precursors' . Despite efforts made by member states to control and monitor precursor chemicals, over the past five years the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) has reported an increase in the use and number of precursors in illegal drug production. Furthermore, although seizures of precursor chemicals like potassium permanganate (used in the manufacture of cocaine) increased from 92,702 kg in 2012 to 585,072 kg in 2016, global co - caine production has risen by 44% since 2009.

Since 2009, various countries, including India, Iran, Malaysia, Palestine and Thailand, have taken steps to reduce or eliminate the use of capital punishment for drug offences, while others are considering reinstating the practice with bills in progress in Bangladesh, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. The recent escalation of punitive drug policies in South and South East Asia has resulted in the extrajudicial killings of over 27,000 people under Rodrigo Duterte's Presidency of the Philippines since June 2016. The right to health: Despite increases in the num- ber of countries providing various harm reduction interventions, only 1% of people who inject drugs worldwide live in countries with adequate cov - erage of both needle and syringe programmes (NSPs) and opioid substitution therapy (OST). Access to harm reduction is even more limited in prisons and other places of detention, resulting in the prevalence of HIV, hepatitis B and tuber - culosis among people in prison being two to ten times higher than among the general population. The surge in overdose deaths - in particular in the United States where over 71,000 people died of an overdose in 2017 alone - is also a major issue of concern. While the federal response in the United States has overwhelmingly been law enforcement focused, Canada - which has also been affect - ed by a surge in overdose deaths - has adopted a number of public health measures, including the opening of 25 new drug consumption rooms since 2016. The criminalisation and stigmatisation of people who use drugs has been identified by a number of UN agencies as a major barrier to accessing service provision. At national level, 26 countries have adopted a decriminalisation model to facilitate access to health services and reduce stigma and prison overcrowding. Meanwhile, 75% of the world population, concen- trated in the Global South, remain without access to essential medications for pain relief, while 92% of morphine is being used by just 17% of the world population. Overall reforms remain inadequate to address this issue. However, countries such as Costa Rica, India, Mexico, Uganda and Ukraine have recently taken various steps to improve access to morphine for palliative care and pain relief, and 48 countries have now established medicinal cannabis systems for a number of ailments. Criminal justice rights and right to be free from torture: The Shadow Report also sheds light on the human rights associated with incarceration and dis- proportionate punishments. According to UN data, one in five prisoners worldwide is incarcerated for drug offences, the overwhelmi ng majority of whom for drug possession for personal use. In certain re - gions, this proportion is even greater for women, as is the case in various Latin American countries, and in Thailand where over 80% of the 47,000 wom- en in prison are incarcerated for a drug offence. In several countries, drug offenders also continue to be victims of excessive punishments, sometimes including acts of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. This includes forced urine Credit: Juan Fernandez Ochoa, IDPC Only 1 in 100 people who inject drugs lives in a country with adequate coverage of both NSP and OST75%of theworld remain without access to proper pain relief treatment.92% of the global supply of morphine is used by 17% of the world populaon.Credit: Juan Fernandez Ochoa, IDPC10 Taking stock: A decade of drug policycountries are now considered as drug trafficking hubs, with the collusion between high-level officials and traffickers constituting a major threat to securi- ty, governance and development. Posing an additional layer of complexity, the devel- opment of crypto-drug markets has forced policy makers to adapt their law enforcement strategies. However, available data show that only 17% of crypto-drug markets were closed down as a result of drug law enforcement interventions; the rest having been shut down because of exit scams, vol- untary closure or hacking. Further studies conclud- ed that only a small minority of those purchasing drugs in crypto-drug markets stopped using these markets because of drug law enforcement action - putting into question the efficacy of current drug control efforts. Nevertheless, the rise in the use of online drug markets has led to interesting devel- opments in the field of health and harm reduction. For instance, online forums within crypto-drug markets have facilitated peer-based reviews and feedback on drug purchases, sellers, purity and effects of products bought online, enabling peo - ple who use drugs to reduce health harms, and facilitating discussions on the availability of drug support services. Advancing development Tracking progress towards development - and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - consti- tutes the third key analytical research area of this Shadow Report. Evidence collected for the Re - port shows that drug control efforts have mainly testing, compulsory registration requirements, in- carceration in compulsory detention centres and corporal punishment, including on children. At the same time, tens of thousands of people have recently been arbitrarily arrested in Cambodia and Bangladesh for suspected involvement in illicit drug activities. Although discussions have been held at regional and international levels on these issues, on the ground little progress has been made to remedy these human rights abuses. Promoting peace and security Instead of reducing the overall scale of the illegal drug market, overly punitive drug policies have of- ten exacerbated violence, instability and corruption. In the case of opium, while cultivation fell in South and South East Asia over the past decade, it has in- creased significantly in Afghanistan which now pro - duces 86% of the world's opium. Academic research concluded that forced eradication campaigns had led to increased levels of crime, an ongoing Talib - an insurgency and militias remaining active in the region, with severe consequences for subsistence farmers. Similarly, despite forced crop eradication campaigns in Colombia, coca cultivation increased by 115% between 2009 and 2016. Interdiction ef- forts in the country have resulted in violent clashes between affected communities and the police and the military, forcing millions of people to be inter - nally displaced. In Mexico, a militarised war on drug cartels launched in 2006 resulted in over 150,000 deaths associated with the drug trade and more than 32,000 disappearances. In West Africa, several Credit: Juan Fernandez Ochoa, IDPC 1 in 5 prisoners worldwide are incarcerated fordrug oences83%~serve sentences for drug possession for personal useIn some parts of the world, over 80% of women incarcerated are serving sentences for drug-related oences. 11 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policyconsisted of eradication measures, with little atten- tion given to the critical development issues faced by affected communities in rural and urban contexts. Although alternative development has gained much visibility in UN forums and discussions over the past decade, such programmes have generally been used to justify crop eradication campaigns, rather than focusing on creating the conditions that im- prove people's livelihoods and reduce their depend- ence on illegal crop cultivation. The use of harmful pesticides to destroy drug crops has impacted upon the health of local communities and damaged the environment by displacing subsistence farmers into new, more remote areas, including national parks and indigenous territories. In Colombia, 32% of coca is cultivated in national parks and indigenous reserves. In recognition of concerns over human and environmental harms associated with harmful pesticides, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru and Thailand have banned the use of these chemical agents. While alternative development programmes have mostly been counter-productive, two country ex - amples stand out as more positive models. Since the 1960s, Thailand has adopted a long-term de - velopment strategy in areas where illegal opium cultivation was concentrated. This approach has led to reductions in poverty levels through increased access to education, employment, basic health and social services and infrastructure. On the other side of the world, since 2008 Bolivia has allowed farmers to grow a sufficient amount of coca for subsistence purposes, facilitating access to a national legal mar - ket for coca products, as well as improving access to safe water, education and other sources of income. Both the Thai and Bolivian models rely on strong community participation. As in areas of illicit crop cultivation, poverty has now been recognised as a main driver of engagement in illicit drug trafficking and other supply-side activi- ties. In Latin America, the overwhelming majority of women incarcerated for drug offences are first time, non-violent offenders, with limited formal educa- tion or employment opportunities and the sole care provider of several children and other dependents, who engage in illegal drug activities because of sit - uations of socio-economic vulnerability. Although these issues are better understood and visible in re - gional and global forums, few member states have taken action on the ground. Costa Rica is a notable exception. Since 2013, the country has adopted a number of reforms to reduce the high rate of incar - ceration of women in situation of vulnerability, by ensuring more proportionate sentences for certain Assessing progress onPeace and security Crypto-drug markets only 17% of the Global Drug Survey respondents said they would stop using CDMs following closures9% (50% said closures had no eect on their usage paerns) of crypto-drug markets close down due to law enforcement intervenonEradicaon and social conflictWar on drugs and violence 150,000Mexico'swar on drugs Launched in 2006, deaths has resulted in over 32,000 disappearances Forced internal displacement115% increase in coca culvaon (2009-2016) Forced eradicaon of coca crops in ColombiaSocialconflictCredit: Juan Fernandez Ochoa, IDPC12 Taking stock: A decade of drug policyConclusion The commitments and targets set in the 2009 Polit - ical Declaration and Plan of Action have not been achieved, and in many cases have resulted in coun- ter-productive policies. The Shadow Report also raises a number of issues on the past and future evaluation of global drug policies. Firstly, the Report highlights the urgent need to conduct more thor - ough and regular research on the broader range of impacts of drug policies at local, national, regional and international level. Secondly, and related to the need for more research, the Report puts into question the sources of data currently being be used for such formal evaluations. These rely heavily on government reporting. A more comprehensive and balanced picture of the situa- tion requires incorporating civil society and academ- ic research. This is particularly important for sensitive issues related to drug policy and human rights. And thirdly, the lack of progress made towards the drug-free targets, along with the negative conse - quences associated with efforts to achieve those tar - gets, mean that member states should reflect upon what to measure. Focusing exclusively on measur - ing the scale of the illegal drug market is clearly not enough to understand the impact of drug policy on the key UN Charter commitments to health, human rights, development, peace and security. The third section of this Shadow Report attempts to provide some recommendations which we hope will pro - vide a useful starting point for further discussions as to which goals and metrics could be considered for the post-2019 global drug strategy.drug offences, providing alternatives to incarcer - ations and offering social and health support for those in need. What next: Designing new benchmarks for global drug policy The 2016 UNGASS was instrumental in expanding the scope of global drug policy debates beyond the siloed three pillars of demand reduction, supply re - duction and international cooperation to also focus on health (including harm reduction and access to controlled medicines), development, human rights and new challenges. Going forward, this seven-pil- lar structure should prevail in global drug control debates. This Shadow Report demonstrates that the objec - tive of achieving a drug-free world is unrealistic and unachievable. The pursuit of 'drug-free world' targets has resulted in policies and punitive enforcement practices which have undermined health, human rights, development and security. Beyond 2019, the overall goals of global drug policy - as well as the metrics and indicators used to evaluate progress - urgently need to be reconsidered. New goals, met - rics and indicators should be aligned both with the UNGASS Outcome Document and the SDGs, and focus on the critical need to minimise drug-related health harms, improve access to healthcare, uphold basic human rights, ensure gender equality, reduce poverty in cultivation and trafficking areas, improve citizen safety and reduce corruption. A detailed list of indicators is proposed in the final section of the Shadow Report.community coca controlBolivia's Regulated legal cultivation Registered growers can grow on a limited extension of land.

Post-2019, member states should meaningfully reflect upon the impacts of drug control on the UN goals of promoting health, human rights, de - velopment, peace and security - and adopt drug policies and strategies that actively contribute to advancing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, especially for those most margin- alised and vulnerable. Global drug policy debates going forward should reflect the realities of drug policies on the ground, both positive and negative, and discuss constructively the resulting tensions with the UN drug control treaties and any human rights con- cerns associated with drug control efforts. Beyond 2019, UN member states should end pu- nitive drug control approaches and put people and communities first. This includes promoting and facilitating the participation of civil society and affected communities in all aspects of the design, implementation, evaluation and moni- toring of drug policies. 14 Taking stock: A decade of drug policyTaking stock: A decade of drug policy 15 Part 1 Introduction Taking stock: A decade of drug policy16 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy In March 2009, the 52nd session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) featured a High-Level Seg- ment held in Vienna,1 with a view to define the inter - national community's 10-year global drug strategy. The event resulted in the adoption, by consensus, of the '2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem' .2 In order to understand the implications of the 2009 process and the ensuing framework for international drug policy,3 it is critical to analyse the period running up to 2009. 1.1 The UNGASS decade: ' A drug-free world, we can do it' The first ever UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on drugs was held in 1990, at which member states adopted a Political Declaration to strengthen the global approach.4 Eight years later, UN member states assembled again in New York at a second UNGASS on the 'world drug problem' under the strapline 'A drug-free world, we can do i t '.5 Echoing this overarching objective, the UN International Drug Control Programme had origi- nally proposed the adoption, at the 1998 UNGASS, of the SCOPE plan - i.e. the 'Strategy for Coca and Opium Poppy Elimination' by 2008. Supported by the USA, the plan was met with strong criticism from NGO groups, and preventing its adoption became one of their main priorities. The fact that this plan was not adopted as the main outcome of the 1998 UNGASS was an important success for civil society.6 What remained of the SCOPE Plan was the inclusion, in the 1998 Political Declaration (S-20/2),7 of paragraph 19: 'Welcome the global ap - proach by the United Nations International Drug Control Programme to the elimination of illicit crops, and commit ourselves to working closely with the Programme to develop strategies with a view to eliminating or reducing significantly the illicit cultivation of the coca bush, the cannabis plant and the opium poppy by the year 2008' (emphasis add- ed).8 In a way, the SCOPE plan gave birth to the targets to eliminate the global illegal drug market with a first target period running until 2008, and which was then reiterated for the following dec - ade. 1998 also marked an important shift in focus from a historical emphasis on supply reduction to focus both on demand and supply, with the adop - tion of the 'Declaration on the guiding principles of drug demand reduction' .9 Ten years later, as the end of this 'UNGASS decade' was approaching, available data at the time showed no reduction in the overall scale of the illegal drug market.

UN drug control: The UNGASS decades, 1990-present18 Taking stock: A decade of drug policyon Drugs and Crime (UNODC) developed a 'contain- ment' rhetoric,10 explaining that statistical evidence showed that drug use prevalence had remained sta- ble since the 1909 Shanghai Commission. Drug use prevalence, the UNODC stated, had 'been contained to less than 5% of the adult population' .11 The con- tainment argument, however, was criticised for its reliance on 1909 data a benchmark for comparison - opium, for instance, was relied upon for the me - dicinal treatment of multiple illnesses in 1909, and its use then cannot be compared with non-medical opium or heroin use in the 21st century.12 In March 2008, Antonio Maria Costa also produced a seminal paper presented at the 51st session of the CND in the form of a conference room paper: 'Mak - ing drug control \"fit for pu rpose\": Building on the UNGASS decade' .13 Recognising that 'Some of the more ambitious targets set at UNGASS in 1998 re - main elusive' , the UNODC Executive Director open- ly acknowledged the 'unintended consequenc - es' associated with the dominant approach to drug control: 'A huge criminal black market that now thrives' 'Policy displacement' , with an imbalance of pub - lic resource allocation towards drug law enforce - ment at the expense of public health and social interventions 'Geographical displacement' , also called 'the balloon effect' , meaning that the rare successes in reducing cultivation or trafficking in one area merely lead to increases elsewhere 'Substance displacement' , with tighter controls on certain drugs leading suppliers and people who use drugs to turn to other substances, sometimes with unintended consequences for health 'The way we perceive and deal with the users of illicit drugs' , in other words, the stigmatisation of drug use, which has resulted in the margin- alisation and discrimination of people who use drugs and has negatively impacted their access to healthcare and social services.14 Meanwhile, in recognition of the severe conse - quences of punitive drug policies, reforms were materialising at national level, with an increasing number of governments supporting harm reduc - tion measures and moving towards the decriminal- isation of drug use and possession for personal use. It is in this context that member states initiated the negotiations process for the post-2008 global drug control strategy.1.2 The 10-year review of the 1998 Political Declaration The High-Level Segment of the 52nd session of the CND in 2009 concluded a year-long review of the 1998 UNGASS targets. To 'allow additional time for conducting an objective, scientific, balanced and transparent global assessment' ,15 member states had decided to divide the review process into three stages: A thematic debate at the 51st session of the CND in 2008 to discuss the outcomes of the assessment conducted by the UNODC on global progress against the 1998 Political Declaration.16 'Making drug control \"fit for purpose\"' was an integral part of this review. A 'period of reflection' during which five inter - governmental expert working groups17 elaborat - ed a number of recommendations on demand reduction, supply reduction, money-laundering and judicial cooperation, eradication of illegal drug crops and alternative development, and precursors and amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS).18 The conclusions of the expert working groups provided the materials upon which the new strategy post-2008 would be drafted. The negotiation of a new Political Declaration and Plan of Action, which was adopted by con- sensus at the High-Level Meeting of March 2009. Civil society used this review period to organise a se - ries of consultations and meetings. This culminated in the Global Civil Society Forum, held in July 2008 and attended by over 300 civil society representa- tives who worked together to agree on the 'Beyond 2008 Declaration' .19 The Declaration was formally presented at the 52nd session of the CND.20 1.3 The 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action: Setting a new target date The 2009 'Political Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrat - ed and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem' recognises that 'the commitments made by Member States in 1998 to attain signifi- cant and measurable results in the area of drug demand reduction have been attained only to a limited extent' and that 'despite some significant progress made in certain areas, efforts have not led to a significant overall decrease in the global illicit cultivation of crops used for the production 19 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policyof narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances' .21 However, in many respects, the 2009 Political Declaration is very similar to the declaration that emerged from the 1998 UNGASS and the objec - tives established in 2009 are comparable to those formulated ten years before: 'the ultimate goal of both demand and supply re - duction strategies and sustainable development strategies is to minimize and eventually elim- inate the availability and use of illicit drugs and psychotropic substances... We are determined to tackle the world drug problem and to actively promote a society free of drug abuse in order to ensure that all people can live in health, dignity and peace, with security and prosperity' .22 The objectives flowing from this goal led member states once again to: 'establish 2019 as a target date for States to eliminate or reduce significantly and measurably: a. The illicit cultivation of opium poppy, coca bush and cannabis plant; b. The illicit demand for narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances; and drug related health and social risks; c. The illicit production, manufacture, market - ing and distribution of, and trafficking in, psychotropic substances, including synthetic drugs; d. The diversion of and illicit trafficking in pre - cursors; e. Money-laundering related to illicit drugs' .23 The High-Level Segment itself reflected several points of contention between member states on the direction of global drug control, in particular on the concept of harm reduction. A few member states fought a long and protracted battle to include the term in the document, but it was eventually removed, even as a footnote, during the negotia- tions and ultimately replaced with the term 'related support services' . However, reflecting the increas- ing level of support for a health-based approach towards drug use, a group of 26 member states24 led by Germany made a joint statement at the 2009 Segment declaring that they would interpret the term 'related support services' to mean 'harm re - duction measures' .25 This was one of the early signs that cracks in the 'Vienna consensus'26 were forming. Nonetheless, in the years that followed, the Political Declaration - with its 'drug-free world' goals at the centre - became a key document of reference for the international community in its efforts to control the illegal drug market.1.4 The 2014 mid-term review of the 2009 Political Declaration: A missed opportunity The first occasion to review progress made against the goals established in 2009 was five years later in 2014, with the mid-term High-Level Review of the Political Declaration, held at the 57th session of the CND. The event, however, mainly consisted of country statements at a 2-day summit in Vienna and difficult negotiations over a consensus-based document, rather than an objective assessment of what had been achieved so far.27 While the discus- sions acknowledged the continued challenges re - lated to drug control, the resulting Joint Ministerial Statement mostly reiterated the themes of the 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action. The Joint Ministerial Statement28 also made no reference to the lack of progress made towards the achievement of the target of halving new HIV infections among people who use drugs by 2015, which had been agreed by the UN General Assembly through a ma- jority vote in the 2011 Political Declaration on HIV/ AIDS.29 In 2014, some unprecedented reforms had taken place at national level, and perhaps in reflection of these changes, reaching consensus at the UN became increasingly difficult. At the time, Bolivia had withdrawn from the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (the first and only country to do so) and re-acceded with a reservation on coca leaf chewing.30 Various US states31 and Uruguay32 had adopted regulatory regimes for non-medical can- nabis use, and around 20 countries had established a form of decriminalisation, whether de jure or de facto , of drug possession for personal use.33 In ad- dition, calls for more humane, health-centred drug policies - including a harm reduction approach and the abolition of the death penalty for drug offences - were increasingly vocal. These developments had a significant impact on the dynamics at the CND in Vienna. For the first time in the history of the international drug control re - gime, a member state (Ecuador) called in its official statement for a reform of one of the three UN drug conventions34 - breaking a taboo that had long remained sacrosanct at the CND. These views were met by a more conservative front led by the Russian Federation.35 It is unsurprising, therefore, that it took over nine months for the Joint Ministerial Statement to be negotiated during intense debates, resulting in a relatively bland, watered-down document. The difficult negotiations contributed to a growing sense of frustration among many member states.36 20 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy1.5 The 2016 UNGASS: The winds of change Even before the 2014 high-level review, a sense of exasperation was growing amongst those states seeking reform, particularly in Latin America, a re - gion which was experiencing increasing levels of violence as a result of overly punitive drug policies. At the 2012 Summit of the Americas, most of the presidents of the region met privately to discuss drug policy and called on the Organization of Amer - ican States (OAS) to analyse the results of present policies and explore alternatives. Shortly thereaf- ter, the governments of Colombia, Guatemala and Mexico were successful in getting the issue of drug policy reform on the UN agenda. At the 2012 UN General Assembly meeting, those countries issued a formal statement underscoring the need to 'review the approach' of present drug policies and called on the UN to 'exercise its leadership...and conduct a profound reflection to analyze all available op - tions, including regulatory or market measures, in order to establish a new paradigm that prevents the flow of resources to groups involved in organized crime' . The statement concludes by asking the UN to host 'an international conference to allow the necessary decisions to be made in order to achieve more effective strategies and tools with which the global community faces the challenges of drugs and their consequences' .37 The convening of a third UNGASS on drugs was agreed within the Omnibus Resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 2012.38 Opening session of the 2016 UNGASS on drugsCredit: Marie Nougier, IDPC Held in New York on 19 to 21 April 2016, the third UNGASS on drugs was characterised by surface consensus and underlying conflict. As was the case in 2014, negotiating the UNGASS Outcome Doc - ument39 was highly challenging, the divide being greater than ever on the key substantive issues of global drug control.40 Once again, human rights, the death penalty in particular, and harm reduc - tion were at the forefront of the tensions between member states.41 While strong statements on these issues were made throughout the proceedings, neither was explicitly included as such within the final declaration, although key harm reduction interventions were referenced for the first time in such a high-level document on drug control.42 These underlying tensions reflected a deeper divi- sion between the narrative of achieving a 'drug-free society' and the view that this goal is unattainable and that drug policies should be trying to manage the 'drug problem' in a way that minimises poten- tial harms as much as possible for individuals and affected communities. The resultant 26 page-long Outcome Document was a significant improvement over previous high-level declarations on drug pol- icy, with unprecedented visibility given to certain human rights concerns (e.g. abuses in the context of law enforcement, proportionality of sentencing and gender equality), public health (including access to controlled medicines) and development, which was also reflected in a new 7-pillar thematic structure for member state discussions, breaking with the three traditional pillars of demand reduction, supply re - duction and international cooperation.43 21 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policyBox 1 The INCB's shifting position on selected drug policy issues: A 10-year review Historically, the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) has been considered as the most conservative UN drug control body, with vocal statements against states having adopted harm reduction and decriminalisation policies, and lit - tle condemnation of drug policies raising human rights concerns. However, over the past decade the Board's positions have evolved on a number of drug policy issues. A key development has been the move from the INCB's refusal to take a stance on the death penalty for drug offences to regular calls for UN member states to abandon the practice.44 More recently, the INCB condemned the extrajudicial killings of suspected drug offenders - albeit after intense pressure from civil society45 - as 'a seri- ous breach of the legal obligations to which the Philippines is held by the three UN drug control conventions and by the corpus of international legal instruments to which the country has ad- hered' .46 Meanwhile, the Board has remained consistent in its calls for more proportionate sentencing, which was first touched on in 1996, and expanded in the thematic chapter of the INCB's 2007 Annual Report.47 The INCB has advo - cated for proportionate sentencing repeatedly since then.48 Another major change relates to the INCB's po - sition on decriminalisation. In 2015, the Board concluded that: 'The treaties do not require the incarceration of drug users, but rather provide for alternatives to conviction or punishment for those affected by drug abuse...That some countries have chosen incarceration rather than treatment has been a denial by governments of the flexibili- ty that the treaties provide' .49 Going a step further in supporting decriminalisation, the INCB spoke at a side event at the 58th session of the CND on the Portuguese decriminalisation model.50 Similarly, there has been a noticeable difference of tone on medicinal cannabis. In 2013, the INCB President had pronounced: 'If such \"medical\" schemes are not well managed and supervised, they could be seen as \"backdoor legalisation\" of cannabis for recreational use' .51 More recent pub - lications by the Board have acknowledged the legality of medicinal cannabis use under the 1961 convention, and focused on discussing the tech- nical, administrative and legal factors involved.52 With regards to harm reduction, the INCB has re - mained timid on drug consumption rooms. The Board was highly critical of this intervention in past Annual Reports, stating in 2005 that 'Drug injection rooms contravene the major principle of the treaties' .53 The 2016 Report was considered as softening the Board's stance, at least in terms of the tone of its remarks, limiting its comments to technical and legal questions, implying that when certain conditions are fulfilled, such facilities do operate in line with the drug control treaties.54 In its 2017 Report, however, the Board again expressed reservations concerning the fact that users of the facilities acquired their drugs prior to entering the drug consumption rooms, and utilis- ing stigmatising language such as 'drug abusers' - representing subtle indications of a retraction of the 2016 position.55 Identifying ways of addressing the existing ten- sions between the rights of indigenous groups and member states' obligations under the UN drug control treaties (see Box 13) is another matter on which the INCB has not yet adopted a clear position - although the INCB President rec - ognised that 'there are in fact contradictions' but that 'in the current state of drug control legislation' allowing indigenous groups to use internationally controlled substances for traditional purposes 'is not possible' .56 Yet another issue of concern remains the culture of lack of transparency in the INCB's work. The Board meets in secret, and no minutes of its meetings are published. Further, there is no public access to the analysis through which it arrives at its policy positions,57 and reports from country visits are not made available online or shared with member states. However, adding some transparency to the Board's functioning, the INCB's engagement with civil society has also improved since 2009. The Board now undertakes a yearly dialogue with civil society at the CND, and regularly meets with NGOs during its most country visits. Further, the Board held a meeting with civil society delegates in May 2018 - the first of its kind - in order to discuss the medical and non-medical uses of cannabis.58 The INCB has come a long way since 2009, but there remains some way to go before the Board can become the champion of human rights and public health it appears as in its rhetoric.22 Taking stock: A decade of drug policyThe fact that the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)59 were agreed just a few months before the UNGASS Outcome Document60 contributed to the incorporation of a more visible development perspective within the UNGASS proceedings and the Outcome Document, with a whole chapter dedicated to the issue independently from supply reduction imperatives, and a broader perspective focusing both on rural and urban settings. Nevertheless, a genuine evaluation of global drug policies once again failed to materialise. The UN Secretary General had encouraged member states to use the UNGASS in order to 'conduct a wide-ranging and open debate that considers all options' .61 However, the discussions remained en- trenched in the usual narrow diplomatic parame - ters, with no reconsideration of the harms caused by drug control policies, and with the goal of promoting 'a society free of drug abuse' reaffirmed and featuring prominently in the preamble of the Outcome Document.62 As in 2014, the establish- ment of regulated markets in some member states for non-medical use remained the 'elephant in the room' , with almost no discussions held on the in- herent resulting tensions for the global drug con- trol regime. As a result, despite some undeniable progress, there was no fundamental shift in the underlying punitive enforcement-led drug control paradigm, except for one singularly pivotal ele - ment: for the first time in two decades, and apart from an inclusion in the preamble of the need to achieve a 'society free of drug abuse' , no explicit mention was made of the detailed 'drug-free world' targets as they had been laid out in paragraph 19 of the 1998 Political Declaration and paragraph 36 of the 2009 Political Declaration. 1.6 The next step: The 2019 Ministerial Segment of the 62nd CND The next step on the international drug policy roadmap will be in March 2019 - with a high-level Ministerial Segment scheduled before the 62nd ses- sion of the CND. A core objective of this event is to 'take stock of' progress made during the decade since the adoption of the 2009 Political Declara- tion and Plan of Action, with a view to delineating the global drug strategy for the next decade.63 The event is particularly timely considering the signifi- cant changes that have taken place since 2009. The illegal drug market has become more complex, with changing production regions and trafficking routes, the increasing use of online markets, and new drugs and drug use behaviours. The division between pro - duction, trafficking and consumption countries has also become increasingly blurred. In the meantime, local and national drug policies have changed dra- matically over the past decade, with some countries moving towards a harm reduction approach, de - criminalisation and even regulated markets for cer - tain substances, while others have escalated their punitive approach to counter supply and demand. In this rapidly changing environment, a review of progress made since 2009 and an evaluation of whether the 2009 strategy remains 'fit for purpose' constitute key priorities. Only a few months away from the Ministerial Segment, however, no such re - view has been undertaken. 23 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policyBoth the 2014 High Level Review and the 2016 UNGASS were missed opportunities for an honest and objective review of the successes and failures of global drug policies since the adoption of the 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action. As the target period as set forth in paragraph 36 of the 2009 Political Declaration is set to expire in 2019, and with the Ministerial Segment of the 62nd session of the CND drawing near, no independent evaluation has yet taken place. Biennial reports on the implementation of the Political Declaration were published by the UNODC Executive Director in 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018,64 but like the UNODC World Drug Reports, these rely on member states' responses to the Annual Report Questionnaire (ARQ), and therefore represent an incomplete and subjective picture of the overall drug control landscape. Furthermore, these reports focus al- most exclusively on the scale of the illegal drug market, with little attention given to issues related to human rights, public health and development - although it should be noted that the more recent World Drug Reports have made efforts to provide more analysis of these aspects. In an attempt to help fill this gap, the objective of this 'Shadow Report' is three-fold. Firstly, it assess- es the progress made, or lack thereof, against the objectives set out in the 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action. Secondly, we evaluate whether and how the implementation of the Political Decla- ration and Plan of Action may have contributed to, or undermined, the broader priorities of the United Nations, namely protecting human rights, advanc - ing peace and security and promoting develop - ment. Thirdly, we offer recommendations for the 2019 Ministerial Segment and the next decade in drug policy, focusing on the implementation of the UNGASS Outcome Document and the achievement of the SDGs. 2 Objective of this shadow report24 Taking stock: A decade of drug policypeace and security and advancing development. Secondly, actions were selected according to the key priorities of the IDPC network - in particular those related to improving health, human rights, human security, social inclusion and development, in line with IDPC's vision65 and policy principles.66 Following this process, 33 actions were selected for this report and are listed, along with the relevant issue they relate to, in the Annex . For each selected action, desk-based research was conducted to measure progress and remaining chal- lenges. The research aimed to identify comparable data when available (taking into account methodo - logical divergences in research conducted between 2009 and 2018), but also to provide qualitative in- formation on whether or not the objectives set out in 2009 were achieved. IDPC reviewed the UNODC Biennial Report for 2018, the UNODC World Drug Reports published between 2009 and 2018, docu- mentation from UN agencies and civil society, and academic research - all of which are cited through- out this document. The results of this research form the basis of the conclusions presented in Part 2. The findings of the Shadow Report are further supple - mented by case studies aiming to show the human impacts - both positive and negative - of the past decade of international drug control. Part 3 of the Shadow Report looks to the future, analysing the gains achieved within the UNGASS Outcome Document, and offering recommenda- tions on how to leverage the SDGs to develop new metrics and indicators against which to measure the progress in global drug policy for the next decade. The 2009 Political Declaration and its Plan of Ac - tion recognise the 'important role played by civil society' in the 'formulation and implementation' of drug policy (Action 10). Action 12(b) also requests member states to 'involve all stakeholders at the community level (including the target populations, their families, community members, employers and local organizations) in... monitoring and evaluation of demand reduction measures' . In light of these Actions, the International Drug Policy Consortium (IDPC) has worked with its network of civil society members and partners to evaluate progress against the 2009 goals and targets, with the aim of contrib - uting to the debates in the lead up to, and during, the 2019 Ministerial Segment. This report does not seek to provide a comprehen- sive repository of all available data on drugs, but rather an analysis of the most relevant informa- tion available regarding what is known about key achievements and failures of the global drug con- trol regime between March 2009 and July 2018. 45 experts from within civil society, academia, govern- ments and UN agencies peer reviewed the report to ensure its validity and robustness (see Acknowl- edgements section above). In preparation for this report, IDPC identified key actions within the 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action against which to measure progress. Two criteria were used to select which ones to focus on in this Shadow Report. Firstly, for each action, an assessment was made as to whether the target was tangible and quantifiable, and how progress could be measured towards its achievement against the UN priorities of protecting human rights, promoting 3 MethodologyTaking stock: A decade of drug policy Part 2: Evaluating progress made in addressing the 'world drug problem' since the adoption of the 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action Taking stock: A decade of drug policy 2526 Taking stock: A decade of drug policyArticle 36 of the 2009 Political Declaration is perhaps one of the most significant, as it established 2019 as the target date 'to eliminate or reduce significantly and measurably a. the illicit cultivation of opium poppy, coca bush and cannabis plant; b. the illicit demand for narcotic drugs and psycho - tropic substances; and drug related health and social risks; c. the illicit production, manufacture, marketing and distribution of, and trafficking in, psycho - tropic substances, including synthetic drugs; d. the diversion of and illicit trafficking in precur - sors; and e. money-laundering related to illicit drugs' .67 This section discusses progress made against each of these objectives, drawing from official data pro - vided by the UNODC (see Box 2 ), in particular the World Drug Reports from 2009 to 2018 and the lat - est biennial report of the UNODC Executive Director on 'Action taken by Member States to implement the Political Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem' , published in March 201868 - taking due account of issues related to quality and gaps in the UNODC's data (see Box 2 ). 1.1 The illicit cultivation of opium poppy , coca bush and cannabis plant The latest data from the UNODC shows no reduc - tion in the scale of cultivation of opium, coca and cannabis between 2009 and 2018 (see Table 1). Since 2009, cultivation has in fact increased for all these plants. According to data submitted by UN member states to the UNODC between 200969 and 2018,70 the global illegal cultivation of opium pop - py has increased by 125%. This is mainly due to a surge in cultivation in Afghanistan, where poppy cultivation increased from 123,000 hectares (with potential opium production at 6,900 tons) in 2009 to 328,000 hectares in 2017 (with potential opi- um production at 9,000 tons). Similarly, the global cultivation of the coca bush rose by 30% over the period 2009-2016. As for cannabis, while the World Drug Report estimated that between 200,000 and 641,800 hectares of the plant were being Global cultivation 2009 Latest estimates Change since 2009 Opium poppy 185,935 ha71418,000 ha (2017)72+ 125% Metric tons of Coca bush 163,800 19% Cannabis 200,000-641,800 ha79 No recent estimate available from the UNODCUnknownTable 1.

However, these reports continue to be based essentially on data assembled from completed ARQs,80 which countries are mandated to provide to the UNODC secretariat each year. Although the ARQ was re - vised in 2010, just a year following the adoption of the Political Declaration, the secretariat regularly acknowledges the gaps, irregularities and varying quality of data received from this mechanism.81 For example, in the 2018 World Drug Report (which refers to data from 2016) out of 199 re - spondents, the UNODC received 110 replies to ARQ part 3 ('Extent and patterns of drug use') and 113 replies to ARQ part 4 ('Extent and pat - terns of cultivation, manufacture and trafficking') (see Figure 2). The geographical distribution of responses is another issue of concern. While 87% of countries responded in Europe and 77% in Asia, only 57% responded in the Americas, 31% Figure 2. Response rate by member states to the ARQ on drug demand and supply for the World Drug Reports produced between 2010 (data from 2008-9) and 2018 (data from 2016)83in Africa and, finally, only 2 out of 16 countries in Oceania. These issues severely impact upon the reliability, quality and comparability of the UNODC's core data.82 In order to fill the gaps in data collection from the ARQ, the UNODC uses a number of additional data sources, including information provided by governments via offi- cial communications with the UNODC, official national publications, as well as data from the Heads of National Law Enforcement Agencies, data published by international and regional or - ganisations such as Interpol, the World Customs Organization, the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction, and the OAS In- ter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (CICAD). The UNODC's biennial reports on the implementation of the 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action, published in 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2018, also rely upon the ARQ data submitted by governments. These analyse the progress - or 29 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policyotherwise - made toward the objectives of the 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action, and are therefore likewise affected by the gaps and lack in quality of data. The latest report published in 2018 deploys data gathered between 2010 and 2016, taken from parts 1 'Legislative and institutional framework' and 2 'Comprehensive approach to drug demand reduction and supply' of the ARQ. For part 2, the UNODC notes that only about 40% of member states supplied data for use in the analysis of certain trends, such as activities related to supply reduction. Regions including Sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania and the Caribbean are heavily underrepresented in the sample, with only about 10% or less of member states in those regions responding consistently to parts 1 and 2 of the ARQ.84 A new round of consultations is currently underway to simplify and streamline the ARQ, with a view to adapt the ARQ to new realities but also to increase its response rate.85 Bearing in mind the multiple methodological complexities and gaps in available data, this section of the Shadow Report heavily relies on UNODC data, but also considers additional sources of information from other UN agencies, government reports and civil society findings. Furthermore, in 2013, the UNODC reported that data from 2011 represented 'an improved avail- ability of more reliable data, which allows for setting a new baseline for global estimates on injecting drug use and HIV among people who inject drugs' .86 For drug-related harms, this re - port therefore relies on baseline estimates from 2011, rather than on those for 2009.87 cultivated in 2009, no global estimates were pro - vided in 2018, although the UNODC concluded that cannabis cultivation was reported in 145 countries in the period 2010-2016, 'representing 94 per cent of the world's total population' .88 It is important to note that, with the exception of Bolivia, which has implemented a sophisticat - ed coca monitoring system carried out with the support of the European Union and local com- munities, these cultivation figures should be con- sidered as very rough estimates, as evidenced in the often vastly different reporting between the UN and the US government.89 They do, however, provide a useful measure for evaluating trends over time. 1.2 The illicit demand for narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, and drug-related health and social risks Here again, UNODC data for 200990 and 201691 show no signi-ficant progress either on reducing demand, or on reducing drug-related health and social risks (see Table 2). The overall number of people aged 15-64 who used drugs at least once in 2016 is es- timated at 275 million, representing an increase by 31% on the 2009 numbers. It should be noted that over the same period, the overall world population aged 16 to 64 increased by only 8.7%.92 The UNODC reported a reduction in the numbers of people who inject drugs from 14 million in 2009 to 10.6 million in 2016 - although the 2018 World Drug Report also notes that 'This estimate is based on the most recent and highest quality information currently available to UNODC. It does not imply that there has been a change in the global number of PWID com- pared with those published in previous editions of the World Drug Report' . The main drug of choice remains cannabis, with 192.2 million (increase by 17% since 2009), followed by opioids (increase by 16% since 2009) and amphetamines (with a slight decrease by 2% since 2009). Regarding drug-related health and social risks, the UNODC estimates that the global prevalence of HIV, hepatitis C and tuberculosis among people who inject drugs have remained high but stable, between 2011 and 2018 - although this does not reflect possible increases or decreases with- in countries or regions, especially where data is scarce or of poor quality. According to the latest data, globally 11.8% of people who inject drugs are living with HIV (compared to 11% in 2011), and 51.9% are infected by hepatitis C (compared to 51% in 2011), while tuberculosis prevalence is at 8% (a slight decrease from the 2011 estimate at 8.4%). The UNODC estimates that the number of direct drug use-related deaths has surged by 60% since 2000, from 105,000 deaths in 200093 to 168,000 recorded deaths in 2015.94 The World Health organization (WHO) also estimated that in 2015 roughly 450,000 people had died as a result of drug use, if indirect deaths related to HIV and hepatitis C were taken into account.9530 Taking stock: A decade of drug policyGlobal estimates of people who use drugs200996Latest estimates (2016)97 Change since 2009 Total number of people use drugs210 million (range: (range: 204-346 million) + 31% Total number of people who inject drugs 14 million 10.6 million* - 24%* Total number 13-55 million)- 2%Table 2. Global estimates of people who use drugs, 2009 and 2016 1.3 The illicit production, manufac - ture, marketing and distribution of, and trafficking in, psychotropic sub- stances, including synthetic drugs Since 2009, the market for synthetic drugs - referred to in the UN conventions as 'psychotropic substances' - has become more complex and diversified than ever, and shows no signs of disappearing. The 2018 World Drug Report found a persisting production and use of methamphetamine in North America and East and South East Asia, an expanding amphetamine market (both trafficking and use) from the well-established markets of the Near and Middle East/South West Asia to North African countries, and a surge in synthetic manufacture and consumption in South Asia.98 In 2015, the UNODC also reported an increase in methamphetamine production in West Africa, although this still constitutes a small share of overall global production of the substance.99 The market for crystal methamphetamine was also reportedly on the rise in North America, East and South East Asia and Oceania, with a purer substance (crystals) than the traditional tablet form. Further, despite efforts to dismantle illegal manufacturing laboratories of MDMA (ecstasy) and to address trafficking of this substance, MDMA consumption is rising in Europe and Oceania.100 The increasing use of new technologies, in particular sales via the dark net, is posing additional challenges.101 In addition to the expanding market for traditional synthetic drugs, the past decade has seen the emer - gence of hundreds of new psychoactive substances (NPS). In 2018, the UNODC reported that 'the range of psychoactive substances available on the market has never been greater' , adding that 'From 2009 to 2017, 111 countries and territories reported a cumu- lative total of 803 individual NPS' .102 Another issue for this target relates to the non-med- ical use of prescription drugs. Already in its 2011 World Drug Report (corresponding to data from 2009), the UNODC had characterised the 'non-med- ical use of prescription drugs' as 'a growing health problem in a number of developed and developing 803NewPsychoacve Substances have been recorded in over 111 countries and territories.? ? ???* This change can most likely be explained by methodological differences in data collection between 2009 and 2016 rather than by a reduction in the number of people who inject drugs, as noted in the 2018 World Drug Report. 31 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policycountries' . In 2018, the situation was described as having 'reached epidemic proportions in parts of the world' , in particular in North America where it has contributed to the opioid overdose crisis that has caused thousands of deaths over the past few years (see Box 4 ). Although 'global estimates of the non-medical use of prescription drugs are not avail- able' , the latest data led the UNODC to conclude that it 'remains quite widespread' , with the use of benzo - diazepines being the most common substance used in most countries.103 1.4 The diversion of and illicit trafficking in precursors Precursors are the 'chemical substances that be - come incorporated, at the molecular level, into a narcotic drug or psychotropic substance during the manufacturing process' .104 They are controlled under Article 12 of the 1988 Convention, which is policed by the INCB. The monitoring of precursor chemicals remains at the core of member states' drug supply reduction activities.105 During the period 2010-2016, 90% of ARQ respondents reported compiling lists of national companies authorised to manufacture, distribute and trade in precursors. Member states also adopted new measures to curb the diversion of, and illegal trafficking in, precursors, including the dissemination of lists of controlled substances to companies, the establishment of codes of conduct and guidelines for operators, and the adoption of legislation requiring companies to report the trans- actions of controlled substances. Meanwhile, the proportion of member states engaging in monitor - ing precursor chemicals decreased slightly between 2010 and 2016 from 100% to 97%.

Regard- less of the increase in seizures, as mentioned above the production of cocaine has increased by 44% be - tween 2009 and 2016 (see Table 1). 1.5 Money-laundering related to illicit drugs While efforts have been made nationally to adopt new laws and regulations, and globally through re - gional and international cooperation mechanisms to counter money-laundering associated to the illegal drug market (see Section 2.2.3 below), little impact has been recorded on the scale of mon- ey-laundering between 2009 and 2018 - a UNODC study in 2011 estimated that less than 1% of the total amount being laundered is seized.113 In 2009, criminal proceeds from the illegal drug market amounted to an estimated 3.6% of the glob - al GDP , 2.7% of which was being laundered, repre - senting US$ 1.6 trillion.114 The UNODC's latest esti- mates, released in 2017 and referring to data from 2014, point to the fact that the amount of money laundered globally each year represents 2 to 5% of global GDP , that is, between US$ 800 million and 2 trillion.115 The proceeds of drug sales 'accounted for more than one quarter of overall revenues of trans- national organized crime groups in 2014' . 'In recent years' , the UNODC continues, 'drug-related income seems to have represented the second largest source of income - after counterfeiting of a broad trol decreased between 2010 and 2016, falling from 94% to 77%.106 At international level, the proportion of countries using the INCB's Pre-Expert Notification Online (PEN Online) system - which enables easy online exchange of information between member states on shipments of chemicals and provides the ability to raise alerts to stop suspect shipments before they reach illegal drug manufacturers - increased from 86% in 2010 to 98% in 2016.107 In the same period, around half of member states also reported taking steps to address the use of substances not under international control, as well as to target substitute chemicals for the manufacture of precursors used for the manufacture of heroin, cocaine or ATS.108 With regards to NPS, the challenge of controlling these substances begins with the identification of their precursor chemicals, and the methods used in their manufacture.109 The first NPS precursors to be internationally controlled were 4-anilino-N-pheneth- ylpiperidine (ANPP) and N-Phenethyl-4-piperidi- none (NPP), two precursors of fentanyl, which were scheduled into Table 1 of the 1988 Convention in October 2017.110 This brought the total of interna- tionally controlled precursor substances to 26. Despite these drug control efforts, however, the INCB reported that the use and number of precursors used in illegal production had increased in the past five years. Although there are major gaps in available data reported to the INCB on seizures of precursors,111 the Board reported a large increase in the seizure of acetic anhydride (used in the illegal manufacture of heroin) from 89,657 litres in 2012 to 135,184 litres in 2016.112 426-652 USD Billion The global drug market's turnover is esmated at >50%approx. is channelled into money laundering.Less than 1% of the amount laundered is seized.Credit: Juan Fernandez Ochoa, IDPC 33 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policyrange of goods - of transnational organized crime groups at the global level' .116 Today, the global drug market is estimated to turnover between US$ 426 and 652 billion.117 Of this, the UNODC estimates that 'well over half of the gross profits generated...are channelled into money-laundering' .118 At regional level, similar trends have been observed. In Europe, the illegal drug market is valued at ap - proximately 28.3 billion euros a year.119 A number of anti-money-laundering regulations were adopted by the EU over the past 10 years, with over US$ 20 billion spent by banks each year to run a complex compliance regime. Despite these efforts, according to Europol, money launderers are running billions of illegal drug and other criminal profits through the European banking system with a 99% success rate - with only 1% of criminal assets seized each year in the EU.120 Similarly, West Africa has been greatly affected by the illegal drug market, corruption and money-laundering over the past 20 years. Despite efforts to tackle these issues, the number of court rulings on money-laundering is reportedly very low and, according to the Inter-Governmental Action Group Against Money-laundering in West-Africa, 'has not yielded the expected result' .121 Since the adoption of the UN Charter in 1945,122 the 34 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy 2 Assessing progress made towards the 2009 Plan of Action against the broader priorities of the United Nations UN has aimed to maintain international peace and security, protect human rights, deliver humanitarian aid, promote sustainable development and uphold international law.123 It is against three of these over - arching UN priorities - protecting human rights, maintaining peace and security and advancing development - that Section 2 evaluates progress made against selected actions to which member states unanimously committed themselves in the 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action on drug control. Relevant actions are highlighted at the top of each sub-section in a text box. 2.1 Protecting human rights 'One of the shared elements to all declarations, action plans and resolutions that underline the principle of a comprehensive, integrated and balanced approach to addressing the world drug problem is the commitment to ensuring compliance with human rights norms' , INCB, June 2018124 The protection and promotion of human rights is a key purpose, as well as a guiding principle, of the UN and its founding Charter.125 In 1948, the Univer - sal Declaration of Human Rights126 brought human rights into the realm of international law, with all UN bodies and entities - including the Vienna-based drug control bodies - being bound by the obligation to respect, protect and fulfil human rights and funda- mental freedoms. Since then, a normative and insti- tutional framework for the promotion and protection of human rights has been developed through the adoption of several binding human rights treaties. The 2009 Political Declaration itself reaffirms its 'unwavering commitment to ensure that all aspects of demand reduction, supply reduction and interna- tional cooperation are addressed in full conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, international law and the Uni- versal Declaration of Human Rights' (paragraph 1). A similar paragraph was included in the preamble of the UNGASS Outcome Document,127 alongside an entire section dedicated to human rights. In recent years, increasing visibility has been given to the impacts of drug control on human rights, in particular with the adoption of the first ever Human Rights Council resolution on human rights and drug policy in 2015128 which resulted in a comprehensive analysis of the issue by the Office of the High Com- missioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) a few months later.129 A second resolution was approved at the Human Rights Council in March 2018, mandating the OHCHR to draft a report aiming to contribute to the implementation of the UNGASS Outcome Docu- ment from a human rights perspective.130 This section will assess the impacts of drug policies, strategies and programmes on the protection of human rights, in particular the right to health, the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific research, the right to life, the right to be free from torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, the right to liberty and to be free from arbitrary detention, the right to a fair trial and due process, the rights of indigenous people, and the right to be free from discrimination. 2.1.1 The right to highest attainable standard of health The right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health conducive to living a life in dignity (thereafter referred to as 'the right to health') is a human right which applies equally to all without discrimination. It is enshrined in a number of human rights treaties, including Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights131 (as well as General Comment No. 20 on non-discrimination in economic, social and cultural rights132 and General Comment No. 22 on sexual and reproductive health133), Article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child,134 Article 12 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women135 and Article 5 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.136 The right to health includes the rights to control one's health and body, and to be free from non-con- sensual medical treatment and experimentation 35 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Assessing progress onHuman rights 27,000~ extrajudicial killings in the Philippines, since June 2016Death penalty Extrajudicial killings Access to harm reducon Health in prisons Overdose response3,940 people have been executed for drug oences over the past decade 33 jurisdicons retain the death penalty for drug-related crimes Only 1 in 100 people who inject drugs lives in a country with adequate coverage of both NSP and OST2x - 10xHIV, HCV & TB prevalence in prison higher than among general populaon8%United Statescounes implement overdose educaon and to essenal medicines Incarceraon Torture and cruel punishment26 have adopted a model of countries decriminalisaon to facilitate access to health services, reduce sgma and reduce prison overcrowding. 75%of theworld remain without access to proper pain relief treatment.92% of the global supply of morphine is used by 17% of the world populaon . 1 in 5 prisoners worldwide are incarcerated for drug oences83%~serve sentences for drug possession for personal useIn some parts of the world, over 80% of women incarcerated are serving sentences for drug-related oences. forced urine tesngcorporal punishm ent compulsory registraon compulsory detenon can also amount to acts of torture or cruel treatment.Administrave punishmentCredit: Juan Fernandez Ochoa, IDPC 36 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action Action 2(g): 'Develop and implement, in coop - eration with international and regional agen- cies, a sound and long-term advocacy strategy, including harnessing the power of communi- cation media, aimed at reducing discrimination that may be associated with substance abuse, promoting the concept of drug dependence as a multifactorial health and social problem and raising awareness, where appropriate, of inter - ventions based on scientific evidence that are both effective and cost-effective'which may amount to torture. In accordance with the obligation to uphold the right to health, member states must ensure that healthcare goods, services and information are available, accessible, afforda- ble, acceptable and of good quality.137 States have an immediate obligation to take steps to progres- sively realise the right to health to the maximum of their available resources, and should not take retro - gressive measures which may result in reducing or preventing protections of the right to health. Ensuring access to evidence-based drug prevention Drug prevention programmes have historically consisted of mass media campaigns focusing on 'just say no' messaging and scare tactics to deter people from using drugs. Both the UNODC138 and national policy makers have used this approach. In the USA, for example, the Montana Meth Project used slogans like 'Not even once' , mistakenly im- plying that methamphetamine use instantly leads to dependence, and portraying people who use methamphetamines as violent, engaging in risky and promiscuous behaviour, or induced into a 'zombie like' status.139 In 2011, Romania launched a large-scale government-funded campaign to tackle the recent surge in NPS use, comparing peo - ple who use drugs with cows eating grass.140 Sys - tematic reviews of these mass media campaigns found that they have been ineffective at curbing the levels of drug use (which they had purported- ly claimed to do), and may have exacerbated the social stigmatisation and demonisation of people who use drugs,141 exacerbating social exclusion, discrimination, violence and creating barriers to service and healthcare provision. Similar campaigns have been developed to curb illegal cultivation - some of which have been found to be stigmatising towards indigenous groups. For instance, in 2008 the National Drug Commission of Colombia launched a prevention campaign called 'No cultives la mata que mata'142 - 'Don't grow the plant that kills' - to dissuade people from cultivat - ing, trafficking and using coca, cannabis and opium. The indigenous group Coca Nasa - a micro-firm cre - ated to protect the rights of coca farmers - brought an official complaint against the campaign. This resulted in a Supreme Court decision in 2010 which found that the campaign infringed upon the rights of Coca Nasa and indigenous groups within Colom- bia to grow and use coca for traditional purposes.143 In 2018, the UNODC concluded that most preven- tion interventions had reported 'little or no effica- c y '.144 Yet, based on ARQ responses, 57% of mem- ber states continue to use media campaigns, 63% use information sharing and 15% use 'vocational training and income generation' programmes. On the other side of the spectrum, only 21% of UN member states use family and parenting skills training and just 17% use screening and brief in- terventions, despite evidence of effectiveness for both interventions.145 Worryingly, the UNODC also reported no improve - ment since 2009 in the trend to evaluate prevention interventions, with most evaluations using process indicators, and 'only a small number focusing on outcomes, and even fewer on impact' .146 The pro - gress made towards ensuring that interventions are based on scientific evidence of effectiveness has therefore been limited since the adoption of the Political Declaration. In an effort to 'guide policy - makers worldwide to develop programmes, policies and systems that are a truly effective investment' , the UNODC launched a set of 'International stand- on drug use prevention' in 2015.147 However, no follow-up study or evaluation on how the standards have been taken forward by member states has been conducted to date. Credit: Private 37 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policyEnsuring access to harm reduction interventions Harm reduction refers to policies, programmes and practices that aim primarily to reduce the negative health, social and economic risks and harms asso - ciated with drug use without necessarily reducing drug consumption. Harm reduction benefits people who use drugs, their families and the community.148 Harm reduction is needed for all types of drugs (e.g. heroin, cocaine, cannabis, ATS, NPS, etc.) and all forms of use (e.g. smoking, injecting, snorting, etc.). Although not specifically mentioned by name, this evidence-based approach is implicitly recog- nised within Article 36 of the Political Declaration and in two specific actions (Action 4(i) and 28(c)), and several key harm reduction interventions were included in the 2016 UNGASS Outcome Document (paragraphs 1.o and 1.m)149 for the first time. Harm reduction measures have also been recognised as essential for the realisation of the right to health by the UN General Assembly,150 the Human Rights Council,151 the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,152 the Committee on the Rights of the Child,153 the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women,154 the Special Rap - porteurs on the right to health155 and on the preven- tion of torture,156 as well as the OHCHR.1572009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action Action 4(i): 'Strengthen their efforts aimed at re - ducing the adverse consequences of drug abuse for individuals and society as a whole, taking into consideration not only the prevention of related infectious diseases, such as HIV, hepatitis B and C and tuberculosis, but also all other health conse - quences, such as overdose, workplace and traffic accidents and somatic and psychiatric disorders, and social consequences, such as family prob - lems, the effects of drug markets in communities and crime' Action 10(b): 'Ensure, where appropriate, the sufficient availability of substances for medica - tion-assisted therapy, including those within the scope of control under the international drug control conventions, as part of a comprehensive package of services for the treatment of drug dependence' Action 38(c): 'Develop prevention and treatment programmes tailored to the specific characteris - tics of the phenomenon of amphetamine-type stimulants as key elements in any relevant strat - egy to reduce demand and minimize health risks'Box 3 CND resolutions related to harm reduction since 2009 Resolution 61/4.

Achieving universal access to prevention, treatment, care and support for drug users and people living with or af- fected by HIV (2010) The effectiveness of harm reduction measures in protecting the health of people who use drugs is well documented. Since 2009, progress has been made to recognise and promote the nine inter - ventions included in the Technical guide released by the WHO, UNODC and UNAIDS in 2012 on HIV prevention interventions among people who inject drugs, including needle and syringe programmes (NSPs) and opioid substitution therapy (OST).158 The number of countries with an explicit reference to harm reduction in national policy documentation increased from 71 in 2008 to 88 in 2016.159 Since 2008, the number of countries providing NSPs, OST, drug consumption rooms and take-home 38 Taking stock: A decade of drug policyHarm reduction servicesNumber of countries with services in operation in 2008-2010Number of countries with services in operation in 2017-2018 Change since 2008 NSP 82 countries (2008)16093 countries16111 more countries OST 70 countries (2008)16286 countries16316 more countries Drug consumption rooms8 countries (90 rooms) (2009)164 10 countries (118 rooms)1652 more countries Take-home naloxone distribution 14 countries (2010)16615 countries1671 more country Drug checking Unknown 18 countries168Unknown Heroin-assisted therapy Unknown 7 countries169UnknownTable 3. Countries delivering key harm reduction interventions, 2008-present naloxone (an opioid/opiate overdose antidote) has also increased (see Table 4). Globally, the number of drug consumption rooms has increased over the period 2008-2017, from 90 to 118 rooms, as Canada opened 25 new facilities over the past two years, spurred in part by the worrying increase in opioid overdose deaths in the country (see Box 4 ).170 Be- tween 2014 and 2016, the UNODC also reported an increase in the coverage of antiretroviral therapy, condom distribution, targeted information and education, hepatitis B and C prevention, diagnosis and treatment, as well as tuberculosis prevention, diagnosis and treatment.171 Despite such progress, significant challenges re - main. At global level, only seven CND resolutions related to specific harm reduction were adopted since 2009 (i.e. 5% of all resolutions adopted, see Box 3 ), but the term 'harm reduction' has not yet been mentioned in any CND resolution or UNGASS declaration on drugs - although the term is en- shrined in the Political Declarations on HIV and AIDS adopted in 2006,172 2011173 and 2016,174 and used widely across the UN agencies. Most recognised harm reduction interventions at the UN relate to drug injecting175 (see Box 4 ), with limited attention given to other methods of use, such as smoking and snorting, which require their own modes of harm reduction. This is despite the fact that the UNODC reported that ATS consumption remains high and is the most commonly used substance after cannabis and opioids176 (see Table 2). Although Action 38(c) promotes 'prevention and treatment programmes' to 'reduce demand and minimize health risks' for ATS use, these programmes remain severely limited, and few efforts have been made to evaluate the level of coverage for harm reduction interventions among people who use ATS. To date, guidance from the UN on ATS use only consists of a WHO series of technical briefs published in 2011.177 The publication of a con- ference room paper on stimulant harm reduction at the 61st session of the CND in March 2018 was a positive step in this regard.178 In this context, civil so - ciety research and interventions have been instru- mental in responding to non-injecting ATS use. ATS harm reduction interventions have included: Measures seeking to improve personal hy - giene and nutrition, for example making water, fruits, toothpaste and toothbrushes available in low-thresholds drop-in centres, sharing of in- formation on how to improve diets and getting adequate rest.179 Information on how to inject or smoke more safely, and the promotion of less harmful routes of drug use (e.g. smoking vs. injecting, although long-term smoking may also result in health harms) with the provision of smoking parapher - nalia to reduce harms (e.g. in Canada, Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland). Drug checking services, allowing people to as- certain the content, purity and strength of their drug to reduce risks of overdoses and undesired or unexpected effects from ingesting toxic and/ or dangerous contaminants. Around 30 drug checking services (some officially recognised by governments, others operating informally) are available in 18 countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, France, Italy, Luxem- bourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, Uruguay and the USA.180 Housing first programmes and the provision of basic healthcare, food distribution and 39 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policyemployment services to reduce marginalisation and associated harms (e.g. in Brazil, Canada and Switzerland). Peer-led information sharing, reviews and feed- back on drug purchases and use in online fo - rums, and harm reduction advice on the dark net (e.g. community groups in Eastern Europe and Central Asia promoting HIV testing on the dark net). Even for the more 'traditional' harm reduction servic - es, access remains a key issue with no availability of OST, NSPs or naloxone in about 100 countries. Even in countries where these services are available, cov - erage for the core interventions promoted in the UN Technical Guide remains 'too low to be effective' ,181 with high coverage for NSPs in only nine countries, and OST only in 20 countries (see Figure 3). A 2017 study also found that less than 1% of people who inject drugs live in countries with high coverage of both NSPs and OST.182 Another major challenge remains the lack of fund- ing allocated to harm reduction interventions. UN- AIDS estimates that US$ 1.5 billion is required each year by 2020 to fund HIV prevention among people who inject drugs.183 However, only US$ 188 million was allocated to harm reduction in 2016 - the same amount (inflation adjusted) as in 2007, and just 13% of what is needed.184 It is also estimated that inter - national donor funding - which accounts for two thirds of all harm reduction funding - fell by 24% between 2007 and 2016.185 Furthermore, while the funding gap for the broader HIV response in low- and middle-income countries is reported to be 20%, it should be noted that the gap is close to 90% for harm reduction.186 The urgent need to address the funding gap for harm reduction was recognised at the CND in 2017, with the adoption of Resolution 60/8 'Promoting measures to prevent HIV and other blood-borne dis- eases associated with the use of drugs, and increas- ing financing for the global HIV/AIDS response and for drug use prevention and other drug demand re - duction measures' .187 With indications of reduced in- ternational donor funding for harm reduction, and limited domestic investment in harm reduction ap - proaches within HIV budgets, civil society has called upon governments to critically evaluate their drug policy investments and consider redirecting a small proportion of funds from law enforcement to health and harm reduction responses.188 Indeed, Harm Reduction International estimated that redirecting just 10% of drug law enforcement funding towards harm reduction would cover harm reduction needs in the community and in prison189 - where coverage remains particularly poor (see below). Furthermore, there remain significant legislative, political and technical barriers hampering access to harm reduction. The WHO 'Consolidated guide - lines on HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care for key populations' , first published in 2014 and revised in 2016, identified four 'critical enablers' as part of an effective public health response to HIV, or in other words, 'essential strategies for an enabling environment' to improve access to harm reduction interventions: Supporve legislaon to improve violence againstCredit: Juan Fernandez Ochoa, IDPC40 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Supportive legislation, policy and financial com- mitment, including a call for countries to 'review and revise policies and work towards the decrim- inalisation of behaviours, such as drug use and possession for personal use' (this will be further discussed below).

Availability and coverage of NSPs and OST, by number of countries, 2017191Credit: UNODC World Drug Report 2018, Booklet 2 41 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policylack of effective legal protection against these, as well as the widespread cases of violence against people who use drugs in various countries, act as a significant barrier to accessing health and social services.193 As a result of these various factors, people who use drugs are made particularly vulnerable to health and social harms. In the 2011 Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS, UN member states had commit - ted to reducing new HIV infections by 50% among people who inject drugs by 2015.194 As mentioned above , no progress has been made towards this target. On the contrary, both UNAIDS195 and the UNODC196 reported that the number of newly in- fected people who inject drugs had increased by one third between 2011 and 2015, from 114,000 to 152,000 new cases. UNAIDS also estimated that in 2017, the risk for people who inject drugs to ac - quire HIV was 22 times higher than for the general population.197 Some regions have been particularly affected, especially Eastern Europe and Central Asia and the Middle East and North Africa, where people who inject drugs accounted for more than one third of new HIV infections in 2017.198 Similarly, the global prevalence of viral hepatitis C and tuberculosis among people who inject drugs has re - mained the same or increased slightly between 2009 and 2016 - although these data do not take into ac - count wide differences across countries and regions. The number of drug-related deaths has also increased dramatically during the same period from 183,500 deaths in 2009 to an estimated 450,000 deaths in 2015 - with opioid overdose deaths representing a third to half of drug-related deaths. Although the USA has been most impacted by the recent surge in overdose deaths (see Box 4 ), a similar trend can be observed in Canada (3,987 overdose deaths recorded Credit: Juan Fernandez Ochoa, IDPC 2015 (168,000) 2000 (105,000)deathsdrug-related+60% between 2000 & 2015 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action Action 4(h): 'Consider developing a compre - hensive treatment system offering a wide range of integrated pharmacological (such as detoxifi- as counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy and social sup - port) interventions based on scientific evidence and focused on the process of rehabilitation, recovery and social reintegration' Action 10(b): 'Ensure, where appropriate, the sufficient availability of substances for medica- tion-assisted therapy, including those within the scope of control under the international drug control conventions, as part of a compre - hensive package of services for the treatment of drug dependence' Action 38(c): 'Develop prevention and treat - ment programmes tailored to the specific characteristics of the phenomenon of amphet - amine-type stimulants as key elements in any relevant strategy to reduce demand and min- imize health risks'in 2017)199 and Europe (9,138 overdose deaths in the EU, Norway and Turkey in 2016).200 Ensuring access to evidence-based drug dependence treatment 'By denying effective drug treatment, State drug pol- icies intentionally subject a large group of people to severe physical pain, suffering and humiliation, effec- tively punishing them for using drugs and trying to coerce them into abstinence, in complete disregard of the chronic nature of dependency and of the scientific 42 Taking stock: A decade of drug policyevidence pointing to the ineffectiveness of punitive measures' , Juan E. Mendez, UN Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 2013201 The UNODC reported little increase in the availabil- ity of drug dependence treatment between 2010 and 2016, and coverage remains low. Between 2009 and 2017, only 40% of member states reported high coverage of counselling and treatment planning, while coverage remained low and unchanged for detoxification, OST, peer support groups, screening and brief interventions, contingency management, cognitive behaviour therapy, treatment for comor - bidity, motivational interviewing, vocational train- ing, social assistance, education activities, rehabili- tation and aftercare.202 Although OST is the treatment option with the most solid evidence base to manage opioid dependence, it is only operational in less than half of the world, and remains 'the least provided' drug dependence treatment service,203 despite an increase from 70 to 86 countries providing OST between 2008204 and 2017.205 In various countries, methadone and buprenorphine - the most common drugs used for OST which are also included in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines206 - are banned in national legislation; this is the case in countries such as Egypt, Jordan, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkmenistan and Uganda. Countries like the Rus- sian Federation have been criticised by a number of UN human rights treaty bodies for not providing methadone as a form of OST, and several cases on the issue are pending within the European Court of Human Rights.207 When OST is indeed available, additional barriers include cost (with many services only provided in pri- vate facilities), accessibility (especially in rural areas and for women and LGBTQ+ individuals), long waiting lists, restrictive prescription and delivery regulations, lack of awareness about OST and available services, and fear of breach of confidentiality.208 Morphine (slow release) and heroin-assisted treatment - an- other treatment option for opioid dependence with strong evidence of effectiveness209 - remains limited to a small number of countries (Canada, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and the UK), often in the form of pilot or high-threshold programmes with a small number of beneficiaries.210 Additionally, substitution treatment for people de - pendent on stimulants, including ATS and crack/ cocaine, is severely limited, and research is lagging behind despite evidence of extensive problematic use and hence clinical need. With regards to ATS dependence, substitution treatment was reported in Australia with dextroamphetamine.211 In the UK, substitution programmes using dexamphetamine have been in place since 1988, and although no controlled studies were conducted, 'the doctors... generally regard their amphetamine maintenance as clinically successful' , with 'significant reductions in amphetamine use, benzodiazepine use, fre - quency of injection, needle-sharing, and money spent on illicit drugs' .212 In Asia, mild plant-based stimulants are used as a form of substitution treatment, including kratom in Thailand and My - anmar,213 and ephedra in China, although more evaluations are needed to assess the effectiveness of these programmes.214 Regarding substitution treatment for people dependent on cocaine, sev - eral studies have analysed the benefits of using cannabis to help people to regain control over their crack use. In Brazil, available studies have shown that cannabis use helped to reduce crav - ing for crack, improve people's sleep and appetite and improve their overall quality of life.215 Similar initiatives have been developed in Jamaica216 and Canada.217 However, such initiatives remain limited to a few selected countries and localities, and so far scientific evaluations of these interventions have been scarce. Finally, in many countries, particularly in the global south, the quality of drug dependence treatment provided is questionable and is not based on availa- ble scientific evidence,218 with cases of ill-treatment and other human rights abuses documented by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and UN agencies alike.219 This is despite the recommenda- tion of Special Rapporteur on the right to health that 'the same standards of ethical treatment ap - ply to the treatment of drug dependence as other health-related conditions' , and that 'health-care personnel have an obligation...not to stigmatize or violate a patient's human rights' .220 The Special Rap - porteur on torture has documented several instanc - es of torture and other ill-treatment of people who use drugs in the name of treatment and rehabilita- tion.221 In 2012, the UNODC published its 'TREATNET Quality standards for drug dependence treatment and care services' , in an effort to contribute to 'the development of evidence-based drug depend- ence treatment services' .222 However, good quality treatment remains a major issue of concern. 43 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policyBox 4 The unprecedented opioid overdose crisis in North America North America has recently experienced an un- precedented number of overdose deaths. In the USA, between 1999 and mid-2018, more than 350,000 people have died from an opioid over - dose.223 This is six times more than the number of deaths of American soldiers during the entirety of the Vietnam War.224 The highest number on record was in 2017, when total overdose deaths reached 71,568.225 The White House estimated the financial cost of the 'opioid epidemic' to be US$ 504 billion in 2015.226 People of colour, in particular African American men, have been disproportionately im- pacted by fatal overdoses.227 Numerous explana- tions have been provided for this highly worrying trend. Some have identified the powerful pharma- ceutical industry228 and over-prescription in the 1990s and 2000s while others point to economic insecurity, deindustrialisation,229 the widespread criminalisation and demonisation of people who use drugs, and their social exclusion.230 Like the USA, Canada is experiencing an epidem- ic of opioid-related overdoses. In 2017, a record 3,987 people in Canada died of apparent opioid overdoses, an increase of 34% since 2016.231 The majority of opioid-related deaths involved the potent synthetic opioid fentanyl or opioid poisonings in 2016-2017 resulted in an average of 16 hospitalisations a day.233 Article 36(b) of the 2009 Political Declaration, and Actions 4(i) and 10(b) commit member states to 'strengthen their efforts aimed at reducing the adverse consequences of drug abuse... such as overdose' . The response to this crisis by the US and Canadian governments has been drastically different in that regard. In the USA, the Trump White House has acknowl- edged the severity of the opioid crisis by declaring it as a national emergency,234 but in the context of rhetoric promoting border crackdowns and other punitive enforcement. When it comes to crucial life-saving healthcare programmes, such as ex - panded drug dependence treatment, the Trump Administration and the Republican-controlled Congress have moved to curtail funding and crip - ple the Affordable Care Act. A 2016 report by the Surgeon General found that only 10% of Americans suffering from drug dependence obtain specialty treatment, due to severe shortages in the supply of care and lack of affordable options.235 Currently, only 8% of US counties implement overdose edu- cation and naloxone distribution programmes - a key harm reduction intervention to reduce the risk of opioid overdose deaths.236 In the meantime, Canada's federal government chose a 'public health approach to problematic substance use' and adopted a new 'Canadian drugs and substances strategy' , under leadership from the Minister of Health.237 The new strategy restores harm reduction as a key pillar of drug policy (which had been excised entirely in 2007 by the previous government), alongside the other three pillars of treatment, prevention and law en- forcement. This was accompanied by legislation to simplify the process of applying for an exemp - tion under federal drug law to operate drug con- sumption rooms without risk of prosecution to clients or staff for drug possession.238 As a result, the number of these facilities has grown from one legally-sanctioned room in 2016 to 26 currently operating in four provinces in August 2018, with more applications under review.239 In addition, frustrated by the insufficiently rapid response at various levels of government, com- munity advocates in several cities opened, with- out legal sanction, lower-barrier pop-up 'over - dose prevention sites' to enable easier access to sterile injection equipment and the opportunity for immediate interventions, such as naloxone administration, in the event of an overdose. In re - sponse, Health Canada ultimately agreed to give provinces and territories the ability obtain a class exemption from federal drug laws for any provin- cially-approved overdose prevention sites so as to approve temporary sites based on urgent need, without requiring the lengthy application process for a full service.240 The Federal Parliament also 8%United Statescounties implement overdose education and naloxone distribution programmes only Continued on next pageCredit: Juan Fernandez Ochoa, IDPC44 Taking stock: A decade of drug policyAgainst Women: Article 12 of the Convention (Women and Health) requires that states 'eliminate discrimination against women in their access to healthcare services throughout the life cycle' .248 Nevertheless, most harm reduction and treatment services continue to be tailored primarily to men who use drugs,249 and many fail to provide suitable environments and support for women and girls, including for example childcare facilities, sexual and reproductive health services, services to tackle gender-based violence, adequate opening hours, geographical access, and staff trained to respond to gender-specific needs.250 Breaches of confidenti- ality in healthcare settings - a fundamental human rights principle251 - in relation to their drug use and HIV status may deter women from accessing ser - vices and increases the likelihood of them experi- encing exclusion, harassment, abuse and violence. Finally, the fear of loss of child custody when mak - ing contact with healthcare providers acts as an im- portant deterrent for mothers to access services.252 In countries or jurisdictions where drug use during pregnancy is criminalised, women may avoid sex - ual and reproductive health services for fear of ar - rest, putting themselves and their babies at risk of further harm.253 As a result, although women make up one third of people who use drugs globally, they only repre - sent one fifth of those in treatment.254 In 2017, the INCB concluded that this was particularly the case 'in low- and middle-income countries' , mentioning Afghanistan, where 'women make up only 4% of those in treatment' , and Pakistan, where 'that fig- ure is 13 per cent' .255 These data suggest that little progress has been made towards Action 14(a) at national level. The specific challenges faced by women have be - come more visible in international debates since 2009, although only three CND resolutions have been dedicated to the issue over the past nine years Ensuring access to drug services for women and girls Women and girls are particularly at risk of drug-relat - ed health harms because of criminalisation, stigma- tisation and social exclusion, which are compound- ed with endemic gender inequality, gender-based violence and misogyny. In various EU countries, average HIV prevalence can be up to 50% higher among women who use drugs than among their male counterparts.246 Risk factors include the fact that women are more likely than men to be 'second on the needle' (i.e. they inject after, and are often in- jected by, a male partner), the high level of gender stereotyping and stigma associated with their use, which deters them from accessing harm reduction and treatment services, and the severe lack of gen- der-sensitive drug services. For women sex workers who use drugs, they face additional criminalisation which serves to further enhance their risk of sexual- ly-transmitted or blood-borne infections.247 General Recommendation No. 24 of the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination passed the Good Samaritan Drug Overdose Act to protect both overdose victims and witnesses from certain charges related to drug possession when seeking emergency help.241 Among other additional actions, the federal government has adopted regulatory amendments to make na- loxone available without a prescription242 and to remove regulatory barriers to the prescription of methadone and diacetylmorphine (heroin).243 At international level, Canada, alongside other member states, spearheaded the adoption by the CND of the first-ever resolution addressing stigma against people who use drugs, including in health and other social services.244 While these efforts are commendable, Canada - as many other countries across the globe - continues to rely on criminal sanctions against all those involved in illegal drug activities, including people who use drugs. The ongoing criminalisation of people who use drugs is an important factor hampering progress in the response to this 'national public health crisis' .245 It also remains to be seen what impact the recent move towards a legal, regulated cannabis market might have on the opioid crisis. 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action Action 14(a): 'Ensure that a broad range of drug demand reduction services, including those in the areas of prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and related support services, provide approaches that serve the needs of vulnerable groups and are differentiated on the basis of scientific evidence so that they respond best to the needs of those groups, taking into account gender considerations and cultural background' Action 14(c): 'Provide specialized training for those who work with vulnerable groups, such as patients with psychiatric co-morbidities, mi- nors and women, including pregnant women' 45 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policywomen in all stages of the development, implemen- tation, monitoring and evaluation of drug policies and programmes, and to develop and disseminate gender-sensitive and age-appropriate measures that take into account the specific needs and circumstanc - es faced by women and girls with regard to the world drug problem, bearing in mind that targeted inter - ventions that are based on the collection and analysis of data, including age- and gender-related data, can be particularly effective in meeting the specific needs of drug-affected populations and communities' .260 Nevertheless, although issues affecting women are now being discussed in Vienna-based UN agen- cies, those affecting LGBTQ+ communities have so far been entirely ignored by the CND, although these issues are increasingly being discussed with- in UNAIDS261 and are mentioned in the OHCHR re - port on UNGASS implementation.262 At local level, various programmes have sought to address the health risks associated with practices like chemsex (i.e. drugs used to accompany, enhance and/or facilitate sexual activity, in particular among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, as well as in queer and fetish communities). These in- clude peer support groups, helplines, distribution of harm reduction paraphernalia and counselling, but overall these initiatives remain severely lim- ited.263 At national level, Ireland's latest national drug strategy for 2017-2025 explicitly addresses chemsex.264 Ensuring access to prevention services for children and youth(that is, only 2% of all resolutions adopted since 2009, see Box 5 ). The inclusion, in 2016, of an entire chapter dedicated to the issue of human rights, women, children, youth and vulnerable members of society in the UNGASS Outcome Document is therefore welcome.256 In 2017, the INCB also dedi- cated the thematic chapter of its Annual Report to women and drugs and a specific section on human rights,257 while Booklet 5 of the 2018 UNODC World Drug Report also focuses exclusively on this issue.258 The UNODC also collaborated with the International Network of People Who Use Drugs, UN Women and the WHO to produce a policy brief analysing the specific needs of women who inject drugs.259 These are late but welcome steps towards providing more visibility to the specific issues faced by women and the need to ensure differentiated responses to guar - antee their rights. Furthermore, Human Rights Council Resolution 37/42 calls upon States to 'mainstream a gender perspective into and ensure the involvement of UNODC World Drug Report 2015 Box 5 CND resolutions focusing on women Resolution 61/4.

The Convention also recognises 'the right of the child to the enjoyment of the high- est attainable standard of health and to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health' and the obligation for states parties 'to ensure that no child is deprived of his or her right of access to such health care services' (Article 24.1). In an effort to achieve this obligation, most coun- tries have tried to prevent drug use among youth and children with 'just say no' messaging and scare tactics, instead of seeking to strengthen protective factors and reduce risk factors leading to drug use, in line with the UNODC International standards on drug use prevention.265 A prominent example of such an approach was promoted by Singapore at the 2016 CND in the form of postcards being shared in schools as a drug prevention strategy.266 Although 'just say no' prevention interventions remain widespread, scientific evidence suggests that they have had limited to no impact on drug use prevalence, and have side-lined initiatives with greater efficacy.267 Mandatory drug testing in schools and educational settings have also been used by a number of gov - ernments to deter drug use among youth, despite the human rights concerns raised over this practice. Human Rights Watch notably concluded that 'tak - ing a child's bodily fluids, whether blood or urine, without their consent may violate the right to bodily integrity and constitute arbitrary interference with their privacy and dignity' . 'Depending on how such testing occurs' , Human Rights Watch continued, 'it could also constitute degrading treatment, and may deter children from attending school or college... depriving them of their right to an education' .268 Mandatory drug testing efforts may also be coun- terproductive, with people switching to less detect - able (but sometimes more harmful) substances. Furthermore, despite efforts to prevent drug use among youth and children, the latest data from the UNODC show that the extent of drug consump - tion is higher among young people than among older people in most countries, and for most drug types.269 Reflecting this trend, many prevention pro - grammes have not only sought to deter drug use, but have also focused on providing life-saving harm reduction advice and services and aimed to address the wider social issues faced by young people. In its General Comment No. 15, the UN Committee on Rights of the Child endorsed harm reduction as an important approach to minimising the negative health impacts of drug use among children and young people.270 The Committee also urged states to increase the production and dissemination of accurate and objective information with regards to drug use.271 Similarly, the Special Rapporteur on the right to health has stressed the importance of states providing prevention, harm reduction and treatment services specifically tailored to the needs of children and adolescents.272 In order to better 'involve youth and children' in prevention programmes in line with action 14(b), some peer-led drug education initiatives have been developed by civil society. For instance, Students for Sensible Drug Policies, a student-led organisa- tion promoting harm reduction access for young people, recently launched a peer-led programme called 'Just Say Know' .273 The programme provides certification and training for young people to be - come peer educators and organise workshops and seminars on drug education and harm reduction in schools and universities. The programme was pilot - ed in the USA and Nigeria and has received positive feedback from the peer educators, the students and the schools themselves.274 Although this initiative requires further scientific evaluation, it is an inter - esting example of how to better involve young peo - ple in prevention and education campaigns. To date, limited progress has been made in expand- ing youth-friendly harm reduction services since 2009, and young people continue to face a number of barriers in accessing harm reduction services, such as age restrictions, the need for parental consent in accessing NSPs and OST, or lack of training on how to respond to their needs.275 To improve young people's access to youth-friendly harm reduction services, several NGOs have developed toolkits and guides for practitioners.276 Various UN agencies also collaborated with NGOs to produce a technical brief on HIV and young people who inject drugs in 2015.277 These documents recommend expanded access to child and family welfare services, housing, food, social protection benefits, legal assistance, access to education, vocational training and employment, mental health support, as well as harm reduction services in festivals and nightlife settings, including drug checking services.278 The work of youth-led NGOs (e.g. Students for Sensible Drug Policies, Youth Organisation for Drug Action, Youth RISE and others) focusing on harm reduction and drug policy reform has also brought more visibility to the issue and tech- nical expertise on how to address the complex range of problems faced by young people who use drugs. 47 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policybut are poorly served' .284 UNAIDS also estimated that rates of drug injection among prisoners ranged from 2 to 38% in Europe, 34% in Canada and up to 55% in Australia.285 Where there is little or no access to sterile injection equipment in such settings, it fol- lows that most injection involves the sharing, often by multiple people, of non-sterile equipment, often makeshift 'rigs' fashioned from other items. The UNODC found that the level of access to a com- prehensive range of drug dependence treatment in prisons has only marginally improved between 2010 and 2017, while coverage of some services had Ensuring access to drug services in prisons According to the Nelson Mandela Rules, the right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health extends to people held in prison and other closed settings. As such, people in custody should receive a level of healthcare comparable to that available to people in the community and with- out discrimination.279 There are an estimated 10 million people incarcer - ated worldwide,280 and evidence shows that prisons are high risk environments for the spread of com- municable diseases, with 'the prevalence of HIV, HBV and tuberculosis among people in prison and other closed settings...2 to 10 times higher than among the general population' .281 In some regions, the Americas in particular, incarceration is driven by the mass incarceration of low-level drug offenders. It is therefore unsurprising that drug use in closed settings remains high. Worldwide, the UNODC esti- mates that around one in three prisoners have used drugs at least once while in prisons,282 stating that 'prisoners are at higher risk for infectious diseases 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action Action 15(a): 'Working within their legal frameworks and in compliance with applicable international law, consider allowing the full implementation of drug dependence treatment and care options for offenders, in particular, when appropriate, providing treatment as an alternative to incarceration' Action 15(c): 'Implement comprehensive treatment programmes in detention facilities; commit themselves to offering a range of treatment, care and related support services to drug-dependent inmates, including those aimed at prevention of the transmission of related infectious diseases, pharmacological and psychosocial treatment and rehabilitation; and further commit themselves to providing programmes aimed at preparation for release and prisoner support programmes for the transition between incarceration and release, re-entry and social reintegration' Action 16(d): 'Provide appropriate training so that criminal justice and/or prison staff carry out drug demand reduction measures that are based on scientific evidence and are ethical and so that their attitudes are respectful, non- judgemental and non-stigmatizing'Box 6 UN comprehensive package of 15 key interventions in prison In 2013, the UNODC, the International Labour Organization, UNDP , the WHO and UNAIDS released a policy brief on the prevention, treatment and care of HIV in prisons and oth- er closed settings which promotes a compre - hensive package of 15 interventions: 1. Information, education and communication 2. Condom programmes 3. Prevention of sexual violence 4. Drug dependence treatment, including opioid substitution therapy 5. Needle and syringe programmes 6. Prevention of transmission through medical or dental services 7. Prevention of transmission through tat - tooing, piercing and other forms of skin penetration 8. Post-exposure prophylaxis 9. HIV testing and counselling 10. HIV treatment, care and support 11. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis 12. Prevention of mother-to-child transmission 13.

Treatment quality also remains an issue, with servic - es available 'not necessarily of the same standard as those provided in the community' .292 Additional is- sues include long waiting times to access treatment, unnecessary restrictions for some prisoners, and the ongoing stigma and discrimination associated with OST in prison.293 With regards to other drug services in prison, in particular those included in the UN comprehensive package of 15 key interventions in prison (see Box 6), the UNODC reported that only antiretroviral therapy and HIV testing and counselling were con- sistently reported to be widely available in prison settings, and coverage for tuberculosis prevention, diagnosis and treatment among people who use drugs has increased since 2014.294 However, the availability of NSPs in prison, which was already limited to only 10 countries in 2010,295 was further reduced in 2016 to only eight countries, with Iran and Romania having closed down their services.296 Discussions are underway in Canada to start imple - menting NSPs in all federal prisons. Condoms are rarely made available in prisons despite the higher risks of contracting sexually transmitted diseases while in prison.297 Little progress was also made in expanding the provision of measures aimed at re - ducing the risks of overdose, despite the fact that 'people who use heroin are exposed to a severe risk of death from overdose after release from prison, especially in the first two weeks' .298 In 2016, only a small number of countries provided varying de - grees of overdose prevention training and distribut - ed naloxone to prisoners on or prior to their release, Figure 5.

In countries where it is available, OST is sometimes only available in one or two prisons, generally in male prisons - even though women incarcerated for drug offences 'suffer worse consequences than men' , meaning that women generally have no access to these programmes while incarcerated.290 This is despite the recommen- dation from the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women that 'gender-sen- sitive and evidence-based drug treatment services to reduce harmful effects for women who use drugs, including harm reduction programmes for women in detention' should be available.291 In some cases, people can only access OST in prison if they were 2x - 10xHIV, HCV & TB prevalence in prison higher than among the general populaonCredit: Juan Fernandez Ochoa, IDPC 49 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policyincluding Estonia, Ireland, Norway, Spain, the UK,299 various provinces in Canada and two US states.300 In terms of progress towards Action 16(d), train- ings targeted at criminal justice and prison staff on demand reduction measures in prison settings have fallen in 2016-2017 to the 'lowest recorded level' , with a decrease most noticeable among 'law enforcement and prison staff' .301 The UNODC also reported that 'harm reduction activities initiated by officers were primarily focused on the potential threat of prisoner-to-staff transmission' ,302 rather than aiming to reduce the health risks of drug use among prison inmates. Providing alternatives to prison or punishment for people who use drugs 'A criminal record for a young person for a minor drug offence can be a far greater threat to their well-being than occasional drug use' , Kofi Annan, former UN Secretary General303 Article 4(c) of the 1988 UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substanc - es provides that 'in appropriate cases of a minor nature, the Parties may provide, as alternatives to conviction or punishment, measures such as educa- tion, rehabilitation or social reintegration, as well as, when the offender is a drug abuser, treatment and aftercare' (emphasis added).304 The 2009 Plan of Action also promotes for the use of such alterna- tives in action 15(a), while recognising 'the concept of drug dependence as a multifactorial health and social problem' in action 2(g). Despite these com- mitments, data from the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) shows that one in five prisoners worldwide is incarcerated for a drug offence,305 of whom 83% are in prison for drug use or possession for personal use.306 The need to make better use of alternatives to prison and punishment for people who use drugs has been recognised in paragraph 4.j of the UNGASS Outcome Document,307 in CND resolution 58/5 'Supporting the collaboration of public health and justice authorities in pursuing alternative measures to conviction or 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action Action 15(a): 'Working within their legal frameworks and in compliance with applicable international law, consider allowing the full implementation of drug dependence treatment and care options for offenders, in particular, when appropriate, providing treatment as an alternative to incarceration'punishment for appropriate drug related offences of a minor nature' ,308 and by a number of UN agencies and entities that have called for the decriminalisation of people who use drugs, including the UNODC,309 the OHCHR,310 UNAIDS,311 WHO,312 the United Nations Development Programme,313 a number of UN Special Rapporteurs on human rights,314 the UN Commit - tee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights,315 UN Women,316 as well as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, UNICEF, the World Food Programme, the International Labour Organization, UNESCO, the UN Population Fund and the International Organization for Migration.317 Similarly, various regional bodies have given visibility to the issue. In 2015, CICAD com- missioned a study on the availability and effectiveness of alternatives to incarceration to inform the debate in the Americas,318 and also concluded that 'Decrim- inalization of drug use needs to be considered as a core element in any public health strategy' .319 More recently, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights recommended the decriminalisation of drug use and possession for personal use as a way of re - ducing pre-trial detention and improving prison con- ditions.320 The European Union also released a study on the various alternatives to incarceration across the region321 and adopted Council Conclusions in support of the practice.322 Finally, the need for 'alter - natives to incarceration for minor offenses' featured in the African Union's 2013-2017 Plan of Action on Drug Control.323 At national level, only 26 countries have adopted a decriminalisation model, whether de jure (enshrined in the law), or de facto (in practice only), focusing on all substances for some or only cannabis for many others.324 These include: Armenia, various provinces in Australia, Belgium, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Ger - many, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Latvia, Mexico, the Neth- erlands, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, various US states and Uruguay.325 In Argentina and Georgia, the criminalisation of drug possession for personal use was ruled as un- constitutional, but no legislative reform has yet tak - en place in either country. Only six of the countries 26 have adopted a model of countries decriminalisaonCredit: Juan Fernandez Ochoa, IDPC50 Taking stock: A decade of drug policyThe Portuguese decriminalisation policy emerged in 2000 - under the leadership of for - mer President and current UN Secretary Gen - eral Antonio Guterres - thanks to a confluence of several political and social factors. At the time, the HIV epidemic among people who use drugs had surged massively, more than 75% of prisoners were incarcerated for drug-related crimes, and mass media was fuelling public fears that people using drugs would inevitably die. As a result, drug policy quickly became the top priority of the government. A com - mission, composed of experts from different backgrounds and expertise, was established in 1998 to draft a new 'National strategy to fight against drugs' . At the time, the country's strat - egy already promoted inclusiveness and broad participation of people who use drugs, their families, health and education professionals, the courts, the community, etc. The national strategy was approved in April 1999, enshrin - ing in the law the fundamental principles of humanism, pragmatism, innovation, the importance of scientific evidence, as well as community participation in drug policy design and implementation. The decriminalisation model was officially adopted with Law 30/2000 in July 2001, and was followed by significant investments in a broad and coordinated network of health and social services. Law 30/2000 introduced a system of referral to administrative panels called 'Commissions for the Dissuasion of Drug Addiction' . A person detained by the police with up to 10 days' worth of drugs is referred to the Commission which can orientate them towards voluntary harm reduction and treat - ment services, social services, and also impose fines and community service - although sanc - tions are rarely used in practice. Although still enshrined in a punitive approach, the model adopted in Portugal has nonethe - less greatly improved health outcomes, with a drop in new HIV infections attributed to in - jection, reduced numbers of overdose deaths, and a significantly lower rate of drug-induced mortality among adults than the European average (3.86 deaths per million recorded in Portugal compared to 21.8 deaths per million across the EU in 2016). The policy has also fa - cilitated access to voluntary drug dependence treatment and harm reduction interventions, and has reduced the incarceration rate for drug offences, while enabling law enforce - ment efforts to focus on high-level traffickers and organised crime.326 However, even the Portuguese decriminalisa - tion model is facing various challenges, not least the issue of funding. Harm reduction ser - vices in Portugal are mainly provided by NGOs, with a strong community basis, and are funded by up to 80% by the state, with NGOs covering the remaining 20%. Government budget cuts, combined with the difficulty for NGOs to raise money for an issue that is no longer a top pri - ority for Portuguese society, have resulted in hard working conditions, low salaries and lack of training for harm reduction service provid - ers. The Portuguese Harm Reduction Network submitted a set of recommendations to the Health Secretary of State in October 2017 to improve harm reduction sustainability, includ - ing the need to change the funding rules for drug services. So far, however, no change has been made, and the Portuguese policy remains under pressure. Recent reforms have also split the management of drug services into two branches, the first managed by the Portuguese drug agency (Servi\u00e7o de Interven\u00e7\u00e3o nos Com - portamentos Aditivos e nas Depend\u00eancias) and in charge of defining the national strate - gy, producing information, introducing inno - vation and evaluating implementation; and the second concerned with local diagnosis of needs and implementation.327 Tension and lack of coordination between the two branches are also issues of concern. Finally, although drug use is decriminalised, people continue to rely on the criminal black market to purchase their drug of choice, with no control over the purity or quality of the substance used. Nevertheless, and despite these challenges, the Portuguese decriminalisation policy is regarded as an im - portant model, having proven its effectiveness in protecting the health and improving the social inclusion of people who use drugs.

In some cases, law enforcement agencies use these registries and the information they contain for interrogation purposes.332 In 2013, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture concluded that 'Use of drug registries - where people who use drugs are identified and listed by police and health-care workers, and their civil rights curtailed - are violations of patient confidentiality that lead to further ill-treatment by health providers' .333 These practices also act as a strong deterrent for accessing life-saving health and social services.334 Other countries or jurisdictions which have not decriminalised drug use have nonetheless adopted diversion models for people who use drugs, which can be triggered at time of arrest, during trial and post-incarceration. The level of effectiveness for these alternatives to incarceration varies greatly.335 For instance, the drug courts model implement - ed in the USA and promoted in various regions of the world, especially in Latin America, has been subject to considerable criticism. A 2018 compre - hensive study of drug courts implemented across the Americas has found that they were 'a costly, cumbersome intervention that has limited, if any, listed above - Croatia, the Czech Republic, Ecuador, Israel, Jamaica and Mexico; the province of Western Australia and several US states made their move towards decriminalisation during the period 2009- 2018, with ongoing discussions in several countries such as Ghana, Ireland, Norway and Tunisia. Canada is expected to bring into force, in late 2018, legis- lation decriminalising possession of cannabis for personal use, although the government continues to reject calls to decriminalise possession of other substances. The low prevalence of decriminalisa- tion among member states as a viable alternative to punitive approaches persists, despite increasing evidence that removing criminal sanctions against people who use drugs can reduce prison over - crowding, improve health outcomes, and address drug use-related stigma and discrimination.328 The decriminalisation models adopted in the countries mentioned above vary considerably, as do their lev - el of effectiveness.329 The model with the most solid evidence base is Portugal330 (see Box 7 ). Some countries do not impose criminal sanctions against drug use or possession for personal use per se but continue to use excessive and dispropor - tionate administrative punishments that violate a number of human rights, including the rights to health, liberty and privacy. These include compul- sory detention (see below), forced urine testing (including in Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Georgia, Indonesia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyr - gyzstan, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Pakistan, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lan- ka, Tajikistan, Thailand, Turkey, Turkmenistan, forced urine tesngcorporal punishment compulsory registraon compulsory detenon can also amount to acts of torture or cruel treatment.Administrave punishmentCredit: Juan Fernandez Ochoa, IDPC52 Taking stock: A decade of drug policybarrier to an effective drug court system.342 Other approaches have yielded better results. For exam- ple, the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) programme launched in 2011 in Seattle, USA, has focused on diverting people who use drugs at the time of arrest to a case worker providing health and social guidance on a case-by-case basis. Evaluations of the programme have shown positive results, and similar initiatives are now being implemented in other US cities.343 Improving access to controlled substances for medical purposes One of the stated key objectives of the UN drug control treaties is to ensure access to controlled substances for medical and scientific purposes - but only one action in the entire 2009 Political Declara- tion and Plan of Action is dedicated to the issue: Action 10(c). The cornerstone essential medicine for palliative care and pain relief is oral morphine. In its General Comment No. 14, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also recog- nised the obligations for member states to 'respect the right to health by, inter alia, refraining from denying or limiting equal access for all persons... to preventive, curative and palliative health servic - es' , and ensure the availability of 'essential drugs' included on the WHO Model List of Essential Med- icines without delay as a 'core obligation' .3442009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action Action 10(c): 'Continue to comply with the procedures established under the international drug control conventions and relevant resolutions of the Economic and Social Council relating to the submission to the International Narcotics Control Board of estimates of their requirements for narcotic drugs and assessments of requirements for psychotropic substances so as to facilitate the import of the required narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and to enable the Board, in cooperation with Governments, to maintain a balance between the demand for and the supply of those drugs and substances in order to ensure the relief of pain and suffering and the availability of medication-assisted therapy as part of a comprehensive package of services for the treatment of drug dependence, while bearing in mind, in accordance with national legislation, the World Health Organization Model List of Essential Medicines'Box 8 Addressing the health impacts of aerial spraying of crops cultivated for drug production The 2009 Political Declaration and its Plan of Action focus exclusively on the health aspects of drug use, without considering the health implications of supply reduction efforts in ar - eas affected by illegal crop cultivation. This is despite evidence that forced crop eradication through aerial spraying using harmful herbi- cides have had severe impacts on the rights and health of local communities. In 2015, the WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded that glyphosate - often used for aerial spraying - 'probably causes cancer' ,336 while the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health declared that there was 'trustworthy evidence that aerial fumi- gation with glyphosate...damages the phys- ical health'337 of affected communities. This includes respiratory problems, skin rashes, diarrhoea, eye problems and miscarriages.338 Aerial spraying also has indirect health impacts. In Colombia, for instance, aerial spraying has damaged legal subsistence food crops such as bananas, beans, plantains and yuca, as well as chicken and fish farms, located near coca fields.339 In such contexts, subsistence farmers not only lose their main source of income (coca and other crops des- tined for the illegal drug market), but also their main source of food (as is the case with any form of forced eradication). Furthermore, aerial spraying can damage rivers and wa- ters, threatening to leave entire communities without access to clean water.340 impact on reducing incarceration. Indeed, for many it may have the opposite effect: increasing criminal justice supervision and subjecting participants who fail to graduate to harsher penalties than they may have otherwise received' .341 In many cases, instead of focusing on people dependent on drugs having committed other offences, drug courts focus on people caught for simple drug use or possession for personal use (generally cannabis). The unavailability of evidence-based treatment programmes in vari- ous countries in the region also acts as a significant 53 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policyThe need to ensure access to 'essential medicines, including controlled medicines' for surgical care and anaesthesia was also recognised by the World Health Assembly as an essential component of uni- versal health coverage. The World Health Assembly also noted that a large proportion of the global population had limited access to opioid analgesics for pain relief, and that 5.5 billion people (i.e. 83% of the world's population) lived in countries with low to non-existent access to analgesics, with only 710 million people (11% of the world's population) having moderate to adequate access.348 In 2013, the Special Rapporteur on torture con- cluded that 'Ensuring the availability and accessi- bility of medications included in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines' was 'a legal obligation under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961' , adding that 'When the failure of States to take positive steps, or to refrain from interfering with health-care services, condemns patients to unnecessary suffering from pain, States not only fall foul of the right to health but may also violate an affirmative obligation under the prohibition of torture and ill-treatment' .349 The severe lack of access to controlled substances for medical purposes is driven, among other issues, by national rules and regulations around controlled medicines that go far beyond the requirements of the 1961 and 1971 drug control treaties. These In 2010, the INCB reported that 'Although medical science has the capacity to provide relief for most forms of moderate to severe pain, over 80 per cent of the world population will have insufficient anal- gesia, or no analgesia at all, if they suffer from such pain' .345 In 2015, the INCB published a special report on access to controlled medicines, which showed little improvement from the 2009 data. In its special report, the INCB concluded that 'Around 5.5 billion people still have limited or no access to medicines containing narcotic drugs, such as codeine or mor - phine, leaving 75 per cent of the world population without access to proper pain relief treatment. Around 92 per cent of morphine used worldwide is consumed in countries in which only 17 per cent of the world population lives: primarily the United States of America, Canada, Western Europe, Austral- ia and New Zealand' .346 In 2017, a study also estimat - ed that 298.5 metric tonnes of morphine-equivalent opioids were distributed in the world each year, but only 0.1 metric tonnes (0.03%) were made available in low-income countries. As a result, 25.5 million people who died in 2015 - representing 45% of all global deaths that year - experienced serious health-related suffering. 80% of these deaths were in developing regions of the world. The study also found that each year, 2.5 million children die ex - periencing serious health-related suffering. 98% of these children lived in developing countries, and 93% of these deaths were avoidable.34775%of theworld remain without access to proper pain relief treatment.92% of the global supply of morphine is used by 17% of the world populaon.Credit: Juan Fernandez Ochoa, IDPCCredit: Juan Fernandez Ochoa, IDPC54 Taking stock: A decade of drug policyhampering access, increased empowerment and training of frontline healthcare workers, the adop - tion of a palliative care policy or strategy, and the al- location of more funding towards providing access to palliative care and pain relief.356 It is in the field of medicinal cannabis that most progress has been made since the adoption of the 2009 Political Declaration - despite the UN drug control system delineating cannabis as a drug whose liability 'to abuse and to produce ill effects...is not offset by substantial therapeutic advantages' .357 48 countries now provide some form of medicinal cannabis for a number of ail- ments (see Figure 6).358 24 of these countries have adopted or reviewed drug legislations to allow or expand access to medicinal cannabis between 2009 and 2018, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, the Czech Re - public, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Jamaica, Lesotho, Luxembourg, Malta, Macedonia, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, various states in the USA and Zimbabwe. In the UK, a recent scandal involving a 12-year old boy whose anti-epileptic medicine (cannabidiol oil) was confiscated by customs agents at a London airport showcased the urgent need to review drug legislations and ensure broader access to include overly strict requirements such as special prescription forms, limitations on the number of days a prescription can cover, limitations on which healthcare workers can prescribe controlled sub - stances, the criminalisation of healthcare providers for prescribing medications and the resulting fear of arrest, requirements for additional licenses for hospi- tals, pharmacists and healthcare workers, additional record keeping or reporting requirements, and lim- itations on the daily doses that can be prescribed. Lack of understanding and training about palliative care and pain relief - in particular 'opiophobia' - are also important barriers to improving the availabil- ity of controlled medicines.350 The funding gap is also a major issue for ensuring adequate access to controlled medicines - although it is estimated that 'the cost of meeting the global shortfall of about 48.5 metric tonnes of morphine-equivalent opioids is about $145 million per year' , the equivalent of 0.0002% of global GDP .351 Despite the urgency of ensuring better access to controlled medicines, only four CND resolutions were adopted on this issue since 2009 (see Box 9) - representing just 3% of all CND resolutions adopted between 2009 and 2018. The UNGASS Outcome Document has made considerable pro - gress in this area, with an entire chapter aimed at improving access to controlled substances for medical and scientific purposes.352 In 2014, the World Health Assembly also adopted Resolution 67.19 'Strengthening of palliative care as a com- ponent of comprehensive care throughout the life course' , noting CND resolutions 53/4 and 54/6, and to essential medicines...including opioid analgesics such as morphine, in line with the three United Nations international drug control conventions, contributes to the realization of the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and well-being' .353 In 2018, in order to pro - vide 'concrete information about actions Member States can take to address the negative health out - comes, such as the enormous burden of untreated pain around the world, associated with inadequate access to controlled medicines' , the UNODC re - leased its 'Technical guidance: Increasing access and availability of controlled medicines' .354 Some progress has been made in various countries to improve access to and availability of controlled medicines, including in Costa Rica, India, Mexico, Uganda (see Box 10) and Ukraine - with Kenya, Ma- lawi, Nigeria, Rwanda and Swaziland expected to follow similar steps undertaken by Uganda.355 These have included the removal of regulatory barriers Box 9 CND resolutions adopted on access to controlled medicines since 2009 Resolution 57/10.

In its provisional conclusions, the ECDD recommended that pure CBD 'should not be scheduled within the International Drug Control Conventions' . The ECDD also decided to proceed to a critical review of cannabis plant and resin, extracts and tinctures of cannabis, Del- ta-9-THC and isomers of THC, with conclusions planned to be released on time for the 2019 Ministerial Segment.363Medicinal cannabis regulated Argenna, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Croaa, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Macedonia, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Puerto Rico, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay Pilot projects on medical cannabis Denmark, IrelandNabiximols (Savex) authorised Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Kuwait, Liechtenstein, Luxemburg, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, United Arab Emirates, United KingdomFigure 6.

Available scientific evidence, for instance, supports the potential therapeutic use of cannabis in neurological diseases376 such as multiple sclero - sis377 and epilepsy,378 chronic pain379 and appetite stimulation.380 Similarly, several studies have high- lighted the possible benefits of MDMA for patients with treatment-resistant post-traumatic stress dis- order, of LSD for cluster headaches, and of psilocy - bin for obsessive-compulsive disorder and cluster headaches, among others.381 It should nonetheless be recalled that 'science' may be conceptualised differently from one country to another. This issue was particularly visible in 2015 However, there remains significant barriers in medi- cal research on controlled drugs, with little improve - ment since 2009. The classification of substances like LSD, MDMA, cathinone and psilocybin in Schedule I of the 1971 Convention and of cannabis in Sched- ules I and IV of the 1961 Convention has resulted in tight controls at national level, severely restricting their access for scientific research due to the bu- reaucracy associated with conducting research or clinical trials.372 In the UK, for example, obtaining a Schedule 1 licence under the Misuse of Drugs Act to conduct scientific research takes over a year, costs around GBP 5,000 (US$ 6,500), and requires high levels of security for the research facility.373 Obtain- ing the substance itself may also present difficulties as they are usually unavailable from standard chem- ical manufacturers. Furthermore, the fact that these substances are placed in Schedule I - and are there - fore considered as dangerous with little therapeutic value - was found to be 'a powerful deterrent to Box 10 Improving access to controlled medicines in Uganda Uganda has become a leader in East Africa for improving access to palliative care. Although coverage remains severely limited with 90% of Ugandans in need not being able to access pal - liative care,366 over the past 20 years the gov - ernment has undertaken a number of steps to improve the situation. These steps have included incorporating palliative care in the Ugandan 'Health sector development plan for 2015/16 to 2019/20' ,367 and the approval of the first 'National palliative care policy' in 2015,368 hence providing a com - prehensive framework to scale up palliative care services nationwide. Palliative care was also integrated in the curriculum of healthcare professionals, in an effort to facilitate its appli - cation in mainstream healthcare, but also to broaden the range of opioid prescribers - al - lowing nurses and clinical officers to prescribe oral morphine for pain management.369 The registration of oral morphine as a palliative care treatment by the National Drug Authority and its inclusion into Uganda's national list of essential medicines was also instrumental to ensure better access to the medicine for pain relief and palliative care. Other factors of suc - cess have included a long-standing relation - ship between the Ministry of Health, Hospice Africa Uganda, the Palliative Care Association of Uganda and the private sector,370 as well as the allocation of government funding to pur - chase morphine. Finally, efforts were made to destigmatise and conduct more research on palliative care. Despite these positive steps, various obstacles remain. For instance, the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Control) Act, prom - ulgated in 2015, inadvertently made prescrip - tion and dispensation of morphine by nurses illegal, hampering efforts to expand palliative care since nurses are at the frontlines of pallia - tive care provision. The 2015 legislation, draft - ed by the Ministry of Internal Affairs without consultation with the Ministry of Health, also approved an approach overly focused on inter - diction of drug use and trafficking, greatly im - pacting upon access to controlled substances for palliative care and pain relief and hindering the realisation of the right to health.371 Civil society calls to reform the 2015 Act led to the creation of an ad hoc committee in September 2017. Comprised of representatives from the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Internal Af - fairs and civil society, the committee advises the government on issues related to palliative care and harm reduction, and on how to im - prove the 2015 legislation. In the meantime, the Chief of Counter-Narcotics has committed not to prosecute nurses prescribing and dis - pensing morphine. 57 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policygovernments should adopt \"all positive measures\" to \"increase life expectancy\"' .389 This includes several elements, particularly a range of economic, social and cultural rights which are essential to meet the basic needs and lead a dignified life. The death penalty for drug offences Although the death penalty is not specifically men- tioned in the 2009 Political Declaration, international human rights mechanisms and the INCB are unani- mous in their conclusion that drug offences do not meet the threshold of 'most serious crimes' , which are the only crimes under international law to which the death penalty may conceivably be applied.390 How - ever, 33 jurisdictions worldwide still prescribe capital punishment for drug-related crimes. Although only a minority execute for these offences (see Table 4),391 since 2009 at least 3,940 people were executed for drug offences.392 This figure is likely to amount for only a fraction of those executed because of the un- der-reporting and secrecy surrounding the practice in various countries - most notably China, where thousands of people are believed to have been exe - cuted for drug offences in the past decade.393 In addition to the serious human rights implications of such an approach, available evidence shows that the death penalty has no measurable impact on deterring involvement in drug-related offences, the prevalence of drug use and drug-related health and social harms. In fact, Asia - where most countries imposing the death penalty for drugs are locat - ed - is one of the regions where drug use overall is increasing.394 A growing number of human rights mechanisms, drug control bodies and governments have called for an end to the death penalty for drug offences, including the UNODC395 and the INCB.396 The wide opposition to capital punishment for drugs was ev - ident during the 2016 UNGASS, where 66 member states spoke against the practice.397 Regrettably, as in 2009, no consensus could be achieved between member states on the issue, leading to its omission from the UNGASS Outcome Document.398during the negotiation of CND Resolution 58/7382 on strengthening cooperation with the scientific community on drug demand and supply reduction policies. Proposed by the Russian Federation, the resolution was the subject of concerns among civil society groups since the country's discourse around harm reduction, and OST in particular, has failed to recognise available scientific evidence of effective - ness for these interventions. Instead, the Russian Federation has long promoted its science of 'nar - cology' , which draws its roots from Soviet Russian psychiatry.383 In such contexts, the UNODC, WHO and other UN entities have a key leadership role to play in collating and assessing scientific evidence on drug control. 2.1.3 The right to life 'Although drugs and crime kill, governments should not kill because of them' , UNODC Executive Director Foreword of the 2009 Political Declaration384 The right to life, enshrined within Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,385 Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Polit - ical Rights,386 and Article 6 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child,387 is the precondition for the full realisation of human dignity and the effec - tive exercise of all human rights.388 The UN Human Rights Committee has stressed that the 'right to life...should not be interpreted narrowly and that 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action Action 22(c): 'Ensure that supply reduction measures are carried out in full conformity with the purposes and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, the three international drug control conventions and, in particular, with full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States and all human rights and fundamental freedoms' Action 41(c): 'Ensure that measures to control precursors and amphetamine-type stimulants are carried out in full conformity with the purposes and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, the international drug control conventions and, in particular, with full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States and all human rights and fundamental freedoms' 3,940 people have been executed for drug oences over the past decade 33 jurisdicons retain the death penalty for drug-related crimes.Credit: Juan Fernandez Ochoa, IDPC58 Taking stock: A decade of drug policyfor Human Rights condemned these killings and expressed concern that marginalised communities were being particularly targeted.417 Similarly, the ap - proach of 'shoot to kill' while enforcing drug laws, in violation of the right to life, has been condemned by the UNODC which concluded that 'Such responses contravene the provisions of the international drug control conventions, do not serve the cause of justice, and will not help to ensure that \"all people can live in health, dignity and peace, with security and prosper - i t y \"'.418 The INCB,419 various UN human rights bodies420 and governments421 also condemned the practice of extrajudicial killings as a drug control strategy. 2.1.4 The right to be free from torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment The right to be free from torture and other cruel, in- human and degrading treatment or punishment is enshrined in Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights422 and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrad- ing Treatment or Punishment.423 This prohibition is absolute and non-derogable, even in time of public emergency, and can never be justified whether on the basis of 'exceptional circumstances' , 'superior orders' , 'necessity' or other reason. In 2009, member states committed to ensure that both demand reduc - tion and supply reduction measures would respect human rights. However, a large number of human rights violations associated with drug control efforts have been documented by the UN and civil society between 2009 and 2018. Perhaps in response to these abuses, in 2016 member states committed to 'uphold the prohibition of...torture and other cruel, inhuman At national level, positive trends have been doc - umented since 2009. The number of reported executions (excluding those carried out in secret) dropped from over 600 in 2010 to 280 in 2017.399 Countries are progressively moving away from the death penalty as a mandatory punishment for drug crimes, either by removing it from their legal system or allowing more discretion for judges when impos- ing the sentence (e.g. India400 and Malaysia401) or by limiting its scope (e.g. Singapore402). Other initia- tives aimed at curbing the use of the death penalty were adopted by Thailand403 and Palestine.404 One of the most significant developments was the amend- ment approved in November 2017 by Iran which raised the minimum quantity of drugs required to incur capital punishment.405 This reform had impres- sive effects, with the number of executions for drug crimes dropping from 242 in 2017 (an average of one execution every 1.5 days), to just three in the first seven months of 2018.406 At the same time, however, some governments have revamped their war on drugs approach. In the Philippines, a bill reinstating the death penalty for a wide range of drug-related offences was approved in the House of Parliament and is now sitting in the Senate,407 despite the fact that the reintroduction of capital punishment would also contravene the Phil- ippines' obligations under the Second Optional Pro - tocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Po - litical Rights,408 an international treaty ratified by the country in 2007 which categorically prohibits exe - cutions and commits countries to abolish the death penalty. Similar bills aimed at widening the use of the death penalty for drugs are being considered in Bangladesh409 and Sri Lanka.410 Furthermore, since 2009, countries which had previously abandoned or strongly limited this practice resumed executions - in particular Indonesia and Singapore411 - while other countries, such as Saudi Arabia, continue to execute large numbers of drug offenders each year. Extrajudicial killings of suspected drug offenders The recent trend of targeting and killing suspected drug offenders has raised many concerns over vio - lations to the right to life. Such practices have been reported in the Philippines (see Box 11),412 Indone - sia413 and Bangladesh.414 In Indonesia, the police were involved in the killing of an estimated 79 suspected drug dealers in 2017 - a sharp rise from the 14 killings recorded in 2016 and 10 killings in 2015.415 In Bangla- desh, between May and July 2018, at least 200 people were killed at the hands of the police and more than 25,000 were arrested for suspicion of involvement in the illegal drug trade.416 The UN High Commissioner 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action Action 6(a): 'Ensure that demand reduction measures respect human rights and the inherent dignity of all individuals and facilitate access for all drug users to prevention services and health- care and social services, with a view to social reintegration' Action 22(c): 'Ensure that supply reduction measures are carried out in full conformity with the purposes and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, the three international drug control conventions and, in particular, with full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States and all human rights and fundamental freedoms' 59 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policyBox 11 Extrajudicial killings in the Philippines While campaigning for the Philippines' pres - idential election in 2016, Rodrigo Duterte committed to launch a war against drugs that featured killing people suspected of using or supplying drugs, which he justified to the pub - lic by the extensive level of drug-related activ - ities in the country. On the day of his inaugu - ration as president on 31 July 2016, he made a plea to the people: 'If you know of any addicts, go ahead and kill them yourself as getting their parents to do it would be too painful' .424 He also encouraged the police to kill drug offenders and promised them immunity.425 According to the Philippines government, 4,075 'drug personalities' were killed by secu - rity forces during drug law enforcement op - erations in the period 1 July 2016 to 20 March 2018.426 The Philippine National Police report - ed that an additional 22,983 people were killed from 1 July 2016 to 21 May 2018 - this repre - sents at least 33 people killed each day during this period, in cases classified as 'deaths under inquiry' .427 In total, this amounts to over 27,000 people killed since 1 July 2016.428 Recognising that the reported numbers of people killed are disputed by some NGOs, a project supporting multidisciplinary and evidence-based research on the drug control campaign in the Philip - pines known as the 'Drug Archive' has collated and analysed data on verified cases of killings from 10 May 2016 to 28 September 2017, which represent only a fraction of the killings.429 During the first 15 months of the Duterte presi- dency, there were only 19 days where no deaths were reported in the media, including four days in February 2017 after the Philippines National Police drug law enforcement operations were suspended following the kidnapping and mur - der of a South Korean businessman; and five days in August 2017 after public outrage against the killing of 17-year old Kian delos Santos, where CCTV footage showed him being dragged away by police then shot to death in an alley.430 Reports from civil society organisations also un- veiled a network of links between state author - ities and unidentified armed persons, and un- der-the-table payments to police to kill suspects. In addition, 'drug watch lists' , used to identify people suspected of using or selling drugs, have acted as unsubstantiated blacklists, in violation of the right of due process.431 Despite the thousands of people unlawfully killed in police operations or cases of 'deaths under inquiry' , as of September 2017 the Philip - pines Department of Justice reported that pros- ecutors had only filed 19 murder and homicide cases nationwide in connection with the gov - ernment's war on drugs, with no convictions.432 The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has condemned the impunity for extrajudicial killings related to the Philippines' war on drugs, as well as the ongoing threats by Duterte against people suspected of drug-related activities and people working to uphold and protect human rights (including national and international hu- man rights defenders such as Senator Leila de Lima,433 the Philippines Commission on Human Rights and the UN Special Rapporteur on extra- judicial, summary or arbitrary executions).434 According to civil society organisations, this wave of deliberate and widespread extrajudi- cial executions, which appear to be systematic, planned and organised by the authorities, may constitute crimes against humanity. In February 2018, the International Criminal Court opened a preliminary examination into whether crimes against humanity had been committed in the Philippines' war on drugs,435 prompting Presi- dent Duterte to announce, a few weeks later, that the Philippines would withdraw from the Rome Statute.436 Memorial during the 2017 Support.

This is the case in Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru and Puerto Rico.445 Numer - ous studies from NGOs, UN agencies and academics have reported widespread cases of human rights violations associated with compulsory detention, including lack of due process, inhuman, cruel and degrading treatment (including beatings, whipping and flogging) sometimes amounting to torture, arduous physical exercises, forced labour, denial of medical treatment, imposition of unscientific and abusive methods of 'treatment' , and humiliation of various kinds.446 In 2015, the UNODC issued a discussion paper providing recommendations to support member states to transition from compulsory detention to or degrading treatment or punishment' within the UNGASS Outcome Document.437 Corporal punishment for drug offences Under the laws and religious practices of several countries, criminal courts and/or administrative bodies may impose corporal punishment for a num- ber of drug offences, either as the main sanction or in addition to a prison sentence. The offences range from simple drug use, to possession of cer - tain amounts of drugs and drug trafficking. Corporal punishments can include caning, whipping, lashing, flogging, stoning and bodily mutilation. Such prac - tices have been reported in Brunei Darussalam, In- donesia, Iran, Malaysia, the Maldives, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen.438 Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia and Singapore were also reported to use corporal punishment on children.439 The intensity of applica- tion of corporal punishment varies from country to country, with Singapore and Malaysia being some of the most active states in the number of cases for which corporal punishment is applied.440 This practice has been condemned by UN human rights bodies and entities as amounting to cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment and contravenes the absolute prohibition of torture.441 Compulsory detention as 'treatment' In 2012, 12 UN entities - including the UNODC, WHO, UNAIDS, UNICEF, UN Women, OHCHR and others - called for the closure of compulsory drug detention centres, concluding that they 'raise 27,000~ extrajudicial killings since Rodrigo Duterte became President of the Philippines, in 2016.Credit: Juan Fernandez Ochoa, IDPCCredit: Juan Fernandez Ochoa, IDPC 61 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policydrug offenders were tortured, including through beatings, to provide information about their drug suppliers.450 Another study found that people who use drugs in Russia were regular victims of physical violence, ill-treatment and rape at the hands of law enforcement officers to obtain information and 'fa- cilitate \"confession\"' .451 The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture also documented cases of people depend- ent on drugs being denied OST 'as a way of eliciting criminal confessions through inducing painful with- drawal symptoms' , which is recognised as a form of torture.452 The UN Committee against Torture has recently raised concerns over this practice.453 Addi- tional studies found that women are particularly at risk of physical and mental abuse at the hands of the police.454 In Zimbabwe455 and Mexico456 for example, women who use drugs are regularly asked for sexual favour by the police in exchange for their release. voluntary community-based treatment.447 The UN Special Rapporteur on the right to health has high- lighted the mounting evidence that healthcare and support in community settings yield better health outcomes, particularly for marginalised groups.448 However, little progress has been made to close down the centres since 2009. Violence and ill-treatment by law enforcement agencies In various countries around the world, UN entities and civil society organisations have documented widespread cases of violence, excessive use of force and ill-treatment of people who use drugs and drug offenders at the hands of the police or the military. Furthermore, in several contexts the police have adopted militarised drug law enforcement strate - gies, including through training, equipment and techniques to dismantle the illegal drug market. This has been the case, for instance, in countries like Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, where the armed forc - es are granted increasing powers to tackle the drug trade, resulting in an exacerbation of violence. In the midst of Mexico's drug war, between 2011 and mid-2014, 3,260 complaints of torture, enforced disappearances and other human rights violations have been attributed to the armed forces - with only a handful being investigated.449 In 2010, the Special Rapporteur on Torture reported that in Indonesia Credit: Juan Fernandez Ochoa, IDPCCredit: Juan Fernandez Ochoa, IDPCFigure 7.

Rus- sian Federation) which concluded that Russia had violated his rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.463 In Cambodia, the drug war launched in January 2017 has resulted in 17,700 people arrested for suspected drug activities - an 80% increase from the previous year.464 In Bang- ladesh, more than 13,000 people wer e arrested be - tween May and June 2018.465 The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention also concluded that 'the right to liberty of persons in Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights requires that states should have recourse to deprivation of liberty only insofar as it is necessary to meet a pressing societal need, and in a manner proportionate to that need' . Regarding pretrial detention, the Working Group 'noted with concern the practice of over-incarceration...as well as the factors that lead to over-incarceration, includ- ing detainees' ethnic or social origin, poverty and social marginalization' .466 According to international human rights law and standards, pre-trial detention must be an exceptional measure and based on an individualised determination that it is reasonable and necessary only when there is a substantial risk of flight, harm to others or interference with the evidence or investigation that cannot be allayed by other means. The UN Human Rights Commit - tee has further established that pre-trial detention should not be mandatory for any particular crime nor should it be ordered for a period based on the potential sentence.467 The same year, the UN CCPCJ estimated that one in five prisoners worldwide was incarcerated for a drug offence.468 In various regions, women have been particularly affected, with over half of women in prison being incarcerated for drug offences. Al- though they continue to represent a small propor - tion of the general population, female prisoners are the fastest growing prison population, and this is driven by overly punitive drug laws (see Box 12).469 The UN CCPCJ also concluded that the overwhelm- ing majority of those in prison for drug offences were accused of drug use or drug possession for personal use. The rest are generally accused of low-level dealing and micro-trafficking, with a mi- nor proportion imprisoned for high-level, violent drug offences. In Colombia, for example, only about 2% of all prisoners convicted of drug offences are medium to high-ranking figures.470 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action Action 6(a): 'Ensure that demand reduction measures respect human rights and the inherent dignity of all individuals and facilitate access for all drug users to prevention services and health-care and social services, with a view to social reintegration' Action 15(a): 'Working within their legal frameworks and in compliance with applicable international law, consider allowing the full implementation of drug dependence treatment and care options for offenders, in particular, when appropriate, providing treatment as an alternative to incarceration' Action 22(c): 'Ensure that supply reduction measures are carried out in full conformity with the purposes and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, the three international drug control conventions and, in particular, with full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States and all human rights and fundamental freedoms'2.1.5 The right to liberty and to be free from arbitrary detention According to Article 9 of the International Cov - enant on Civil and Political Rights,458 the right to liberty entails that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention, and that no one shall be deprived of their liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law.459 Under the right to liberty, people who are arrested must be informed of the reasons of their arrest and notified of their rights at time of arrest, and must be brought prompt - ly before the judge. Everyone deprived of their liberty has the right to challenge the lawfulness of their detention before a court, and a person unlawfully detained has the right to reparation, including compensation. The UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention found various instances in which people who use drugs were particularly at risk of arbitrary deten- tion,460 and declared that compulsory detention for the purpose of drug 'rehabilitation' was 'inherently arbitrary' .461 Civil society studies have supported these findings. A report on Russia, for instance, found that people who use drugs were regularly victims of arbitrary arrest, planting of evidence to 64 Taking stock: A decade of drug policyand Mexico, for example, pre-trial detention is mandatory for all drug offences, whether of minor or high-level nature, and people can await trial for months up to several years.473 This runs counter to the recommendations by the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to 'ensure that persons are not held in pretrial detention for periods longer than those prescribed by law or proportionate, and that they are promptly brought before a judge' (empha- sis added).474 The principles of proportionality of sentencing and of alternatives to incarceration are welcome additions within the UNGASS Outcome These minor, non-violent drug offences are often punished with longer prison sentences than for violent offences such as rape or murder. In Bolivia, for example, the maximum penalty for drug traffick - ing is 25 years, compared to 20 years for homicide and 15 years for rape.471 In various countries, drug laws and criminal codes impose mandatory mini- mum sentences for drug offences, preventing any flexibility on the part of the judge to impose less se - vere punishment for first-time, non-violent offences. The disproportionate nature of criminal sanctions for drug offences not only violates the right to lib - erty; it can also undermine the rule of law where criminal systems have to absorb a high number of minor offences instead of focusing scarce resourc - es on crimes that have a higher impact on society. Over-incarceration for drug offences can also exac - erbate poverty and marginalisation, as many people involved in low-level dealing or micro-trafficking are in a situation of vulnerability (see Box 12). The sheer number of people incarcerated for drug offences, as well as the proportion of people held in pre-trial detention for drug crimes, have contributed to severe prison overcrowding and dire conditions in detention in many parts of the world - with little progress made to tackle this phenomenon since 2009. In 2015, the OHCHR raised concerns over 're - ports of persons detained for drug-related offences not being registered or promptly brought before a judge' , adding that 'In some States...an arrested per - son suspected of a drug-related offence can be kept in custody without being charged for a substantially longer time than a person detained for other offenc - es can be' .472 In countries like Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador 1 in 5 prisoners worldwide are incarcerated fordrug oences83%~serve sentences for drug possession for personal useIn some parts of the world, over 80% of women incarcerated are serving sentences for drug-related oences.Credit: Juan Fernandez Ochoa, IDPCCredit: Juan Fernandez Ochoa, IDPC Credit: Adam Schaffer, WOLA 65 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policyBox 12 The mass incarceration of women for drug offences in Latin America The 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Ac - tion each have only one reference to women, and neither acknowledges the growing incar - ceration of women for drug-related offences. According to the World Female Imprisonment List, more than 714,000 women and girls are currently being held in penal institutions worldwide.476 The number of women and girls in prison has increased by 53% between mid-2000 and mid-2016, a period in which the global male prison population increased by only 20%.477 In the most extreme example of Brazil, the country's female prison population increased by 342% between 2000 and 2016478 and women incarcerated for drug offences ac - count for about 60% of the total female prison population.479 The highest levels of incarcera - tion of women, however, can be found in East and South East Asia, where the mass incarcer - ation of individuals charged with low-level, non-violent drug offences has led to severe prison overcrowding. As of 2015, over 47,000 women were behind bars in Thailand, 80% of whom were convicted of drug offences.480 In Latin America, most women are arrested for first time, non-violent, low-level but high- risk drug-related activities, such as small-scale drug dealing or transporting drugs, or for sim - ple drug use - and generally engage in illegal drug activities because of poverty, lack of op - portunities and/or coercion. They often have little or no education and live in conditions of poverty. A large number are single mothers, and the sole care provider of their children because of entrenched gender norms.481 They may also need harm reduction or treatment services for drug dependence, mental health issues or physical problems, which are often hard to access in prison. Most have suffered some form of sexual violence before and/or during their incarceration.482 Their incarcera - tion can have severe and long-lasting conse - quences not only for themselves, but also for their families and communities.483The 'UN Rules for the Treatment of Women Prisoners and Non-Custodial Measures for Women Offenders' (the Bangkok Rules), adopt - ed in December 2010 by the UN General As - sembly, were instrumental in recognising the specific characteristics and needs of women deprived of their liberty.484 Those rules, as well as reports from the UN Special Rappor - teur on violence against women485 and the Committee on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women,486 have called upon governments to develop gender-sensi - tive alternatives to incarceration. In Vienna, it was not until March 2016 that the CND adopt - ed a landmark resolution (Resolution 59/5) on 'Mainstreaming a gender perspective in drug-related policies and programmes' , which recognised the many risks faced by women in the illegal drug trade and called on member states to adopt gender-sensitive drug policies and programmes.487 The UNGASS Outcome Document was a significant step forward on gender issues, by highlighting the importance of promoting gender-sensitive drug policies, and recognising both the particular vulner - abilities and specific needs of women in pri - mary care and treatment programmes, as well as within the criminal justice system. With re - gards to incarceration, operational paragraph 4.n encourages 'the taking into account of the specific needs and possible multiple vulnera - bilities of women drug offenders when impris - oned' , in line with the Bangkok Rules.488 Nationally, since 2009 only a handful of coun - tries have adopted gender sensitive policies to address the high rates of incarceration of wom - en for drug offences. Today, there is an urgent need to ensure proportionate penalties for drug offences, allowing for the consideration of mitigating factors such as socio-economic marginalisation, being the sole care provider of dependents, and drug dependence, and make better use of gender-sensitive alterna - tives to incarceration for minor offenders. 66 Taking stock: A decade of drug policysuspected of engaging in illegal drug activities in South and South East Asia. The UN High Commis- sioner for Human Rights characterised this practice as 'dangerous...and indicative of a total disregard for the rule of law' .492 The compulsory detention of people who use drugs also raises concerns over the lack of due process associated with this practice.493 In less extreme cases, the right to a fair trial and due process is hampered in a number of ways for people accused of drug offences. The OHCHR, for instance, reported country cases where a person is automat - ically presumed guilty of drug trafficking in specific conditions, thereby reversing the burden of proof in criminal proceedings.494 In several countries, trials rely on statements made under coercion during po - lice investigation.495 In other cases, investigations, arrests and house searches are conducted without judicial authorisation and with reports of incommu- nicado detention without charges.496 2.1.7 The rights of indigenous peoples The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), adopted in 2007, reinforces the basic cultural rights embedded in Article 27 the Uni- versal Declaration of Human Rights497 and Article 15 of the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.498 In particular, it estab - lishes that indigenous peoples have the right not to be subjected to forced assimilation or destruction of their culture (Article 8); to practice and revitalise their cultural traditions and customs (Article 11); to be secure in the enjoyment of their own means of subsistence and development and to engage freely in all their traditional and other economic activities (Article 20); and to maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage (Article 31).499 Ac- cording to Julian Burger, former coordinator of the OHCHR Indigenous Peoples and Minorities Unit, this 'gives indigenous peoples the possibility of continu- ing to produce crops and plants that they have tra- ditionally grown for their own religious, medicinal, or customary purposes, and which constitute a part of their cultural practice and identity' .500 2.1.6 The right to a fair trial and due process The right to due process and a fair trial - protected in Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights489 and Articles 14 and 16 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights490 - includes the right to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law; to be presumed innocent until proven guilty; to be tried without delay; to access interpreters, con- sular assistance and legal aid; and to receive prompt and detailed information and legal assistance in a language and format that is accessible. The recognition, in the UNGASS Outcome Doc - ument, of the need to 'Promote and implement effective criminal justice responses to drug-related crimes to bring perpetrators to justice that ensure legal guarantees and due process safeguards...and ensure timely access to legal aid and the right to a fair trial'491 has been a significant step forward in ensuring more human rights protections in demand and supply reduction strategies. This operational recommendation is particularly relevant in light of the recent surge in extrajudicial killings of people 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action Action 6(a): 'Ensure that demand reduction measures respect human rights and the inherent dignity of all individuals and facilitate access for all drug users to prevention services and health- care and social services, with a view to social reintegration' Action 22(c): 'Ensure that supply reduction measures are carried out in full conformity with the purposes and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, the three international drug control conventions and, in particular, with full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States and all human rights and fundamental freedoms' Action 41(c): 'Ensure that measures to control precursors and amphetamine-type stimulants are carried out in full conformity with the purposes and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, the international drug control conventions and, in particular, with full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States and all human rights and fundamental freedoms'2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action Action 22(e): 'Promote supply reduction measures that take due account of traditional licit uses, where there is historical evidence of such use, as well as environmental protection, in conformity with the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988' 67 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policy2.1.8 The right to be free from discrimination The right to be free from discrimination is recognised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,505 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,506 the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,507 as well as the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,508 the Conven- tion on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimina- tion Against Women509 and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.510Perhaps as a result of the inherent contradictions between indigenous rights and the international drug control regime (see Box 13), only a handful of member states have adopted laws and regulations to protect the rights of indigenous groups to grow and use controlled substances. The most emblem- atic example is Bolivia's constitutional protection of the traditional use of the coca leaf. Other examples include the protection of coca use among indige - nous communities in Colombia, Peru and Argenti- na;501 the 2015 legislation in Jamaica allowing the religious use of cannabis among the Rastafari;502 ayahuasca use for traditional and religious purposes in Brazil, Peru, Colombia and Canada (in the latter, limited to the Ceu do Montreal religious group); the ancestral use of peyote among Native Americans in the USA; and the traditional use of khat in Ethiopia, Somalia and Yemen.503 The 1989 Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention (No. 169) also enshrines indigenous peoples' right to free prior and informed consent in all matters that affect them.504 In practice, drug control strate - gies in indigenous peoples' lands have largely been designed and implemented without consultations with local communities, and have mostly consisted in forced crop eradication campaigns, as will be fur - ther discussed below .

Data suggests that wom- en who use drugs are particularly vulnerable to stig- ma and discrimination as they are seen as breaking with the traditional image of the woman as a care giver.516 An additional layer of discrimination exists for people of colour. In the UK, for instance, it is esti- mated that black people are nine times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people, Box 13 Addressing the tensions between the rights of indigenous groups and UN drug control obligations There is an undeniable conflict between the obligations imposed by the UN drug con - trol system and indigenous rights - which is reflected in action 22(e). When the UN drug control regime was established, the rights of indigenous peoples had not yet acquired the international legal recognition that they have today. Indigenous peoples had no say at all in the negotiation of the drug treaties, while today consultation and consent are accepted principles for all matters of law and policy that impact indigenous peoples. The Single Convention allowed 'transitional reservations' for the traditional uses of opium, coca leaf and cannabis (Article 49), but by De - cember 1989 the chewing of coca leaf, the use of cannabis in religious ceremonies, and all other non-medical indigenous practices in - volving these plants were to be abolished. The 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances addresses another range of substances and departs slightly from the zero-tolerance regime imposed for 'narcotic drugs' by leaving legal space for the use of 'psychotropic substances' in religious ceremonies, specifically for the pe - yote cactus, hallucinogenic mushrooms and ayahuasca (Article 32.4). More importantly, plants containing psychotropic substances were not brought under international control; only the extracted alkaloids are included in the 1971 Schedules. Subsequent diplomatic efforts led to the inclu - sion of Article 14.2 in the 1988 Convention stat - ing that measures to eradicate the cultivation of coca, opium poppy and cannabis 'shall respect fundamental human rights and shall take due account of traditional licit uses, where there is historic evidence of such use' . However, the same article specifies that any measures under the 1988 Convention 'shall not be less stringent than the provisions applicable to the eradica - tion of illicit cultivation of plants containing narcotic and psychotropic substances' under the 1961 and 1971 treaties (an obligation fur - ther reinforced by Article 25). Therefore, while the insertion of the first and only mention of human rights across the three drug conventions was politically significant, its legal standing remains contentious. Although the 2009 Political Declaration was adopted only two years after the adoption of the UNDRIP , it made no mention of it and kept with the contradictions enshrined in the 1988 Convention. At the same time the Political Dec - laration was being adopted, the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues ruled that certain provisions of the 1961 Convention were 'incon - sistent with the rights of indigenous peoples to maintain their traditional health and cultural practices' and recommended that those treaty articles 'be amended and/or repealed' . In 2016, whilst referring briefly to UNDRIP , the UNGASS Outcome Document once again failed to ad - dress the contradictions between indigenous rights and international drug control obliga - tions. In his UNGASS statement, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, stated that the language regarding in - digenous rights in the 2016 document was 'am - biguous' , concluding that 'it would have been better if it were clearly indicated that indige - nous peoples should be allowed to use drugs in their traditional, cultural or religious practices when there is historical basis for this' .

In 2018, the CND adopted its first ever resolution on the need to address the stigma associated with drug use: Resolution 61/11 'Promot - ing non-stigmatizing attitudes to ensure the avail- ability of, access to and delivery of health, care and social services for drug users' .519 Although limited to a small number of countries, several interventions have recently been developed with a focus on reducing stigma and improving ac - cess to healthcare. The 'Stop the Stigma' campaign, launched by Citywide Drug Crisis in Ireland, uses information sharing to break down stigma and promote respect and dignity for people who use drugs, support community programmes, under - stand the complexity of dependence and end the criminalisation of people who use drugs.520 Simi- larly, the Vancouver Canucks hockey team and the provincial Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions launched the 'Stop overdose' campaign in 2018 in the Province of British Columbia, Canada. As part of this programme, US$ 322 million are being invested over three years to reduce stigma, show the human face of people who use drugs and provide a health and social response to drug use.52170 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Assessing progress onPeace and security Crypto-drug markets only 17% of the Global Drug Survey respondents said they would stop using CDMs following closures9% (50% said closures had no eect on their usage paerns) of crypto-drug markets close down due to law enforcement intervenonEradicaon and social conflictWar on drugs and violence 150,000Mexico'swar on drugs Launched in 2006, deaths has resulted in over 32,000 disappearances Forced internal displacement115% increase in coca culvaon (2009-2016) Forced eradicaon of coca crops in ColombiaSocialconflictCredit: Juan Fernandez Ochoa, IDPCStrategies aiming to dismantle major trafficking hubs and routes, cultivation areas or eradicate a certain substance have generally resulted in market chang- es, rather than an overall reduction in illegal drug activities globally. The phenomena of 'geographical' and 'substance' displacement resulting from drug control operations had already been identified in the 2008 World Drug Report, and data collected by the UNODC between 2009 and 2018 have confirmed this trend. For instance, crackdowns on opium have led to reductions in cultivation in South East Asia, but opium cultivation has surged in Afghanistan which is now producing 86% of the world's opium (see Box 14).522 Opium cultivation also went up in Mexico, which is the main supplier for the growing US heroin market.523 Meanwhile, people who use drugs in East and South East Asia have been drawn towards phar - maceutical opioids and ATS which are often more available than heroin.524 Similarly, in the Andean region, while Bolivia has seen a consistent reduction in coca cultivation since 2009, production has largely increased in Colombia since 2014 - and overall, the global area cultivated has increased by 30% between 2009 and 2016 (see Figure 9). Drug control operations to shut down re - tail markets for substances like cocaine, ecstasy, her - oin and cannabis in Europe and North America have also led to hundreds of synthetic NPS flooding onto the market - with increasing levels of overall drug use525 and, in some cases, elevated levels of drug-re - lated harm compared to more traditional drugs. Instead of redressing this situation, policing and militarised drug control campaigns have generally 2.2 Promoting peace and security Following the devastation of the Second World War, one of the core goals of the UN in 1945 was to main- tain international peace and security. The UN and its member states aimed to achieve this objective by working to prevent conflict, helping parties in conflict to make peace, peacekeeping, and creating the conditions to allow peace to hold and flourish. This section will assess how drug control in the past decade has contributed to promoting and consoli- dating peace and security worldwide. 2.2.1 The 'balloon effect' and escalating levels of violence 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action Action 22(c): 'Ensure that supply reduction measures are carried out in full conformity with the purposes and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law, the three international drug control conventions and, in particular, with full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States and all human rights and fundamental freedoms' Action 24(g): 'Implement strategies to disrupt and dismantle major organizations involved in trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and to address emerging trends' 71 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policyBox 14 Unprecedented levels of opium cultivation in Afghanistan When the Political Declaration and its Plan of Action were devised in 2009, Afghan poppy cul - tivation stood at 123,000 hectares and potential opium production at 6,900 tons.526 According to the latest annual report produced by the UNODC and the Afghan Ministry of Counter Narcotics, the opium industry reached unprecedented lev - els in 2017, with an area of 328,000 hectares un - der cultivation and potential opium production up to 9,000 tons (see Figure 8).527 Cultivation of poppy increased by 63% since 2016 and passed the previous highest level (in 2014) by 46%, or 104,000 hectares. Potential production of opium increased by 87% between 2016 and 2017. This is despite sustained and intensive intervention on the part of the international community - in - cluding regular CND resolutions on the issue528 - and the Afghan government to curb opium cultivation over the past decade. The failure to curb illegal opium cultivation in Afghanistan can be explained by a number of reasons. First and perhaps most importantly, the rise in illegal cultivation reflects the progres - sive erosion of the Afghan government control, influence and presence in recent years, and the continued and the progressive deteriora - tion in security and political uncertainty in the aftermath of the 2014 presidential election.529 Secondly, the global demand for drugs derived from opium has continued to drive production in the country, especially with the decline in opium poppy cultivation in the Golden Trian - gle region (Thailand, Myanmar and Lao PDR). Thirdly, drug control efforts in the country have mainly consisted of alternative development programmes focused on crop eradication and the replacement of opium poppy with other licit crops (e.g. wheat) - but with limited success as the country's climate makes it well suited for poppy cultivation relative to other crops. In the absence of more lucrative alternatives, and with the reduction in international aid for broader so - cio-economic development in rural areas, opium production remains at the heart of the Afghan economy with thousands of families relying on it to survive.530 In its 2018 World Drug Report, the UNODC concluded that the large-scale production of opiates was likely to 'fuel further instability and insurgency and increase funding to terrorist groups in Afghanistan' , and to further 'constrain the development of the licit economy and potentially fuel corruption' .531 However, the UNODC pointed out elsewhere that the opium economy also stimulated the wider, licit rural economy as 'Afghan farmers purchase food, have medical expenses, and purchase daily needs products. These expenses - paid from opium money - benefited local bakers, butchers and other small-scale businesses in rural Afghani - stan' .532 Tackling the illegal cultivation of opium in the country therefore necessitates a thorough understanding of these complex development and peacekeeping dynamics.

Recognising the severe consequences of this approach, prominent academic institutions, NGOs, UN agencies and various nation- al-level policy makers have engaged in strategic dis- cussions on how to modernise drug law enforcement. Illegal drug markets are not inherently violent, and although drug control may not be able to curb the scale of the illegal drug trade, it might help shape the market in a way that minimises the harms caused to affected communities and society as a whole.541 2.2.2 The rise of crypto-drug marketsundermined peace and security. The emergence of new trafficking routes in developing or fragile states where governance is weak has contributed to dest - abilising affected countries, undermining the rule of law and facilitating high-level corruption. This has been observed in several West African coun- tries, with Mali, Niger, Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau now recognised as major trafficking hubs, where the collusion between high-level officials and drug traffickers constitutes a major threat to security, governance and development.534 In South East Asia, punitive drug control policies aiming at curbing the expanding market for ATS have translated into an escalation in violence and human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings. On the other side of the world, Mexico launched a militarised war on drugs in 2006, which has caused over 150,000 drug trade-related deaths535 and more than 32,000 disappearances.536 Between 2011 and 2015, 282,300 people were internally displaced as a consequence of violence,537 and 12,120 drug-related kidnappings Credit: Marie Nougier, IDPC Figure 9.

In the past four decades, Colombia has implemented forced eradication strategies to combat illegal drug supply, including aerial spraying, manual eradication, criminalisation of growers, destruc - tion of processing 'laboratories' and interdiction. This strategy has had serious financial, environ - mental, social and human rights implications,543 among them the internal displacement of mil - lions of people as a result of the conflict with the FARC and violent clashes with the military in coca cultivation areas.544 In 2012, the Colombian government and the FARC began peace talks, with an agenda item on 'Solution to the illicit drug problem' . Chapter 4 of the 2016 Peace Agreement, dedicated to drug issues, paved the way to a new approach towards illegal drug production, with due regard to rural development (chapter 1). Under the Na - tional Comprehensive Substitution Programme, farmers involved in illegal crop cultivation are encouraged to sign agreements with the state to voluntarily eradicate coca crops. In exchange, they receive a state subsidy, and the govern - ment committed to improving land ownership, access to public goods, markets and infrastruc - ture and access to credit.545 124,000 families across Colombia have expressed willingness to benefit from the Programme - representing approximately 100,000 hectares of coca. Indi - vidual agreements were signed with 77,000 families. The UNODC supports this initiative by monitoring compliance with the required 'vol - untary' self-eradication.546 As of July 2018, the UNODC confirmed the self-eradication of 18,000 hectares, with another 10,000 hectares still under verification. The pilot for this 'voluntary substitution' pro - gramme started in Brice\u00f1o, Antioquia where, in an effort to generate trust, the government and the FARC committed to work with the farming community of 11 villages in the municipality to foster economic change and reduce their dependence on coca. Although the peace agreement itself included references to co - ca-growing communities' right to participate in decision-making processes in order to facilitate the voluntary and peaceful destruction of coca plants, those communities were in fact given no space at all to negotiate the terms of the contracts and were forced to sign up under the threat of forced eradication.547 The joint substitution effort is also faced with several challenges, not least the serious setback created by the referendum vote against the orig - inal Peace Agreement in October 2016, the fact that the government and the FARC only released implementation protocols in February 2017, and the overall lack of coordination between state institutions. In addition, bureaucratic process - es created delays in payments to participating families, while agricultural technical assistance, access to land and lack of basic infrastructure are lagging behind.548 In parallel, the bill pro - viding differential criminal treatment for coca farmers has not yet been passed, making them vulnerable to arrest and incarceration. Moreover, although financial subsidies are offered to fam - ilies in exchange for voluntary eradication, the programme lacks a comprehensive, long-term development strategy that is able to deliver alternative crop cultivation and income gener - ation. Cases of violence also continue to be reported in affected areas - with the UN estimating that 106 community leaders were killed in 2017 alone.549 Finally, Colombia is facing growing in - ternational pressure due to the recent surge in coca cultivation, making the country the world leader in coca cultivation. The recent election of President Duque, who openly pronounced him - self in favour of forced crop eradication, presents yet another key challenge for the years ahead.550 It is equally worrying that, in its 2017 'Colombia coca cultivation survey' , the UNODC seems to encourage this approach, recommending that 'Forced eradication should be implemented on coca lots where growers did not sign agree - ments to achieve continuous, coca-free territo - ries' .551 These many issues highlight the urgency of guaranteeing more security, human rights protection and sustainable development in the implementation of the Peace Process.74 Taking stock: A decade of drug policyReport 2014,556 the UNODC has consistently - and with an increasing sense of alarm - described the issue as 'growing' ,557 and recognised the need for more research, money, and innovative thinking.558 In practical terms, although the usage of these markets remains dominated by the Global North,559 their international reach has extended in recent years with the appearance of Chinese vendors of NPS, precursors, fentanyl and fentanyl analogues. As such, crypto-drug markets are growing in several areas - in relation to traditional markets, in political significance, and in global reach. In 2017, UNODC's Executive Director also conceded that drugs bought and sold online frequently utilise postal services for distribution,560 highlighting the lack of progress made by the international community towards the 2009 goal of curbing postal trafficking. Many state-level law enforcement and criminal justice systems remain ill-equipped to deal with the issue of crypto-drug markets.561 Although there has been some international law enforce - ment cooperation on the issue - most notably be - tween US federal agencies, Europol, and state-level Box 16 Crypto-drug market operations Crypto-drug markets have been in operation since 2010, but have gained importance with the Silk Road website in February 2011. Dark net markets usually remain active for just a few months up to a few years, and so the landscape changes rapidly, making it all the more difficult for drug law enforcement to target these online markets. Most closures, however, do not result from law enforcement action (only 17% of cryp - to-drug market closures), but are generally the result of 'exit scams' (where operators suddenly close down the site and steal the money), vol- untary exits and hacking by third parties552 (see Figure 10). Since 2009, the use of the internet to facilitate transnational illegal drug transactions has become a phenomenon of growing significance. In the past decade responses to crypto-drug markets have been undertaken either unilaterally or through pre-existing strategic and security cooperation al- liances, often on an ad-hoc basis, and in a vacuum left by the absence of clear international policy. Ac - cording to the UNODC, 42% of member states have a system in place to monitor the sale of illegal drugs over the internet - with no increase since 2009.554 Policy making in the area has been constrained by an inadequate technological understanding of the phenomenon, and without the required common legal frameworks necessary to adequately address the trans-jurisdictional nature of the issue. A 2016 study555 noted that crypto-drug markets continue to account for a relatively small percentage of drug sales globally, with all internet-facilitated transactions totalling around 1% of the total mar - ket, but that percentage represented an increase of 50% in the period 2013-2015. Since the first men- tion of dark net markets in the UNODC's World Drug Figure 10. Causes of closure of crypto-drug markets553 75 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policyenforcement - cooperation has occurred despite muddled international policy direction. States taking action have done so in response to press- ing and immediate domestic law enforcement or public health challenges, rather than as part of any coherent policy landscape.562 Other states - such as the UK and Germany - have also taken action in response to requests for security cooperation from long-standing allies. More recently, individual mem- ber states have worked within pre-existing alliances to coordinate several high-profile market interven- tions. In general, US agencies continue to lead on the issue, as they have since the closure of the origi- nal Silk Road website in October 2013. Of European states, the Netherlands has been notably proactive in the area, playing a key role alongside Europol in Operation Bayonet in 2017.563 In the absence of cohesive national and internation- al policy in the area, law enforcement agencies have continued the approach of shutting down markets, apprehending administrators, and seizing server assets in strategies reminiscent of the traditional offline drug law enforcement operations. So-called 'takedown' operations seek to exploit either of two key structural weaknesses: the markets' centralised authority (by apprehending the human administra- tors of the sites), and/or the physically-centralised servers themselves. In each case, the takedowns result in the market sites going offline, but the sub - sequent effect on vendors and buyers is less clear. Recent research suggests that takedown strategies may play a significant role in provoking technolog- ical innovation,564 and the UNODC acknowledges that more research is required to better understand the effects of 'hard'565 interventions.566 Indeed, it is not yet clear whether closure under - mines trust in - or the will to use - crypto-drug markets among people who use drugs. In 2018, only 15% of respondents to the Global Drug Survey said they felt closures discouraged their use of on- line markets, and only 9% had stopped altogether, with more than 50% reporting that takedown had no effect on their usage patterns.567 Further, there is evidence of market migration, fragmentation, and online 'turf wars' similar to patterns observed in tra- ditional markets, as surviving markets vie for market share following takedowns. This has led Europol to conclude that 'law enforcement interventions in the form of darknet market take-downs disrupt darknet markets, although the overall ecosystem appears to be fairly resilient with new markets quickly becom- ing established' , and vendors and customers migrat - ing to the latest trading platform to continue their operations.568 Acknowledging this phenomenon, Operation Bayonet represented a somewhat evolved approach, with Europol and the US Department of Justice working together to quietly seize and op - erate AlphaBay as an intelligence 'honeypot' ,569 in advance of taking down Hansa Market. Despite the new approach, there is evidence that crypto-drug markets are already evolving toward decentralised and distributed models.570 Nevertheless, there is also evidence demonstrating the potential of such online platforms to reduce health harms for people who use drugs. Available research has shown that anonymised user forums and online chat rooms facilitate peer-based reviews and feedback about the quality of drug purchases, reliability of sellers, the purity and effects of certain products, representing a novel form of peer-based harm reduction, as well as 'an entry point for drug support services' .571 Today, crypto-drug markets continue to operate as an efficient and growing means to transact canna- bis, cocaine, and prescription opioids.572 They also facilitate the 'marketing and distribution of, and trafficking in, psychotropic substances, including synthetic drugs'573 as well as precursors. Further - more, crypto-currencies provide a means to launder money associated with the drug trade (see Section 2.2.4 below). In short, the continued proliferation of crypto-drug markets speaks directly to many of the goals of the 2009 Political Declaration, and shows lack of progress for each. 2.2.3 Tackling money-laundering International provisions against money-launder - ing were first included in the 1988 United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances as a strategy against drug trafficking by criminal organisations. The im- plementation of concrete measures was entrusted 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action Action 51(a): 'Establishing new or strengthening existing domestic legislative frameworks to criminalize the laundering of money derived from drug trafficking, precursor diversion and other serious crimes of a transnational nature in order to provide for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of money laundering' Action 51(d): 'Promoting effective cooperation in strategies for countering money-laundering and in money-laundering cases'76 Taking stock: A decade of drug policyby the G7 to the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in 1989, which became the global an- ti-money-laundering standard-setter.575 A number of regional task forces modelled on the FATF were established in the 1990s and the 2000s - such as the Asia/Pacific Group on Money-laundering,576 the Financial Action Task Force for Latin America,577 the Inter-Governmental Action Group Against Money Laundering in West Africa,578 among others. Since 2009, several instruments have been adopted to consolidate the work of the FATF. These include the adoption, in 2012, of the 'International standards on combating money-laundering and the financing of terrorism & proliferation - the FATF recommen- dations' , which aim to strengthen international safeguards and protect the integrity of financial systems by providing governments with stronger tools to take action against financial crime.579 A year later, member states adopted the 'Methodology for Assessing Compliance with the FAFT Recommenda- tions and the Effectiveness of [Anti-Money-launder - ing/Countering the Financing of Terrorism] Systems' , to help determine whether a country is sufficiently compliant with the 2012 standards, and whether their systems work effectively - with rounds of eval- uation taking place regularly.580 The UNODC has its own programmes to tackle money-laundering, in particular the 'Global pro -gramme against money-laundering, proceeds of crime and the financing of terrorism' which encourages member states to develop policies to counter money-laundering and the financing of terrorism, monitors and analyses related prob - lems, raises awareness and coordinates initiatives carried out by the UN and other international organisations.581 Through this programme, the UNODC has cooperated with a range of interna- tional and regional organisations, including with the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Interpol and others.582 In April 2009, just a month after the adoption of the 2009 Political Declaration, the UNODC published its 'Model pro - visions on money-laundering, terrorist financing, preventive measures and proceeds of crime' ,583 which are meant to be a 'starting point for State authorities as they evaluate the measures that should be incorporated into domestic law in or - der to prevent, detect, and effectively sanction money-laundering, the financing of terrorism and the proceeds of crime' .584 The World Bank also provides technical assistance to member states in developing effective laws, regulations and institutional framework, assessing the im- pact of money-laundering, training the financial sector supervisors, investigators, prosecutors, judges, designing effective asset disclosure Figure 11.

Evaluation of anti-money-laundering efforts by the UNODC have mainly focused on 'process' or 'activity' indicators. The data available through ARQ responses show that despite these global efforts, little progress has been recorded at national level in the past decade. In 2018, the UNODC reported a slight increase, from 37% in 2010 to 40% in 2016, in the percentage of states having legislation pro - viding for the conclusion of bilateral or multilateral asset-sharing agreements. However, it recorded a slight fall between 2010 and 2016 in the percentage of states having measures in place to manage seized assets, for banks and other financial institutions to identify customers and verify their information to trace proceeds of crime, and to detect and monitor the cross-border transport of cash. There was also a slight decrease in the proportion of states in which it is mandatory to report suspicious transactions.585 Despite the recorded slight fall, all these percentag- es remain relatively high, at around 70% of report - ing states - although it should be noted that only about 10% or less of member states in Sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania and the Caribbean provided consist - ent data on this issue (see Box 1 ). When one looks into the impacts that these process- es have yielded on the scale of money-laundering, the results have been minimal. Despite an expan- sion in global tools and collaboration at regional and international level to tackle money-laundering, the illegal drug trade remains the second largest source of income of transnational organised crime groups,586 who continue to launder money with im- punity. Indeed, as discussed above , UNODC research concluded that less than 1% of the total amounts laundered were seized.587 In 2016, Europol's Asset Recovery Unit frankly admitted that in Europe from 2010 to 2014, only 2.2% of the estimated proceeds of crime were provisionally seized or frozen, and ul- timately just 1.1% of the criminal profits were finally confiscated at EU level.588 A 1.1% interception rate means that '98.9 percent of estimated criminal prof- its are not confiscated and remain at the disposal of criminals' ,589 that is, in addition to the accumulated criminal wealth from previous years. The 2013 HSBC money-laundering scandal590 and the Panama Pa- pers in 2016591 are merely two examples of the scale of the issue. Figure 11 highlights the interdiction rates and criminal proceeds retained by criminal enterprises in high-income countries. Tackling money-launder - ing in lower-income countries, with fewer resourc - es, may prove to be even more challenging. New technologies present additional challenges to the current anti-money-laundering framework, with growing volumes of transactions and large data sets requiring computational analysis to reveal patterns, trends and associations. The growing demand for online services and related internet payment sys- tems also pose challenges with borderless virtual environments requiring an adaptation of current strategies.592 In its 2018 World Drug Report, the UNODC concluded that drug-related money-laun- dering affected the economy in a number of ways, including by inflating property prices, distorting ex - port figures, as well as by exacerbating unfair com- petition, the gap in wealth distribution and corrup - tion, while negatively affecting foreign investment in developing countries.593 This is not to say that the anti-money-laundering regime has entirely failed. Since 2000, most coun- tries have adopted more legislation to tackle mon- ey-laundering and extended the scope of their surveillance activities. There have also been more convictions for money-laundering, and countries are better equipped to cooperate against serious crimes and to seize proceeds. However, a thorough cost-benefit analysis remains to be undertaken on anti-money-laundering efforts, both globally and nationally.594 Furthermore, the anti-money-laun- dering regime may also generate harms - efforts to control money-laundering may lead banks to cut down overseas remittances to 'the most vulnerable populations in the poorest countries' .595 The failure to control illegal money flows also extends to the failure to counter tax evasion, tax avoidance and trade mispricing, which is eroding the tax base for development. Finally, it is worth nothing that the anti-money-laundering regime - which requires tighter government controls over the banking sec - tor - was developed at a time when the world was in a process of complete deregulation of financial markets. It is unlikely that any significant improve - ment in tackling money-laundering will material- ise until there is political will to better control the financial sector.596 78 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy2.3 Advancing development The third key priority of the UN, as established in its founding Charter, was to 'achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character' ,597 and improving people's well-being worldwide through a comprehensive development approach that 'promotes prosperity and economic opportunity, greater social well-being, and protec - tion of the environment' .598 This approach was first reflected in the Millennium Development Goals (2000-2015),599 and has since then been consolidat - ed in the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.600 2.3.1 Analysing factors leading to illegal cultivation There are many factors leading to the cultivation of crops; primary among them is insecrity, armed conflict, poverty, marginalisation and lack of op - portunities in the licit market. Another is cultivation for personal recreational use, and yet another is traditional usage. While cultivation for recreational and traditional use have so far not been adequately discussed at global level, progress has been made in identifying the developmental factors linked to illegal crop cultivation. For instance, the UNGASS Outcome Document requests member states to address the factors related to illegal crop cultivation 'by implementing comprehensive strategies aimed at alleviating poverty...and by promoting sustaina- ble development aimed at enhancing the welfare of the affected and vulnerable population through licit alternatives' .601 The UNODC, which had traditionally mostly focused on assessing the impact of alterna- tive development programmes through reductions in hectares of crops cultivated, is also taking steps to broaden its traditional 'Crop Monitoring' surveys to include socio-economic issues. An example of this new approach is the 2016 Afghanistan opium survey, in which the UNODC documented the links between illegal crop cultivation and various SDGs602 (see Figure 12). In its contribution to the 2016 UNGASS, the United Nations Development Programme was also instru- mental in documenting and analysing the links between poverty and engagement in the illegal drug trade, in particular,603 and is now engaged in a very important exercise being carried out with the University of Essex to elaborate International Human 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action Action 43(b): 'Conduct research to assess the factors leading to the illicit cultivation of drug crops used for the production of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances' Assessing progress on Development Alternave development Regulang coca produconSequencing Proper sequencing tends to be ignored and alternave development is oen subordinated to crop eradicaon The importance ofAdequate sequencing requires that no eradicaon occurs before there are suciently developed alternave sources of income.

Similarly, several NGOs have conducted valuable research to better understand the factors leading to illegal crop cultivation and engagement in other aspects of the illegal drug trade.605 At national level, in 2018 the UNODC reported that only 'some member states' had conducted studies evaluating the impact of their alternative development programmes, while 'others' (not quantified) used human development indicators to review impact.606 Although limited, this is a recognition of the need to address the developmental factors pushing many vulnerable people to engage in illegal drug activities. Furthermore, since 2009, several new initiatives have led to the production of detailed research607 and tools608 and have facilitated constructive dialogue among the UN, member states, civil society and academia, to better understand the development factors contributing to engagement in illegal cultivation and trafficking. This includes the 'Global Partnership on Drug Policies and Development' (GPDPD) programme led by the German development agency GIZ,609 and the Cooperation Programme between Latin America, the Caribbean and the European Union on Drug Policies (COPOLAD) project.610 At the same time, the need to evaluate alternative development projects by utilising human development indicators has been an issue of debate in UN expert meetings on alternative development for nearly two decades, yet remains the exception rather than the rule.

However, instead of prior - itising forced crop eradication, the government decided to undertake major long-term develop - ment efforts to address the underlying causes of involvement in opium cultivation. The strategy focused on providing agricultural alternatives, improving access to healthcare and education and developing basic infrastructure such as roads, electricity and clean water supplies. The alternative livelihoods programme was incorpo - rated in the broader local and national develop - ment strategy and consisted in a bottom-up ap - proach, driven by community engagement and strong partnerships with community leaders. The programme was also adequately sequenced, ensuring that opium poppy fields would not be eradicated until basic services and alternative livelihoods were in place.611 A 2018 study by the Mae Fah Luang Foundation found that this approach had contributed to re - ducing poverty levels among subsistence farm -ers who were able to turn to alternative sources of income before opium poppy was eradicated, increasing household incomes and facilitating the development of small-scale businesses. The regions in which the programme was imple - mented now benefit from more diverse econom - ic activities, including the cultivation of crops like tea, Inca peanut and bamboo, and increased tourism thanks to improved infrastructure. Ac - cess to healthcare (including drug dependence treatment), education, electricity and clean water was also improved, and environment pro - tection became an essential component of the approach through sustainable land distribution, reforesting initiatives and environmental ed - ucation incorporated in school curriculums.612 However, it is also important to point out that poppy cultivation migrated to other countries, mainly to neighbouring Myanmar, and that the Thai drug market shifted from opium/heroin to methamphetamines being the primary drug of concern.

Since 2009, most countries affected by illegal crop cultivation have adopted some form of alternative development programme, generally alongside eradication campaigns. These include Afghanistan, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Morocco, Myanmar, Peru, the Philippines and Thailand.613 However, few have embedded these programmes in a comprehensive, long-term sustainable development strategy. In this regard, 'proper and coordinated sequencing of development interventions' is perhaps one of the most problematic issues related to alternative development. Proper sequencing means that no eradication should take place until there are suffi- ciently developed alternatives in place to ensure subsistence farmers' survival.614 In theory, most al- ternative development programmes implemented since 2009 have included the concept of adequate sequencing. However, in practice only Bolivia and Thailand seem to have respected this core compo - nent of an effective sustainable development ap - proach. Others have merely implemented alterna- tive development programmes as a complementary aspect of, or to justify, crop eradication, rather than as the primary means of creating the conditions that would improve people's livelihoods and reduce their dependence on illegal crop cultivation.615 The cases of Colombia (see Box 12) and Peru are particularly illustrative of these concerns. In Thailand, efforts were made to implement a long-term development strategy for about 15 years before opium poppy started being eradicated, in close consultation with the local communities (see Box 17). In Bolivia, the government's approach has focused on ensuring that farmers could grow a sufficient amount of coca for subsistence purposes, facilitating access to a national legal market for coca products, improving access to safe water, education and promoting addi- tional sources of income.616 With regards to drug trafficking, it was only recently that the UN started recognising the complex vul- nerabilities of those engaging in drug trafficking, with most debates revolving around women. The conversation made a significant step forward at the UNGASS, and with the adoption of Resolution 59/5 'Mainstreaming a gender perspective in drug-relat - ed policies and programmes' which 'Urges Member States to implement broad-based programmes aimed at preventing women and girls from be - ing used as couriers for trafficking in drugs' .617 The UNGASS Outcome Document also includes various 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action Action 45(c): 'Establish, where possible, sustainable alternative development programmes, in particular in drug-producing regions, including those with high levels of poverty, as they are more vulnerable to exploitation by traffickers and more likely to be affected by the illicit cultivation of drug crops and the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances' Action 45(d): 'Consider, where appropriate, including in their national development strategies, integrated and sustainable alternative development programmes, recognizing that poverty and vulnerability are some of the factors behind illicit drug crop cultivation and that poverty eradication is a principal objective of the Millennium Development Goals; and request development organizations and international financial institutions to ensure that alternative development strategies, including, when appropriate, preventive alternative development programmes, are incorporated into poverty reduction strategy papers and country assistance strategies for States affected by the illicit cultivation of crops used for the production of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances' Action 47(f): 'Ensure the proper and coordinated sequencing of development interventions when designing alternative development programmes; and, in this connection, the issues of the establishment of agreements and viable partnerships with small producers, favourable climatic conditions, strong political support and adequate market access should be taken into account'Proper sequencing tends to be ignored and alternave development is oen subordinated to crop eradicaonAdequate sequencing requires that no eradicaon occurs before there are suciently developed alternave sources of income.

Two in ten prisoners are currently in prison for drug offences - reaching a ratio of six in ten among female prisoners. The most common offences for which people are incarcerated include smuggling drugs in prisons, micro-trafficking, drug transportation and small-scale selling (drug possession for personal use is not criminalised in Costa Rica). Women incarcerated for drug offences are usually first time non-violent offenders, single mothers of several children, with limited formal education or employment possibilities. Their mass incarceration has had a devastating impact on women and their families and has led to serious prison overcrowding and poor prison conditions. In an effort to decongest the criminal justice sys - tem and guarantee basic rights for prisoners, the Costa Rican government has carried out a series of legislative and political reforms. Starting in 2013, Law 9161 (known as '77bis') was approved and reduced the prison sentence for women accused of smuggling drugs in prison (a reduction from 8-20 years to 3-8 years), guarantee - ing more proportionality and a gender perspective in Costa Rica's drug legislation. The law opened up the possibility of alternatives to incarceration for women in situations of vulnerability accused of this specific drug offence.618 The approval of the law directly benefited a quarter of women incarcerated for drug offences with the immedi - ate release of more than 120 women.619 The mass release of women from prison led to the creation of an inter-institutional network for the social re - integration of women in conflict with the law. This network includes eight public institutions working in the areas of health, gender, family, employment, the judiciary, prisons and drug control. The active coordination of the Ministry of Women for the provision of a wide range of services and direct support to formerly incarcerated women has been instrumental to the network's success.620 The most recent reform was the approval of Law 9361 in early 2017, which reduces the time for which a criminal record is kept, according to the offence committed and the penalty imposed. This was in recognition of the difficulty faced by formerly incarcerated individuals to find employ - ment after their release, increasing their vulnera - bility to poverty and re-engagement in criminal activities. The law also allows the immediate elim - ination of the criminal record for people found in situation of vulnerability. Before the reform, criminal records were kept in the judicial registrar for 10 years, without distinction between serious or minor crimes.621 Interestingly, this reform initi - ative was initially going to target those who had committed drug offences and was then expanded to cover more offences. It has nonetheless had a major impact for drug offenders. The Costa Rican experience is therefore an excellent example of how to address the situation of poverty, margin - alisation and exclusion faced by people engaged in criminal activities for subsistence purposes.

In 2012, the UK revised its sentencing guidelines to take into account the role of women in the overall drug trafficking chain during trial, with the recognition of various situations of vulnerability as mitigating factors - although the failure to review drug legisla- tions has meant that these new guidelines only had a limited impact.623 In 2014, Ecuador adopted a new criminal code to ensure more proportionate sen- tencing for drug offenders, in particular micro-traf- fickers, in recognition that those at the lowest level in the drug trafficking chain were generally involved in drug activities because of socio-economic issues. However, the legislation was revised in 2015 which severely limited the positive impacts of the new policy on reducing prison overcrowding.624 Costa Rica is by far the country which has made most pro - gress on this issue (see Box 18).Box 19 CND resolutions on alternative development adopted between 2009 and 2018 Resolution 61/6.

The 2015 World Drug Report included a dedicated section on alter - native development, concluding that: 'Despite the amount of attention given to alternative develop - ment at the international level, there is a disconnect between international rhetoric and funding' .626 De- spite the level of visibility given to alternative devel- opment in the CND (see Box 19) and the UN General Assembly,627 the report continues, 'the funding for it has decreased considerably in the last few years' . In fact, 'overall gross disbursements of alternative development funds from OECD countries have de - clined by 71 per cent since the adoption of the Polit - ical Declaration and Plan of Action on International Cooperation towards an Integrated and Balanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem' .628 As noted above, GPDPD and COPOLAD have taken the lead in facilitating country visits in areas bene - fiting from alternative development programmes, providing technical support, providing guidance for assessing the impacts of different alternative devel- opment strategies on broader human development indicators and aligning alternative development efforts with the SDGs. 2.3.4 Ensuring collaboration with local communities in illegal crop cultivation areas 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action Action 45(f): 'Ensure that the design and implementation of alternative development programmes, including, when appropriate, a preventive approach, involve all stakeholders, take into account the specific characteristics of the target area and incorporate grass- roots communities in project formulation, implementation and monitoring' Action 47(b): 'Develop alternative development programmes and eradication measures while fully respecting relevant international instruments, including human rights instruments, and, when designing alternative development interventions, taking into consideration the cultural and social traditions of participating communities' Action 47(d): 'Ensure that the implementation of alternative development and preventive alternative development, as appropriate, enhances synergy and trust among the national Government, local administrations and communities in building local ownership'The need to involve affected communities in the design, implementation and monitoring of alter - native development programmes is recognised in three actions. Community involvement in these programmes is critical to ensure that they are real- istic and adapted to the local terrain, market access and know-how of affected communities. This key principle was recognised in the UN General As- sembly Resolution 68/196 'United Nations guiding principles on alternative development' and in the UNGASS Outcome Document.629 In its 2018 report on UNGASS implementation, the OHCHR also rec - ognised that 'In terms of the design of alternative development programmes, the participation of those affected, including women, minorities and indigenous peoples, should be essential' .630 On the ground, however, and with some notable exceptions, meaningful community participation in alternative development programmes is sorely lacking. For example, while the Colombian Peace Agreement recognises that poverty and conflict are at the root of coca cultivation in that country and calls for significant community involvement in rural development efforts,631 in reality community par - ticipation was very limited. Despite being called to participate in many meetings, they were not given a significant role in negotiating the terms of crop sub - stitution contracts, were forced to sign up for 'vol- untary' coca eradication under the threat of forced eradication and had little opportunity for meaning- ful input into development plans, which lag way behind in implementation (see Box 15). Thailand and Bolivia seem to have yielded better results. In Bolivia, a social control system enables farmers to cultivate a certain amount of crops, while the com- munity is responsible for ensuring that households do not produce more than the quantity authorised (see Box 18).632 In Thailand, the government's long- term development strategy in opium cultivation areas has promoted a bottom-up approach aiming to identify the needs and problems of affected com- munities, building partnerships with local commu- nities and community leaders, and incorporating local know-how in all aspects of the programme (see Box 17).633 Community Assembly on crop substitution in San Jos\u00e9 del Guaviare, 2017Credit: OCCDI Global 85 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policyBox 20 Bolivia's community coca control Andean indigenous communities have used the coca leaf in cultural rituals, social and economic interactions, and medicinal uses for centuries.634 From 1980s until the early 2000s, Bolivia's drug control strategy fuelled forced coca eradication leading to human rights violations and exacer - bating the poverty of affected farmers. From 2006 onwards, Bolivia has shifted its strategy to expand and protect the rights of indigenous coca growers. In 2004, the Bolivian government allowed regis - tered farmers in the Chapare to cultivate 1,600 m2 of coca for the legal market, shifting away from defining coca growers as active participants in the illegal drug trade to identify them as subsistence farmers working to feed their families. Article 384 of the 2009 Constitution defends coca in its natural state, asserting its cultural significance and grant - ing it legal protection.635 In an effort to address the tensions between the licit national coca market and the international drug control regime, Bolivia with - drew from the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs in 2011 and re-acceded it a year later with a reservation allowing coca cultivation and sales for cultural, medicinal and traditional uses.636 In 2010, the government implemented a partici- patory Community Control Support Programme, based on sovereignty, shared responsibility and respect for human rights.637 The 2017 General Coca Law further differentiated coca from co - caine, decriminalising coca cultivation with the hope of reducing the stigma surrounding coca cultivation. The Bolivian model for community coca control has promoted: A reduction in illegal crop cultivation via a de - velopment strategy seeking to address affect - ed communities' basic needs and by limiting repression638 Citizenship and access to information, em- powering and involving communities in the formulation and implementation of develop - ment policies, providing subsistence income through legal plots, while working to voluntar - ily reduce excess coca production and diversi- fying their economy639 Development and poverty alleviation in coca growing regions by strengthening public ser - vices and institutional frameworks for margin- alised communities640 Respect for the fundamental human rights and wellbeing of families and vulnerable communities, preventing illegal cultivation of coca, while taking into account traditional licit uses641 Cooperation between farmers, the state, and international stakeholders such as the EU and the UNODC to develop crop monitoring sys- tems and impact assessment tools focusing on broader development considerations.642 community coca controlBolivia's Regulated legal cultivation Registered growers can grow on a limited extension of land.

For instance, in reference to Colombia and Bolivia, researchers found that 'under alterna- tive development initiatives, coca farmers cleared more primary forest to plant \"land hungry substitute crops\" that could not be cultivated as intensively as coca' . The report also concluded that 'The loss of for - ests and the degradation of natural habitats in drug production and drug trafficking zones contributes to the crisis of biodiversity decline worldwide' .652 It should be recalled here that forest conservation is essential to tackling climate change, since 11% of global emissions originate from deforestation.653 Nevertheless, environment protection is barely discussed at the CND, while discussions at the High Level Political Forums on the SDGs, at the UN Frame - work Convention on Climate Change or within the UN Environment Programme have so far largely ignored the links between drug control and envi- ronment degradation. In recognition of this worrying trend, the UNODC reported that since 2010 an increasing number of member states have included environmental con- servation in their alternative development strat - egies. This includes reforestation, soil restoration, the use of bio-fertilisers, the diversification of crops, organic production, and more rarely ecotourism.654 2.3.5 Protecting the environment in drug control strategies In various areas, illegal crop cultivation has contrib - uted to the deforestation and degradation of the environment because of the chemicals used to grow and process crops, such as agrochemicals, sulfuric acid, kerosene and others, being discharged into soil and streams.643 This, however, is not limited to the cultivation of crops destined for the illegal drug market, with similar environmental harms associat - ed with many other forms of agriculture. Rather than minimising harms to the environment, forced crop eradication campaigns have exacerbated environ- mental damage, by displacing subsistence farmers into new, more remote environments, including na- tional parks and indigenous territories.644 In Colom- bia, for instance, the UNODC estimated in 2016 that 32% of coca was being cultivated in national parks, indigenous reserves and Afro-Colombian Com- munity Lands, and that the areas cultivated within these territories had been in 'constant increase in the last years' .645 The use of harmful pesticides to destroy crops des- tined for the illegal drug market has also damaged fish and other aquatic life due to contaminated water, as well as fauna, insects and soil composition.646 The destruction of natural habitats and tropical ecosys- tems is likely to result in harms to native species.647 In recognition of concerns over both human and en- vironmental harms, Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador and Thai- land have all banned the use of chemical agents in eradication efforts.648 Colombia's discontinuation of aerial spraying is likely to be reversed under the new government, while substances like glyphosate649 con- tinue to be used for manual fumigation.650 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action Action 22(e): 'Promote supply reduction measures that take due account of traditional licit uses, where there is historical evidence of such use, as well as environmental protection, in conformity with the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988' Action 49(e): 'Ensure that development partners, affected States and other relevant key development actors examine innovative ways to promote alternative development programmes, including preventive alternative development programmes, where appropriate, that are environmentally friendly' Peruvian rainforestCredit: Health Poverty Action 87 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policyto receiving any development assistance, resulting in a variety of human rights violations. In Afghani- stan, for instance, militarised interventions funded first by the USA and then by the Russian Federation have resulted in a more precarious security situ- ation with increased levels of crime, an ongoing Taliban insurgency and official and unofficial mi- litias remaining active in the region - with severe consequences for subsistence farmers.659 A 2017 Brookings Institution report found that this had resulted in increased support from the population to the Taliban which provides armed security, jobs and subsistence, especially in remote rural areas of the country.660 The recent shift towards broader development strategies in illegal crop production areas by donors like GIZ and the European Union is therefore welcome, but remains the exception. References to human rights and alternative devel- opment are often put in the context of ensuring that human rights are taken into account in implement - ing drug control programmes. These, however, are not policy choices per se, but rather obligations that need to be respected. Eradication prior to the estab - lishment of alternative livelihoods pushes people deeper into poverty, and fosters human rights viola- tions, social unrest, instability and violence, among other negative impacts. It exacerbates stigmatisa- tion and marginalisation of small-scale producers, and can result in imprisonment, displacement, and the criminalisation of indigenous and traditional cultural practices. According to the Transnational Institute: 'People have the right to be free from hunger, to an adequate standard of living, to live a life in dignity, and to social security. When states fail in meeting their obligations to secure these rights, a strong argument can be made that they cannot interfere when people as a consequence are forced to find their own ways to do so, even if that means their involvement in illicit cultivation in absence of viable licit alternatives' .661The need to ensure 'environmental sustainability' is also within paragraph 7.g of the UN- GASS Outcome Document.655 As an example, Thailand has incorporated a strong environment protection component in its alterna- tive development strategy, including in land distri- bution, which areas should be cultivated and which should be reforested, how to use natural resources sustainably, etc. The programme also includes envi- ronmental education 'so that new generations can continue to be stewards of environmental sustain- ability' .656 Similarly, in Colombia the UNODC - with support from GPDPD and the climate protection project REDD+657 - has conducted a comprehen- sive analysis of the environmental impact of coca cultivation in the country, offering a set of criteria and recommendations to address this critical issue, including the use of traditional production models, as well as the creation of partnerships with affected communities.658 2.3.6 Ensuring that development assistance protects human rights Until recently, the links between drugs and devel- opment have been largely misunderstood and have generally been ignored by international donors. In other cases, foreign aid has been conditioned to the adoption of a drug control approach by recipient countries, including eradicating all cultivation prior 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action Action 47(c): 'Ensure that development assistance provided to communities in areas affected by illicit cultivation of crops used for the production of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances takes into account the overall aims of human rights protection and poverty eradication'88 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy 89 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Part 3: What next?

I encourage the continuation of this structure for future UN drug policy debates', UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, 2018662 When it was adopted in April 2016, the UNGASS Outcome Document was criticised by civil socie - ty663 and a number of government officials664 for failing to question the punitive approach to global drug control, and for failing to mention decrimi- nalisation and the abolition of the death penalty for drug offences, among other issues. The call, in the preamble of the Outcome Document, for the achievement of a 'society free of drug abuse' , remains particularly problematic considering the lack of progress and severe consequences associ- ated with efforts to achieve this goal over the past 10 years. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the issue of reg-ulated markets for certain substances likewise did not make it into the final document (see Box 21). Initial analysis by IDPC - to be published later in 2018 - confirms that all recommendations and thematic areas covered in the 2009 Political Dec - laration and Plan of Action were also incorporated in the Outcome Document, apart from one issue (witness protection, mentioned in Paragraphs 61 and 62 of the Plan of Action). Both the spirit and themes of the 2009 Political Declaration are there - fore largely reflected within in the 2016 Outcome Document. Nonetheless, in many regards the Outcome Doc - ument represents a significant improvement over past high-level drug policy documents - including the 2009 Political Declaration and its plan of ac - tion. Indeed, a number of critical drug policy issues which were either not included or only partially covered in 2009 were incorporated in the 2016 doc - ument.

The UN drug control treaties expressly limit cannabis use to medical and scientific purposes, and cannabis is placed under the strictest of the conventions' control schedules, meaning that its liability 'to abuse and to produce ill effects... is not offset by substantial therapeutic advantages' . How - ever, cannabis is by far the world's most widely used illegal drug.666 Instead of persisting with efforts to ban cannabis markets, an increasing number of jurisdictions are choosing to provide for legal, regulated access to cannabis for adults for non-medical purposes. These jurisdictions have concluded - in somxe cases by public bal- lot - that regulation would be better suited to promote the health, security, and human rights of their citizens. Movement toward regulation of non-medi- cal cannabis is most obvious in the Americas, namely in Uruguay,667 Canada,668 and the USA,669 and these policy shifts are prompting renewed debate on cannabis regulation elsewhere in the world, such as in the Netherlands,670 Switzer - land671 and New Zealand.672 In the Caribbean, where Jamaica already allows for cannabis use in religious ceremonies673 and St Vincent and the Grenadines is about to adopt a similar bill, a recent report of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Regional Commission on Marijuana recommends that 'the end-goals for CARICOM should be the removal of a prohibitionist re - gime that has proven to be ineffective, unjust and caused more harm than it sought to pre - vent' and that 'CARICOM Member States should negotiate the tensions arising between redun- dant treaties and other requirements, not uni- laterally, but as a unified entity' .674 There is little doubt that legal regulation of non-medical cannabis is beyond the bounds of what the drug control treaties permit. But regulation is moving ahead all the same, and the resulting treaty tensions are now a matter of intense debate at UN drug policy forums.675 The so-called 'Vienna consensus' is fractured, and the starkly different approaches to canna- bis are among the key reasons why. Reaching a new global consensus to revise or amend the UN drug control conventions in order to accom- modate legally regulated markets for cannabis does not appear to be a viable scenario for the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, the limits of flex - ible treaty interpretations have been reached, and overstretching them any further would result in undermining the basic principles of international law. States that intend to move towards legal regulation, or that have already done so, are therefore obliged to explore other options to reconcile such policy changes with their obligations under international law. Only a few options are available that do not require the consent of all the treaty parties. The WHO can recommend, after a critical review by its ECDD, to change the schedule of a con- trolled substance or remove it from the sched- ules altogether, and the CND is then asked to adopt the recommendation by a simple or two-thirds majority vote (for the 1961 and 1971 conventions, respectively). The ECDD's first-ever critical review of cannabis is indeed underway.676 This review is likely to result in WHO recommendations by the end of 2018 to re-schedule cannabis (plant, resin and extracts) within the 1961 treaty and its active THC com- pounds within the 1971 treaty, although reach- ing the required CND majority to adopt them may prove difficult. The other options that do not require UN consensus are either a unilateral procedure by late reservations to the treaties or denunciation and re-accession with new reservations (as Bolivia did with regard to coca), or collective inter se modifications negotiated between like-minded countries - a procedure provided for under Article 41 of the Vienna Con- vention on the Law of Treaties.677 The inter se procedure was specifically de - signed to find a balance between the stability of treaty regimes and the necessity of change in the absence of consensus. This option would require the like-minded agreement to include a clear commitment to the original treaty aim to promote the health and welfare of human- kind and to maintaining the original treaty obligations vis-\u00e0-vis countries not party to the inter se agreement. The situation in which the Continued overleaf92 Taking stock: A decade of drug policyof the 2009 Declaration (i.e. demand reduction, supply reduction and international cooperation). In addition to better reflecting the complexities of the illegal drug market, this new structure enables member states to address a broader range of drug policy issues that do not fit under the headings cooperation to enhance international cooperation' . The inclusion of separate chapters on access to controlled medicines, human rights and develop - ment are particularly important for drug control to better contribute to the broader UN objectives of protecting human rights, peace and security, and development. Furthermore, the level of visibility allocated to each of the seven themes within the Outcome Docu- ment is much more balanced than in 2009. Then, the Plan of Action included 122 actions to reduce supply compared to only 50 on demand reduction. In comparison, the Outcome Document provides a much more balanced alternative (see Figure 13).UN drug control treaty regime finds itself to - day - systemic challenges and inconsistencies, increasing tensions with state practices, huge political and procedural obstacles to amend- ments, and unilateral escape attempts - merit a careful exploration of the legitimacy and via- bility of inter se agreements. As more countries opt for legal regulation of cannabis, the coor - dinated collective response entailed by inter se agreements has clear benefits compared to a chaotic scenario of a growing number of dif- ferent unilateral reservations and questionable re-interpretations.678 children, key harm reduction interventions (such as overdose prevention and NSPs, although the term 'harm reduction' failed once again to feature in the final text), proportionality of sentencing, key human rights issues (including the right to a fair trial and due process, to be free from torture and cruel punishment, among others), as well as devel- opmental considerations with a strong link to the need to alleviate poverty and to achieve the SDGs in both rural and urban settings. Finally, it is worth noting that the UNGASS Outcome Document does not include the unrealistic drug-free world targets that were incorporated in both the 1998 and 2009 Political Declarations. This omission leaves the door open to consider new metrics and indicators through which progress can be evaluated. The seven-pillar structure of the Outcome Docu- ment (i.e. demand reduction, supply reduction, in- ternational cooperation, access to controlled med- icines, human rights, evolving realities, trends and challenges, and development) is also a welcome departure from the siloed three-pillar approach 93 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policy The 2019 Ministerial Segment is a critical moment to take stock of what has - and has not - been achieved over the past decade, as well as to build on the im- portant progress reflected in the UNGASS Outcome Document. It is also a key opportunity to re-orientate international drug policy away from harmful punitive approaches towards more effective and humane pol- icies. Ahead of the Segment, the IDPC network679 de- veloped four recommendations to inform the 2019 event and global drug policy going forward. 2.1 Moving away from 'drug-free world' targets The data presented in this Shadow Report show that the targets aiming to 'eliminate or reduce significantly and measurably' the illegal drug market have failed to materialise. Over the past decade, these targets have distorted policy prior - ities, diverting funding away from proven public health and development approaches, and have been used to justify a number of human rights abuses. Beyond 2019, the international commu-nity should consider adopting more meaningful goals and targets in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the UNGASS Outcome Document and international human rights com- mitments. Examples of possible new targets are available below. 2.2 Meaningfully reflect the impacts of drug policies on the UN goals of promoting health, human rights, development, peace and security Most drug policies worldwide have undermined or run counter to the overarching priorities of the UN to protect human rights, consolidate peace and security and advance development. Undeniable progress has been made within the UNGASS Outcome Document to better reflect these key priorities, in particular with references to the SDGs. Going forward, the overall objective of global drug policies should actively seek to contribute to advancing the 2030 Agenda for Sus- tainable Development, including protecting basic 2 The 2019 Ministerial Segment: Establishing a timeline for the next decade94 Taking stock: A decade of drug policyhuman rights, strengthening good governance and promoting the well-being of society, especially those most marginalised and vulnerable. 2.3 Reflecting the realities of drug policies on the ground, both positive and negative The Shadow Report highlights significant changes in the global drug policy landscape since 2009, with unprecedented reforms taking place at local Box 22 Options for drug policy reform Ahead of the 2016 UNGASS, IDPC released the third edition of its Drug Policy Guide.680 Bringing together global evidence and best practices, the Guide provides expert analysis across the spec - trum of drug policy, including on aspects related to public health, criminal justice and develop - ment. Each theme explores the latest available evidence of effectiveness, illustrated by country case studies, and offers advice and recommen- dations for effective, balanced and humane drug policies. These include: The scale up, expansion and funding of evi- dence-based drug prevention, harm reduc - tion and drug dependence treatment servic - es in the community and in prison settings The removal of legislative, regulatory and technical barriers that hampers access to controlled medicines, especially in the Glob - al South The decriminalisation of people who use drugs and subsistence farmers engaged in illegal crop cultivation The consideration of legally regulated mar - kets to address the harms associated with punitive drug control, in particular mass incarceration, human rights abuses, stigma and discrimination The use of effective and humane alternatives to incarceration for non-violent drug offend- ers, and the review of current drug laws to ensure more proportionate sentencing for all drug offences The abolition of the death penalty for drug offences The incorporation of a development per - spective in drug policies to address poverty, marginalisation and vulnerability, with the goal of leaving no one behind The recognition and protection of the rights of indigenous peoples, including the right to grow and use internationally controlled substances The consideration of new metrics and indi- cators to measure the effectiveness of drug policy, using the Universal Human Rights Index and the SDGs The inclusion of civil society, in particular affected communities, in all aspects of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of drug policy.681 and national levels in the fields of harm reduc - tion, treatment, decriminalisation, alternatives to incarceration, medicinal cannabis, and the crea- tion of legally regulated markets for non-medical use, among others. 2019 will be a critical juncture at which these reforms should be discussed, in particular with regards to the possible resulting tensions with the international drug control re - gime (see Box 21). On the other side of the policy spectrum, it is equally important to acknowledge the human rights abuses committed in the name 95 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policyapproach to drug policy, in order to redress some of the social harms associated with punitive drug control. Putting people first also requires that the UN address the ongoing tensions between UN drug control obligations and the rights of indig- enous peoples. In this context, a rights-centred approach should aim to protect the traditional and medicinal practices of indigenous commu- nities, including their right to cultivate and use controlled substances. This shift in focus requires civil society and com- munity involvement in all aspects of the design, implementation, evaluation and monitoring of drug policies at local, national, regional and inter - national levels. This imperative had already been recognised within the 2009 Political Declaration and Plan of Action (Actions 10 and 12(b)) and was reiterated in the 2016 UNGASS Outcome Docu- ment (Preamble and paragraphs 1.q, 4.g, 7.l and 9). Beyond 2019, global drug policy should include the continued and meaningful participation of most affected groups, in particular people who use drugs, people involved in subsistence farming of crops destined for the illegal drug market, formerly incarcerated drug offenders, indigenous peoples, and other communities such as affected women, children and youth. of drug control, including the continued use of the death penalty for drug offences, extrajudi- cial killings, compulsory detention centres, mass incarceration and dire prison conditions, stigma and discrimination against people who use drugs, and others. These serious human rights concerns should feature prominently in the 2019 debates to ensure a paradigm shift in drug policy that is en- shrined in international human rights law, health and social inclusion. 2.4 Ending punitive approaches and putting people and communities first This Shadow Report has showcased how drug policies have so far placed a disproportionate emphasis on the substances they seek to con- trol, rather than on the well-being of people and communities they seek to serve. Beyond 2019, the global drug strategy should focus on putting people and communities at the centre, and seek to improve their living conditions, address their vulnerabilities and protect their human rights - in line with the SDG vision of 'leaving no one behind' . This entails embracing a social justice 96 Taking stock: A decade of drug policyof complexity, requiring the UN and its member states to recalibrate their policies - including those relating to drug control - to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. By continu- ing to promote drug-free targets while side-lining other critical aspects of drug policy, governments may run the risk of failing to achieve many of the SDGs agreed upon in 2015. The difficulty now lies in defining which new metrics and indicators member states and the UN should use to measure progress. The SDGs are highlighted within the UNGASS Outcome Docu- ment's preamble and paragraph 7.g. The Goals, along with their detailed targets and indicators, provide an invaluable resource for every aspect of policy making at the UN level. The interrelation- ship between the SDGs and drug policy has been extensively discussed elsewhere683 and this anal- ysis will therefore not be repeated here. Instead, this section proposes possible new metrics and indicators based on the SDGs and closely aligned with the UNGASS Outcome Document's operation- al recommendations. While not every SDG may be relevant to drug policy, the targets and indicators they provide can be used and adapted to meas-The success of drug control strategies should be measured through an assessment of the impact of drug control efforts in the enjoyment of human rights and other critical aspects such as security, health and social-economic development', OHCHR, 2018682 Reconsidering the overall goals of global drug pol- icy beyond the mere objective of achieving a drug- free society entails a rethink of the metrics and in- dicators being used to evaluate progress achieved by drug policies and strategies worldwide. If drug control no longer has a singular focus on reducing cultivation, trafficking and use - objectives that have not been achieved over the past 20 years - but rather on minimising drug-related health harms, improving access to healthcare, upholding basic human rights, reducing poverty in cultiva- tion and trafficking areas, improving citizen safety and reducing corruption, the use of indicators fo - cusing on measuring the scale of the illegal drug market will no longer be enough. Furthermore, the additional thematic areas covered in the UNGASS Outcome Document require the development of additional indicators to measure progress, and their inclusion in a revised ARQ. Finally, the adop - tion of the SDGs in 2015 poses an additional layer Credit: Sustainable Development Goals website 3 Identifying new indicators for measuring the success of drug policy: How to leverage the Sustainable Development Goals 97 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policythe work currently being undergone by NGOs, UN agencies and government bodies on the issue, and aim to offer a starting point for further discussion on the matter.684 ure the success of drug policies, strategies and programmes. This is also an opportunity to iden- tify 'outcome' or 'impact' metrics and indicators, instead of solely using 'process' or 'activity' indi- cators. These proposed indicators are based upon 98 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy3.1 Chapter 1: Demand reduction and related measures The current UNODC data reporting mechanism already covers levels of drug use and dependence, as well as some drug use-related health issues.

Much of the recommendations within this chapter relate to supply reduction efforts, but several also focus on health. In this regard, the following SDG targets may be useful: Original SDG target/indicatorPossible drug policy target/indicator & relevant paragraph in the UNGASS Outcome Document Target 3.3: By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuber - culosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other com- municable diseasesBy 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis and com- bat hepatitis and other communicable diseases among people using NPS or ATS (para 5.d) Availability of innovative, accessible interventions to ad- dress the adverse health consequences of NPS and ATS use (para 5.d) Indicator 3.3.1: Number of new HIV infections per 1,000 uninfected population, by sex, age and key pop - ulationsNumber of new HIV infections per 1,000 uninfected peo - ple using NPS or ATS, by sex, age (para 5.d) Indicator 3.3.2: Tuberculosis incidence per 1,000 pop - ulationTuberculosis incidence per 1,000 people using NPS or ATS, by sex, age (para 5.d) Indicator 3.3.4: Hepatitis B incidence per 100,000 pop - ulationHepatitis B and C incidence per 100,000 people using NPS or ATS, by sex, age (para 5.d) Target 3.5: Strengthen the prevention and treatment of substance abuse, including narcotic drug abuse and harmful use of alcoholProportion/number of people dependent on NPS or ATS receiving evidence-based drug dependence treatment, in- cluding substitution treatment (para 5.d) Availability of minimum quality standards for the preven- tion and treatment of NPS or ATS dependence (para 5.d) Indicator 3.5.1: Coverage of treatment interventions (pharmacological, psychosocial and rehabilitation and aftercare services) for substance use disorders% of people dependent on NPS or ATS accessing evi- dence-based treatment, by sex, age (para 5.d)104 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy3.6 Chapter 6: Strengthening international cooperation This topic is extensively covered in the 2009 Political Declaration and within the current ARQ. However, two SDG Targets may be useful to consider: Original SDG target/indicatorPossible drug policy target/indicator & relevant paragraph in the UNGASS Outcome Document Target 16.A: Strengthen relevant national institutions, including through international cooperation, for building capacity at all levels, in particular in developing countries, to prevent violence and combat terrorism and crimeLevel of information sharing through effective coordination mechanisms at national, regional, sub- regional and international levels on expertise and best practice in drug policy (para 6.c) Target 17.6: Enhance North-South, South-South and triangular regional and international cooperation on and access to science, technology and innovation and enhance knowledge sharing on mutually agreed terms, including through improved coordination among existing mechanisms, in particular at the United Nations level, and through a global technology facilitation mechanismFormal and informal mechanisms established to enhance North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation among member states on drug policy (para 6.b) Indicator 17.14.1: Number of countries with mechanisms in place to enhance policy coherence of sustainable developmentLegislation, policy and/or strategy adopted and implemented to enhance policy coherence between drug control and sustainable development (para 6.d) 105 Taking stock: A decade of drug policy Taking stock: A decade of drug policy3.7 Chapter 7: Alternative development, development-oriented balanced drug control policy Here again, the UNGASS Outcome Document made significant progress in expanding the concept of alter - native development to include broader development considerations, including addressing socio-economic vulnerabilities, improving access to education, employment, land tenure and natural resources, addressing inequalities and protecting the environment - both in rural and urban settings.

The expression of 'Vienna consensus' refers to the decision-making practice at the CND based on an embedded convention among member states of only adopting resolutions by consensus, and never putting decisions to a vote. In 2009 and subsequent years, however, it has become more and more difficult for member states to achieve consensus, especially on issues considered to be controversial such as harm reduction measures, the death penalty, decriminalisation, treaty reform, indicators, and others. This has led to increasingly artificial 'consensus' on paper 27.
