IN SERT AT ................................ ................ 14 _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 3 A INTRODUCTION Evenity is indicated for the treatment of severe osteoporosis in post -menopausal women at high risk of fracture. The active substance, romosozumab , is a humanised immunoglobulin inhibitor. Inhibition of s clerostin leads to a transient stimulation of bone formation and inhibition of bone resorption. This dual effect of increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption results in rapid increases in trabecular and cortical bone mass and improvements in bone structure and strength. Evenity is available as a solution for subcutaneous injection in a pre-filled syringe containing romosozumab 105mg solution sterile, -free, clear to opalescent, colourless to light yellow solut ion at pH 5.2.

C ASSESSMENT OF CLINICA L EFFICACY The clinical efficacy data to support the use of romosozumab in the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (PMO) at high risk of fracture was supported by two pivotal Phase III, randomised, double -blind studies, ARCH and FRAME and one supportive study STRUCTURE. Pivotal Alendronate -controlled study (Study 20110142; ARCH) Study ARCH was a Phase III, double -blind, randomised, event -driven study evaluating romosozumab compared to alendronate in post -menopausal women wi th osteoporosis (PMO) and previous fragility fractures . Subjects in the study were randomi sed in a 1:1 ratio to receive either romosozumab 210 mg via two subcutaneous injections once monthly or oral alendronate 70 mg once weekly for the first 12 months i n the double -blind phase; following which r omosozumab was stopped and all subjects received open -label alendronate in the second year. All s ubjects received daily calcium (500 to 1000 mg) and vitamin D (600 to 800 IU) supplementat ion. The use of alendronat e as an active comparator was considered acceptable. Spine X rays were obtained at screening, Months 6, 12 and 24. Vertebral fractures were determined using X rays, CT or MRI. A medical report was acceptable if imaging reports were not available. The prim ary efficacy endpoints were i) the incidence of new vertebral fractures at Month 24 and ii) the incidence of clinical fracture (non -vertebral fracture or clinical vertebral fracture) at the primary analysis. The primary analysis was performed when all women had completed the Month 24 study visit and clinical fracture events were confirmed for at leas t 330 women, which occurred after a median of 33 months on study. The key secondary endpoints were the percent change from baseline in bone mineral density (BMD) at lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck at Months 12 and 24 , and the incidence of non-vertebral fractures at primary analysis. A fixed -sequence testing procedure was used for multiplicity adjustment of the two primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints to maintain the overall significance level at 0.05. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 5 A total of 4 ,093 PMO subjects aged 55 to 90 years old with previous fragility fractures were studied. The patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced between the treatment arms. The mean age of the study population was 74 years old and 7.0% were Asian . Overall, 96.1% of women had a vertebral fracture at baseline , and 99.8% of women had a previous fracture. The mean baseline lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck BMD T -scores were 2.96, 2.80 and 2.90 , respectively . Treatment with romosozumab resulted in a significant decrease in fractures compared to alendronate treatment. The incidence of new vertebral fracture s at Month 24 was 4.1% (74/1825) in the romosozumab group compared to 8.0% (147/1834) in the alendronate gr oup with an absolute risk reduction of 4.03% (95% CI: 2.50 %, 5.57 %) and a relative risk reduction of 50% (95% CI: 34 %, 62%; p<0.001 ). Through the primary analysis period, the incidence of clinical fracture was 9.7% (198/2046) in the romosozumab group and 1 3.0% (266/2047) in the alendronate group, with a relative risk of 27% (95% CI: 12 %, 39%; p<0.001 ). The results were statistically significant. The increase in BMD from baseline was consistently higher in the romosozumab group than in the alendro nate group at Month 12 at the lumbar spine (13.7% vs 5.0%), total hip (6.2% vs 1.7%); statistical significance ( p<0.001 ) was reached at all locations. At Month 24, romosozumab for 12 months followed by alendronate for 12 mon ths significantly increased BMD from baseline compared to alendronate alone for 24 months at the lumbar spine (15.3% vs 7.2%), total hip (7.2% vs 2.3%); statistical significance ( p<0.001 ) was also reached at all locations. Romosozumab also significantly reduced the risk of nonvertebral fractures compared to alendronate. Through the primary analysis period, the incidence of nonvertebral fracture was 8.7% (178/2046) in the romosozumab (217/2047) in the alendro nate group , yielding a (95% CI : 1%, 34%; p=0.040 ). The study was not powered to assess the effect of romosozumab on hip fractures, but a favourable point estimate was observed compared to alendronate at both Month 12 (relati ve risk reduction 36% [95% CI : -26%, 67%]) and at the time of primary analysis (relative risk reduction 38% [95% CI : 8%, 58%]).

In the first 12 months , subjects received either subcutaneous romosozumab 210 mg monthly or placebo . All subjects were switched to open -label subcutaneous denosumab 60 mg every 6 months in the second year. All subjects received daily calcium (500 to 1000 mg) and vitamin D (600 to 800 IU) supplementation. Spine X rays were obtained at screening, Month 6, 12 and 24. No n-vertebral fractures were confirmed using X rays, CT or MRI. A medical report was acceptable if imaging reports were not available. The co -primary endpoints were the incidence of new vertebral fractures at Month 12 and Month 24. The key secondary endpoin ts included clinical fracture s at Month 12 (defined as non - vertebral fractures and symptomatic vertebral fractures ), non -vertebral fractures at Months 12 and 24 and hip fractures at Months 12 and 24. A fixed -sequence testing procedure was used for multipli city adjustment of the co -primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints to maintain the overall significance level at 0.05. A total of 7 ,180 PMO subjects were randomised to study treatment . The patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced between the treatment arms. The mean age of the studied population was 71 years old and 12.1% were Asian . Baseline mean BMD T -scores were -2.72 at lumbar spine and -2.47 at total hip and -2.75 at femoral neck. This study recruited a population of less severe PMO subjects compared to study 20110142 ( ARCH ), as subjects with BMD T -score of -3.5 at the total hip or femoral neck, history of hip fracture, severe vertebral fract ure or more than 2 moderate vertebral fractures were excluded. A total of 18.7% of patients in the romosozumab group and 18.0% in the placebo group had a prevalent vertebral fracture at baseline, as evaluated by the central imaging vendor. Treatment with romosozumab resulted in a significant decrease in new vertebral fractures compared to placebo at Month 12. The incidence of new vertebral fractures at Month 12 was 0.5% (16/3321) in the romosozumab group compared to 1.8% (59/3322) in the placebo group , with an absolute risk reduction of 1.30% (95% CI: 0.79 %, 1.80 %) and a relative risk reduction of 73% (95% CI: 53 %, 84%). At Month 24, patients who were initially randomised to romosozumab had significantly fewer vertebral fractures than placebo after all subjects switched to denosumab. The incidence of new vertebral fractures was 0.6% (21/3325) in the romosozumab/denosumab group compared to 2.5% (84/3327) in the placebo/denosumab _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 7 group, wit h an absolute risk reduction of 1.89% (95% CI: 1.30 %, 2.49 %) and a relative reduction of 75% (95% CI: 60 %, 84%). Romosozumab significantly reduced the risk of clinical fracture s (nonvertebral and clinical vertebral fracture s) by 36% (95% CI: 11 %, 54%) compared to placebo through Month 12 (p = 0.008 ). However, the reduction in non -vertebral fractures at Month 12 was not significant (p=0.096) , although a clear separation between treatment groups in favour of romosozumab was observed. The remaining endp oints in the testing sequence were not formally tested for statistical significance. Nevertheless, favourable point estimate s were noted compared to placebo at both Month 12 and Month 24.

The increase in BMD from baseline was markedly higher in the romosozumab group than in the placebo group at Month 12 at the lumbar spine (13.1% vs 0.4%), total hip (6.0% vs p<0.001 ) was reached at all locations . At Month 24, romosozumab followed by denosumab maintained the increases in BMD at the lumbar spine (16.6% vs 5.5%), total vs 2.3%); statistical significance ( p<0.001 ) was also reached at all locations . Extension phase through Month 36 A lower fracture risk was observed through Month 36 for new vertebral, clinical, non -vertebral, major non -vertebral, major osteoporotic and new or worsening vertebral fractures in the romosozumab group compared to the placebo group , despite both treatment groups having switched to denosumab after the first 12 months of double -blind treatment. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 8 Incidence of key fracture endpoints through Month 36 (Study 20070337) Cumulative incidence of clinical fracture and non -vertebral fracture through Month 36 (Study 20070337) Women transitioning from bisphosphonate therapy The supportive study STRUCTURE (20080289) was a Phase IIIb, multicentre, randomised, open -label study comparing romosozumab to teriparatide in PMO subjects with severe osteoporosis transitioning from bisphosphonate use . The study population had a high risk for fracture, defined as low BMD at lumbar spine, total hip or femoral neck, and with evidence of a previous fracture. Subjects were randomised to receive either subcutaneous romosozumab 210 mg once a month or subcutaneous teriparatide 20 ug once daily fo r 12 months. All subjects received daily calcium (500 to 1000 mg) and vitamin D (600 to 800 IU) supplementation. The primary efficacy variable was the percent change in total hip BMD from baseline at Month 12. The study was not designed to assess for fracture data. A total of 436 subjects were randomised to study treatment. The patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were generally ba lanced between the treatment arms. The mean age was 71 .5 years (range: 56 -90 years) and only 0.5% were Asian. Enrolled women had a mean baseline lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck BMD T -scores of -2.85, 2.24, and -2.46, respectively, and a history o f nonvertebral fracture after age 50 or vertebral fracture at any time. All subjects received oral bisphosphonate therapy in the 3 years immediately prior to screening. The majority of subjects received prior alendronate ( 92.7% in teriparatide group and 88 ) during this period . _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 9 Romosozumab significantly increased BMD at the total hip relative to teriparatide at Month 12 (2.9% vs -0.5%; mean difference in at 12 months compared to teriparatide CI 2.6, 4.2]; p<0.0001) at femoral neck. Overall, the clinical efficacy of romoso zumab in the treatment of osteoporosis in post - menopausal women was demonstrated. D ASSESSMENT OF CLINICAL SAFETY The clinical safety of romosozumab in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis was mainly derived from the 12 -month romosozumab treatment periods in studies ARCH and FRAME , comprising 5,621 patients. Overview of Safety Profile (12 -month PMO Fracture Trial Safety Analysis Set) 606 (10.8%) Treatment -related SAE 25 (0.4%) 29 discontinuations due to AE 77 (1.4%) 59 (1.0%) AE: adverse event; SAE: serious adverse event A total of 77.5% of subjects in the romosozumab group and 79.6% in the control group reported at least one adverse event (AE). Treatment -related AEs were reported at similar incidence rates of 15.9% in the romos ozumab group vs 14.5% in the control group. Most of these events were mild to moderate in severity. The most common AEs and their incidences (romosozumab vs control) were viral upper respiratory tract infection (14.1% vs 14.5%), arthr algia (11.3% vs 11.2%) and back pain (10.0% vs 10.9%). Most of these events were mild to moderate in severity. Treatment -related AEs reported in romosozumab group included arthralgia and injection site pain (1.2% vs 0.9%). The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was similar between romosozumab and control groups (10.8% and 10.6%, respectively). Pneumonia (0.6% vs 0.5%) was the most frequently reported SAE, followed by femur fra cture (0.3% vs 0.3%). None of the femur fractures were adjudicated as atypical femoral fracture s. Treatment -related SAEs were reported in ~1% of subjects, and there was no clustering of SAEs in any System Organ Class . AEs of special interest in clude hypocalcaemia of the (n=1 in romosozumab), which were identified/potential risks of romosozumab. These identified risks were described as warnings in the approved product labelling . _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 10 Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) The most significant safety signal for romosozumab was the imbalance in adjudicated MACE events (defined as a composite of myocardial infarction [MI], stroke and death) observed in study ARCH during the first 12 months of treatment, but not observed in the FRAME study nor in the overall study period. In terms of baseline characteristics , the study populations were generally balanced between the treatment groups within each study, including CV -related medical history. Time to first adjudicated MACE through Month 12 and the overall study period (Safety Analysis Set, Studies 20070337 and 20110142) The number of subjects with MACE events during the 12 -month double -blind romosozumab treatment phase in the ARCH study was 41 (2.0%) in the romosozumab group versus 22 (1.1%) in the alendronate group, yielding a hazard ratio ( HR) of 1.87 (95% CI 1.11, 3.14) for romosozumab compared to alendronate. In addition, 16 subjects (0.8%) had MI in the romosozumab arm versus 5 subjects (0.2%) in the alendronate arm and 13 subjects (0.6%) had stroke in the romosozumab arm versus 7 subjects (0.3%) in the alendronate arm. These events occurred in patients with or without a history of MI or stroke. Cardiovascular (CV) death occurred in 17 subjects (0.8%) in the romosozumab group and 12 (0.6%) subjects in the alendronate group. All -cause death occurred in 30 subjects (1.5%) in the romosozumab group and 22 (1.1%) subjects in the alendronate group. In subgroup analyses by baseline characterist ics and history of cerebrovascular events and/or cardiac ischemic events, the increased risk of MACE events through Month 12 was consistently elevated on romosozumab compared to alendronate or placebo in all subgroups. Nonetheless, the imbalance in MACE events between treatment group s was no longer evident (HR 1.15 [0.88, 1.50]) when the subjects were followed through till the end of the study period , with a median follow -up time of approximately 33 months. During the 12 -month double -blind romosozumab trea tment phase in the placebo -controlled FRAME study, there was no difference in positively adjudicated MACE; 30 (0.8%) occurred in the romosozumab group and 29 (0.8%) in the placebo group. All -cause death occurred in 29 subjects (0.8%) in the romosozumab gro up and 24 (0.7%) subjects in the placebo group. In the supportive STRUCTURE study in women with PMO, cardiovascular events were not adjudicated. A numerical imbalance in AEs of cardiac disorders (5.0% vs 3.7%) and vascular disorders (7.3% vs 3.3%) were ob served. In addition, serious cardiac disorders were reported _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 11 in 2.3% for romosozumab and 0.9% for teriparatide. One serious cerebrovascular accident, one ischaemic stroke and one transient ischaemic attack were reported in the romosozumab group vs none in the teriparatide group. Deaths All fatal AEs in these studies were adjudicated and categorised as CV or non -CV-related deaths. Deaths which could not be confirmed to be CV -related were assumed to be CV in the analysis. In the ARCH study , 22 subjects (1.1%) in the alendronate group versus 30 romosozumab subjects (1.5%) had a fatal AE where as in the FRAME study, 24 placebo subjects (0.7%) versus 29 romosozumab subjects (0.8%) had a fatal AE . The incidence of non -CV deaths in the 12 -month double -blind period was generally balanced in both studies, with the majority of deaths in both studies being due to malignancies (22 of 43 cases). CV mortality (\"CV death\" + \"Undetermined\") was generally balanced in the FRAME study (17 romosozumab -treated subjects (0. 5%) and 15 placebo -treated subjects (0.4%) had adjudicated CV deaths ). In the ARCH study, a numerical imbalance in the incidence of CV deaths was observed , comprising 17 romosozumab subjects (0.8%) compared to 12 alendronate subjects (0.6%). Of these, 5 ro mosozumab subjects compared to 2 alendronate subjects had fatal MIs or strokes. The incidence of non -MI or non -stroke fatal CV events was balanced (9 events in romosozumab group and 8 events in alendronate group). When analysed by age, an imbalance in de ath in subjects 75 years old was observed with higher number of events associated with romosozumab treatment compared to placebo or the active control during the 12 -month double -blind period in both studies ARCH and FRAME , see table below. The relatively small number of events (n=105; <1%) limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions, particularly when these numbers become even smaller when split by age groups; and that these events may be confounded by existing medical comorbidities in this frail population. Subject incidence of fatal adjudicated AEs in the 12 -month double -blind period in 20070337 (FRAME) and 20110142 (ARCH) _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 12 Non-clinical studies have not identified a mechanism by which romosozumab may have contributed to the increas ed CV events in ARCH study. A literature review on background rates of MACE events reveal ed a similar range of MACE events in the target patient population. Based on the known mechanism of action , there was no association between sclerostin and/or romosozu mab and the key pathological mechanisms underlying MI and stroke, i.e., plaque rupture, plaque erosion, increased thrombogenesis or vasospasm. There is also no genetic evidence for any association between sclerostin and CV risk. Osteoporosis and CV disea se have overlapping risk factors and are associated conditions in epidemiological studies. In the clinical studies, t he number of CV events was considered small over the time period examined (22 events [1.1%] in alendronate group [ n=2014] vs 41 events [2.0%] in romosozumab group [ n=2040] over 12 months in the ARCH study), and the associated hazard ratios may be difficult to interpret given the small number of events. Neve rtheless , the potential CV safety signal could not be entirely ruled out. In an exploratory analysis, i t was observed that w hen patients with a history of MI or stroke were excluded from the event rates calculation, the excess MACE events per 1000 patients in the romosozumab versus control group decreased from 23 to 3 . This data suggests that restricting the treatment population to a targeted subset by excluding patients with a prior history of MI or stroke may minimise the possible increased CV risk from romosozum ab treatment. Overall, romosozumab presented an acceptable safety profile for the target patient population. Appropriate warnings and precautions have been included in the package insert to address the identified safety risks. E ASSESSMENT OF BENEFIT -RISK PROFILE Osteoporosis is a disease characterised by low bone mass, disruption of the bone structure and skeletal fragility, resulting in decreased bone strength and an increased risk of fracture. In the context of severe osteoporosis, clinical practice gu idelines recommend the use of an anabolic agent as initial treatment in patients with very high risk of fracture (including those with a recent fracture in the last 2 years, multiple prevalent fractures, very low BMD T -scores, very high FRAX [Fracture Risk Assessment Tool] major osteoporotic and/or hip fracture scores). Teriparatide is currently the only anabolic agent available in Singapore, but patient compliance is impacted by the need for daily injections . Hence, there is a medical need for alternative therapies for patients with a higher risk of fractures. The clinical efficacy of romosozumab in the treatment of osteoporosis in post -menopausal women was demonstrated in studies ARCH and FRAME. Romosozumab produced clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction s in new vertebral fractures (at Mon th 24) and clinical fractures (at a median follow -up duration of 33 months at time of primary analysis) compared to alendronate in study ARCH . In the placebo -controlled FRAME study, patients who received an initial 1 -year treatment with romosozumab experie nced significant reduction s in new vertebral fracture risk compared to placebo. This benefit persisted after the patients transitioned to denosumab at Month 12 through Month 24 , compared to subjects who transitioned from placebo to denosumab. The lowered f racture risk in the romosozumab treatment group was observed through the extension phase to Month 36. Although both studies were not designed to adequately assess effects on hip fracture, there were favourable point estimates for the romosozumab group comp ared to controls. In both studies, romosozumab increased BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck compared to control through Month 24. Furthermore, romosozumab has shown superiority to _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 13 teriparatide for rapid increase s in BMD from baseline in p ost-menopausal women with severe osteoporosis transiting from at least 3 years of bisphosphonates therapy in the STRUCTURE study. The main studies providing safety data for romosozumab in post -menopausal women with osteoporosis w ere the two large pivotal studies , ARCH and FRAME . AEs were mostly mild to moderate in severity and mainly include d viral upper respiratory tract infection , arthralgia , back pain, hypersensitivity reactions, injection site reactions and headache. The most not able safety concerns were MACE, hypocalcaemia, hypersensitivity reactions, osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fractures , which have been adequately addressed in the package insert. There were uncertainties with respect to the divergen ce in CV sa fety data from the two pivotal fracture studies in PMO women. No plausible mechanism by which romosozumab would impact the risk of MI and stroke has been identified , and no specific subgroups of patients were identified from the clinical data as being at r elative ly higher risk of MACE . In view of these uncertainties , the use of romosozumab is recommended only in a restricted population of post-menopausal women at high risk of fracture who require rapid build -up in bone mass was considered favourable, taking into consideration the advantage of rapidly increasing bone mass and quick onset of efficacy. Risk mitigation measures have been included in the package insert to manage the risk of MACE , including contraindicating its use in patients with a history of MI or stroke, assessing fracture risk and CV risk over the next 12 months by the prescriber and discontinuing romosozumab if a patient experiences a MI or stroke during treatment. The requirements for submission of periodic benefit -risk e valuation reports , as well as results from the observational non-interventional study comparing the clinical characteristics of patients treated with romosozumab versus other approved osteoporotic therapies, were attached as registration condition s to furt her monitor and confirm the benefit -risk of romosozumab in the approved patient population. F CONCLUSION Based on the review of quality, safety and efficacy data, the benefit -risk balance of Evenity for the treatment of severe osteoporosis in post -menopausal women at high risk of fracture, with a corresponding contraindication in patients with history of myocardial infarction or stroke , was deemed favourable and approval of the product registration was grante d on 27 May 2021. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Page 14 APPROVED PACKAGE INSERT AT REGISTRATION 1 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT EVENITY\u00ae solution for injection in pre -filled syringe 105 mg/1.17 mL 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION EVENITY solution for injection in pre -filled syringe 105 mg Each pre -filled syringe contains 105 mg romosozumab in 1.17 mL (90 solution . EVENITY (romosozumab) is a humani sed monoclonal (IgG2) with high affinity and specificity for sclerostin. Romosozumab has an approximate molecular weight of 145 kDa and is produced in a mammalian cell line (Chinese hamster ovary) by recombinant DNA technology. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for subcutaneous injection . EVENITY is a sterile, preservative -free, clear to opalescent, colo urless to light yellow solution, pH 5.2. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic Indications Postmenopausal Osteoporosis EVENITY is indicated for the treatment of severe osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture. 4.2 Dosage and Administration Dosage The recommended dose of EVENITY is 210 mg administered subcutaneously. Administer EVENITY once every month for 12 doses. Patients should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D [see Contraindications (4.3), Special Warnings and Precautions for Use (4.4), and Clinical Data (5.1)]. If the EVENITY dose is missed, administer as soon as it can be rescheduled. Thereafter, EVENITY can be scheduled every month from the date of the last dose. After completing EVENITY therapy, consider transition to another osteoporosis therapy [see Pharmacodynamic Properties 5.1) and Clinical Data (5.1)]. Method of Administration Subcutaneous use. Administration should be performed by an individual who has been trained to administer the product. To administer the 210 mg dose, give 2 subcutaneous injections of EVENITY. 2 For detailed instructions on storage, handling, and administ ration, follow the directions provided in the \"Instructions for Use.\" Important Administration Instructions Visually inspect EVENITY for particles and discoloration prior to administration. EVENITY is a clear to opalescent, colo urless to light yellow solution. Do not use if the solution is cloudy or discolo ured or contains particles. Administer EVENITY in the abdomen, thigh, or upper arm subcutaneously. If you want to use the same injection site, make sure it is not the same spot on the injecti on site you used for a previous injection. Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. 4.3 Contraindications Hypocalcaemia EVENITY is contraindicated in patients with uncorrected hypocalc aemia [see Special Warnings and Precautions for Use (4.4), Adverse Reactions (4.8), and Special Populations (4.6)]. Hypersensitivity EVENITY is contraindicated in patients with known clinically significant hypersensitivity to romosozumab or to any component of the product formulation [see Special Warnings and Precautions for Use (4.4) and List of Excipients (6.1) ]. Myocardial Infarction and Stroke EVENITY is contra indicated in patients with a h istory of myocardial infarction or stroke [see Special Warnings and Precautions for Use (4.4)]. 4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use Myocardial Infarction and Stroke In a randomi sed controlled trial in postmenopausal women, there was a higher rate of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), a composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke, in patients treated with EVENITY compared to those treated with alendronate. Romosozumab is contraindicated in patients stroke [see Contraindications ( 4.3)]. When determining whether to use romosozumab for an individual patient, consideration should be given to her fracture risk over the next year and her cardiovascular risk based on risk factors (e.g. established cardiovascular disea se, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking, severe renal impairment, age). Romosozumab should only be used if the prescriber and patient agree that the benefit outweighs the risk. If a patient experiences a myocardial infarction or strok e during therapy, treatment with romosozumab should be discontinued. Hypocalcaemia Transient hypocalc aemia has been observed in patients receiving EVENITY. Correct hypocalc aemia prior to initiating therapy with EVENITY [see Contraindications (4.3), Adver se Reactions (4.8), and Special Populations (4.6)]. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypocalc aemia. Patients should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D [see Pharmacodynamic Properties (5.1)]. 3 Patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 15 to 29 m L/min/1.73 m2) or receiving dialysis are at gr eater risk of developing hypocalcaemia and the safety data for these patients is limited. Calcium levels should be monitored in these patients. Hypersensitivity Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions, including angio -oedema, erythema multiforme, and urticaria occurred in the EVENITY group in clinical trials. If an anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs, initiate appropriate therapy and discontinue further use of EVENITY [see Contraindications (4.3) and Ad verse Reactions (4.8)]. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), which can occur spontaneously, is generally associated with tooth extraction and/or local infection with delayed healing and has occurred rarely in patients receiving EVENIT Y in the clinical trials. Patients who are suspected of having or who develop ONJ while on EVENITY should receive care by a dentist or an oral surgeon. Discontinuation of EVENITY therapy should be considered based on individual benefit -risk assessment. The following risk factors should be considered when evaluating a patient's risk of developing ONJ: potency of the medicinal product that inhibits bone resorption (the risk increases with the antiresorptive potency of the compound), and cumulative dose of b one resorption therapy. cancer, co -morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking. concomitant therapies: corticosteroids, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy to head and neck. poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, p oorly fitting dentures, history of dental disease, invasive dental procedures e.g. tooth extractions. All patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, receive routine dental check -ups, and immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling or non -healing of sores or discharge during treatment with romosozumab . Atypical Femoral Fracture Atypical low -energy or low -trauma fracture of the femoral shaft, which can occur spontaneously, has occurred rarely in pat ients receiving EVENITY in the clinical trials. Any patient who presents with new or unusual thigh, hip, or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patient presenting w ith an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of EVENITY therapy should be considered based on individual benefit -risk assessment. 4.5 Interactions with Other Medicaments and Other Forms of Interaction No drug interaction studies have been conducted with EVENITY. 4.6 Special Populations Pregnancy Risk Summary EVENITY is not indicated for use in women of reproductive potential or in pregnant women. 4 There are no studies of EVENITY in pregnant women. Therefore, it is not known whether EVENITY can cause f oetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal Data Reproductive and developmental effects of romosozumab were assessed in the rat in a pre liminary and definitive embryo f oetal development study, a combined fertility and embryo development study, and a pre - and postnatal study. In pregnant rats administered romosozumab at exposures at least 30 -fold higher than the systemic exposure observed in humans following a monthly subcutaneous dose of 210 mg romosozumab (based on AUC comparison), romosozumab -related effects were limited to a slight increase in the incidence of reduced ventral processes on the sixth cervical vertebra in f oetuses at Gesta tion Day 21, which resolved in pups examined postnatally. This variation represents a slight developmental delay in a skeletal process not found in humans, and therefore this finding is not relevant to humans. Skeletal abnormalities (including syndactyly and polydactyly), occurred in 1 out of 75 litters across all studies. Based on the weight of evidence (including single litter incidence, below group mean exposure to romosozumab, presence of anti -romosozumab antibodies in the dam, and absence of skeletal malformations at substantially higher maternal and f oetal exposures), these observations were concluded to be unrelated to romosozumab. There were no adverse effects on postnatal growth and development. Syndactyly occurs at a high incidence in sclerosteos is but does not occur in patients heterozygous for the genetic mutation. Risk for malformations of developing digits in the human f oetus is low following romosozumab exposure due to the timing of digit formation in the first trimester in humans, when place ntal transfer of immunoglobulins is limited. Lactation Romosozumab is not indicated for use in breast -feeding women. It is not known whether EVENITY is present in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse effects in nursing infants from EVENITY, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue EVENITY, taking into account the potential benefit of EVENITY to the mother or the potential benefit of breastfeeding to the infant. Fertility No data are available on the effect of EVENITY on human fertility. Animal studies in female and male rats did not show any effects on fertility endpoints at doses up to 300 mg/kg (100 -fold the clinical dose) [see Preclinical Safety Data/Nonclinical Toxicology (5.3)]. Paediatrics The safety and efficacy of EVENITY have not been established in p aediatric patients [see Preclinical Safety Data/Nonclinical toxicology (5.3)]. Elderly No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients (see also section 5.2). Hepatic Impairment No clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment. Renal Impairment 5 No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment. Patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2) or receiving dialysis are at greater risk of developing hypocalc aemia [see Contraindications (4.3) and Special Warnings and Precautions for Use (4.4)]. Monit oring of calcium levels is highly recommended. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is important in patients with severe renal impairment or receiving dialysis. 4.7 Effects on Ability to Drive and Use Machines No studies on the effect on the ability to drive or use heavy machinery have been performed in patients receiving EVENITY. 4.8 Adverse Reactions Summary of the Safety Profile The adverse reactions described in the table below are based on 12 -month pooled data from 3695 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and 163 men with osteoporosis treated with EVENITY in Phase II and Phase III, placebo -controlled clinical trials [see Adverse Reactions (4.8)]. The adverse reactions in EVENITY treated patients ( N = 2040) in a double blind, Phase II I active -controlled study were similar in type to those seen in the placebo -controlled trials. The most common adverse reactions ( 1/10) from the pooled safety data were viral upper respiratory tract infection and arthralgia. Tabulated Summary of Adverse Reactions Adverse reactions are displayed by system organ class and frequency below using the following convention: very common ( 1/10), common ( rare ( 1/10,000 to < and very rare (< 1/10,000).

See Contraindications (4.3) and Special Warnings and Precautions for Use (4.4). c. Most frequent injection site reactions were pain and erythema. Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of romosozumab has been evaluated using a screening immunoassay for the detection of binding anti -romosozumab antibodies. For patients whose sera tested positive in the screening immunoassay, an in vitro assay was performed to detect neutrali sing antibodies. In postmenopausal women dosed with 210 mg monthly EVENITY, the incidence of anti -romosozumab antibodies was 18.1% (1072 of 5914) for binding antibodies and 0.8% (50 of 5914) for neutrali sing antibodies. Across all doses studied in postmenopausal women, the pooled incidence of binding antibo dies and neutrali sing antibodies was similar to the 210 mg monthly dose, respectively. In men with osteoporosis dosed with 210 mg monthly EVENITY, the incidence of anti -romosozumab antibodies was consistent [17.3% (28 of 162) for binding antibodies and 0.6 % (1 of 162) for neutrali sing antibodies] with that observed in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. No impact to the efficacy and safety of romosozumab was observed in the presence of anti -romosozumab antibodies. Myocardial infarction, stroke and mort ality In the active -controlled trial of romosozumab for the treatment of severe osteoporosis in postmenopausal women during the 12 -month double -blind romosozumab treatment phase, 16 women (0.8%) had myocardial infarction in the romosozumab arm versus 5 women (0.2%) in the alendronate arm and 13 women (0.6%) had stroke in the romosozumab arm versus 7 women (0.3%) in the alendronate arm. These events occurred in patients with and without a history of myocardial infarction or stroke. Cardiovascular death occu rred in 17 women (0.8%) in the romosozumab group and 12 (0.6%) women in the alendronate group. The number of women with major adverse cardiac events (MACE = positively adjudicated cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke) was 41 (2.0%) in the romosozumab group and 22 (1.1%) in the alendronate group, yielding a hazard ratio of 1.87 (95% confidence interval [1.11, 3.14]) for romosozumab compared to alendronate. All -cause death occurred in 30 women (1.5%) in the romosozumab group and 22 (1.1%) wom en in the alendronate group. In the placebo -controlled trial of romosozumab for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (including women with severe and less severe osteoporosis) during the 12 -month double -blind romosozumab treatment phase, there was no difference in positively adjudicated MACE; 30 (0.8%) occurred in the romosozumab group and 29 (0.8%) in the placebo group. All -cause death occurred in 29 women (0.8%) in the romosozumab group and 24 (0.7%) women in the placebo group. Reportin g of Suspected Adverse Reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit -risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions as per local regulations . 4.9 Overdose There is no experience with overdosage in clinical trials with EVENITY. 7 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other drugs structure and sation . ATC code: M05BX06 Mechanism a humani sed monoclonal antibody (IgG2) that binds and inhibits sclerostin. Romosozumab has a dual effect on bone, increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption. Romosozumab stimulates new bone formation on trabecular and endocortical bone surfaces by stimulating osteoblastic activity resulting in i ncreases in trabecular and cortical bone mass and improvements in bone structure and strength. Pharmacodynamic Effects EVENITY has a dual effect on bone, increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption. In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, EVENITY increased the bone formation marker procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) early in treatment, with a peak increase of approximately 145% relative to placebo 2 weeks after initiating treatment, followed by a return to placebo levels at mo nth 9 and a decline to approximately 15% below placebo at month 12. EVENITY decreased the bone resorption marker type 1 collagen C -telopeptide (CTX) with a maximal reduction of approximately 55% relative to placebo 2 weeks after initiating treatment. CTX l evels remained below placebo and were approximately 25% below placebo at month 12. After discontinuation of EVENITY therapy in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, P1NP levels returned to baseline within 12 months; CTX increased above baseline levels within 3 months and returned toward baseline levels by month 12, reflecting reversibility of effect. Upon retreatment with EVENITY after 12 months off treatment, the level of increase in P1NP and decrease in CTX by EVENITY was similar to that observ ed during the initial treatment. In women transitioning from oral alendronate, EVENITY also increased bone formation and decreased bone resorption. Clinical Data Treatment of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women Study 1 (ARCH, alendronate -controlled) was a randomi sed, double blind, alendronate -controlled study of 4093 postmenopausal women aged 55 to 90 years (mean age of 74.3 years), with a median follow -up of 33 months. The mean baseline lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck BMD T -scores were 2.96, 2.80, and 2.90, respectively, 96.1% of women had a vertebral fracture at baseline, and 99.8% of women had a previous fracture. Women were randomi sed (1:1) to receive either monthly subcutaneous injections of EVENITY (N = 2046) or oral weekly alend ronate (N = 2047) for 12 months, with daily supplementation of calcium and vitamin D. After the 12 -month treatment period, women in both arms transitioned to open -label alendronate while remaining blinded to their initial treatment. The primary analysis wa s performed when all women had completed the month 24 study visit and clinical fracture events were confirmed for at least 330 women, which occurred after a median of 33 months on study. The primary efficacy endpoints were the incidence of new vertebral f racture through month 24 and the incidence of clinical fracture (defined as the composite of nonvertebral fracture and clinical vertebral fracture) at primary analysis. Secondary efficacy endpoints included the incidence of nonvertebral fractures, hip frac tures, and major nonvertebral fractures at the primary analysis, and percent change from baseline in BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck at month 12 and month 24. 8 Effect on New Vertebral and Clinical Fractures EVENITY reduced the inciden ce of new vertebral fracture at 24 months and clinical fracture after a median of 33 months. The number of patients who experienced vertebral and clinical fracture was consistently lower in the EVENITY arm at prespecified time points. See Table 2 for full data. Table 2 .

The Kaplan -Meier estimates of the cumulative incidence of clinical fracture, nonver tebral fracture and hip fracture over time are shown in Figure 2 below. Figure 2. Cumulative Incidence of Clinical, Nonvertebral, and Hip Fractures Effect on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) EVENITY significantly increased BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck compared with alendronate at month 12. At month 24, 12 -month treatment with EVENITY followed by 12 -month treatment with alendronate significantly increased BMD compared with alendronate alone for 24 months at the lumbar spine, total h ip, and femoral neck. The BMD increase with EVENITY over alendronate observed at month 12 was maintained at month 24 (see Table 4 ). 11 Table 4.

P-value < 0.001 based on an ANCOVA model, adjusting for treatment, age strata, presence of severe vertebral fracture at baseline, baseline BMD value, machine type, and baseline BMD value -by-machine type interaction . A total of 167 subjects participated in the imaging component (as measured by DXA) of the Imaging and PK/BTM/Biomarker Substudy. EVENITY resulted in progressive increases from baseline in BMD beginning at month 6. Treatment differences in BMD between EVENI TY and alendronate groups continued to increase at month 12. After transitioning to alendronate after 12 -month treatment with EVENITY, treatment differences in BMD between the EVENITY -alendronate and alendronate -alendronate groups continued to increase at month 18 and were maintained at month 24 (see Figure 3). Consistent effects on BMD were observed regardless of baseline age, baseline BMD, and geographic region at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck. Treatment differences in BMD at 6 months we re 7.6% at the lumbar spine, 2.2% at the total hip, and 2.9% at the femoral neck. At 12 months, the treatment differences were 8.9% at the lumbar spine, 3.7% at the total hip, and 4.1% at the femoral neck. At 18 months, after transitioning to alendronate a fter 12 months of EVENITY treatment, the treatment differences between the EVENITY -alendronate and alendronate -alendronate groups were 9.3% at the lumbar spine, 4.3% at the total hip, and 5.4% at the femoral neck. At 24 months, the EVENITY -alendronate grou p maintained gains in BMD compared to on the alendronate -alendronate group, with treatment differences of 9.4% at the lumbar spine, 4.3% at the total hip, and 5.3% at the femoral neck. 12 Figure 3. Percent Change in BMD at Lumbar Spine, Total Hip, and Femor al Neck from Baseline Over 24 Months Study 2 (FRAME, placebo -controlled) was a randomi sed, double blind, placebo -controlled study of 7180 postmenopausal women aged 55 to 90 years (mean age of 70.9 years). The mean baseline lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck BMD T -scores were 2.72, 2.47, and -2.75, respectively, and 18.3% of women had a vertebral fracture at baseline. Women were randomi sed to receive subcutaneous injections of either EVENITY (N = 3589) or placebo (N = 3591) once every month for 12 months with daily supplementation of calcium and vitamin D. After the 12-month treatment period, women in both arms transitioned to open -label denosumab 60 mg subcutaneous every 6 months for 12 months while remaining blinded to initial treatment. The co primary efficacy endpoints were the incidence of new vertebral fractures through month 12 and through month 24. Secondary efficacy endpoints included the incidence of clinical fractures (all symptomatic fractures including nonvertebral a nd painful vertebral fractures), nonvertebral fractures, new or worsening vertebral fractures, major nonvertebral fractures, hip fractures, and percent change from baseline in BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck, and were evaluated though 24 months. Effect on New Vertebral and Clinical Fractures EVENITY significantly reduced the incidence of new vertebral fractures through month 12 (p < 0.001), as shown in Table 5. The reduction in fracture risk persisted through the second year in women who received EVENITY during the first year and transitioned to denosumab compared to those who transitioned from placebo to denosumab (month 24; p < 0.001).

Effect on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) 16 EVENITY significantly increased BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck compared to placebo at month 12. Following 12 months of treatment, EVENITY increased BMD at the lumbar spine from baseline in 99% of postmenopausal women. Ninety -two percent of women treated with EVENITY achieved at least a 5% increase from baseline in BMD at lumbar spine by month 12 and 68% gained 10% or more. These effects were sustained with transition to another osteoporosis treatment; women who received EVENITY for 12 months followed by denosumab for 12 months had greater increases in BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck at month 24 com pared to women who received placebo for 12 months followed by denosumab for 12 months ( see Table 7). Consistent effects on BMD were observed regardless of baseline age, baseline BMD, and geographic region at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck. Table 7.

Number of women randomi sed. b. p-value < 0.001 based on an ANCOVA model, adjusting for treatment, age and prevalent vertebral fracture strata, baseline BMD va lue, machine type, and baseline BMD value -by-machine type interaction . Among women with BMD assessed at baseline and every 6 months, EVENITY significantly increased BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck relative to placebo at 6 and 12 months. Following the transition from EVENITY to denosumab, BMD continued to increase through month 24. In wom en who transitioned from placebo to denosumab, BMD also increased with denosumab use. The differences in BMD achieved at month 12 between EVENITY and placebo patients were overall maintained at month 24, when comparing patients who transitioned from EVENIT Y to denosumab versus patients who transitioned from placebo to denosumab ( see Figure 6). Treatment differences in BMD at 6 months were 9.4% at the lumbar spine, 4.3% at the total hip, and 3.6% at the femoral neck. After 12 months, the treatment differenc es were 13.3% at the lumbar spine, 6.9% at the total hip, and 5.9% at the femoral neck. At 18 months, women who received EVENITY followed by denosumab maintained gains in BMD compared to women who received placebo followed by denosumab, with treatment diff erences of 11.8% at the lumbar spine, 6.8% at the total hip, and 6.8% at the femoral neck. At 24 months, women who received EVENITY followed by denosumab maintained gains in BMD compared to women who received placebo followed by denosumab, with treatment d ifferences of 12.6% at the lumbar spine, 6.0% at the total hip, and 6.0% at the femoral neck. 17 Figure 6. Percent Change in BMD at Lumbar Spine, Total Hip, and Femoral Neck from Baseline Over 24 Months Bone Histology and Histomorphometry A total of 154 transiliac crest bone biopsy specimens were obtained from 139 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at month 2, month 12, and/or month 24. Of the biopsies obtained, 154 (100.0%) were adequate for qualitative histology and 138 (89.6%) were adequate for full quantitative histomorphometry assessment. Qualitative histology assessments from those treated with EVENITY showed normal bone architecture and quality at all time points. There was no evidence of woven bone, minerali sation defects, or marrow fibrosi s. Histomorphometry assessments on biopsies at months 2 and 12 compared the effect of EVENITY with placebo (15 specimens at month 2 and 39 specimens at month 12 in the EVENITY group, 14 specimens at month 2 and 31 specimens at month 12 in the placebo gro up). At month 2 in women treated with EVENITY, histomorphometric indices of bone formation at trabecular and endocortical surfaces were increased due to a significant increase in modelling based formation with no significant effect on remodelling formation . These effects on bone formation were accompanied by a decrease in indices of bone resorption. At month 12, both bone formation and resorption indices were decreased with EVENITY, while bone volume and trabecular and cortical thickness were increased. Bio psies obtained at month 24 compared the effect of EVENITY for 12 months followed by denosumab for 12 months (18 specimens) with placebo followed by denosumab (21 specimens). At month 24, indices of bone remodelling were low and similar in both groups, cons istent with the effects of denosumab. Treatment of Osteoporosis in Women Transitioning from Bisphosphonate Therapy Study 3 (STRUCTURE) was a randomi sed, open -label study of 436 postmenopausal women aged 56 to 90 years (mean age of 71.5 years) with osteoporosis transitioning from bisphosphonate therapy to EVENITY. This study evaluated safety and BMD changes by dual -energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) through 12 months of treatment with EVENITY compared with 12 months of treatment with teriparatide. The study also evaluated hip strength estimated by finite element analysis (FEA) over 12 months using quantitative computed tomography images. Enrolled women had a mean baseline lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck BMD T -scores of -2.85, 2.24, and -2.46, respectively and a history of nonvertebral fracture after age 50 or vertebral fracture at any time. At month 12, EVENITY increased BMD from baseline by 9.8% lumbar spine, 2.9% CI: 2.5, 3.4) at the total hip, and 3.2% (95 % CI: 2.6, 3.8) at the femoral neck. Treatment differences in BMD at 12 months compared to teriparatide were 4.4% (95% CI: 3.4, 5.4) 18 3.4% (95% CI: 2.8, 4.0) at the hip, the femoral neck (95% CI: 2.6, 4.2; p -value < 0. 0001 for all comparisons). At month 12, EVENITY increased estimated strength from baseline by 2.5% (95% CI: 1.7, 3.2) at the total hip. The treatment difference in estimated strength at the total hip at month 12 compared to teriparatide was 3.2% (95% CI: 2.1, 4.3; p -value < 0.0001). Adverse reactions observed in this study were generally consistent with those seen in women not transitioning from bisphosphonate therapy (discussed in Section 4.8). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties Following SC administration, romosozumab exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics as a result of binding to sclerostin. Dose proportional increases in exposure were observed for the doses of 140 mg and higher. Administration of a single dose of 210 mg romosozumab in health y male and female subjects ( N = 90, age range: 21 to 65 years) resulted in a mean (standard deviation [SD]) maximum serum concentration (C max) of 22.2 (5.8) mcg/mL and a mean area under the concentration -time curve (AUC) of 389 (127) mcg*day/mL. The median time to maximum romosozumab concentration (T max) was 5 days (range: 2 to 7 days). Following a 210 mg subcutaneous dose, bioavailability was 81%. After C max, serum levels declined with a mean effective half -life of 12.8 days. Steady state was generally re ached by month 3 with minimal accumulation (less than 2 -fold) following monthly dosing. The presence of anti -romosozumab binding antibodies decreased romosozumab exposure up to 22%, which was not considered clinically meaningful [see Adverse Reactions (4. 8)]. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age (20 -89 years), gender, race, or disease state (low bone mass or osteoporosis) had no clinically meaningful effects on pharmacokinetics (< 20% change in exposure at steady state). Romosozumab exposure decreased with increasing body weight. This decrease had a minimal impact on lumbar spine BMD gain (< 15% change) based on exposure response analyses and was not considered clinically meaningful. Thus, no dose adjustment is necessary b ased on age, gender, race, disease state, or body weight. The pharmacokinetics of romosozumab were similar in patients transitioning from bisphosphonate therapy. Drug Interactions No drug drug interaction studies have been conducted with romosozumab. Special Populations Paediatrics: The pharmacokinetics of romosozumab in p aediatric patients have not been assessed. Elderly : The pharmacokinetics of romosozumab were not affected by age from 20 to 89 years. Renal Impairment: Following a single 210 mg dose of romosozumab in a clinical study of 16 patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2) or end -stage rena l disease (ESRD) requiring h aemodialysis, mean C max and AUC were 29% and 44% higher in patients with severe renal impairment as compared to healthy subjects. Mean romosozumab exposure was similar between patients with ESRD requiring haemodialysis and healthy subjects. A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated an increase in romosozumab exposure with increasing severity of renal impairment. However, based on both the renal impairment study and population PK 19 analysis, this increase is not clinically meaningful and no dose adjustment is necessary in the se patients [see Special Populations (4.6)]. Hepatic Impairment: No clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment. 5.3 Preclinical Safety Data/Nonclinical Toxicology Carcinogenicity In a carcinogenicity study, doses up to 50 mg/kg/week were administered by subcutaneous injection to Sprague -Dawley male and female rats from 8 weeks to up to 98 weeks of age. These doses resulted in systemic exposures that were up to 19 times higher than the s ystemic exposure observed in humans following a monthly subcutaneous dose of 210 mg romosozumab (based on AUC comparison). Romosozumab caused a dose -dependent increase in bone mass with macroscopic bone thickening at all doses. There were no effects of rom osozumab on mortality or tumo ur incidence in male or female rats. Mutagenicity Mutagenesis has not been evaluated, as monoclonal antibodies are not expected to alter DNA or chromosomes. Impairment of Fertility No effects on fertility were observed in male and female rats at doses up to 300 mg/kg (100 times the clinical dose). No effects were noted in reproductive organs in rats and cynomolgus monkeys dosed with romosozumab in the 6 -month chronic toxicology studies at exposures up to 37 and 90 times higher, respectively, than the systemic exposure observed in humans administered 210 mg romosozumab monthly (based on AUC comparison). Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology No adverse effects were noted in rats and monkeys after 26 once weekly s ubcutaneous injections at doses up to 100 mg/kg and systemic exposures 37 and 90 times higher, respectively, than the systemic exposure observed in humans following a monthly subcutaneous dose of 210 mg romosozumab (based on AUC comparison). In growing rats administered a rodent surrogate sclerostin antibody at pharmacologically active doses, a transient increase in longitudinal growth rate predicted to result in < 1% increase in bone length was observed. In growing rats dosed with romosozumab fo r 6 months resulting in exposures up to 19 times higher than the systemic exposure observed in humans following a monthly subcutaneous dose of 210 mg romosozumab (based on AUC comparison), there was no effect on femur length. In bone safety studies in ova riectomi sed rats and monkeys, once weekly treatment with romosozumab for 12 months increased bone formation and decreased bone resorption. The resulting increase in bone mass and improvements in cortical bone geometry and cancellous bone microarchitecture was associated with increased bone strength at exposures from 0.5 to 21 times higher than the systemic exposure observed in humans following a monthly subcutaneous dose of 210 mg romosozumab (based on AUC comparison). Bone tissue was of normal or improved quality with no evidence of minerali sation defects, accumulation of osteoid, or woven bone. 20 6.
