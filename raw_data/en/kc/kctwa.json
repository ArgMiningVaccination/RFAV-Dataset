Nucleic acid amplification techniques (e.g., PCR), nuclear acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), and Lawrence Livermore Microbial Detection Array (LLMDA), are undoubtedly the leading technologies for rapid detection and identification of most known human viruses. PCR, an extremely sensitive detection method, can amplify a specific region of DNA sequence by 106 times in vitro. As one of the most frequently used methods, PCR can efficiently detect viral RNA. You only need to convert RNA into DNA and then perform PCR analysis called reverse transcription PCR in real-time during the reaction. The detection of the influenza virus by qPCR is faster than the endpoint detection method, and its sensitivity is equal to or even better than the cell culture method. A previous study on detecting respiratory syncytial virus from children's nasal secretions showed that qPCR was the most sensitive assay compared with assays based on immunofluorescence and cell culture. There are two kinds of qPCR: one is based on probes known as TaqMan PCR, and the other is based on dye incorporation known as SYBR Green. qPCR is widely applied in the experimental study and clinical diagnosis of HIV-1, dengue virus and influenza virus. For example, the reduction of virus nucleic acid in infected cells is an indicator of a test article's antiviral efficacy. In addition, as a sensitive, precise, and wide dynamic range technique, qPCR generates quantitative data. This is a powerful attribute because it allows the quantification of infection, its progression, and any tissue tropism in the context of infectious diseases. Creative Diagnostics provides qPCR services for virus detection and quantification, drug/therapy response, gene expression analysis, relative/absolute quantification, mutation analysis, and genotyping. (Other viruses or microorganisms may be available on request) We combine infection and analytical expertise to provide our clients with the most powerful portfolio of antiviral and antimicrobial in vitro testing services. Facing an increasing demand for new antiviral and antimicrobial compounds for the treatment of infectious diseases, Creative Diagnostics can test these compounds in vitro to determine their potential efficacy in vivo models.
