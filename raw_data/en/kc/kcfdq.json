The ever -growing list of globally spread corona virus -19 disease (COVID19) patients has demonstrated the high transmission rate among human population. Altho ugh 12 new drugs are being tried for management of COVID19, currently there are no FDA approved drugs or vaccines to prevent and treat the infection of the SARS -CoV-2. Considering the current state of affairs, there is an urgent unmet medical need to ident ify novel and effective approaches for prevention and treatment of COVID19 by re -evaluating the knowledge of traditional medicines and repurposing of drugs. Here, we used molecular docking approach to explore the beneficial roles of an array of phytochemic als and active pharmacological agents present in the Indian herbs (Tulsi, Haldi, Giloy, Black pepper, Ginger, Clove, Cardamom, lemon, and Ashwagandha) which are widely used in the preparation of Ayurvedic medicines in the form of Kadha to control various respiratory disorders such as cough, cold and flu. The evaluation was made based on the docking scores calculated by AutoDock Vina. Our study has identified an array of phytochemicals present in these herbs which have significant docking scores and potentia l to inhibit different stages of SARS -CoV-2 infection as well as other Coronavirus target proteins. Molecular docking also indicated that, the phytochemicals present in these herbs possess significant anti -inflammatory property. Overall our study provides scientific justification in terms of binding of active ingredients present in different plants used in Kadha preparation with viral proteins and target proteins for prevention and treatment of the COVID19 . This preparation can boost individual 's immunity and inhibit the viral severity by interfering at different stages of virus multiplication in the infected person. Introduction Viral infections cause a wide spectrum of human diseases which appear with m ild, severe or life-threatening symptoms and un derlie major clinical and socio -economic problems worldwide. Human Coronavirus es (CoVs), including severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (SARS -CoV), middle east respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (MERS -CoV) and 2019 novel Coronavirus (SARS -CoV-2) hav e caused three recent major global epidemics with significant morbidity and mortality ( Paules et al., 2020). Presently, there are no specific drugs or vaccines approved for SARS -CoV-2. In light of the high infectivity rate of SARS -CoV-2 and lack of treatment options, World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it as a global emergency and researcher s from all -over the world are trying to find possible cure for this disease called Corona Virus Disease or COVID19. Phylogenetic analysis shows that SARS -CoV- 2 has very high nucleotide sequence identity with SARS -CoV-1 (79.7%) (Zhou et al., 2020). The envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS -CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved regions, with sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively. CoVs are enveloped viruses with a positive -sense single -stranded RNA genome and contain at least four structural proteins: Spike (S) protein (trimeric), enve lope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein. The Spike protein promotes host attachment and virion -cell membrane fusion during infection. Therefore, Spike proteins play a crucial role in determining the host range and tissue tropis m. Zoonosis is common among CoVs and they can be transmitted from one animal species to another, animals to humans, and humans to humans ( Lim et al., 2019) . Therapeutic interventions against CoVs can either activate the host defence machinery and immune sy stem or block viral life cycle events including transmission, cell binding, enzymes involved in synthesis of the viral components, replication and assembly (Wu et al., 2020). In search of therapeutics against CoVs, researchers are using following three bro ad strategies; (i) Test existing broad -spectrum anti -viral drugs, (ii) in silico screening of molecular databases to identify the lead molecules against viral or host proteins and (iii) rational drug design based on the genomic information and pathological characteristics of COVID19 (Wu et al., 2020). Among these, repurposing approach will shorten the time and reduce the cost as compared to other strategies (Wu et al., 2020). A part from the above strategies, alternative approaches including traditional and herbal medicines may also have significant potential for management of COVID19 both as prophylaxis and therapeutic purpose . Ayurvedic medicines and their extracts are used fo r treatment of viral diseases for a very long time (Arora et al., 2010; Alleva et al., 2010). Ayurvedic medicines are used in Indian subcontinent since the Vedic p eriod dating back to more than 2 000 years (Saini, 2016). An important Ayurvedic method for en richment of active pharmacological agents from herbs involves preparation of Kadha ( decoction) for oral consumption. According to Panchvidh Kashyapam described in the Charak Samhita (an ancient text on Ayurveda), there are five prescribed ways to consume m edicinal herbs and plants (Shingadiya et al., 2016). These includes: i) Swaras (juicing), ii) Kwath (decoction), iii) Kalka (in form), iv) Hima (an herb induced concoction), The decoction ( Kadha ) from a mixture of spices and herbs is considered to be one of the oldest forms of medicine invented by humans. Kadha is prepared from dry or less juicy ingredients like spices and herbs. The Ministry of AYUSH (Ayurvedic, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy ), Government of India, has recently recommended the use of Kadha for boosting the immunity and reducing inflammation during COVID 19 crisis (The ministry of AYUSH, 2020). During viral infections, inflammation is part of the body's immune response to reduc e infection, limit viral replication and transmission, reduce tissue injury and kill infected cells . Acute inflammation is beneficial and it is followed by healing and regeneration. However, CoVs are known to manipulate host machinery and subvert the immun e system leading to chronic inflammation (Chen et al., 2017; Takeuchi and Akira, 2007). The induction of pro - inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the host during SARS -CoV infection acts as a double -edged sword which not only activates host immune respo nse for viral clearance but also aggravates tissue injury and organ toxicity during clinical evolution of the disease (Gu and Korteweg, 2007; Tisoncik et al., 2012). CoVs infect cells using their spike proteins by making interaction with cognate receptors present on the host cell surface. The spike proteins of SARS -CoV and MERS -CoV attach to the cellular receptor enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor respectively for their entry inside the cells (Gu and Korteweg, 2007; Wang et., 2013). SARS -CoV-2 spike protein has higher affinity towards human ACE2 as compared to that of SARS -CoV-1 (Zhou et al. 2020). Upon infecting the host cells, CoVs manipulate host machinery for new virus production and also elicit inflammatory response in the host due to tissue injury (Gu and Korteweg, 2007; Wang et., 2013). Clinical investigation of critically ill patients infected with SARS -CoV-2 have shown high concentration of cytokines and chemokines in human plasma, suggesting that cytoki ne storm was associated with disease severity, multi -organ failure and mortality (Huang et al., 2020). Cyclooxygenase -2 (COX -2), phospholipase A2 (PLA2), kinase (IRAK) are important druggab le targets involved in SARS -CoV-2 induced inflammatory response and can be used to screen anti -inflammatory molecules. In the present study, the phytochemicals and active pharmacological ingredients found in different herbs used in making Kadha were docke d with different viral proteins (such as viral capsid spike, proteases, NSP polymerase), host cell receptors & proteases (such as human ACE2 and furin) as well -inflammatory mediators COX2, PLA2, IRAK -4 and NIK proteins) . Our study predicted that many of these phytochemicals possess significant affinity towards functional region of viral proteins including spike, proteases, nucleoproteins and polymerase as well as host surface receptors. These phytochemicals also showed significant binding af finity for the functional region of different inflammatory mediators. Our findings indicate that regular consumption of this a yurvedic Kadha in consultation with the ayurvedic practitioner may significantly boost the host immunity and also help in the prevention of viral infection and pathogenicity and reduc e disease -severity in the infected individuals. Materials and Methods Phytochemicals name of commonly used herbs in making Kadha : Some of the commonly used herbs in the pre parations of A list of 108 phytochemicals present in herbs that are used in preparation of Kadha or similar drink were collected from literature. Phytochemicals found in Ocimum et el. , 2004) . 3D structures these different phytochemicals were downloaded from PubChem ( https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) in structure -data file (SDF). Preparation of Ayurvedic Kadha : There are specific Ayurvedic methods to prepar e the Kadha . In India, variants of standard Kadha are also prepared using d ifferent combinations of herbs depending on the severity of disease / ailment and availability of ingredients . The most common ingredients are Tulsi leave s (10-15 leaves or \u00bc teaspoon powder) , Black (4- 5 pieces) , teaspoon powder) and Giloy (2-5g raw or \u00bc teaspoon powder) . To make the Kadha, these herbs are boiled in 200 ml water for 5-10 minute s, and jaggery o r honey is added to make it sweet. The preparation is filtered and mixed with \u00bc teaspoon of lemon juice. In case, if all ingredients are not available , it can be prepare d using locally available ingredient s. Protein structures: In order to study the mode of interaction of different phytochemicals with various proteins including SARS -CoV-2, SARS -CoV-1, other important proteins and receptors found on virus and host cell s, molecular docking was performed. We have used following PDB ID's In order to study the interaction of different phytochemicals with different pro -inflammatory mediators like COX2, PLA2, 5f1a, 4uy1, 4dn5 and 2nru respectively. All the protein structures were retrieved from pr otein data bank (www.rcsb.org) and cleaned using UCSF Chimera, developed by the Resource for Biocomputing, Visualization, and Informatics at the University of California. Molecular docking: PyRx virtual screening too ls was used for preparation of the input files and performing molecular docking using Vina wizard . For preparation of protein input files, all water molecules, ligands and ions were removed from *.pdb file s. The polar hydrogens were added to protein structure and prepared file s were saved in *.pdbqt format. The molecule 's energy w as minimized using energy minimization tools of PyRx virtual screening tools and ligands were saved in *.pdbqt format after adding polar hydrogens for further docking process. All doc king results were sorted by the binding energy. 2D interaction of the ligand and protein was visualized using Discovery Studio Visualizer. Region -specific docking was performed against SARS -CoV-2 main protease and spike protein as well as for human ACE2 & Furin protease. Following AutoDock Vina docking SARS -CoV-2, SARS -CoV and host anti-inflammatory mediator s were blindly docked using complete protein structure . Results Our molecular docking study revealed that different phytochemicals found in the traditional Ayurvedic Kadha, may have high binding affinity ( the lowest binding energy ) with various viral and host macromolecular targets and other human pro -inflammatory mediators and proteins. Table 1 shows the list of the phytochemicals which showed significant binding affinity (-7.5 kcal/mole) with human ACE2 and furin protein s. Table 2 shows the predicted binding of top 12 phytochemicals and native ligand N3, against SARS -CoV-2 main protease and their different protein residues which are involve d in the interaction . These molecules kcal/mole respectively. All these molecules share same binding site with the well -known inhibitor, N3 and their bi nding energy is also comparable (Fig 1). SARS -CoV-2 spike protein interact s with the host ACE2 receptor present on the surface of the host cells for their entry. Table 3 shows the binding of top 12 phytochemicals with SARS -CoV- 2 spike (PDB ID: 6VXX ) and the different residues involved in their interaction. These molecules are, Withanolide B, Withanolide, Withaferin A, acid, Piperolein respectively. These phytochemicals were found to share same binding pocket in the target proteins (Fig 2 a). Table 4 shows the binding of top 10 phytochemicals with human ACE2 (PDB ID: 2AJF) and the different residues involved in their interaction. The phytochemicals with high affinity for human ACE2 are, Withaferin share same binding pocket in human ACE2 (Fig 2 b) . Furin is another protease found in the host cells which act s on the viral spike protein and facilitate s its interac tion with the human ACE2. Table 5 shows the predicted binding of top 12 phytochemicals with human furin (PDB ID: 5MIM) and the different residues involved in their interaction s. These molecules are, Wi thanolide, Many of these molecules share same binding pocket as it s native ligand . However, our docking study also Hespertin, Campesterol, Chavicine, Rosmarinic acid, Stigmastereol bind to the residues at a site adjacent to binding site of native ligand (Fig 3). The molecular docking performed against other proteins from SARS -CoV-2 and SARS -CoV- 1proteins are shown in Table 6. Many of the phytochemicals present in the Kadha have significant binding affinity with SARS -CoV-2 and SARS -CoV-1 proteins . Some of the phytochemicals which have high respectively. A list of the phytochemicals which we re found to exhibit high affinity Among the phytochemicals tested , the following molecules were predicted to bind with Nsp9 RNA binding protein of SARS CoV ten phytochemicals were predicted to interact with SARS -CoV-2 RNA binding of the phytochemicals (having binding energy 7.5 kcal/mole) were also predicted to interact with SARS (having energy 7.5 kcal/mole) which may interac t phytochemicals (having energy 7.5 kcal/mole) were also predicted to interact with SARS - Table 7 shows the predicted binding energy of different phy tochemicals with molecules involved in the inflammatory process es such as COX2, PLA2, NIK and IRAK -4. From Table 7, it that may possess high binding affinity with most of the inflammatory molecules used in the study. Our study proposes that many of the phytochemicals present in these herbs may directly inhibit COX -2, PLA2 and IRAK -4 which are involve d in the inflammation. Many of these phytochemicals may also bind to the active site of the protein and at the same time few of them may have very high affinity for other region s of the target protein w hich may affect its function. Our study also shows that several phytochemicals present in the Kadha have significant predicted inhibitory activity to wards NIK. Inhibition of the NIK by phytochemicals may moderate the NF -B dependent genes which are involve d in inflammation. Based on these docking studies, it may be predicted that the phytochemicals present in the Kadha may exhibit anti-inflammatory property . Discussion Use of herbs and phytochemicals has a long history in the management of various respiratory diseases (Santana et al., 2016; Alamgeer et al., 2018; Pinn et al ., 2001). Currently, the demand of complementary medicine, including herbal medicine has become more popular in healthcare for both general maintenance of health and for treatment of minor illnesses (Barnes, 2004). In European count ries, several species of herbs have been used against flu and common cold (Weiss and Fintelmann, 2000). Similarly, in Russia and Estonia various herbs and medicinal plants have also been used for centuries for management of common cold and flu (Raal et al., 2013). In India, use of spices and herbs for treatment of various diseases including cough, cold is a common practice with recorded history of over 2000 years ( Vasanthi and Parameswari, 2010, Sachan et al., 2018) . is well -known that SARS -CoV viral genome encodes more than 20 proteins, among which -chymotrypsin -like (PLpro) are vital for virus replication (Lindner et al. 2005). They cleave the two translated polyproteins (PP1A and PP1AB) into individual functional components, resulting in release of 16 non -structural proteins (NSPs) (Jo et al., 2020). Thus SARS -CoV-2 main protease is considered as a promising druggable target. The viral NSPs play an important role in replication and transcription. Our study predicts that many of the phytochemicals of Kadha have significant binding affinity with the main predicted binding energy lower than the pharmacological inhibitor, N3 (Fig 1, Table 2). The binding of these phytochemicals with main protease may slow down the cleavage of PPs to releases NSPs and decrease the process of viral replication and tra nscription. The SARS -CoV spike protein plays an important role in virus entry into the host (Li, 2016). Initial interactions between the S1 domain and its host receptor (ACE2), and subsequent S2 segment mediated fusion of the host and viral membrane allows the viral RNA genome to enter inside the host cells. Thus, these proteins represent as important targets for designing drug (Li, 2016). Our study predicts that an array of the phytochemicals ha ve significant binding affinity with the SARS -CoV-2 spike prot eins ( Table 3, Figure 2a) as well as with host ACE2 protein ( Table 4, Figure 2b) and furin protein (which facilitate spike and ACE2 interaction) (Table 5, Figure 3). Thus, phytochemicals may significantly inhibit viral interaction with the host receptor and slow down or stop the entry of the viral genome inside the host. The spike protein is also known to activate the immune response of the host cell toward s CoVs (Li, 2016). The S1 domain of spike acts as a major antigen on the surface of the virus ( Yuan et al., 2016). SARS -CoV nucleocapsid protein (SARS -CoV NP) is another vital structural protein which shows intrinsic multimerization and interacts with M protein, suggesting that NP is both critical to formation of the viral nucleocapsid core and is involved in virion assembly (He et al. 2004, He et al. 2004). Our study predicts that the phytochemicals such as Withanone, Withanolide Oleanolic have significant binding energy with nucleocapsid protein ( Table 6). The N protein of SARS -CoV are also known to up -regulate the expressio n of the proinflammatory protein COX2 and also interact with the proteasome subunit p42, which affects a variety of basic cellular processes and inflammatory responses (Hu et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2010). Nsp3 protein is another key component for Coronavirus and is essential for replication/transcription complex (RTC) formation. It plays various roles in Coronavirus infection. It releases Nsp1, Nsp2, and itself from the polyproteins and interacts with other viral Nsps as well as RNA to form the rep lication/ transcription complex (Leia et al. 2018). Similarly, Nsp15 protein also acts as an endoribonuclease and preferentially cleaves of uridylates through a ribonuclease A (RNase A) -like mechanism and also facilitates viral replication and transcrip tion (Alcantara et al. 2010; Sawicki and Sawicki, 1998 ). Our study predicted that many of the phytochemicals of the Kadha have significant binding affinity with Nsp3 and Nsp15. Thus, the phytochemicals identified in Table 6 may disrupt the formation of RTC and stop the viral genome replication ( Table 6). During the SARS -CoV infection, human lung epithelial cells are among the first targets for viral entry. In response to viral multiplication and host cell damage, lung epithelial cells secrete inflammatory mediators to initiate and exacerbate host innate inflammatory responses, causing detrimental immune -mediated pathology within the lungs. SARS -CoV-2 infects ACE -2 expressing epithelial cells in the air sacs (alveoli) in lower lungs. The damaged epithelium l eads and interlobular septal thickening lead to leaky cell junctions, accumulation of fluid which is rich in proteins, inflammatory mediators and Pneumonia. The spread of virus from lung to systemic circulation and excessive production of pro -inflammatory mediator can damage different vital organs. Our study predicts that an array of the phytochemicals such as in the preparation of the Kadha, have significant binding affinity with the many of these inflammatory mediators or the molecules involved in this process ( Table 7). It is well known that, NF -B is the master regulator for several genes such as COX -2, VEGF (vascular endothelial growth Factor), pro IL-6, and TNF), chemokines and MCP - 1), adhesion molecules, immunoreceptors, growth factors, a nd other agents involved in proliferation and invasion. NF -B activation is mediated by two distinctly different redox - related signalling pathways. The first pathway involves NIK/IKK whereas second pathway involve MAPKs and both causes the induction of tra nscriptional activation of NF -B. NF -B- inducing kinase (NIK) a key the non -canonical NF -B signalling pathway. NF -B is also one of the main inducible transcription factors shown to respond directly to oxidative stress. Oxidative stress act ivates nuclear factor -B and migrates to the nucleus and binds to elements on DNA in enhancers and promote r regions . Various herbs have potential to control inflammation -associated disease by decreasing the production of the pro -inflammatory mediators by suppressing pro -inflammatory pathways (Pan et al., 2011). Our study also predicted that phytochemicals found in the Kadha have significant binding affinity with NIK ( Table 7) which can stop NF -B mediated downstream events. In a very recent study, Huang et al (2020) have shown that the patients infected with SARS -CoV-2 had high amounts of IL1 , IFN, IP10, and MCP1, which can mediate cytokine storm associated multi -organ damage. At the same time, SARS -CoV-2 infection also initiates increased secretion cytokines (eg, IL4 and IL10) which suppress inflammation (Huang et al., 2020). The increase d secretion of inflammatory mediators was also associated with moderation of helper T cell responses in COVID19 patients. Taken together, our current findings and the recent knowledge about SARS -CoV and SARS - CoV-2 pathology, profess the use of Ayurvedic Kadha in the prevention and management of COVI D-19. The phytochemicals found in the Kadha have significant binding affinity with the different CoVs proteins (Scheme 1), indicating that they may control viral infection and multiplication in the host cells. Molecular dock ing study with human inflammatory mediators predicts that many of the phytochemicals present in this preparation have significant anti - inflammatory property. Most of the phytochemicals found in the herbs ashwagandha, giloy, tulsi, clove and black pepper ha ve potential to interact with most of the druggable proteins selected in this study. In conclusion, regular consumption of ayurvedic Kadha in consulta tion with ayurvedic practitione r may decrease the inflammatory response, boost the individual's immunity and reduce the risk of CoV s infection including SARS -CoV-2.
