This secluded, serene and sumptuous resort feels like the Garden of Eden. There are tons of fun things to do in addition to water sports; there are delicious food options and an on-site herb & vegetable garden for fresh \"farm-to-table\" dining. The resort is quiet and safe which is great for early morning and late night walks. But there's also a convenient buggy service that continuously runs around the island or is available on-call within minutes. The friendly, attentive staff treats you both like royalty & like family. Your wish is their command! The crown jewel of this island is the Wellness Center with a full service spa, relaxation services and a gym. Hands down, the Furaveri wellness center and staff surpass many of the 5+ star resort spas I've visited around the world. Please book with Ayu Ariani - her sound therapy sessions, facials, mindfulness techniques and massage therapies were medicine for my mind, body and soul. Her skill as an esthetician, sound healer and spa therapist was rivaled only by her genuine compassion. She cares deeply, she's a wealth of information about natural healing and stress elimination modalities; and, she is dedicated to the long term well being of all her clients (mind, body, spirit). Definitely ask about the fresh herbal teas made with ingredients grown right on Furaveri island.
