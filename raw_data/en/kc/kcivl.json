Over time, these insults can lead to fibrosis or cirrhosis. In fact, a recent [study led by Harvard](https://aasldpubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/hep.32272) estimated that a one-year increase in alcohol consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic will result in 8,000 additional deaths from alcohol-related liver disease, 18,700 cases of liver failure, and 1,000 cases of liver cancer by 2040.
