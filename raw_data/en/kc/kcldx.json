Sanofi and GSK today announce that they intend to submit data from both their booster and Phase 3 efficacy trials as the basis for regulatory applications for a COVID-19 vaccine. The public health relevance of the refrigerator temperature-stable adjuvanted protein-based Sanofi-GSK vaccine is strongly supported by the induction of robust immune responses and a favorable safety profile in multiple settings. In participants who had received a primary series of an already authorized mRNA or adenovirus vaccine, the Sanofi-GSK booster vaccine induced a significant increase in neutralizing antibodies of 18- to 30-fold across vaccine platforms and age groups. When the Sanofi-GSK vaccine was used as a two-dose primary series followed by a booster dose, neutralizing antibodies increased 84- to 153-fold compared to pre-boost levels (see Figures 1a and 1b for details). Thomas Triomphe Executive Vice President, Sanofi Vaccines \"We're very pleased with these data, which confirm our strong science and the benefits of our COVID-19 vaccine. The Sanofi-GSK vaccine demonstrates a universal ability to boost all platforms and across all ages. We also observed robust efficacy of the vaccine as a primary series in today's challenging epidemiological environment. No other global Phase 3 efficacy study has been undertaken during this period with so many variants of concern, including Omicron, and these efficacy data are similar to the recent clinical data from authorized vaccines.\" Roger Connor President of GSK Vaccines \"The evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 demonstrates the need for a variety of vaccines. Our adjuvanted protein-based vaccine candidate uses a well-established approach that has been applied widely to prevent infection with other viruses including pandemic flu. We are confident that this vaccine can play an important role as we continue to address this pandemic and prepare for the post-pandemic period.\" When used as a two-dose primary series, the Sanofi-GSK vaccine delivered robust levels of neutralizing antibodies, with GMTs reaching 3711 units. For comparison, a panel of sera from volunteers in the same age range who received two doses of an already approved and highly effective mRNA vaccine displayed a GMT of 1653 units, measured simultaneously in the same laboratory. Data from the VAT08 efficacy study showed that two doses of Sanofi-GSK vaccine generated an efficacy of 57.9% (95% confidence interval [CI, 26.5, 76.7]) against any symptomatic COVID-19 disease in the seronegative population. The Sanofi-GSK vaccine provided 100% protection (0 vs 10 cases post-dose 1, 0 vs 4 cases post-dose 2) against severe disease and hospitalizations and 75% (3 vs 11 cases) efficacy against moderate-to-severe disease in seronegative populations. While sequencing is still in progress, early data indicate 77% efficacy against any Delta variant-associated symptomatic COVID-19 disease, in line with expected vaccine effectiveness. Across both studies, the Sanofi-GSK vaccine was well-tolerated in younger and older adults with no safety concerns. The companies are in discussions with regulatory authorities, including the US FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA), and plan to submit the totality of the data generated with this vaccine candidate to support regulatory authorizations.

Geometric Mean Titers (GMT) (95% CI). To evaluate the immunogenicity of the Sanofi-GSK vaccine as a booster, human immune sera samples were tested by Monogram Biosciences [San Francisco, CA] using an FDA-approved standardized pseudovirus neutralization test (pVNT) against the D614G prototype virus. About VAT08 and VAT02 The Phase 3 trial, VAT08 is evaluating a 10\u00b5g antigen formulation of the SARS-CoV-2 adjuvanted recombinant protein-based vaccine for efficacy, immunogenicity and safety compared to a placebo. Stage one of the trial is assessing the efficacy of a vaccine formulation containing the spike protein against the original D614 (parent) virus in more than 10,000 participants >18 years of age, randomized to receive two doses of 10\u00b5g vaccine or placebo at day 1 and day 22 across sites in the US, Asia, Africa and Latin America. Enrolment recently completed for a second stage in the trial, evaluating a second bivalent formulation, including the spike protein of the B.1.351 (Beta) variant. The Phase 3 trial follows positive initial results from a Phase 2 clinical trial (VAT00002). In that trial, the COVID-19 vaccine candidate was administered to 722 adults to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of 2 doses and to identify an optimal dosing for use as a booster. Results showed strong rates of neutralizing antibody response with 95% to 100% seroconversion following a second injection in all age groups (18 to 95 years old), across all doses. Full study results for both VAT08 and VAT02 will be published later this year.
