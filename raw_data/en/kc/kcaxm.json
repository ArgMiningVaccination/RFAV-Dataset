Abstract A proportion of patients who recovered from COVID-19 have ongoing, recurrent, or new symptoms with negative nucleic acid/ antigen test results, which has become a new public health problem that needs to be concerned. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has shown its unique advantages in preventing, treating, and rehabilitating COVID-19. To further standardize clinician's clinical diagnosis and use of TCM for the treatment of common symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection following negative nucleic acid/antigen results, the front-line clinical experts were invited for discussion on the concepts, etiology, clinical manifestations of post-COVID-19 condition, and on treatment with TCM to form the consensus. Clinicians of TCM, Western medicine, or integration of both can use this consensus document for clinical practice and research purposes. Keywords: Expert consensus, Post-COVID-19 short-term condition, Traditional Chinese medicine Introduction Currently, China's COVID-19 prevention and con- trol focus has shifted from \"preventing infection\" to \"preserving health and preventing serious illness\"[1]. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has played a cru- cial role in alleviating the symptoms of patients, pre- venting the development of serious illnesses, treating seriously ill patients, and promoting rehabilitation[2]. However, clinical practice and epidemiological investi- gations have shown that many patients experience post- COVID-19 short-term symptoms after negative nucleic acid/antigen test results, such as fatigue, cough, short- ness of breath, palpitations, insomnia, muscle pain, and loss of smell or taste[3-5]. There is an urgent need to give full play to the advantages of TCM in post-COVID-19 rehabilitation. The \"Expert consensus on the use of TCM for the treatment of common symptoms of post-COVID-19 short-term condition\" was proposed by the Chinese Association of Chinese Medicine and Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine with the objective of improving standardization of relative diagnoses and treatment actions, enhancing clinical efficacy, and guiding clinical practices. This document outlines the effectiveness, safety, practicality, and accessibility of rec- ommended prescriptions and medicines. Presented in this consensus document are the con- cepts, etiology, clinical manifestations, and the use of TCM for the treatment of common symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection following negative nucleic acid/antigen results. It applies to the clinical diagnosis and treatment of patients with TCM, whose COVID-19 infection has been diagnosed as mild or medium, and can be used as a reference for the implementation of manag- ing symptoms developed by serious/critical patients after discharge from hospital. Clinicians of TCM, Western medicine, or integration of both can use this consensus document for clinical and research purposes. Concept of common symptoms of post-COVID-19 short-term condition The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in patients with mild/medium infection following a negative nucleic acid/antigen test, mainly include fatigue, shortness of breath, unproductive cough with scanty phlegm, thirst and dry throat, stomach stuffiness, poor appetite and loose stools, palpitations and insomnia, loss of smell and taste, spontaneous sweating and night sweats, drowsi- ness and forgetfulness. These symptoms occur primarily at 2 weeks to 3 months after infection. According to TCM theory, an internal struggle occurs in the body between pathogenic factors and antipatho- genic qi when epidemic toxins attack the exterior of the body. The antipathogenic qi overcomes the pathogenic factors, but the residual pathogens remain, causing dual Junhua Zhang and Bo Pang contributed equally to this work. 1 Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, China; 2 Haihe Laboratory of Modern Chinese Medicine, Tianjin, China; 3 Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China; 4 China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China * Corresponding author.

Owing to the damage to the lung and spleen and deficiency in healthy qi and yin, symptoms may include fatigue, lassitude, shortness of breath when moving, unproductive coughing with scanty phlegm, thirst, dry throat, spontaneous sweating, palpi- tations, and insomnia.
