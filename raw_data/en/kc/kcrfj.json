April 28, 2014. CAUTION: Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of licensed veterinarian. OSPHOS contains clodronate disodium, a bisphosphonate indicated for the control of clinical signs associated with navicular syndrome in horses. OSPHOS is the only FDA-approved bisphosphonate for use in horses that is labeled for intramuscular injection. In a clinical trial evaluating OSPHOS in 86 horses, lameness improved in 74.7% of horses by at least one grade 56 days after treatment. Only 9% of horses displayed clinical signs of being uncomfortable, nervous, colicky and or pawing after receiving OSPHOS. Less than 1% of horses experienced colic requiring treatment. WITH OSPHOS THE BENEFITS ARE CLEAR . . . A stride forward for Navicular Syndrome Introducing OSPHOS, the new FDA approved intramuscular bisphosphonate injection from Dechra Veterinary Products6:7/6:\u008e\u0003 \u000fJSVKYVUH[L\u0003PUQLJ[PVU\u0010 Bisphosphonate For use in horses only. Brief Summary (For Full Prescribing Information, see package insert) CAUTION: Federal (USA) law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. DESCRIPTION: Clodronate disodium is (dichloromethylene) salt and is manufactured from the tetrahydrate form. INDICATION: For the control of clinical signs associated with navicular syndrome in horses. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Horses with hypersensitivity to clodronate disodium should not receive OSPHOS. WARNINGS: Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. HUMAN WARNINGS: Not for human use. Keep this and all drugs out of the reach of children. Consult a physician in case of accidental human exposure. PRECAUTIONS: As a class, bisphosphonates may be associated with gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Sensitivity to drug associated adverse reactions varies with the individual patient. Renal and gastrointestinal adverse reactions may be associated with plasma concentrations of the drug. Bisphosphonates are excreted by the kidney; therefore, conditions causing renal impairment may increase plasma bisphosphonate concentrations resulting in an increased risk for adverse reactions. Concurrent administration of other potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be approached with caution and renal function should be monitored. Use of bisphosphonates in patients with conditions or diseases affecting renal function is not recommended. Administration of bisphosphonates has been associated with abdominal pain (colic), discomfort, and agitation in horses. Clinical signs usually occur shortly after drug administration and may be associated with alterations in intestinal motility. In horses treated with OSPHOS these clinical signs usually began within 2 hours of treatment. Horses should be monitored for at least 2 hours following administration of OSPHOS. Bisphosphonates affect plasma concentrations of some minerals and electrolytes such as calcium, magnesium and potassium, immedi - ately post-treatment, with effects lasting up to several hours. Caution should be used when administering bisphosphonates to horses with conditions affecting mineral or electrolyte homeostasis (e.g. hyper-kalemic periodic paralysis, hypocalcemia, etc.). The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in horses less than 4 years of age. The effect of bisphosphonates on the skeleton of growing horses has not been studied; however, bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast activity which impacts bone turnover and may affect bone growth. Bisphosphonates should not be used in pregnant or lactating mares, or mares intended for breeding. The safe use of OSPHOS has not been evaluated in breeding horses or pregnant or lactating mares. Bisphosphonates are incorporated into the bone matrix, from where they are gradually released over periods of months to years. The extent of bisphosphonate incorporation into adult bone, and hence, the amount available for release back into the systemic circulation, is directly related to the total dose and duration of bisphosphonate use. Bisphosphonates have been shown to cause fetal developmental abnormalities in laboratory animals. The uptake of bisphosphonates into fetal bone may be greater than into maternal bone creating a possible risk for skeletal or other abnormalities in the fetus. Many drugs, including bisphosphonates, may be excreted in milk and may be absorbed by nursing animals. Increased bone fragility has been observed in animals treated with bisphosphonates at high doses or for long periods of time. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption and decrease bone turnover which may lead to an inability to repair micro damage within the bone. In humans, atypical femur fractures have been reported in patients on long term bisphosphonate therapy; however, a causal relationship has not been established. ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most common adverse reactions reported in the eld study were clinical signs of discomfort or nervousness, colic and/or pawing.

CooneyEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / NOVEMBER 2015 III EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2016 III Ethics: Navigating your practice in light of animal health company incentives and rebates Over the last several years there has been an increase in animal health company buying programs and incentives. In addition to pricing discounts associated with volume purchases, it is common for clinics to qualify for some type of rebate/reimbursement program. Whether you get direct product price reductions up front or receive a rebate at the end of the buying period, the end result is a net reduction in the price of the products purchased. Certainly there are no ethical issues associated with clinics taking advantage of discounted pricing programs; the question arises when these programs potentially influence treatment choices that may ultimately impact the standard of care horses receive. In recent years there has been a movement by clients and the profession to reduce the impact of product sales on our income base and focus more on charging for our services and expertise. This trend is also occurring in other veterinary sectors. This is no doubt a good direction but many equine practitioners do dispense phar-maceutical and vaccine products. Because we are primarily focused on individual patient care, the use of these products is an important component in our arsenal to help maintain the health and welfare of the horse. As such, it is necessary for most practitioners to maintain some level of drug and vaccine inventory. As a comparison, it is common \u2014though not universal\u2014 for a number of veterinary consultants in the beef and dairy sectors to offer the veterinary rebates they would receive on large product purchases or prescriptions (such as antimicrobials) back to the feedlot or large dairy where the product is used. This is done so there is no appearance of a potential conflict of interest by the veter-inarian as to the influence of a company program on his or her selection of treatment products in food-producing animals. This situation does pose somewhat different cir-cumstances as compared to equine practice, as these types of food animal clients can represent thousands and thousands of animals at a single location. The products are typically shipped directly to the client with specific protocols from the consultant as to their use. The consultant does not administer the products, and he or she focuses on programs and treatment options to ensure the herd's health. The veterinarians are charging for their consulting time (services) and have little to no reliance on income from drug or vaccine sales. It is also not uncommon for some equine practitioners with large accounts to have appropriate amounts of specific products sent directly from the manufacturer or distributor to the farm, ranch or stable. This typically involves vaccines and/or anthelmintic products. With respect to prescription pharmaceuticals, it is required to have a VCPR in place and to have made a clinical diagnosis before dispensing these drugs. The decision to share product discounts or rebates with these clients is at the discretion of the veterinarian. A couple of points relevant to this discussion and taken from our membership directory and AVMA policies: r\u0001 'SPN\u0001 the AAEP Ethical and Professional Guidelines (accessible at www.aaep.org/info/guidelines): \"The ethical practice of medicine includes those remedies and treatments that have, as their short- or long-term goal, the health and welfare of the horse.\" r\u0001 'SPN\u0001UIF\u0001\"7.\"\u00011SJODJQMFT\u0001PG\u00017FUFSJOBSZ\u0001.FEJDBM\u0001 Ethics (which the AAEP has adopted and is accessible at http://tinyurl.com/avmapvme): \"The choice of treatments or animal care shall not be influenced by considerations other than the welfare of the patient, the needs of the client and the safety of the public.\" o \"The medical judgments of veterinarians should not be influenced by contracts or agreements made by their associations or societies.\" o \"A veterinarian may not accept payment of any kind, in any form, from any source, such as a pharmaceutical company or pharmacist, manu- facturer of medical appliances and devices, for prescribing or referring a patient to said source.\" By Nat Messer DVM, DABVP; Eric Peterson DVM; and Kenton Morgan DVM, DACT \"the question arises when these programs potentially influence treatment choices that may ultimately impact the standard of care horses receive.\" continued on page IVIV EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2016 This last point seems conflicting with incentive programs from pharmaceutical companies or other product suppliers, but it is not. There is no doubt that incentive programs are meant to encourage purchase of a product. They are not a payment to influence the veterinarian. The companies are passing along product cost savings associated with future sales and moving volumes of a product rather than individual units. However, it is important to be ever mindful that suppliers should not offer and veterinarians should not accept any type of payment in exchange for the preferred use of, or prescrip-tion for, a particular product. So as long as these programs\u2014and consequent product selection\u2014are agreed to up front by both parties and do not interfere with our medical judgment and treatment rec-ommendations, we are not breaching our ethical standards. Questions to consider when evaluating marketing/sales programs of approved pharmaceuticals and vaccine products (unapproved remedies and compounded products are for another discussion): r\u0001 8JMM\u0001UIF\u0001QVSDIBTF\u0001PG\u0001B\u0001QBSUJDVMBS\u0001QSPEVDU T \u0001CBTFE\u0001 upon price incentives negatively impact my ability to provide standard of care to my patients? r\u0001 8JMM\u0001UIJT\u0001QVSDIBTF\u0001OFHBUJWFMZ\u0001JNQBDU\u0001PS\u0001MJNJU\u0001UIF\u0001 choice of products I may need to provide quality care to my patients? r\u0001 %P\u0001UIFTF\u0001QSJDJOH\u0001QSPHSBNT\u0001QPUFOUJBMMZ\u0001SFGMFDU\u0001B\u0001MFTTFS\u0001 quality product(s) for my patients?

Touch Point: Electronic examination wellness form available for use with clients The examination is the cornerstone of the veterinarian-client-patient-rela-tionship. Our patient may not talk, but they can \"speak\" to us through a well-performed exam. When done properly, the examination transforms information into insight and builds trust between the owner or trainer and veterinarian. If we think of the examination solely as a clinical tool, however, we miss the opportunity to create stronger rela-tionships with our clients. Our clients value how we treat them just as much as they value our medical treatment of their horses.

Before commencing training, 50 yearling Thoroughbreds from a single training facility were evaluated. Radiographic changes in sesamoid bones were graded on a scale of 0 to 5: Changes of grades 2 -5 were considered as possibly signi cant sesamoiditis. Ultrasonographic changes in the forelimb suspensory ligament branches were graded from 0to 3, with grades 2 -3 considered as possibly signi cant. Further imaging was performed only if clinical SLBI occurred over the course of the subsequent 9 months. The prevalence of grade 2 -5 sesamoiditis in initial radiographs was 20.5% (Observer 1) and 23% (Observer 2) of all 200 sesamoid bones assessed. The prevalence of grade 2 -3 suspensory ligament branch change was 18.5% (Observer 1) and 23% (Observer 2). Once adjustments were made for interobserver differences, there was a signi cant association between grade 2 -5 sesamoiditis and grade 2 -3 suspensory ligament branch injury: 28% of sesamoids with grade 2 -5 sesamoiditis also had suspensory ligament branch change ofgrade 2 -3, compared with 4% of sesamoids considered to be normal. Eight horses developed clinical SLBI, of which 5 hadgrade 2 -5 sesamoiditis and grade 2 -3 suspensory ligament branch change at initial imaging assessment. Whenconsidered separately from each other, both grade 2 -5 sesamoiditis and grade 2 -3 suspensory ligament branch change were signi cant risk factors for subsequent SLBI. When these occurred concurrently, there was a signi cantly increased risk of clinical SLBI. These ndings suggest that there is an association between sesamoiditis and suspensory ligament branch changes. There is also a relationship between these conditions and subsequent clinical suspensory ligament branch injury, especially when these ndings occur concurrently. Incomplete fractures of the proximal phalanx In this study, Herv /C19eB r \u20acunisholz and colleagues in Switzerland aimed to characterise the con guration of incomplete proximal fractures of the proximal phalanx (P1) in horses not used for racing and compare radiographic with computed tomography (CT) ndings. Medical records of horses not used for racing diagnosed with an incomplete proximal fracture of P1 based on clinical and radiographic examination and con rmed by CT were retrieved. Radiographs and CT studies of these horses were analysed using a subjective grading system and by measuring variables that characterised fracture con guration. Twenty-four horses were included (mean age 9.5 years, mean body weight 574 kg) with 14 forelimbs and 10 hindlimbs affected. Mean duration of lameness was 8.7 weeks. Computed tomography was superior to radiography in both identifying the fracture and determining fracture size and location. On CT, the mid-sagittal plane was found to be thelocation of 92% of fractures. Mean proximodistal length of the fracture was 13 mm. Fractures were frequently not bicortical. Fractures in forelimbs were located signi cantly more dorsally than fractures in hindlimbs. In 54% of cases a distinct fracture pattern with 2 subchondral lines running parallel in close proximity to each other was identi ed. The authors concluded that incomplete proximal fractures of P1 have signi cant variation in their con gurations, especially their dorsopalmar/-plantar location. Computed tomography examination allowed clear identi cation of the fracture con gurations and was superior to radiography. Modi ed lamellar keratoplasty procedures In this study, Richard McMullen and colleagues in the USA and Germany describe a surgical modi cation surgery on standing horses under sedation. Four client-owned horses, for which the owners declined surgery under general anaesthesia, underwent standing corneal lamellar keratoplasty procedures for the treatment of deep corneal stromal abscesses. The horses were placed in stocks and sedated with detomidine. Local eyelid and retrobulbar blocks were performed to provide local analgesia and akinesia. Each horse 's head was stabilised and supported by soft pads placed on a mobile cart. Two horses each had DLEKs or PLKs performed for the treatment of deep stromal abscesses (DSA). Following the keratectomy modi cation was used to aid rapid closure of the anterior chamber immediately after removal of the abscess. Each of the 4 horses had similar cosmetic and post operative visual outcomes, compared with previously published results. Intraoperative complications were most prevalent in the rst DLEK case (i.e. focal iris and lens damage and post operative anterior chamber collapse). In the remaining 3 cases these were all but eliminated. Greater post operative corneal brosis was observed in the DLEK cases, similar to previously reported ndings. The authors concluded that both the modi ed DLEK and PLK corneal procedures may be performed as an alternative to enucleation on the standing, sedated horse, in horses with deep stromal or endothelial abscesses for which general anaesthesia is not an option. Soaked hay diets to manage EMS and obesity In this study, Caroline Argo and colleagues in the UK evaluated the use of restricted, soaked grass hay diets to promote weight loss in the management of equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) and obesity. Twelve overweight/obese horses and ponies were used to test whether feeding soaked hay at 1.25% of body mass (BM) daily as dry matter (DM) before soaking would lead to weekly target weight losses of 0.5 -1.0%. Six animals were used to evaluate the impact of nutrient-leaching on the digestibility and daily intakes of dietary energy and nutrients. Soaked hay DM was corrected in accordance with the \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd63 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2016'insoluble 'acid detergent bre (ADF) content of fresh and soaked hays. The ADF-based method was validated using a test-soaking protocol. Animals fed soaked hay for 6 weeks lost around 1% of BM weekly. The most weight loss sensitive animal lost almost 2% of BM weekly. Soaking hay did not alter DM gross energy concentrations, incurred losses of water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) and ash and increased ADF concentrations. Digestibilities of gross energy, DM, ash and WSC were unaltered but soaking increased uncorrected values for crude protein ( +12%) and ADF ( digestibility. Corrected 1% of BM daily, providing 64% of maintenance digestible energy requirements, a 23.5% increase in the intended magnitude of energy restriction. Hay soaking leached nutrients, reduced DM and DE provision and was associated with accelerated weight losses over those expected had the same level of fresh-hay been fed. The ADF-based method will allow the predictive evaluation of individual hays to direct feeding management and prevent inadvertently severe DM and energy restriction. Cheek tooth extraction In this retrospective case series, Frederik Langeneckert and colleagues in Switzerland, Germany and the UK describe the preoperative ndings and surgical technique, intraoperative difculties, and post operative complications and long-term outcome of equine cheek tooth extraction using a minimally invasive transbuccal screw extraction (MITSE) technique. Fifty-eight MITSE procedures were performed to extract cheek teeth in 54 equids (50 horses, 3 ponies, and one mule). Peri- and intraoperative dif culties, as well as short- (<1 month) and long-term ( >6 months) post operative complications were recorded. Follow-up information was obtained through telephone interviews, making speci c inquiries about nasal discharge, facial asymmetry, and ndings consistent with surgical site infection. Preoperative ndings included 50 cheek teeth with apical infections, 48 fractures, 4 neoplasia, 2 displacements, and one supernumerary tooth. Previous oral extraction attempts had failed in 55/58 (95%) animals because of cheek tooth fracture or insuf cient clinical crown for extraction with forceps. The entire targeted dental structure was successfully removed using MITSE in 47/58 (81%) procedures. However, MITSE failed to remove the entire targeted dental structure in 11/58 (19%) procedures and was followed by repulsion in 10/11 (91%). Short-term post operative complications included bleeding(4/58, 7%) and transient facial nerve paralysis (4/58, 7%). Owners were satis ed with the functional and cosmetic outcome for 40/41 (98%) animals with follow-up. The authorsconcluded that MITSE offers an alternative for cheek toothextraction in equids, where conventional oral extraction is notpossible or has failed. Overall, there was low morbidity, whichcompares favourably with invasive buccotomy or repulsiontechniques. Use of a tourniquet for IVRP This study by Albert Sole and colleagues in the USA set out todetermine whether exsanguination of the distal limb prior to intravenous limb perfusion (IVRP) increases antimicrobial concentrations IVRP with amikacin sulphate on 2 occasions; once with prior distal limb exsanguination and once without. The pneumatic tourniquet was placed approximately 10 cm proximal to the accessory carpal bone and exerted a standardised amount of pressure (450 mmHg). A solution containing 2 g amikacin sulphate in 60 ml sterile saline solution was infused over a period of 1 min into the cephalic vein distal to the tourniquet and the tourniquet was left in place for 30 min after the infusion. Venous blood samples were also taken 1 min before tourniquet removal. Synovial fluid was obtained from the radiocarpal and metacarpophalangeal joints at 5 min and 24 h. Concentrations of amikacin in synovial and blood samples were determined using an immunoassay. Concentrations of amikacin sulphate in the metacarpo- phalangeal joint at 5 min were signi cantly higher in the exsanguination group than in the non-exsanguination group. This difference was no longer present at 24 h. There was no signi cant difference in the amikacin concentrations in plasma or in radiocarpal joint fluid at either time point. The authors postulate that the higher concentration of amikacin in exsanguinated limbs immediately after IVRP may be the result of decreasing the blood volume in the limb, resulting in the amikacin being less diluted by the blood and therefore reaching higher concentrations in the vasculature. This may be important when employing concentration-dependant antimicrobials such as amikacin. Emptying of the vasculature may also result in faster diffusion of antimicrobial solution andreduced risk of leakage of the solution under the tourniquet. Further study is required to determine whether these effects are also observed in horses with diseased or in flamed joints. S.

Equine 2016Editorial Equine electrocardiography revisited .Introduction The rst systematic study of the equine electrocardiogram (ECG) was published in 1913 (Norr 1913), 11 years after the rst publication describing Einthoven 's ECG methodology (Einthoven 1902) and one year after Einthoven published his description of variations in the ECG in man (Einthoven 1912). Such early adoption seems appropriate when the role played by the horse in early investigations of mammalian cardiovascular physiology is considered. From the mid-1700s, the horse was a frequent subject for invasive studies of cardiovascular physiology (Hoff et al. 1965; Nossaman et al. 2010). At the dawn of electrocardiography it is probable there was as much anticipation for the equine ECG as for its application in man. However, although one of the most important tools used by today 's equine cardiologist, the equine ECG did not have the same impact. The reasons go beyond anatomic difference. Clinical electrocardiography Clinical ECG applications can broadly be classi ed into identi cation and characterisation of disturbances of rhythm (including changes in waveform conformation and timingassociated with abnormalities of impulse conduction orgeneration) and detection of cardiac structural change(chamber load/size and muscle mass distribution). Betweenthese is the use of the ECG to localise foci of myocardialdamage (Taccardi et al. 1998). All are primarily achieved by assessing the body surface ECG. Electrodes are attached tothe skin and changes in potential difference betweenelectrodes are assessed using an ECG machine. Two or moreelectrodes used together are referred to as a 'lead ', with standardised protocols naming leads according to points of electrode attachment on the skin. The shape and size of waveforms is determined by fluctuations in the heart 's electrical activity and their relationship to electrode positionand polarity (positive or negative). Vectorcardiography and lead systems Simultaneous use of multiple different leads positionedaccording to an established protocol or a 'lead system ' reflects attempts to acquire the most accurate picture possible of the heart 's electrical activity in 4 dimensions. In protocols designed for the purpose, the approach is called vectorcardiography and the resultant ECG pattern is called a vectorcardiogram (VCG). This application is the basis of techniques used to assess chamber size and load and to localise pathology, although it has limitations (Chou 1975). If the reader wishes to inform themselves of the speci cs, there is an extensive literature they can consult (e.g. Darke and Holmes 1969; Man et al. 2015). Suf ce to say there is no such thing as a perfect lead system in any species. The constantly changing 3-dimensional pattern of electrical activityemanating from the heart with every cycle is too complex ever to be fully captured by electrodes positioned at the body surface, no matter how artfully arranged. The result isalways an approximation, although this does not mean the approach is entirely without merit in man. Body surface mapping (Toyosu et al. 2015), which assesses the distribution of potential difference over the skin throughout the cardiac cycle, is a useful and promising advance over multiple lead systems in man, but limitations remain (Taccardi et al. 1998; Man et al. 2015). Multiple lead systems and predictive value Multiple lead systems are widely used in human cardiology. Systematisation of patient data, frequent opportunities to relate VCG patterns to nal diagnosis and the number of patients requiring assessment allow the predictive value of speci c VCG patterns to be assessed. Aided by echocardiography, the reliability of ECG and VCG patterns as indicators of speci c diseases is understood, allowing them to be used with good judgement (Man et al. 2015). Despite this, today a de nitive diagnosis of other than rhythm change would rarely be made on the basis of a VCG alone (Chou 1975; Taccardi et al. 1998). In veterinary medicine and despite many publications, practical, procedural and nancial limitations preclude our collecting and collating similar volumes of data for horses and limit our ability to gather supporting diagnostic information. The true predictive value of equine VCG patterns has thus never been determined. There is, however, a further and more fundamental reason why such value is likely not only to be extremely low, but even nonexistent. Limitations in hoofed animals Ungulates (hoofed animals) have a particular adaptation ofthe intracardiac conduction system. This has previously been referred to as tertiary arborisation (Meyling and Ter Borg 1957), but is perhaps more accurately described in terms of conduction system extension from a primarily subendocardialdistribution, as in man, to penetration of the ventricular muscle mass almost to the epicardium and with a large number of junctions with myocytes (Oosthoek et al. 1993). Each conduction junction connects with a much smaller myocardial volume than in other animals like man and the dog, and in some instances Purkinje bres appear to transition smoothly into ventricular myocytes. This distribution facilitates a more ef cient depolarisation, but also drives multiple small wavefronts of depolarisation that tend to cancel each other out. Those that do not cancel out may still lack suf cient electrical strength to contribute to the body surface signal. Most of the equine myocardium thus depolarises silently so far as the body surface ECG is concerned (Muylle and Oyaert 1977). Generic limitations of vectorcardiography aside, therefore, the equine body surface ECG as we currently understand it contains limited information about the pattern of depolarisation. Simply put, the effort required to extract the small amount of information that might be there makes multiple lead systems of limited value in the horse and this despite many heroic attempts (some unpublished) to \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd65 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2016develop appropriate methodology (Baron et al. 1970; Holmes and Darke 1970; Grauerholz 1974). Did we learn anything we can use from studies of equine vectorcardiography in the pre-echo era? The equine VCGreveals the mean (ventricular) electrical axis in hoofedanimals to run parallel to the animal 's long axis. A lead parallel to this axis, sometimes called a base apex lead, islarge, easily differentiated from noise and it, or a variation, istoday the most popular lead for recording rhythm.Appreciation of electrical axes guides us in choosing adifferent lead if an ECG waveform is small or absent -you may nd the waveform in a lead collected at right angles. A cycle that appears mistimed but without waveform changemight reveal its different conformation in a different lead.Finally, although still often used, insights from equine VCGstudies might cause us to question the value of limb leads. The ECG, heart rate and rhythm analysis The ECG is as useful in the horse for monitoring heart rate (HR) and rhythm as it is in any other species and is particularly useful at rest or during work for monitoring the response to exercise and training. You can use custom-designed equipment to collect the signal, or adapt equipment designed for use in other species. The one recurrent issue, no matter what the device, is the quality of the electrodes and their contact with the body. If you can get this right, the rest can be pretty much plain sailing and you do not need to clip or use gel (Physick-Sheard and McGurrin 2010). There are provisos for some modern digital systems, particularly HR monitors, in which the ECG is processed through computer algorithms. It is important to validate equipment for equine use because there are many problematic features in the equine ECG. Heart rate can range from as low as 16 beats/min in a t, older aerobic athlete, to as high as 250 beats/min in a young racehorse.Mature, resting, t horses with extensive aerobic performance histories can experience sinus or AV nodal pauses as long as8-12 s, rate can change suddenly and rapidly in all horses and the T wave can be bigger and of higher frequency thanthe QRS. Algorithms need to process these signals accuratelyand at present few available devices have beenindependently validated for equine use. The only way to besure output is not in error is to perform a simultaneous ECG.This is especially an issue for use of equipment for research ortraining purposes, where the implications of error can be farreaching. We may need to take a step back when using HR and rhythm in training and research. There is some way to gobefore we fully understand the meaning of the data wecollect and we do not really know what is normal. Anarrhythmia or dysrhythmia does not have to be irregular, youwill still get a HR but will need an ECG to differentiate. Weknow we can nd rhythm disturbances in horses everywhere we look, but we do not always know what they mean(Barbesgaard et al. 2010; Physick-Sheard and McGurrin 2010; Verheyen et al. 2013). Caution and circumspection and careful attention to data quality are essential. This does notmean we stop looking, it means we have to avoid jumping toconclusions. It is a little too easy today to collect numberswithout paying adequate attention to where the numberscame from, let alone to what they actually mean. Whowould have thought that horses on the lunge or cooling outafter a routine race might exhibit potentially life-threatening rhythm disturbances, yet look normal and go on to work subsequently without problems. Heart rate variability Medical science has long known there are periodic signalsburied in the beat-to-beat variation in HR (instantaneous heart rate, IHR) and that some re flect underlying autonomic nervous system (ANS) balance (McCraty and Shaffer 2015). Autonomic nervous system tone plays a primary role in controlling HR up to about 120 beats/min in the horse. Variations in the frequency and strength of tonic discharge insympathetic and parasympathetic nerves supplying the heart can be detected by applying a range of time-domain and frequency-domain methods of analysis to the IHR time series. Such analyses have found many applications in man and are applied with progressively increasing frequency in animals, including the horse (von Borell et al. 2007). The primary signal is again the body surface ECG. This is a promising use of the equine ECG, although caution is required. Application of the technique in man is subject to some quite stringent criteria, criteria that are almost impossible to meet in horses (ESC and NASPC 1996). Analysis in the frequency domain is particularly strongly influenced by methodology, including the circumstances of data collection. Further, technical issues aside, different studies often use different criteria for identifying data regions of interest. In the face of these variations, it is dif cult to compare studies and their results -observations that support a study 's primary hypotheses do not necessarily describe what is actually going on. This is, of course, a problem in research in general. Finally, there is disturbing variation in techniques used to generate HR interval data. When adequately standardised, application of the equine ECG in HRV analysis may tell us much about underlying control mechanisms. High delity ECG An application currently under investigation in our laboratory is high delity ECG. We collect research ECG data with far higher delity than is achieved by routine equipment. Most units today are digital and sample the analogue ECG signal with relatively low resolution, both in terms of samples per second and sampling depth and tend to follow the bandpass characteristics of traditional, analogue ECG machines. These characteristics may miss important information. Sampling at high resolution reveals consistent, high frequency signals in some horses that have surprising yet clear relationships to clinical issues. A standard device would miss these signals and we would proceed in blissful ignorance. This is another new and unanticipated frontier for equine electrocardiography. Conclusion Although in some respects the equine ECG contains limited information, in others it is providing us with a progressively richer understanding. It is revealing new insights into the electrical activity of the myocardium, its conduction system and control mechanisms, increasing our knowledge concerning the role of the heart in the equine response to \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd66 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2016physical effort, new horizons in the study of arrhythmias, collapse and sudden death and potentially a previously unrecognised source of information on rhythm disturbances and their mechanisms. Global interest in performance, sudden death and equine welfare, daily advances in equipment capability, portability and computing power, falling costs and increasing availability are all opening new opportunities. The challenge is to use them appropriately, recognising what constitutes good science and walking before we run. The future for equine electrocardiography looks extremely bright !

Card Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, Western College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada; andPrairie Diagnostic Friesian colt died suddenly and a physical examination the morning the foal died showed no abnormalities and serum IgG levels >8.0 g/l. Necropsy examination revealed haemopericardium and 2 cmtransverse tear at the root of the aorta. The foal was also found to have Chlamydophila spp. in the epithelium and Balantidium coli on the mucosal surface of the large colon. An aortic rupture is a novel nding in a foal, colonic Chlamydiosis has not been previously reported in horses and Balantidium coli has not been reported in equids in North America. Introduction In the general horse population, aortic rupture is considered a rare but lethal condition characterised by a tear in the aorta, often at the aortic root. However, in Friesian horses more than 40 cases of spontaneous aortic rupture have been reported, with the aortic rupture site occurring at a different location, the thoracic aorta near the ligamentum arteriosum (Van der Ploeg et al. 2013). Aortic ruptures in Friesian horses occur most commonly at about4 years of age (Ploeg et al. 2013). Friesian horses that experience aortic rupture may die suddenly or have clinical signs present from days to months (Van der Linde-Sipman et al. 1985; Ploeg et al. 2013). The clinical signs associated with aortic rupture in other horse breeds include heart failure,sudden unexplained death and death associated withphysical exertion such as racing or breeding activity installions (Rooney et al. 1967; Sleeper et al. 2001; Lyle et al. 2011). Final diagnosis may be obtained through the use ofchest radiographs, echocardiography, cardiac pressure proles or post mortem examination (Sleeper et al. 2001). Chlamydia/Chlamydophila has been associated with a variety of clinical diseases such as conjunctivitis, rhinitis(Gaede et al. 2010), pulmonary disease (Renhold and Sachse 2008; Theegarten et al. 2008), polyarthritis (McChesney et al. 1974), hepatitis, encephalitis (Loizelier et al. 1979) and abortion in horses (Szeredi et al. 2005; Thein 2012). Chlamydia/Chlamydophila has not been reported in the colon or intestine of horses. Balantidium coli is a ciliated protozoan parasite commonly reported as a commensal organism in the largecolon of man, nonhuman primates, rodents and pigs (Nilles-Bije and Rivera 2010). and less commonly in othermammalian hosts such as sheep, goats (Jamil et al. 2015), cattle (Bilal et al. 2009), buffalo (Sengar and Singh 2006),dogs (Jani et al. 1995), camels (Fouda and Al-Mujalii 2007), coyotes (Grigione et al. Achuthan 1988; Al-Khafaji and Al-Saad 1996; Headley et al. 2008), donkeys (Khan et al. 2013) and mules (Alani et al. 1992). It is usually nonpathogenic but under certain conditions, particularly when associated with other infections, Balantidium coli may become an opportunistic pathogen (Headley et al. 2008; Thompson and Smith 2011). In this report, 3 unique features are described; aortic rupture in a young colt, the presence of Chlamydia/ Chlamydophila and Balantidium coli in the large colon of a horse in North America. Clinical history A 24-day-old, purebred, Friesian colt weighing approximately70 kg (154 lb), which had an uneventful foaling and nursed well at birth, was presented to the Western College of Veterinary Medicine (WCVM) along with his dam who was being managed for a cooled, transported, semen breeding. The foal was examined at 08.30 h and temperature, pulse and respiratory rate were 38.5 \u00b0C, 100 beats/min and 44 breaths/min, respectively. Palpation of the foal 's joints and umbilicus showed they were within normal limits. He was passing normal faeces and was vigorous when blood was drawn at 10.30 h in the morning for a commercial semi- quantitative enzyme immunoassay for immunoglobulin G (IgG) (SNAP Foal) 1, which was >8.0 g/l. The colt was housed outdoors with his dam in a paddock containing a 3-sided shelter and was alive at 12.00 h. Following a thunderstorm at 13.30 h in the afternoon, the colt was found dead in leftlateral recumbency with no sign of a struggle. Post mortem examination was carried out within 2 h of death at the necropsy facility of Prairie Diagnostic Services Inc. (Saskatoon, Canada). Materials and methods Histological studies For histopathological examination, samples of the aorta at the site of rupture and a normal area, heart, lung, kidney, spleen, brain, oesophagus, duodenum, jejunum, 2 sections of the large colon and brain were xed in 10% buffered formalin for histopathology. Fixed tissues were processed routinely by paraf n embedding, sectioned at 5 lm and stained using haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) using an automated slide stainer. Additional 5 lm sections of the large colon were stained with Gram 's stain and Macchiavello 's Rickettsia stain. \u00a92015 EVJ for Chlamydia/Chlamydophila spp., was performed on 5 lm sections of the large colon using a technique adapted for an automated slide stainer (Code-On Histomatic stainer)2as previously described (Haines and Chelack 1991). XIV3digestion was used for epitope retrieval and the monoclonal primary antibody (Mouse anti-Chlamydia)4was used at 1:5000 and 1:10,000 dilutions. Binding of the primary antibody was detected using biotinylated horse anti-mouse Polymerase reaction A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting a conserved region of the 16S RNA gene of Chlamydia spp. and Chlamydophila spp. was performed on tissue from the large colon at Prairie Diagnostic Services Inc. The following primer set was used for the reaction: AAACGACCGCTAATACCG AATGTG, and GCTGCTGGCACGGAGTTAG. The PCR reactionincluded 40 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 20 s, 58 \u00b0C for 30 s and 72 \u00b0C for 60 s to amplify a 381 base pair product. The reaction product was visualised by electrophoresis. Positive product was puried and sequenced by Macrogen Inc., Seoul, Korea. 7 Results At necropsy, the foal was found to be in early rigor mortis without any external lesions and the corneas were clear. A severe haemopericardium was found, associated with a transverse rupture at the aortic root opposite the pulmonary artery, 1.5 cm from the outlet of the aorta and approximately 4.5 cm away from the closed ductus arteriosus ( Fig 1 ). On histopathological examination, in the aorta there was extensive haemorrhage in ltrating between the collagenlayers in the inner half of the tunica media and an accumulation of brin and neutrophils in a laminar pattern (i.e. thrombus) at the rupture site were observed. In the large colon, multifocal areas were seen where the luminal epithelial cells had sloughed into the lumen and mixed with a moderate amount of mucus along with small numbers of inflammatory cells in a laminar pattern. In the colonic mucosa the cytoplasm of some epithelial cells located in the interior of the glands was expanded by numerous basophilic, coccoid, intracytoplasmic organisms which displaced the nuclei. The intracytoplasmic coccoid organisms in the epithelium of the large colon were Gram-negative and stained positively by Macchiavello 's Rickettsia stain ( Fig 2a ). Macchiavello 's stain is to assist in the identi cation of Chamydiophila spp. In addition, small numbers of flagellate protozoal organisms were associated with the mucosal surface of the large colon, morphologically consistent with trophozoites of Balantidium coli. The trophozoites were large (30 -150lm long), spherical to pear-shaped with rows of cilia on the external surface and contained one large macronucleus, an adjacent small micronucleus, contractile vacuoles Chlamydophila psittaci . Further differentiation between these 3 species was not possible by the methods employed. Discussion In the present case, the cause of death in a 24-day-old colt,which died suddenly following a thunderstorm, was severe haemopericardium arising from a transverse aortic rupture which caused cardiac tamponade. In addition, the presence Fig 1: Dorsoventral view of an aortic rupture in the heart of a 24-day-old Friesian colt. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd69 / FEBRUARY 2016ofChlamydia/Chlamydophila and Balantidium coli in the large intestine were considered incidental ndings. Peracute death without visible signs of physical trauma or prior clinical signs of illness is unusual in 24-day-old foals and due to theaforementioned thunderstorm, electrocution by lightning strike was considered as a differential diagnosis. Aortic rupture is often described anatomically in the general horse population at the aortic root due to a tear or aneurysm of the right coronary sinus (sinus of Valsalva) (Rooney et al. 1967; Rooney 1979; Sleeper et al. 2001). The aortic root may rupture into the right atrium, right ventricle, interventricular septum, pericardial space or cause dissecting aneurysms (Bonagura and Reef 2004). The causes of aortic rupture may include congenital cardiac abnormalities (Ploeg et al. 2013), acquired cardiovascular disease (Shirai et al. 1999; Sleeper et al. 2001), physical exertion such as racing or breeding activity in stallions (Rooney et al. 1967; Sleeper et al. 2001; Lyle et al. 2011), trauma (Sarin et al. 2005), damage due to infectious agents (Okamoto et al. 2007) and possibly genetic factors (Van der Linde-Sipman et al. 1985; Milewicz et al. 1996; Johnson et al. 2007; Ploeg et al. 2013). Congenital cardiac abnormalities while hypothetically possible, have not been conclusively associated with aortic rupture in horses (Rooney and Franks 1964). Acquired cardiac disease includes cardiac failure and dystrophic changes of the media of the aorta and degeneration, fragmentation and calci cation of the elastic bres of the aorta 1999; Bonagura 2004). Aortic root ruptures associated with physical exertion have been reported in asymptomatic young racehorses (Sleeper et al. 2001; Johnson et al. 2007; Lyle et al. 2011), pleasure horses (Sleeper et al. 2001) and older breeding stallions following coitus (Rooney et al. 1967). A study regarding the causes of sudden death in young racehorses found that only 1% of death losses were attributed to aortic rupture, with a few deaths (5%) attributed to observed structural problems of the heart but that 25% of horses had histological cardiac lesions (Lyle et al. 2011). In stallions, aortic rupture has been attributed to heart disease and/or hypertension associated with breeding (Rooney et al. 1967). In other horses the predisposition for aortic root tears has been attributed to several different factors including the mechanical forces exerted by the recoil of blood after closure of the aortic valve that forces the heart downward while the aorta is held rmly in place by its attachments to the thoracic vertebrae, placing a large degree of tension on the aortic root (Rooney et al. 1967). Furthermore, tension becomes exaggerated with increased excitement and raised blood pressure, that may occur with exercise or breeding, which increases the vulnerability of the aorta (Rooney et al. 1967). In the case of this foal, the severe thunderstorm may have caused arousal and excitement leading to an elevation in blood pressure, which in turn may have been a factor in the foal 's death. In man, traumatic blunt aortic injuries (BAI) such as following rapid decelerations associated with a motor vehicle accident or thoracic injury associated with being kicked by a horse, have been reported to cause aortic rupture (Sarin et al. 2005). It may be speculated that the foal may have experienced a thoracic injury from a kick or running at high speed into a fence, where the decelerating force or chest compression may have caused ruptured of the aorta. The site of rupture following BAI in man is typically near the ligamentum arteriosum which has been shown to bestructurally weaker than the rest of the aorta (Lundevall 1964). It was noted that there was no sign of trauma at post mortem a) b) Fig 2: The large colon of a 24-day-old Friesian colt. a) Organisms with intracellular Chlamydophila .

Ciliated, oval organisms (arrows) on the mucosal surface are consistent 2016of the foal, making this cause of aortic rupture less likely; however, evidence of external trauma may not always be present in these cases. Infectious causes associated with aortic rupture in horses include invasive aspergillosis of the aorta resulting in an aneurysm (Okamoto et al. 2007). Genetic factors in man associated with aortic rupture include mutations in the Fibrillin-1 gene (Marfan syndrome), Ehrlers-Danlos collagen connective tissue defect and Loeys-Dietz syndrome caused by heterozygous mutations in genes encoding the types 1 or 2transforming growth factor beta receptor (Johnson et al. 2007). In Friesian horses, aortic rupture has been described as occurring consistently near the ligamentum arteriosum rather than the aortic root (Ploeg et al. 2013) and present with different morphological appearances post mortem . These include a circumferential cuff of blood around the aorta, formed by leakage of blood out of the rupture site and into the connective tissue surrounding the aorta or pulmonary artery, an aorto-pulmonary stula and an acute aortic tear with haemothorax (Van der Linde-Sipman et al. 1985; Ploeg et al. 2015). In the Friesian foal in this article, the aortic rupture site was near the root of the aorta and it is unknown if this was due to the young age of this foal such as immature connective tissue, predisposing genetic factors or due to a different aetiology . In Friesians, aortic ruptures occur at an average age of 4 years, varying from yearlings to 20 years of age (Ploeget al. 2013). It is noteworthy that the colt in this report was 24- days-old. The affected horses appear healthy at birth and clinical signs may or may not appear until days to months prior to the rupture (Ploeg et al. 2013). The size of the tear and presence or absence of aorto-pulmonary stulation is related to the clinical signs exhibited by affected Friesian horses. The clinical signs related to gross post mortem ndings in Friesian horses that experienced aortic tears have been reported as 3 scenarios: (i) an acute form represented by 20% of the cases that resulted in sudden death without premonitory clinical signs. (ii) A subacute semi-stable form that represented 40% of cases often related to intermittent signs including colic, epistaxis, chronic productive cough, shifting leg lameness or joint effusion, waxing and waning brisket oedema, fever of unknown origin or sudden onset of poor performance, increase in docility, increased resting heart rate, jugular pulse, pale mucus membranes and death. (iii) A stable form representing 40% of cases characterised by cardiac failure weeks to months later (Ploeg et al. 2013, 2015). Regardless of the clinical manifestations, the tear either causes subsequent cardiac failure or becomes fatal and a denitive diagnosis of the condition requires localisation of the lesion during echocardiography, cardiac catheterisation and pulmonary artery pressure measurement or post mortem investigation (Sleeper et al. 2001; Ploeg et al. 2013). Histological ndings in a group of Friesian horses with acute aortic rupture included presence of brin in the haematoma, predominantly neutrophilic in ltration around the lesion and patchy necrosis of the aortic media (Ploeg et al. 2015). The unique location of the tear near the ligamentum arteriosum in the Friesian breed has resulted in separate explanations, including underlying lesions in the vasa vasorumand ischaemic damage due to tension of the ligamentum (Van der Linde-Sipman et al. 1985; Ploeg et al.2013). It was also hypothesised that the merging of brous ligamentum arteriosum tissue with the vascular tissue may create an area of structural weakness (Ploeg et al. 2015) similar to man (Lundevall 1964). Aortic ruptures may also be attributed to frailty of the aortic wall at the rupture site, as a study performed on 20 affected Friesians revealed focally extensive laminar medial necrosis in this area (Van der Linde- Sipman et al. 1985; Ploeg et al. 2015). Causes of medial necrosis of the aorta include connective tissue abnormalities, which in man are related to gene dysfunction (Van der Linde-Sipman et al. 1985). A combination of these hypotheses with a genetic defect that affects the elastin or collagen in the aortic media may be the underlying cause of aortic rupture within the Friesian breed, which is known for challenges related to inbreeding (Ploeg et al. 2015). The presence of Chlamydia/Chlamydophila in the epithelium of the large colon is another interesting nding. Theegarten et al. (2008) reported that Chlamydia/ Chlamydophila was present in the lungs of both clinically healthy horses and horses with recurrent airway obstruction. The colt in this case was afebrile and had no clinical evidence of disease. To our knowledge, Chlamydia/ Chlamydophila has not been reported in the colon or intestine of horses but may be an important nding regarding the disease ecology. In a survey of microbial isolates of horses in western Canada, Chlamydia/Chlamydophila was not reported (Clark et al. 2010). However, Chlamydia/ Chlamydophila has been reported to be shed through faeces in cattle (Kauffold et al. 2007) and faecal shedding has been considered to be one of the most important routes of transmission (Kauffold et al. 2014). However, there is a lack of information regarding the large colon colonisation of these organisms in horses or other species. To the authors 'knowledge, Balantidium coli, associated with the mucosal surface of the large colon of a horse, is described here for the rst time in North America. Recent reports showed that 18% of Pakistani donkeys and 35% of mules shed the parasite in environments where infection was believed to be associated with contaminated drinking water (Alani et al. 1992; Khan et al. 2013). Balantidium coli is usually nonpathogenic but when associated with other infections could become an opportunistic pathogen (Thompson and Smith 2011). Factors reported to predispose to a pathogenic infection with Balantidium coli in man include nutritional status, parasite load, alcoholism or any chronic disease that results in immunocompromise (Schuster and Ramirez-Avila 2008). Balantidiasis has been reported in a 15-year-old Finnish horse that presented for colic and had haemorrhagic, eosinophilic colitis (Headley et al. 2008). In the present study, the premises on which this colt was raised had no horses with clinical signs of enteric disease at the time of presentation. The colt 's environment would have allowed contact with domestic animals such as dogs and cats and wildlife, which all had access to a natural water source (slough). The source of the Balantidium coli was most likely environmental in this colt. In conclusion, this case is unique for a number of reasons. It is the youngest age reported for an aortic rupture in a Friesian horse, the rupture was at the aortic root which is an unusual location for the breed and the colt appeared to be an asymptomatic carrier of both Balantidium coli and Chlamydia/Chlamydophila within the large colon, neither of which have been previously reported in horses in North America. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd71 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2016Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

Saey Department of Pathology, Bacteriology and Avian Medicine, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Corresponding author email: Veronique.saey@ugent.be aortic rupture horse, several genetic conditions including dwar sm, hydrocephalus and also aortic rupture have been recognised because of their high inbreeding rate (Boerma et al. 2012). Aortic rupture usually occurs in adult Friesian horses, is always fatal and has a prevalence of about2% (Van Vliet and Back 2006). Consequently, it poses a realthreat for this breed of horse. Occasionally, acute tearing ofthe aorta has been described in Friesian horses but in smallernumbers compared to subacute and chronic cases (Ploeget al. 2013). It is at present unclear if this is due to underreporting of acute cases as Friesians with an acuteaortic rupture usually collapse without any previous symptomsand thus these patients are less likely to arrive in the hospitalfor clinical examination. Aortic rupture in Friesian horses is typically located close to the ligamentum arteriosum Botalli. Medial necrosis, smooth muscle cell hypertrophy, elastin and mucoid accumulation are present in Friesians with aortic rupture, even in acute cases (Ploeg et al. 2015). In the report by Diel de Amorim et al. (2016), the very young age of the foal, the atypical location and absence of typical histologicalhallmarks are unusual. A connective tissue defect seems thusless likely in this case. Thunderstorm-associated stress couldhave resulted in hypertension and eventually aortic rupture inthis foal. Friesian horses with aortic rupture sometimes have ahistory of acute collapse during physical exertion and thusmost likely an elevated blood pressure, as suspected also inthis foal. It is thus surprising that the aortic rupture in thispurebred Friesian foal was not at the same typical location. Itis worth mentioning that the rupture in this foal did occuropposite to the pulmonary artery which is also typically seenin affected Friesian horses as the aortic rupture is oftenassociated with stulation into the nearby pulmonary artery. It is possible that the anatomy of the cardiovascular systemshows small differences between foals and adult horseswhich could result in different wall stresses and locations oftearing. The very young age of the foal is remarkable as the youngest reported Friesian horse with aortic rupture so far wasa 1-year-old (Ploeg et al. 2013, 2015). Cases of aortic rupture in very young Friesian foals have been mentioned indiscussions with owners and veterinarians; however, this is therst reported case with necropsy ndings and illustrations. It is disappointing that the illustration in this case report did not give more insight into the exact location and con guration of this atypical rupture. In cases with a suspicion of aortic rupture, adaptations of the standard incision techniques of the cardiovascular system are used at necropsy as ruptures can otherwise easily be missed. Considering the patient was only 24 days old, it is very likely that aortic rupture was not suspected. At this time, more than 40 cases of aortic rupture have been reported. On examination of the pedigrees, affected animals appear to be related which empowers the suspicion of the condition being hereditary. As reported here, the foal was only 24 days old and examining the pedigree could be useful. Author 's declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION For Intra-Articular (I.A.) Use in Horses. CONTRAINDICATIONS: BetaVet\u00ae is contraindicated with hypersensitivity to betamethasone. Intra-articular injection of corticosteroids for local effect is contraindicated in the presence of septic arthritis. WARNINGS: Do not use in horses intended for human consumption. Clinical and experimental data have demonstrated that corticosteroids administered orally or parenterally to animals may induce the first stage of parturition when administered during the last trimester of pregnancy and may precipitate premature par turition followed by dystocia, fetal death, retained placenta, and metritis. Additionally, corticosteroids administered to dogs, rabbits and rodents during pregnancy have resulted in cleft palate in offspring and in other congenital anomalies including deformed forelegs, phocomelia and anasarc a. Therefore, before use of corticosteroids in pregnant animals, the possible benefits to the pregnant animal should be weighed against potential hazards to its developing embryo or fetus. Human Warnings: Not for use in humans. For use in animals only. Keep this and all medications out of the reach of children. Consult a physician in the case of accidental human exposure. PRECAUTIONS: Corticosteroids, including BetaVet \u00ae, administered intra-articularly are systemically absorbed. Do not use in horses with acute infections. Acute moderate to severe exacerbation of pain, further loss of joint motion, fever, or malaise within several days following intra-articular injection may indicate a septic process. Because of the anti-inflammator y action of corticosteroids, signs of infection in the treated joint may be masked. Due to the potential for exacerbation of clinical signs of laminitis, glucocorticoids should be used with caution in horses with a history of laminitis, or horses otherwise at a higher risk for laminitis. Use with caution in horses with chronic nephritis, equine pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID), and congestive heart failure. Concurrent use of other anti-inflammatory drugs, such as NSAIDs or other corticosteroids, should be approached with caution. Due to the potential for systemic exposure, concomitant use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids may increase the risk of gastrointestinal, renal, and other toxicity. Consider appropriate wash out times prior to administering additional NSAIDs or corticosteroids. ADVERSE REACTIONS: Adverse reactions reported during a field study of 239 horses of various breeds which had been administered either BetaVet \u00ae (n=119) or a saline control (n=120) at five percent (5%) and above were: acute joint effusion and/or local injection site swelling (within 2 days of injection), 15% BetaVet \u00ae and 13% saline saline control.

Depending upon their physico-chemical properties, drugs administered intra-articularly may enter the general circulation because the synovial joint cavity is in direct equilibrium with the surrounding blood supply. After the intra-articular administration of 9 mg BetaVet \u00ae in horses, there were quantifiable concentrations of betamethasone (above 1.0 ng/mL) in the plasma. EFFECTIVENESS: A negative control, randomized, masked field study provided data to evaluate the effectiveness of BetaVet \u00ae administered at 1.5 mL (9 mg betamethasone) once intra-articularly for the control of pain and inflammation associated with osteoarthritis in horses. Clinical success was defined as improvement in one lameness grade according to the AAEP lameness scoring system on Day 5 following treatment. The success rate for horses in the BetaVet \u00ae group was statistically significantly different (p=0.0061) than that in the saline group, with success rates of 75.73% and 52.52%, respectively (back-transformed from the logistic regression). ANIMAL SAFETY: A 3-week target animal safety (TAS) study was conducted to evaluate the safety of BetaVet \u00ae in mature, healthy horses. Treatment groups included a control (isotonic saline at a volume equivalent to the pound bodyweight; BetaVet\u00ae). Treatments were administered by intra-articular injection into the left middle carpal joint once every 5-days for 3 treatments. Injection site reactions were the most common observations in all treatment groups. Injection site reactions were observed within 1 hour of dosing and included swelling at the injection site, lameness/stiffness of the left front limb, and flexing the left front knee at rest. The injection site reactions ranged from slight swelling (in many horses on multiple days in all treatment groups) to excessive fluid with swelling, pain, and lameness (4x group only). Injection site reactions were observed most commonly on treatment days, and generally decreased in number and severity over subsequent days. The incidence of injection site reactions increased after the second and third injection (number of abnormalities noted on day 10 > day 5 > day 0). In the BetaVet \u00ae treated groups the number and severity of the injection site reactions were dose dependent. The 4X BetaVet\u00ae group had the highest overall incidence of and severity of injection site reactions, which included heat, swelling, pain, bleeding, and holding the limb up at rest. The control group and 4X group (which received similar injection volumes) had a similar incidence of injection site reactions; however, the severity of reactions was greater in the 4X group. Absolute neutrophils were statistically significantly higher in the BetaVet \u00ae treated groups as compared to the control group. Trends toward a decrease in lymphocytes and eosinophils, and an increase in monocytes were identified in the BetaVet \u00ae treated groups after the initial dose of BetaVet\u00ae. Individual animal values for white blood cells generally remained within the reference range. BetaVet \u00ae treated horses also had a trend toward increased blood glucose after the initial dose. Some individual animals showed mild increases in blood glucose above the reference range.

A multicentre retrospective study evaluating the medical records of horses undergoing ovariectomy for treatment of a GCT was undertaken, documenting the presenting clinicopathological features, treatment and outcome. Follow-up information was obtained by telephone questionnaire. Fifty-two mares were included. Most presented with behavioural/reproductive abnormalities, including stallion-like behaviour (50%), aggression (31%), prolonged nymphomania (19%), and persistent anoestrus (8%). Most (93%) affected ovaries had a multilocular appearance when examined ultrasonographically. Only 60% of horses with histopathologically con rmed GCTs demonstrated elevations in serum inhibin concentrations. Twenty- ve of horses had histopathologically con rmed bilateral GCTs. Ninety-four percent of horses that underwent ovariectomy were discharged from the hospital. Standing laparoscopic ovariectomies had a lower complication rate (34%) than other surgical methods. Long-term complications were uncommon (11%). In conclusion, histopathologically conrmed GCTs can occur in the presence of normal serum inhibin concentrations. The high prevalence of bilateral GCTsindicates that thorough evaluation of the contralateral ovary is necessary. Surgical ovariectomy for treatment of GCTs has favourable short- and long-term outcomes. Standing laparoscopic ovariectomy may be associated with a lower complication rate than other surgical methods. Introduction Granulosa cell tumour (GCT) is reported to be the most common ovarian neoplasm in the mare (Meagher et al. 1977; Bosu et al. 1982; McCue 1998) and represents all and Alden are classi ed as sex-cord stromal tumours as they are derived from, orhistologically resemble, the normal cellular constituents of theendocrine apparatus of the ovary (McCue 1998). They consistof irregular accumulations of granulosa cells by asupporting stroma of spindle imparting a distinctresemblance to disorganised attempts at follicle formation(Kennedy and Miller 1993; Kennedy et al. 1998). In some,theca cells may also be present, giving rise to the designation granulosa-theca cell tumour (Kennedy and Miller 1993; Kennedy et al. 1998). Most affected mares with GCTs have been reported to have unilateral disease and present clinically with behavioural changes (Meagher et al. 1977; Stabenfeldt et al. 1979; Hughes et al. 1980; Perino and Didier 1985); it is suggested that a tentative diagnosis can be made by identifying unilateral ovarian enlargement, usually with atrophy of the contralateral ovary. However, the presence of a GCT with a functional contralateral ovary has been reported (McCue et al. 1991). As the tumours are hormonally active, hormonal imbalances may be identi ed, including low serum progesterone concentrations, and high serum testosterone (40 -67% cases) and inhibin concentrations (Stabenfeldt et 1979; McCue 1992, 1993; Bailey et al. 2002; McCue et al. 2006). Measurement of serum oestrogen concentration is considered unreliable for diagnosis (Stabenfeldt et al. 1979). Recently, anti- M\u20acullerian hormone has been reported as a diagnostic marker for GCT (Ball et al. 2008, 2013). Surgical removal is regarded as the treatment of choice for GCTs (Fessler and Brobst al. 2002; Hubert et al. 2006; McCue et al. 2006). This has been reported via a colpotomy (Colbern and Reagan 1987), flank, paramedian or ventral and Bathe 1993; Hanson Embertson 2006), or via flank laparoscopy (Lee and Hendrickson 2008). Previous clinical observations of the authors suggested that bilateral GCTs may be encountered more frequently than previously reported, and that many mares with con rmed GCTs present with normal serum steroid hormone concentrations. The aims of this study were to evaluate the presenting clinicopathological features, treatment and outcome in a group of mares that underwent surgical removal of a GCT. Materials and methods Medical records from Bell Equine Veterinary Clinic, the University of Georgia and the University of Glasgow were searched for horses that were presumptively diagnosed and treated for GCTs between 2005 and 2010. Horses were considered eligible for inclusion in the study if they demonstrated 2 or 3 of the following 3 criteria: behavioural \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd75 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE 2016changes consistent with the presence of a GCT (stallion-like behaviour, masculinisation, aggression, anoestrus, irregular or prolonged oestrus) (Meagher et al. Hughes et al. 1980; Perino and Didier 1985; McCue et al. 2006), at least one enlarged ovary (larger than 50 928933 mm) (Knottenbelt and Pascoe 1994) and histopathological abnormalities consistent with GCT (Kennedy and Miller 1993; Ellenberger et al. 2007). The clinical decision to perform ovariectomy in all cases was based on the presence of enlargement of one or both ovaries, coupled with clinical signs consistent with GCT. Details recorded from the medical records included the age, breed, duration and nature of clinical signs of the affected horses. Diagnostic information recorded regarding the affected ovary included the size, ultrasonographic appearance (ultrasonography performed per rectum ) and results of hormone assays. Serum concentrations of testosterone, progesterone and inhibin were estimated by radioimmunoassays. The surgical treatment utilised to remove the affected ovary or ovaries was recorded; this was determined by the surgeon 's preference depending on expertise, instrumentation available, size and temperament of the horse, and size of the affected ovary(ies). Any clinically relevant intraoperative ndings or complications, and post operative complications during hospitalisation (short-term complications) were also recorded. Results of available histopathological examination of the ovaries were summarised; no attempt was made to distinguish between GCT and granulosa-theca cell tumour. Atelephone questionnaire was performed a minimum of one year post operatively to establish any long-term complications of the procedure and the duration of return to normal behaviour, reproductive cyclicity and fertility where applicable. Continuous data are reported as mean /C6s.d. Student t tests were used to compare serum testosterone concentrations in horses with and without stallion-like and/or aggressive behaviour, ovarian volume in horses with normal and elevated serum inhibin concentrations, and ovarian volume in horses with and without incisional complications. A P value of <0.05 was considered signi cant. Results There were 52 horses with a mean /C6s.d. age of 11 /C65 years in the study. These included 27% (14/52) Thoroughbreds or Thoroughbred the breed was not recorded in 2% (1/52) horses. Of the 52 horses, only 7 (13%) were used for breeding; the others were pleasure/riding horses. Affected horses demonstrated a variety of clinical signs (Supplementary item 1 ) including stallion-like behaviour in 50% (26/52), 8 /C610 months prior to ovariectomy. GCTs were diagnosed in the absence of behavioural/reproductive abnormalities in 10% (5/52) horses and no presenting information was recorded in 4% (2/52) horses. Other recorded clinical problems included riding problems, stiffness, exercise intolerance, colic, infertility, irregular oestrus cycles, ventral oedema, haemoabdomen and peritonitis the left ovary was performed in 40% (21/ 52) horses, the right ovary in 33% (17/52) horses and bilaterally in 27% (14/52) horses. In 12 of 14 (86%) horses undergoing bilateral ovariectomy, the surgery was performed simultaneously due to suspicion of bilateral disease (i.e. bilaterally enlarged ovaries), whereas in 2 of 14 (14%) horses, bilateral ovariectomy was staggered by 9 months and 2 years due to development of new clinical signs and enlargement of the contralateral ovary following aprevious unilateral ovariectomy. Bilateral GCTs were con rmed by gross and histological examination in 13 of 14 (95%) horses undergoing bilateral ovariectomy, comprising 2 horses that underwent staggered ovariectomy and 11 of 12 horses that underwent simultaneous bilateral ovariectomy (Figs 1 and 2). In one horse, histological con rmation of bilateral disease was not established (histopathological changes indicative of GCT were only identi ed in one of the ovaries; the other ovary had the gross appearance of a GCT but histological examination of a tissue sample from it appeared normal). All affected ovaries were enlarged compared with normal reference values, with the largest recorded at 8161 cm 3(895/C61709 cm3). Of 59 affected ovaries examined ultrasonographically, 54 (93%) had a multiloculated or heterogeneous appearance, whilst 5 (7%) were mainly homogeneous with focal or peripheral cystic areas. The ultrasonographic appearance was con rmed by gross pathological examination of the ovaries following surgical removal in all 59 cases ( Figs 3 -6). a) b) Fig 1: Bilateral granulosa cell tumours, Case 47. \u00a92015 EVJ / FEBRUARY 2016Where serum testosterone concentration was measured, it was above the reference range of the diagnostic laboratory in 35% (7/20) horses (0.56 /C60.66 nmol/l); of the 16 horses demonstrating stallion like and/or aggressive behaviour in which serum testosterone concentration was measured, there were 38% (6/16) with testosterone concentration above the reference values, whereas of the 4 horses with no stallion-like and/or aggressive behaviour, only one (25%) had testosterone concentrations above the normal reference values. There was no statistical difference in testosterone concentrations in horses that either demonstrated or did not demonstrate stallion-like and/or aggressive behaviour (P =0.621). In horses where serum inhibin concentration was measured, it was higher than the normal laboratory reference range in 64% (14/22) horses (1.36/C61.69 ng/ml). Of those horses inhibin concentrations >0.7 ng/ml. There was no statistical difference in ovarian volume in horses with seruminhibin concentrations 0.7 ng/ml (973 /C61044 cm 3) were recorded in 8 cases ( Supplementary item 2 ), in 7 (88%) of which serum progesterone concentration was <3.0 ng/ml. Seventy-three percent (38/52) of horses underwent surgical removal of the affected ovary or ovaries via a standing laparoscopic procedure (27 unilateral [including one horse that underwent 2 staggered laparoscopic procedures] and 11 bilateral). The remaining horses underwent ovariectomy under general anaesthesia; 15% (8/ 52) horses underwent a paramedian laparotomy (all unilateral [including one horse that had previously had a unilateral ovariectomy]), 10% (5/52) underwent a ventral midline approach (4 unilateral and one bilateral) and 2% (1/52) underwent a flank approach (unilateral). Rupture of the ovarian capsule was identi ed laparoscopically in one horse that had a history of haemoabdomen. A large haematoma was identi ed on the cut section of the ovary following surgical removal ( Fig 7 ). Complications (which occurred alone or in combination) prior to discharge from the hospital were recorded in 40% Fig 2: Bilateral granulosa cell tumours, Case 50.

Fig 5: Granulosa cell tumour, Case horses ( Supplementary item 1 (17%, 9/52; swelling, discharge/ incisional infection, seroma, wound breakdown), mild post operative colic that resolved with medical management and supportive care (6%, colitis (4%, 2/52). There was no statistical difference between the volume of the ovary removed and the presence (1659 /C62691 cm3)o r absence (969 /C61696 cm3) of incisional complications (P=0.360). Other complications that occurred in only one horse each included inappetance, small intestinal volvulus,pneumothorax, myopathy/myelomalacia and facial nerveparalysis. Overall, 94% (49/52) of horses were discharged afterovariectomy. Death or euthanasia was attributed to colitisand its consequences (i.e. endotoxaemia and laminitis) in 4%(2/52) of horses and to post operative myopathy/myelomalacia in 2% (1/52) of horses. Of the horses developedcomplications and 3% with incisional infectionor seroma (16%, 6/38 Of the paramedian incision, 63% (5/8) developed complicationsand 13% (1/8) were subjected to euthanasia. Of the 5 ventral midline incision, of horses subjected toeuthanasia. The single horse that underwent a flank incision developed an incisional infection. Eighty-four percent (41/49) of the horses discharged were available for follow-up ( Supplementary item 1 ). Long-termcomplications oestrus in 15% (6/41) horses. Only 3% (1/29) of horses with a remaining ovary and follow-up information were noted to demonstrate clinical signs of abnormal cycling post operatively; in all the other cases, owners reported resolution of abnormal presenting behavioural and/or reproductive abnormalities in 1 week to 6 months post operatively. Five of 6 horses that had undergone unilateral ovariectomy were successfully bred post operatively; however, one of these horses resorbed the fetus in the rst breeding season but maintained the pregnancy in the second season. One mare did not conceive; this was attributed to endometritis. Histopathological con rmation of was obtained in 88% (46/52) horses. The histopathological ndings were consistent with previously de ned changes for GCTs (Kennedy and Miller 1993; Ellenberger et al. 2007) ( Fig 6b ). Histopathological examinations were not recorded in the remaining 6 horses. Discussion In accordance with previous reports, there was no breed predilection for mares with GCTs (Meagher et al. 1977; Watson 1999; Crabtree 2011). Most of the mares in this series were middle-aged (Meagher et al. 1977); however, GCTs have been reported in females of all ages, including neonates (Green et al. 1988), older foals (Hultgren et al. 1987) a) b) Fig 6: a) Granulosa cell tumour (left ovary), Case 17.

Consistent with the literature, the transrectal ultrasound appearance of GCTs in this study varied, but they most commonly (93%) had the appearance of multilocular ( 'honeycomb ') or heterogeneous masses (White and Allen 1985; Hinrichs et al. 1990; Watson 1999). The numbers of horses that demonstrated stallion-like behaviour (50%) and persistent oestrus behaviour (19%) were similar to those previously reported (46% and 22%, respectively) (Meagher et al. 1977); however, fewer horses (8%) demonstrated anoestrus than previously reported (32%) (Meagher et al. 1977). This may have been due to the ease in overlooking anoestrus in mares not used for breeding, since only 13% of the mares in the present study were broodmares. In other reports, mares have been diagnosed with GCTs in the absence of abnormal reproductive behaviour (absence of stallion-like behaviour, aggression, persistent oestrus or prolonged anoestrus) (Crabtree 2011) as was reported in 10% of cases in this series. It is possible that there may have been more mares with normal reproductive behaviour and GCTs included if histopathological examination had been performed on all cases that underwent ovariectomy during the study period; in the absence of the results of histopathological examination, horses had to demonstrate behavioural changes consistent with GCTs to be included in this study which may have therefore caused selection bias. However, these inclusion criteria were chosen to increase the speci city of case inclusion as there are many other differential diagnoses for enlarged ovaries including other ovarian tumours (teratomas (Catone et al. 2004), cystadenoma and cystadenocarcinoma al. 1989; Son et al. dysgerminoma (Chandra et al. 1998; Gehlen et al. 2006; al. 2009), thecoma (Raoo et al. 2006; Azizi et al. 2014), lymphoma (Lock and Macy 1979; Canisso et al. 2013), leiomyoma and broleiomyoma (Carstanjen 2009; Daniel et al. and (Pauwels et al. 2012)), persistent abscess and multiple (Bosu et al. 1982; Watson 1999; McCue et al. 2006). It should also be recognised that not all mares with a GCT present with an enlarged ovary on rectal examination (Daniel et al. 2015b); such cases would have been excluded from the current study. The abnormal reproductive behaviour noted in horses with GCTs has been attributed to the in fluence of steroid hormones secreted from these hormonally active tumours. The types and amounts of the different hormones secreted by individual tumours vary considerably. Aggressive and stallion-like behaviour has been associated with high circulating levels of testosterone (Stabenfeldt et al. 1979; Crabtree 2011; Daniel et al. 2015b); however, it has also been noted that testosterone secretion may be episodic (Bailey et al. 2002). The percentage of horses in this study that demonstrated high levels of circulating testosterone (35%) was similar to previous reports (40 -67%) (Meagher et al. 1977; Stabenfeldt et al. 1979) but there was no signi cant difference in serum testosterone concentrations in horsesdemonstrating normal or stallion-like behaviour. Serum inhibin concentrations have been used to aid diagnosis of GCTs and have been reported to be increasedin 87 -90% of affected mares (McCue 1992, 1998). In this study, only 60% of horses with histopathologically con rmed GCTs had increased serum inhibin concentrations. The resultsof this study therefore question the accuracy of serum inhibin estimations alone for serum inhibin increase the diagnostic accuracy (McCue 1992). Serum inhibin concentrations may be less accurate than previously reported as there may be daily fluctuation in these concentrations, as has previously been reported in testosterone concentrations in mares with GCTs (Bailey et al. 2002). Additionally, the serum inhibin concentrations may be dependent on the size of the tumour (Bailey et al. 2002; Cooke 2008). However, unlike previous studies that showed a positive correlation between inhibin concentrations and tumour mass, there was not a signi cantly different ovarian volume in horses that had normal or elevated serum inhibin concentrations in the present study (ovarian mass was not consistently recorded in this study). Anti-M \u20acullerian hormone has been recently reported as a diagnostic marker for GCT in mares (Ball et al. 2008, 2013; Almeida et al. 2011) but an assay for this hormone was not available at the time of the study. Additionally, expression of serum microRNAs appears to vary between horses with GCTs and normal ovaries, therefore quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction may be used to differentiate between normal cycling mares and mares with GCTs (Lindholm et al. 2011). Ten percent of horses in this study presented with clinical signs not associated with behavioural and/or reproductive changes, as have been reported previously. Potentialsequelae of GCTs include progressive ovarian enlargement which can cause colic or other gastrointestinal issues (Schmidt et al. 1976; Meagher et al. 1977; Nyack and Johnson 1983; Gatewood et al. 1990; van der Zaag et al. 1996), adhesions between the tumours and other intra- abdominal organs (Rambags et al. 2003), weight loss (Nyack and Johnson 1983; McCue 1998) and lameness (Meagher et al. 1977). There have also been occasional reports of more serious sequelae, including granulomatous dermatitis (Abbott et al. 2004), rupture of the small colon (Wilson et al. 1989), diabetes mellitus (McCoy 1986), haemoperitoneum (Green et al. 1988; Gatewood et al. 1990), hypertrophic osteopathy (Lavoie et al. 1992; van der Kolk et al. 1998), subcutaneous lymphoma (Henson et al. 1998), torsion of the ovarian pedicle (Sedrish et al. 1997) or rupture of the GCT causing intra- abdominal haemorrhage (Green et al. 1988; Gatewood et al. 1990; Alexander et al. 2004). These varied presentations highlight the importance of GCTs as a differential diagnosis in the absence of reproductive behavioural changes. The presence of mammary gland enlargement/mastitis has not previously been reported in association with GCT, and the reason for this clinical signs in these 2 cases in this series is uncertain. Bilateral GCTs were identi ed in 14 mares (27%), but histopathological con rmation was not achieved in one of these cases. The concurrent or nonconcurrent occurrence of bilateral GCTs in mares has been rarely reported (Turner and Manno 1983; McCoy 1986). One report documented the development of a GCT 4.5 years after the removal of the contralateral GCT-affected ovary; the mare had conceived and produced a live foal in the interim (Frederico et al. 2007). The reason for the higher prevalence of bilateral disease in this series is uncertain, but it could relate, at least partly, tothe population of horses presented to the participating clinics. Although these bilateral cases might indicate \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd79 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2016metastatic disease, there was no indication in the current cases to suggest spread of tumour to other (nonovarian) sites, and it seems more likely that they represent spontaneous tumour development in both ovaries. When reported (Meagher et al. 1977; Gift et al. 1992; Lavoie et al. 1992; Patrick et al. 2003; Abbott et al. 2004; Ellenberger et al. 2007), metastasis is normally limited to the abdominal cavity but emboli have been reported in the thoracic and sublumbar lymph nodes and the lungs (Gift et al. 1992). Recently, a mare with dangerous/aggressive behaviour associated with an elevated serum testosterone concentration but with normal-sized ovaries was reported (Daniel et al. 2015a); bilateral ovarian leiomyoma was diagnosed in this case. Although one mare recovered cyclical activity spontaneously in the contralateral ovary without any form of treatment for a GCT (Hoque et al. 2003), surgical removal of the affected ovary is the treatment of choice for mares withGCTs (McCue et al. 2006). The choice of surgical approach is generally dependent on the surgeon 's preference, equipment available, size of the ovary and size and temperament of the horse. Advantages of a standing laparoscopic approach include avoidance of general anaesthesia and its associated risks, use of a minimally invasive approach to the abdomen, improved visualisation of the surgical site, decreased morbidity and decreased convalescent time (Hubert et al. 2006). Surgical removal of the affected ovary causes a rapid decrease in serum testosterone and inhibin concentrations(Stabenfeldt et al. 1979; McCue 1992; Bailey et al. 2002) and usually results in the re-establishment of normal cyclical activity in the contralateral ovary in a reported average of 8.5 months (range 2 -16 months) (Meagher et al. 1977). There were insuf cient mares used for breeding in this study to provide information about the incidence of pregnancy andthe time between ovariectomy and conception; a previouslarger investigation reported that 30/39 mares (77%)eventually produced a live foal (Meagher et al. 1977). In this series, a higher complication rate (34%, 13/38) was recorded for horses undergoing laparoscopic ovariectomy forremoval of GCTs compared to any reason 10.8% (17/157mares) (R \u20acocken et al. 2011). This may be associated with a higher number of enlarged ovaries in this series as incisionalcomplications have been associated with increased ovariansize (Rodgerson et al. 2001). Although there was a trend for incisional complications to occur subsequent to ovariectomyof larger ovaries in this series, there was no difference in thevolume of ovaries in horses with or without incisionalcomplications. Despite the 34% complication rate and thelow numbers of ovariectomies performed using othermethods, the complication rate after laparoscopy was lowerthan after other methods, supporting its continued use. Although there were no reports of chronic post operative colic in horses in this series, this surgical procedure isassociated with a risk of intra-abdominal adhesion formation.Adhesions that manifest as infertility, chronic pelvic pain orintestinal obstruction are reported in 16 -35% of women subsequent to open or laparoscopic gynaecological surgery (Lower et al. 2000, 2004; Dubuisson et al. 2010). Open surgeries that involve the ovaries or fallopian tube arereported to have the highest risk of adhesion formation inwomen (Lower et al. 2000). Similar ndings have been reported in horses that underwent exploratory laparoscopyfor investigation of chronic colic; the ovaries were the most common location for adhesion formation in mares that had not previously undergone exploratory celiotomy (R \u20acocken et al. 2002). Additionally, it has been noted that the use of electrosurgical instruments may increase the risk of post operative adhesions (R \u20acocken et al. 2011) warranting continued follow-up studies to evaluate the long-term outcome of such cases. One potential weakness of this study is that histological con rmation of GCT was not undertaken in every case. However, in all but one ovary where GCT was suspected and histopathological examination was performed, this con rmed the presence of GCT; in this single ovary, we assume that the tissue sample did not include an area of neoplastic change. Of the 6 mares where histopathological examinations were not performed, 5 had an enlarged ovary, which appeared multilocular on ultrasonography and demonstrated stallion- like behaviour. Although histopathological examinations were not recorded in these cases, the gross appearance of the abnormal ovary in each mare was considered to be compatible with GCT. In conclusion, horses with GCTs presented with similar clinical signs and ultrasonographic ndings to those reported previously, but elevations in serum inhibin concentrations were less frequent than reported previously and there was a higher prevalence of bilateral GCTs than has been reported previously. Ovariectomy for treatment of GCT has an excellent survival rate, and, when performed unilaterally,horses resumed normal ovarian cycling and reproduced successfully. Although not devoid of complications, standing laparoscopic ovariectomies may be associated with a lower complication rate than other surgical methods.

Karl Frees & Phillip van Harreveld Infection Caused by Rhodococcus equi in Foals Neuroanatomic Diagnosis I & Lyme VaccineOriginal Article Case series evaluating the use of absorbable staples compared with metallic staples in equine ventral midline incisions A. H. Biedrzycki*and S. H. Brounts Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA; andUniversity of Wisconsin Madison, Surgical objective was to evaluate the use of subcuticular absorbable staples (SAS) and compare them with metallic staples (MS) in abdominal skin closure for equine abdominal surgery in terms of surgical site infection (SSI) reduction. Aprospective, randomised clinical trial was carried out on client owned horses presenting for abdominal surgery (n =42 horses). During surgery, horses were randomly assigned to receive either SAS or MS. Preoperative criteria recorded included age, breed and sex of horse; surgical variables included lesion type, anaesthetic, surgical and stapling times; post operative variables included an anaesthetic recovery quality score and an incisional assessment score. Mean \u00b1s.d. anaesthesia times for small intestinal surgeries between the MS and SAS (228 \u00b158.8 min, 234 \u00b138.7 min, respectively) and surgical times between MS and SAS (158 \u00b158.8 min, 174\u00b126.5 min, respectively) were not signi cantly different from each other. There was no signi cant difference in closure times for the MS and SAS (61 \u00b114.1 s, 85 \u00b135.3 s, respectively). Wound scores for the MS (median score 6) were signi cantly greater than the SAS (median score 3) until Day 14, after which there was no signi cant difference between the 2 techniques. No horses in this case seriesdeveloped a SSI. Although no SSIs were identi ed in either group, the superior wound score with the SAS together with other in vitro and clinical evaluations in other species suggest that the use of SAS may be potentially bene cial in horses. Introduction Complications can develop in the ventral midline incision in up to 40% of horses after intestinal surgery, with incisiondrainage in 32 -36% of horses, dehiscence in 3 -5% and hernia formation in 6 Klohnen and Lores 2007; Klohnen and Panizzi 2008). Surgical site infections (SSIs), one of the most common complications, can be a substantial cause of morbidity in the post surgical period in horses that have undergone abdominal surgery. The relationship between SSIs and hernia formation has been identi ed in several studies (Ingle-Fehr et al. 1997; Klohnen and Panizzi 2008). Serous or purulent incisional drainage are more likely to be associated with hernia formation than serosanguineous drainage or other incisional complications (Gibson et al. 1989; Kobluk et al. 1989). Given the implications of these complications, any potential technique to minimisepost operative SSIs would be a welcome addition in the equine industry. Furthermore, the nancial implications associated with an extended period of hospitalisation for treatment of these complications and the use of an abdominal bandage can signi cantly contribute to hospital charges (Klohnen 2009). Percutaneous metallic staples (MS) have been used in wound closure over the past 40 years due to the rapidity of application, ef cacy of tissue xation and relatively good cosmesis (Stockley and Elson 1987). However, MS share many of the disadvantages with traditional percutaneous sutures including the potential for staple track in flammation, bacterial migration into the wound bed, discomfort due to the presence of the staples and the requirements and costs associated with staple removal, which has been associated with considerable pain in man (Best et al. 1995). A previous publication noted a signi cant association between MS and increased risk for incisional complications after exploratory celiotomy in horses (Torfs et al. 2010). Of 356 horses, 303 (85%) had normal wound healing and 53 (15%) developed a surgical site infection (Torfs et al. 2010). Horses with MS were 3.9 times more likely to develop a surgical site infection than if they were closed with mono lament suture material (Torfs et al. 2010). However, both sutures and MS share a problem, in that the presence of material penetrating the skin surface can predispose wounds to developing suture tract infections. Recently, absorbable staples designed for subcuticular placement have become commercially available and have a proven track record in the human eld (Pi ~neros-Fernandez et al. 2006). The use of subcuticular absorbable staples (SAS), which are placed under the skin and not visible from the outside, have the potential to decrease many of the post operative complications associated with the incision after colic surgery. In vitro biomechanical testing of the staple material has demonstrated that the SAS have the theoreticalbiomechanical strength to provide adequate tissue approximation in the immediate post surgical period until they degrade 21 days later (Cross et al. 2009). Due to the signi cant tension and forces associated with an often energetic equine anaesthetic recovery, an in vitro assessment of the biomechanical properties of these staples speci c to the horse was conducted and they were demonstrated to be similar in biomechanical properties to metallic staples and as such, suitable for use in the horse (Biedrzycki et al. 2015). Presented at the American College of Veterinary Surgeons Annual Symposium, San Diego, 2014. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd83 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2016Thus, our purpose was to evaluate the use of the SAS in a clinical setting and compare them to the use of MS in a prospective randomised clinical trial. We aimed to evaluate any complications or the development of SSIs associated with the use of SAS in comparison to MS. As such, our hypotheses for this study were that SAS can be applied in the skin more rapidly than MS and that the use of SAS would have fewer post operative complications and a decreased risk of SSI. Materials and methods Experimental design All horses undergoing a ventral midline celiotomy during December 2011 -2012 were included in a prospective randomised trial study after written consent from the owner. Inclusion criteria included any mature horse that required an open abdominal procedure; foals were excluded from the study. All animal protocols were approved by and in accordance with the University of Wisconsin-MadisonResearch Animal Resources Center. Horses were subjected to similar perioperative antibiotic and analgesic therapy (potassium penicillin [Penicillin G Potassium] 1, 22,000 q. 12 h). Antimicrobials were given for 3 days. If deviation from thisregimen was used, the animals were excluded from thestudy. Both groups were subjected to the same antibioticprotocol. History and physical examination ndings were recorded. Surgical variables included surgical lesion, surgicaland anaesthetic duration, and stapling time. Surgicalpreparation of the ventral midline was performed in theinduction room and standardised several washesusing alcohol and chlorhexidine diacetate (Nolvasan); scrubswere performed until no further debris was detected at thesurgery site. Horses were then transported into the cleansurgery room where a nal, sterile preparation with alcohol/ chlorohexidine was performed. Once the surgical lesion wasidenti ed, horses were randomly assigned to receive either SAS or MS using a random number generator, blocking onlesions type (small intestine vs. other types including largeintestine and caecum) and requirement for enterotomy/resection (yes/no). At the end of surgery, the abdominalcontents were lavaged with several litres of 0.9% sodiumchloride solution, which was subsequently removed prior toclosure. Post operative variables included anaestheticrecovery score, and an incision assessment score.Complications were also recorded in addition to serialmacroscopic evaluations of the incision. Stapling technique Thelinea alba was closed using a simple continuous pattern with No. 3 polyglactin 910, a deep subcutaneous layer with No. 2-0 polyglactin 910 and the skin utilising the SAS or MS. In order to place the SAS, a small tunnel (approximately 5 mm in length) in the subcutaneous tissue was created at the 2 ends of the incision to permit the entry of the nose of the device and allow the ends of the incision to be safely closed. Using double Adson forceps, 5 mm of one side of the incision were initially grasped and then using the other arm, 5 mm of the other side was grasped. The skin incision was lifted up with rm traction and the nose of the stapling device was then introduced. The stapler and the Adson forceps were rmly mated and the trigger of the stapler isdepressed halfway to permit the 2 arms to pinch a portion of the skin. Once this position is encountered, the trigger of the stapler is rmly depressed to deploy the advancing needles and deposit the staple in the subcuticular tissue ( Figs 1 and 2). This procedure was then continued in rapid succession along the length of the incision. In regard to inserting the nal staple, due to space limitations, the device is reversed and gently rocked into position below the tissue plane, with the nose positioned in the previously created subcutaneous tunnel. The staple was deployed and then the stapler rocked out of the incision. The MS were placed by positioning the stapling device in the centre of the incision. This was repeated down the incision line, placing staples at 5 -7m m intervals. The time required for placing the MS or SAS was also recorded. If an inadvertent staple was placed transcutaneously, it was simply removed by grasping the base of the staple with a pair of needle drivers and pulling rmly in a caudal direction. Alternatively, if many staples have to be removed, such as during a revision surgery through the same wound, the staples can be bisected with Mayo scissors and the 2 arms readily removed individually. Post operative treatment The time required for placing the chosen method of skin closure was recorded. An antimicrobial adhesive (3M Ioban 2 antimicrobial incise drape 6650EZ)4was placed over the wound for a 24-h period post surgery and subsequently removed. Recovery was graded using a scoring system classifying the recovery with an overall score of 1 to 6 based on several different categories including overall attitude, the movement to sternal recumbency, the duration and consistency of the sternal phase, the movement to stand, the strength of standing, the number of attempts to stand, whether assistance was used (head and tail ropes), balance and coordination and knuckling. A nal recovery score of 1 indicates a smooth, calm and easy recovery in one attempt, no ataxia or mild ataxia of <5 min duration. A score of 5 indicates a dif cult recovery with disorderly efforts and unable to stand in the rst 5 attempts, with mild ataxia that can last for 20 min or more. A score of 6 indicates an accident during the recovery period. The MS were removed a) b) Fig 1: a) Example of the nose of the Insorb device being placed into the incision. b) Incision partially closed with the Insorb device \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd84 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 201610 days 'post surgery in all cases. The SAS did not require removal. Data analysis The incisions were photographed at serial time points fromventral and lateral angles at 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 21 and 30 days post surgery. Images were assessed for the presence of surgical site complications and evaluated using a scale based on the modi ed Hollander scale wound scoring system and the Southampton wound scoring system (0 -10; 0 being no oedema/redness/complications; Table 1 ) (Singer et al. 1998; Gottrup et al. 2005). SSIs were de ned using criteria previously established, such as incisional pain, discharge,purulent drainage, fever and isolation of organisms from the site (Auricht et al. 2000). Clients provided photographic images of the incision post discharge and a verbal assessment was recorded. Data were evaluated for normality using a Shapiro-Wilk test, with differences among groups separated using a one-way analysis of variance with post hoc Bonferroni adjustment. Categorical data was evaluated using Fisher exact test with signi cance set at P <0.05. If no signi cant differences were identi ed supporting our hypothesis, a post hoc power determination calculation was performed. Results Fifteen horses underwent a ventral midline celiotomy utilising the SAS and 27 with MS (41 for emergency colic surgery, one for elective ovariectomy). The horses were aged 4 -27 years and there was no difference between horses in the MS group (mean, 14.1 /C6 s.d. 6.7 years) and the SAS group (13.2/C65.8 years) and included 25 geldings and 16 mares and one stallion. The breeds of the horses were 11 Arabians, 14 Quarter Horses, 8 Thoroughbreds and 9 other breeds. There was no signi cant difference in breed or sex representation between the MS and SAS groups. For the horses presenting for abdominal surgery, the lesions identi ed during surgery involved the small intestine (13 small intestinal lipomata requiring resection and anastomoses, 9 small intestinal lesions not requiring small intestinal resection), the large colon (17 right dorsal displacements, one nonstrangulating colonic torsion), small colon (one small colon resection and anastomosis) and ovaries (one elective ovariectomy procedure). Among the SAS group, there was no signi cant difference between the anaesthesia times for small intestinal lesions with no resection and large intestinal lesions (158 /C638 min, 162/C627 min, respectively). However, both these anaesthetic times were shorter than surgery that required small intestinal resection and anastomosis (214 /C632 min, P <0.05). In terms of surgical time, there was no signi cant difference among the surgical times for large intestinal/other conditions and small intestinal surgeries without resection (108 /C626 min, 116/C649.5 min, respectively). However, both these times were signi cantly shorter than the surgical time for small intestinal resection (179 /C624.2 min, P <0.05). Among the MS group, there was no signi cant difference between anaesthesia times for small intestinal nonresectionprocedures and large intestine/other conditions (185 /C632.4, 197/C635.5 min, respectively). However, both the anaesthesia times were shorter than the small intestinal resection anaesthesia time (217 /C630.1 min, P <0.05). A similar result was identi ed among the results for surgical times for the small intestinal nonresection group, large intestine/other conditions and the small intestine with resection (123/C627.7 min, 136 /C619.7 min, 165 /C635.8 min, respectively, P<0.05). Between the 2 groups, there was no signi cant difference in the overall times for small intestinal procedures between SAS and MS (anaesthesia time, 160 /C631.1 min, 181/C630.3 min respectively, surgical time 112 /C637.5 min, 129.5/C624.2 min respectively). In addition, there was no signi cant difference between the anaesthesia or surgical times for large intestinal/other procedures between the SAS and MS group.

Four surgeons completed all the surgeries, with no signi cant difference in surgical times for any procedure among the surgeons. Although there was an initial increase in time to close with the SAS due to novelty (the rst 4 cases had a mean time of 14.3/C63.2 min), once experience was gained, there was no signi cant difference in wound closure times between the SAS and the MS (85 s /C635.3 s and 61 s /C614.1 s). All horses recovered from anaesthesia without incident (median recovery score was 3 for both MS and SAS), although in 3 cases the recovery period was prolonged (score =4) and in 5 cases a high recovery score was recorded (score =5), which was associated with horses that had anaesthesia times>200 min, compared with those with anaesthesia <200 min (P=0.05). There was no signi cant difference in recovery score between groups. There was no signi cant difference in the number of horses recovered with head and tail ropes in the SAS group (n =9) and the MS group (n =17). For the SAS at the time of the Ioban bandage removal (24 h after surgery), 13/15 horses were noted to have discharge, varying from mild to moderate, serosanguineous to haemorrhagic. Discharge resolved by 48 h post operatively in 8 horses, by 3 days in 3 horses and 2 horses had evidence of discharge up to 5 days post operatively. In all cases, the drainage resolved without incident. In all MS cases at the time of Ioban removal, some haemorrhagic discharge was noted on theIoban, but this ceased immediately and no further discharge was noted. Horses were discharged from the hospital 2-7 days post surgery. By 14 days, a thin, white line remained visible at the incision site. Photographs at 21 and 30 days demonstrated satisfactory appositional healing of the skin edges with minimal scar formation. All cases (SAS and MS) developed some degree of post operative incisional oedema formation; the amount and duration of oedema formation for the SAS (wound score 3, 2 days post surgery) was signi cantly less than the MS (wound score 6, P <0.05, Fig 3 ). Similar scores were recorded until Day14, at which time there were no signi cant differences between the wound scores for the 2 groups. At this time for both groups, only some mild swelling was macroscopically evident, which resolved by the 30-day evaluation. Four horses (3 in the MS group and one in the SAS group) developed post operative colic, identi ed by pawing and rolling (n =2) episodes, which were diagnosed ultrasonographically as post operative ileus with gastric re flux. Three cases were treated successfully with i.v. lidocaine and in the fourth case erythromycin resolved the post operative ileus. No horse in the clinical case series developed any evidence of an SSI. All wounds healed as expected. No evidence of wound edge dehiscence or staple failure was noted in any case. During follow-up contact with the owners 30 days post operatively, all reported satisfaction with the incision for both groups and associated a positive experience with the use of SAS. Discussion The clinical application of the novel SAS system for use in equine abdominal surgeries has been positive in terms of surgical use of the device and in client perception of the absorbable staples. The lack of complications and success encountered with this device, combined with several advantages described in other studies, suggest that the device could be bene cial in a clinical setting. One of the major merits of the device is that it is easy and very quick to use; once the technique was mastered, the closure times were subjectively comparable to the metallic staplers. In addition, there were no reports of complication or infections encountered and client perception of the incision and the healing of the wound were extremely positive. Although the assessment was subjective, we noted a decreased amount of ventral incisional oedema after the use of the device. Although factors such as the incision length, duration of surgery and trauma to the incisional site sustained during surgery may contribute to this, it is also possible that reduced foreign material, combined with the less rigid form of skin apposition provided by the absorbable staples in addition to the ability of the incision to drain after surgery contributed to the limitation of oedema formation. Although incisional length was not objectively measured at the time of surgery, subjectively we did not appreciate any difference between the 2 groups. As the decision for MS or SAS selection was based on criteria encountered after the incision, we donot believe bias played a role in determining incisional length. The SAS could therefore potentially play an important role in the closure of wounds in equine cases. The use of absorbable material precludes the need to remove the staples, which in terms of metallic staple removal, can be both painful to the horse and dangerous to the veterinarian. There is also no reported discomfort associated with the presence of the SAS in human patients, even in areas with delicate skin coverage under tension (Dresner and Hilger 2009). The design of the device is such to present tissue in the path of 2 needles from the nose of the device, which captures a precise bite of the subdermal tissue. A rigid U- shaped cleated staple is then deposited in the space to secure the closure. The staples are positioned in an interrupted fashion, which allows post operative drainage. Day 3 Fig 3: Representative comparison of SAS (top) and MS (bottom) in ventral midline incisions 3 days post surgery. Note there issigni cantly more oedema associated with the MS. \u00a92015 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2016However, it is important to remember to create the small subcutaneous tunnels at both ends of the incision to accommodate the nose of the stapler. In addition, it is critical that, when using a subcutaneous suture, the sutures are placed suf ciently deep in the tissue to allow free movement of the skin edges. If the subcutaneous sutures are too shallow, the nose of the instrument cannot be placed at suf cient depth to incorporate a correct and secure skin closure. Using the random number generator, we expected the distribution of cases receiving SAS and MS to be approximately 50:50. As it turns out, however, there were 1.8 times more horses receiving MS as SAS. We attribute this to be a random anomaly and had we collected more data, there would have been a more even group size distribution. A power analysis based on the infection rate identi ed between MS and skin sutures identi ed that with equal group sizes a total of 180 horses would need to be evaluated. The design of this study was to report a pilot case series. Currently there are very few studies that aim to evaluate incision infections in colic cases in a prospective fashion. In addition, as this was a prospective study, we had the bene to f evaluating wound parameters using objective criteria and recovery scores, which are often lacking in the retrospective descriptions, making our approach more powerful, limited only by our low case numbers. We did not encounter any SSIs in this small case series, due to the low numbers reported. However, we believe that there may be an added bene t to using the SAS over MS due to material composition. The polymer used in the SAS is a blend of 2 polylactic acid (PLA) and polyglycolic acid (PGA) copolymers. In 2114 bone xation procedures, PGA implants had a 4% infection rate while PLA implants were 5 times lower with a 0.7% rate (Athanasiou et al. 1998). For each polymer, however, infection rates were signi cantly lower than with metallic implants. One explanation might be that bioabsorbable materials possess unstable surfaces compared with metals because of the hydrolytic process continuously eroding their surfaces and, therefore, they do not offer a permanent residence for bacteria to colonise and replicate (Athanasiou et al. 1998). This may potentially explain the results of other studies that note an association between the use of nonbioabsorbable materials, such as MS and in increased risk for SSIs (Torfs et al. 2010). The formulation of the SAS permits the future modi cation and addition of various antibiotics or other components. Bacterial bio lms, which form a polymeric conglomeration and are a current area of research interest, are estimated to be involved in as many as 80% of infections. The potential exists for the materials, which compose the SAS to play a further role in the prevention of bio lm formation and a recent study utilising an anti-bio lm-releasing PLA/PGA product inhibited the formation of bio lms by 97 -99% (Gottrup et al. 2005; Smith and Perera 2007; Huh and Kwon 2011). In the human literature, there are several reported advantages in using the SAS over a subcuticular suture pattern or MS (Shetty et al. 2004). The speed of application has been reported to be a signi cant factor in human surgeries in addition to the elimination of the risk of needle-stick injuries (Tajirian and Goldberg 2010). Furthermore, there isless manipulation of the tissue edges with forceps, whichreduces iatrogenic damage to tissue edges during suturing.Although both the SAS and a subcuticular suture pattern result in a subcuticular closure, the end result can differ signi cantly. The interrupted nature of the SAS enables several regions of drainage between staples to be established that may reduce bacterial infections. This may have several advantages over a continuous subcuticular pattern, which results in a tight seal of the wound. The potential impact of these drainage regions resulting in increased susceptibility to ascending infection in the horse must also be considered. Although not included in this study, a subcuticular suture group could be a potential further test group for evaluation in comparison to the MS and SAS. Investigation in other animal species with SAS have supported the ndings of superior wound healing, reduced in flammatory response, and improved cosmetic appearance in comparison to dermal sutures (Fick et al. 2005). While the cost of the subcuticular stapler ( ~$60) is greater than the ( ~$20), the potential to decrease hospitalisation expenses and eliminate costs associated with incisional infections and/or herniorraphy surgery cannot be ignored. In addition, it is the authors ' opinion that the average call out cost for a veterinarian to remove metallic staples is approximately $100 -150, which does not include fees for sedation and staple removal which can add a further $100 -150. The use of the subcuticular stapler therefore has the potential of reducing costs in abdominal surgeries. However, although 30 staples are sufcient to close a 21 cm incision, we found that in most cases 2 units are required. This therefore signi cantly increases the costs of using the device. Although marketed by the manufacturer as single use, we have not identi ed any deleterious effects sterilising the device using low temperature plasma sterilisation methods (Sterrad System) 5. Ethylene oxide and autoclaves are unsuitable and result in clumping of the staples preventing their successful release from the device, or melting of the device respectively. One potential concern with the use of this device could be wound dehiscence due to the fragility of the staples. Five horses in this series encountered potentially violent recovery episodes, and 4 horses developed post operative ileus. Two of these cases were observed to roll in the post operative period. However, no adverse consequences of these events to the incision line were observed. This combined with biomechanical data provides us with evidence that the SAS are suitable even under adverse conditions. We did encounter several limitations for the use of the subcuticular stapler in vivo . The stapler cannot be used on excessively thick tissue. The normal equine ventral midline has an appropriate thickness for the stapler. However, when repeating a ventral midline incision through scar tissue or oedematous tissue, the increased thickness in these cases prevents the stapler from ring and effective tissue capture cannot be achieved. We therefore do not recommend using the subcuticular stapler in these situations. We have also attempted to use the device on limb incisions. The subcuticular stapler, however, is not able to successfully deploy the staples to engage both skin sections in these cases. We believe that this is due to lack of an adequate amount and consistency (increased brous tissue) of the subcuticular space, which is required in order to cause the slight eversion of the skin. It is imperative that the bluetriangles on the nose of the stapler are completely covered by skin in order to permit successful subcuticular placement, \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd87 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2016which is often dif cult in areas of tight skin coverage such as the limbs. There are several major limitations with this study. The low numbers evaluated have limited our ability to detect signi cant differences between the 2 groups. However, the data are presented as pilot evidence that the use of SAS is appropriate in horses and can be achieved without complication. In addition, reliance on photographic assessment of incisions may not be the optimal method to evaluate outcome. We have demonstrated that SAS can be used for skin closure after exploratory celiotomy surgeries and provides the surgeon with a rapid and cosmetic closure. The interrupted nature of the staple placement permits natural wound drainage combined with the more flexible xation of the skin surface may contribute to lower SSI rates, although, due to the low numbers in the study, this could not be ascertained.

The design and application of appropriateexercise tests are critical factors for the diagnosis of conditions affecting equine performance and it is therefore necessary for veterinary surgeons using such equipment to develop an understanding of appropriate exercise testing methods. This is the rst in a series of three papers covering exercise testing in the equine athlete, interpretation of heart rate and rhythm during exercise and interpretation of dynamic upper respiratory tract function. In this rst paper, both performance and clinical exercise testing in the equine athlete are reviewed. Introduction Exercise testing of athletes can largely be divided into two forms: performance exercise testing and clinical exercise testing. Most veterinary involvement has been with clinical exercise testing. However, the use of performance exercise tests may increase in the future as owners/trainers become more scienti c in their approach to tness and performance of their horses. To date, the majority of exercise testing of equine athletes has focused on racehorses. However, there is an increasing awareness of the need for appropriate exercise tests to be developed for other equestrian disciplines. Exercise testing of horses can be performed on a treadmill or in the eld and there are advantages and disadvantages to both. Field exercise tests enable the horseto be examined in the environment in which it normallyperforms, a key advantage over treadmill exercise testing.Furthermore, eld exercise tests enable the potential effects of rider interactions or tack modi cations to be assessed. In addition, costs tend to be lower for eld exercise tests and some tests can be integrated into training schedules, whichfacilitates acceptance from owners. The main challenges inperforming eld tests lie in the ability to truly standardise them and account for potentially confounding factors thatmay bias interpretation. Treadmill exercise tests areundertaken in a controlled environment with the potentialfor more sophisticated instruments enabling greaterprecision and accuracy in the measurement of a largernumber of physiological variables. Because of this, treadmillexercise tests remain the preferred technique for assessmentof human athletes.Performance exercise testing Performance exercise tests are typically carried out onapparently healthy individuals and provide guidance in the assessment of tness and to evaluate the training programme. This is currently used far more extensively to assess and monitor athletic performance in human athletes than for horses. In elite human athletes a programme of ongoing testing is considered essential to optimise training programme design, reduce injury or illness risk, increase career longevity and maximise sports performance (Newton et al. 2008). There are several potential applications for performance testing in horses: To compare horses, i.e. performance prediction. To monitor an individual horse serially during the season to assess response to training. To ensure the training programme is adequately preparingthe horse for racing/competition. Several studies have reported that routine training programmes (in racehorses and eventers) may be suboptimal in preparing the horse for racing/competition (Serrano et al. 2002; Kingston et al. 2006), which may predispose the horse to injury (Evans2007a). Exercise data The most simple performance test involves measuring the time required to complete a set distance. With the use of global positioning systems (GPS) technology, accurate data on average and peak speeds attained during eld exercise can easily be determined along with data on distances and inclines ( Fig 1 ) (Kingston et al. 2006). This information can be used to document exercise intensity during training and to con rm that training sessions are suf ciently strenuous in preparing the horse for competition. Maximal oxygen consumption Aerobic capacity is best assessed by calculation of maximaloxygen consumption ( _VO 2max). Determination of _VO 2max is one of the most commonly performed tests when assessing athletic performance in elite human athletes. As the competitive distance increases, _VO 2max becomes a more important predictor of performance. However, other factors are also important, particularly running economy, which influences the percentage of _VO 2max that can be sustained during prolonged exercise. In horses, _VO 2max has been shown to be correlated with speed in Thoroughbreds (Harkins et al. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd89 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 20161993) and a higher _VO 2max has been found in superior Standardbred racehorses compared with slower performing horses (Gavreau et al. 1995). Maximal oxygen consumption is calculated during an incremental exercise test. Oxygen consumption ( _VO 2) increases linearly with speed up until _VO 2max, which is de ned as the point where no further increase in _VO 2is elicited despite further increases in speed ( Fig 2 ). Oxygen consumption can be measured in horses exercising on atreadmill with an open or biased- flow system (Bayly et al. 1987; Evans and Rose 1988; Morris 1991) or breath-by-breath system (Art et al. 1990; Butler et al. 1993; Curtis et al. 2005). However, there is limited commercially available equipment that is technically suitable for the high flow and respiratory rates of the exercising horse, especially for eld use. One portable breath-by-breath gas analyser was evaluated for measurement of _VO 2of horses exercising in the eld (Art et al. 2006; Van Erck et al. 2007).

Furthermore, the mask resulted in suf cient resistance to impair ventilation during exercise, thus horses did not reach maximal exercise (Van Erck et al. 2007). More recently the use of an alternative system for measuring _VO 2during eld exercise has been described, with results comparable to those from an open- flow system (Sides et al. 2014). Heart rate The heart rate (HR) responses to exercise are covered in more detail in the second paper of this series. Measurement of HR during exercise is easy to perform and can provideinformation regarding tness and the intensity of an exercise test. When HR and velocity are measured simultaneously, graphs of this relationship can be produced which enable calculation of variables such as the speed at which maximal (HR max) is reached ( VHRmax ) and the speed at a heart rate of 200 beats/min ( V200;Fig 3 ). Although there is no correlation between maximal oxygen consumption ( _VO 2max) and HR max per se , there is a close correlation between percentage of maximal heart rate and percentage of _VO 2max (Evans and Rose 1987). VHRmax is also signi cantly correlated with _VO 2max and hence is a suitable measure of tness in cases where _VO 2cannot be measured (Evans and Rose 1987). Individuals with the greatest athletic capacity will reach HR max at the fastest speeds and a correlation has been shown between VHRmax and race earnings (Gramkow and Evans 2006). Other variables such as V200may be measured during submaximal exercise tests and are likely to be more easily measured during eld exercise testing than VHRmax . However, V200values are less useful predictors of maximal aerobic work capacity since HR maxis quite variable between individuals and hence horses may be exercising at quite different proportions of their HR maxat a set HR value. In sport horses, measurement of V140,V170orV180 may be used if HRs as high as 200 beats/min are never achieved. Repeated measurements of any of these VHR variables in the same horse can be used to demonstrate an increase in tness during a training programme (Vermeulen and Evans 2006) ( Fig 4 ). Determination of velocity and HR has traditionally required standardised stepwise exercise tests, which allow time for the HR to reach steady state at each velocity. These types of tests have been used on the treadmill and in Standardbred racehorses in the eld. However, such tests are more dif cult to apply to Thoroughbreds in the eld. Multiple speed steps are not always convenient, especially in flat 020406080100120140160180200220 02468 10 12 14Oxygen consumption ml/kg bwt/min Speed m/s Fig 2: Oxygen uptake ( _VO 2) measured using a breath-by-breath system in an elite Thoroughbred racehorse undergoing exercisetesting on a high-speed treadmill on a 10% incline.

An alternative method using paired HR and velocity measurements obtained during continuous exercise has been described by Vermeulen and Evans (2006). This method is more suitable for integration into typical 'fast ' training days in commercial Thoroughbred establishments (Fig 1 ). GPS measurements of speed and distance may not be reliable in con ned spaces, especially at faster speeds (Coutts and Duf eld 2010; Duf eldet al. 2010). Therefore, in sport horses examined in an arena, riders are asked to exercise at walk, loose trot, working trot, working canter and extended canter ( Table 1 ). This approach appears to be repeatable within the same horse as long as the rider remains the same. Lactate Lactate is a product of anaerobic muscle metabolism and itsmeasurement can provide information relating to both the horse 's aerobic and anaerobic capacity. At rest, blood lactate levels are 0.5 -1 mmol/l. During exercise, a bilinearrelationship occurs between blood lactate concentration and velocity. However, this is often represented as an exponential curve, especially when limited data points are measured (Kronfeld et al. 1995). The de flection of the lactate- velocity curve represents the start of an imbalance between lactate production and removal/metabolism. This occurs at blood lactate concentrations of 2 -4 mmol/l, leading to the frequent use of the empirical value of 4 mmol/l to de ne the onset of blood lactate or anaerobic threshold (Campbell 2011). After this speed, a more rapid increase in blood lactate concentration is observed in response to further increases in velocity as lactate production exceeds removal. Peak blood lactate concentrations are substantially higher in horses compared with human athletes and may reach levels of 25 -30 mmol/l in Thoroughbred horses after maximal exercise (Harris et al. 1987). Depending on the intensity of exercise, peak lactate levels may not occur for 5 min after cessation of exercise due to ef flux from muscle (Marlin et al. 1991). When comparing data, either between horses or within an individual on multiple occasions, it is important to be consistent with respect to the methodology and sampling location, since these can in fluence the results (Lehnhard et al. 2010). There are differences between whole blood and plasma lactate concentrations, with the plasma lactate concentration approximately 1.5 times greater than that of whole blood, although individual variation occurs due to variable uptake of lactate by red blood cells. Samples are usually taken by jugular venepuncture, into tubes containing lithium heparin or fluoride-oxalate and should be analysed within 4 h. Analysis may be performed on whole blood or plasma. Whole blood is preferable because lactate in the red blood cells is also accounted for and the technique does not require centrifugation (Evans 2000). However, if analysis is delayed beyond 4 h, plasma can be harvested and frozen for later analysis (Evans and Golland 1996). In the laboratory setting, a bench top standard analyser is considered to be the gold standard for accurate analysis of lactate concentration. In the eld, the use of a portable hand-held lactate analyser is more convenient and allows immediate analysis to be performed without the need to send samples to the laboratory. Only lactate analysers that have been validated for use in horses should be used. Some analysers have been shown to be inaccurate at high packed cell volume ( >53%) and others can lose accuracy at higher lactate values (Evans and Golland 1996; Kobayashi 2007). There are two main approaches to the assessment of blood lactate. The rst involves the calculation of the velocity at which a lactate concentration of 4 mmol/l is achieved (V La4) in order to make an assessment of the aerobic capacity and hence performance potential of an individual. In horses, most disciplines, including 'sprint 'races over ve furlongs, are predominantly aerobic in nature (Eaton et al. 1995a) and hence indicators of aerobic capacity are likely to be the most useful indicators of performance. Several studies have shown that a high VLa4value is associated with superior performance in Standardbred racehorses (Courouc /C19eet al. 1997; Leleu et al. 2005; Lindner 2010). Repeated measures of VLa4during a training program are also useful for monitoring tness (Courouc /C19e 1999). In order to ascertain VLa4, multiple samples should be taken during a standardised incremental exercise test. Values of the lactate concentration are plotted against velocity to Februarya) b) Fig 4: a and b) Speed, heart rate (HR) and lactate data obtained from a 10-year-old eventer preparing for 3 *competition. Data were recorded in February at the start of the horse 'stness preparation and again in April before the 3 *competition. The data were collected during an incremental 4 step test. Each stepis cantered over 5 furlongs ( ~1000 m) on a flat sand gallop. At the end of each step the horse was stopped for 1 min to obtain theblood sample. The results show that the tness program has resulted in a clear improvement in the HR and lactate responseto the same exercise test. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd92 EQUINE EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2016allow calculation of VLa4. Exercise tests may be performed on the treadmill or in the eld ( Figs 3 and 4). It should be noted that determination of VLa4can be affected quite substantially by the step duration (Lindner 2007). Step durations of 2 -3 min are commonly used in Standardbred and sport horses. When performed in the eld, the horse has to be stopped between each step to obtain the blood sample. As described earlier, multiple speed steps and blood samplings are not always convenient when dealing with Thoroughbred racehorses during routine training. An alternative approach in these horses is to measure the blood lactate concentration after a single bout of submaximal exercise (Davie and Evans 2000). A second approach is to use lactate measurements as a marker of anaerobic capacity. In human athletes, the use of post exercise lactate concentration has been used as an indicator of anaerobic capacity and higher peak lactate concentrations are an indicator of superior sprinting ability. Less work has been performed in horses but such indicators of anaerobic capacity may be useful for assessment of performance in horses racing over short distances (McGowan 2008). Peak lactate measurements are most commonly determined by taking a single sample following intense exercise to fatigue. Alternatively, incremental exercise tests that include intense exercise enable the measurement of VLa10 (i.e. the velocity at which a lactate concentration of 10 mmol/l is achieved), which is also reported to be an appropriate marker of anaerobic capacity (Lehnhard et al. 2010). Clinical exercise testing Clinical exercise tests are primarily used to enableinvestigations of exercise-induced disorders in horses presenting with poor performance or exercise intolerance. It should be noted that poor performance is frequently multifactorial and therefore multiple diagnostic investigations may need to be performed. Although, in this paper, exercise testing has been divided into performance exercise tests and clinical exercise tests, it is important to recognise that the physiological measurements described for performance exercise testing (particularly HR and lactate) may also provide clinically relevant information ( Fig 5 ). They are also useful for monitoring horses during the competitive season, since elevated heart rates and/or lactate concentrations during a standardised exercise test may be an indicator ofan underlying medical problem such as a cardiorespiratory disorder, lameness or another painful condition. Endoscopic assessment of the upper respiratory tract Endoscopy of the upper respiratory tract is a commonlyperformed clinical procedure during eld and treadmill exercise. It is undertaken in horses presenting with abnormal respiratory noise or as part of a complete assessment in horses with poor athletic performance. It is now widely accepted that resting endoscopy is not necessarily a reliable indicator of events occurring during exercise and that exercising endoscopy is necessary to make a de nitive diagnosis (Kannegieter and Dore 1995; Parente and Martin et 2005; Lane et al. 2006; Barakzai and Dixon 2011; Kelly et al. 2013). The differences in resting and exercising endoscopic ndings are due to the large differences in air flow rates and airway pressures that occur during exercise compared with at rest. Exercising endoscopy is described in more detail in the third paper in this series.With regards to the exercise test, the type of exercise and exercise intensity is highly in fluential in the development of dynamic upper airway obstructions (Allen et al. 2011). Thus for disciplines such as eventing and racing, the exercise test may need to be as strenuous as that required in competition/ racing in order to achieve an accurate diagnosis. For both Standardbred racehorses and sport horses the position of the head and neck and the in fluence of the rider/driver are important factors to consider (Van Erck 2011; Strand et al. 2012; Johnson et al. 2014).TABLE 1: Protocols for some published eld exercise tests Discipline Field performance exercise test protocol ReferencesThoroughbred racing 1000 m trotting at 250 m/min, galloping at 400, 460, 550 and 660 m/min for 600 -800 m eachKobayashi et al.

However, this is not widely performed in the clinical setting because oflimited availability of the technology required. Variables suchas tidal volume, breathing frequency, minute ventilation,oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, inspiratoryand expiratory times, inspiratory and expiratory flows, flow- volume loops, airway pressures and airway impedance haveall been measured during treadmill exercise. An in-depthdiscussion of these variables is beyond the scope of thisarticle and readers are directed to other texts (Evans2007b). Measurement of venous blood gases reveals little or nothing concerning gas exchange during exercise.Measurement of arterial blood gases, however, can beperformed during exercise in order to assess gas exchangeand examine the extent of hypoxaemia and hypercapnia inhorses with suspected respiratory disease. It is important todraw samples whilst the horse is exercising since rapidchanges occur once exercise has ceased (within 5 -10 s), which precludes the use of post exercise arterial blood gasesin the evaluation of gas exchange. Simultaneousmeasurement of body temperature is also necessary. The situation is complicated by the fact that normal horses become hypoxaemic and hypercapnic duringstrenuous exercise. At rest PaO 2(partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood) is approximately 100 mmHg and PaCO 2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood) isapproximately 45 mmHg. Little change in arterial blood gases occurs during walk and trot but at canter PaO 2decreases to approximately 80 -85 mmHg and during strenuous exercise may decrease to 65 -70 mmHg, whilst PaCO 2increases to 50 - 55 mmHg (Bayly et al. 1983, 1989; Butler et al. 1993). Hypoxaemia and hypercapnia are more evident in trained horses and horses with a higher _VO 2max when compared with less t or less able athletes (Christley et al. 1997; Roberts et al. 1999). It is therefore recommended that interpretation of arterial blood gas measurements should be made with caution especially in cases where concurrent measurement of_VO 2maxis not possible (Evans 2007b). Electrocardiography In addition to HR measurements, electrocardiography (ECG) is also commonly performed during exercise in order to assess electrical activity of the heart and diagnose arrhythmias that occur during or immediately after exercise. There are several indications for undertaking ECG during exercise, which are described in detail in the second paper in this series. One study has shown an association between cardiac arrhythmias and peak HR during exercise in racehorses (Ryan et al. 2005). This suggests that during clinical exercise testing of horses suspected of having exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmias it is important to reproduce or exceed the horse 's competition exercise intensity, in order to have con dence in the validity of the ndings (Reef et al. 2014). Muscle enzymes The measurement of muscle enzymes (creatine kinase [CK] and aspartate aminotransferase) before and after exercise provides information relating to muscle damage and may beuseful to evaluate individuals with clinical or subclinical myopathy. There are variations between studies and clinicians as to what exercise test is undertaken and the level of increase in muscle enzymes that are considered abnormal. For muscle enzyme activities to be of pathological signi cance they must be greater than those expected from the nature of the exercise and the tness of the horse (Harris et al. 1990). Both the type of exercise and level of tness may affect post exercise elevations in muscle enzymes. Small fluctuations in serum CK activity may occur during exercise because of enhanced muscle membrane permeability, particularly if exercise is prolonged or strenuous. Numerous human studies have evaluated changes in CK activity after exercise and found that it differs markedly according to exercise conditions (Totsuka et al. 2002) and this is probably similar in the horse. For instance in healthy endurance horses sampled post race, it is not uncommon to obtain CK levels >1000 iu/l (Wilberger et al. 2015). Therefore, in some cases it is difcult to distinguish between physiological and pathological increases in CK. Furthermore the signi cance to athletic performance of subclinical myopathy is not yet well understood. As CK can be dif cult to interpret after strenuous exercise, this might be one situation where low intensity exercise tests may be more useful than strenuous exercise tests. Also, it is suggested that bouts of maximal exercise may be less likely to precipitate exertional rhabdomyolysis in Thoroughbreds and moderate exercise tests (10 -20 min of trot and canter) may be more appropriate (Piercy and Rivero 2014). For polysaccharide storage myopathy, an exercise test of a maximum of 15 min of lungeing at walk and trot is appropriate (Valberg 2009). Exercise test protocols Whatever the reason for exercise testing, it is necessary forprotocols to be standardised if the data is to be compared against subsequent tests for the same horse or with measurements from other horses of similar type, use, age and tness level. In human exercise testing, the following factors contribute to a good performance test (Currell and Jeukendrup 2008) and these can also be applied to equine exercise testing: Validity : the protocol resembles the performance that is being simulated as closely as possible i.e. it would be of questionable validity to do a gallop exercise test on adressage horse. Reliability : the protocol provides a similar result from day to day when no intervention is used. Sensitivity : the protocol is able to detect small but important changes in performance. When designing an equine clinical exercise test a number of additional factors should be considered: Indication for performing the test/presenting complaint. Discipline/nature of the competition or race ( Tables 2 and 3). Status of horse (breed, age, level of tness, training history). The exercise test should be structured and the protocol recorded so that it can be repeated in the future, allowing the effects of any subsequent interventions to be studied. The \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd94 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2016horse should be sound and have undergone suf cient training for the exercise test. Exercise test variables Consideration of the duration, velocity and distance for theexercise test is important. It is also important to consider the effect of incline. Both treadmill and eld tests can be performed on the flat or on the incline. An incline is used to increase work effort without increasing speed and is thought to be safer, with less risk of injury (Takahashi et al. 2006). The effect of incline on measured variables may be substantial. One study showed that V La4was reached at 11.5 m/s on the flat, whereas on a 10% incline it was reached at a speed of only 6.75 m/s (Eaton et al. 1995b). Further consideration as to whether a stepwise incremental test is needed and that the durations are suf cient for the measured variables to reach steady state is required. The majority of exercise testing protocols for horses that are described in the literature have focused onThoroughbred or Standardbred racehorses. However, a recent review of exercise testing in Warmbloods involved in eventing, showjumping and dressage was performed by Munsters et al. (2014). This de ned areas for further development and identi ed an urgent need to standardise methodologies and outcomes. Treadmill exercise test protocols Two main types of treadmill exercise testing protocols havebeen described in horses: The standardised incremental exercise test and the high-speed single step exercise test .I n the former, physiological measurements (such as HR, lactate and _VO 2) can be made at the end of each speed step in order to examine their relationship with speed. Dependingon the requirements for the test, this protocol may be terminated at submaximal intensities or continued until the horse fatigues. The latter is important when determining maximal values of oxygen uptake and heart rate as well as for ruling out possible cardiorespiratory causes of poor performance. A commonly performed standardised incremental treadmill exercise test involves 1 min at 6, 8 and 10 m/s on a 10% gradient followed by increases of 1 m/s for every 1 min completed. It is acknowledged that this type of incremental exercise test does not reproduce racing conditions. Nevertheless it has been used extensively for clinical evaluation of racehorses. The number of steps completed and the total run time provide an index of performance capacity and degree of tness. National Hunt racehorses were found to reach higher speed steps than flat racehorses during incremental step tests (Allen and Franklin 2010) con rming that this type of exercise test has a substantial stamina component and is appropriate for testing of horses that run over longer distances. However, since flat racehorses reach faster speeds during racing a more appropriate test for sprinters would be to start the exercise test at close to maximal speeds and maintain this until the horse fatigues (Parente 1996). Several centres therefore use a high-speed single step exercise test for clinical exercise testing of flat racehorses ( <1 mile). Both the incremental and high-speed tests have been used routinely during upper respiratory tract endoscopy and ECG analysis for racehorses. For non-Thoroughbred racehorses, exercise tests tend to be performed at slower speeds and on a lower incline (0-6%). A typical incremental standardised exercise test for Standardbreds involves fewer steps of longer duration (2-3 min) with recovery periods, at walk or trot, between steps (Courouc /C19eet al. 2000; Courouc /C19e-Malblanc et al. 2002) whilst a single step high-speed test for these horses would involve them running at speeds of 11 -14 m/s on the level or 8-11 m/s on a slight (3%) incline for a period of 3 -5 min (Durando et al. 2002; Strand et al. 2012). For other sport horses the exact protocol will depend on the discipline and the tness of the horse. Field exercise tests Some clinicians integrate eld exercise tests into the normal training sessions, so maximal performance may not be assessed. However, for clinical exercise testing it is often necessary to try to replicate racing/competition conditions in order to elicit a diagnosis, which may involve altering the exercise test from that of a normal training session. For example, exercising the horse at faster speeds or over longer distances than is typically performed during routine training. The design of eld exercise tests is heavily reliant on the facilities available. For racehorses the exercise test could be performed at the trainer 's premises or on a racetrack. Different exercise tests may be required for straight gallops compared with circular gallops. On circular gallops, in common with treadmill exercise tests, exercise can easily be continued for longer distances. In the UK, the predominance of interval training on short inclined gallops means that exercise tests performed at trainers 'premises often have to be undertaken in intervals. The effect of this is not clear, although it is likely that this delays the onset of fatigue. In the UK, many Thoroughbred racehorse trainers use inclined gallops as the main part of the training programme. InclinesTABLE 2: Typical speeds and distances covered during racing Breed (racing type) Distance (m) Mean speed (km/h) *QH Hunt; SB Speeds and distances covered during FEI 3-day eventing competitions (cross country phase). All speeds are theaverage required for the entire distance, therefore peak speeds will be considerably higher Level Average speed (km/h) Distance (m) CCI* 2016of 3% are commonly used, although up to 10% has been reported (Allen and Franklin 2010). Elsewhere, exercise testing is more likely to be performed at the racetrack and therefore it is much easier to replicate the speeds and distances experienced during racing. Values obtained during exercise testing need to be interpreted in light of the environment, track conditions and horse 's behaviour. Excitement, anxiety and pulling against the jockey may result in elevated HR and lactate values (Evans 2000). Field exercise testing is particularly valuable for assessment of sport and other riding horses where speed and duration of exercise are not necessarily the most important factors to assess. For example, in showjumpers and dressage horses, the incorporation of sport-speci c technical skills also provides valuable information. Clinical exercise testing in nonracing disciplines often requires the horse to undertake exercise that reproduces the presenting complaint. For submaximal exercise tests in sport horses, an indoor arena is preferable to reduce the likelihood of external in fluences affecting physiological measurements such as HR (Van Erck Westegren 2014). Several protocols for exercise tests have been described in the literature, variations are likely to depend on the rider/trainer, facilities and the measurements made. Selected protocols for each of the disciplines are shown in Table 3 . Exercise test safety During any exercise at high speed there is a potential risk of injury to the horse. The risk of injury during eld exercise testing has not been evaluated but there is little indication to think that this would be different to the risk of injury during training or racing which has been assessed in several studies. A recent multicentre retrospective study investigated the risk of injury in 2305 horses undergoing treadmill exercise testing (Franklin et al. 2010). The risk of major injury (such as a fracture, tendon injury or severe myopathy) was 0.6%, whilst the risk of minor injury (cuts and abrasions) was 4.7%. These injury rates are not dissimilar to those sustained during high- speed exercise during racing (Williams et al. 2001; Pinchbeck et al. 2004) and eventing (Singer et al. 2008). Undertaking exercise tests on exertional rhabdomyolysis susceptible horses is potentially risky, so caution should be taken when designing the exercise test and good clinical judgement during the test is critical (Piercy and Rivero 2014). Conclusions There has been far greater veterinary application of clinical exercise testing than performance exercise testing in the horse. In elite human athletes the last two decades have seen a dramatic increase in sports medicine and exercise sciences resulting in substantial improvements in athletic performance. Veterinary surgeons involved with equine athletes who integrate high standards of veterinary care with information gained from exercise physiology research may better improve the health, welfare and performance of horses. An important goal for our industry should be to be able to give better advice the design of training programmes to prepare the horse optimally for competition whilst minimising injury and disease. Furthermore, the development of commercial equine speci c products to facilitate this should be encouraged.Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

Although there is considerable variation depending on the athletic discipline, exercise can be considered to be one of the most physiologically demanding times for the cardiovascular system. Assessment of heart rate during exercise typically provides information regarding tness and the intensity of exercise, and on some occasions may provide an early indication of disease. Cardiac causes of poor performance occur relatively infrequently in comparison with disorders of the musculoskeletal and respiratory systems. Nevertheless, exercise induces cardiac hypertrophy, which predisposes athletes to valvular regurgitation and arrhythmias. Consequently cardiac murmurs and arrhythmias are frequently present in equine athletes, whereupon the clinical signi cance can be dif cult to determine. Undertaking an exercise test to identify exercise-induced arrhythmias is important in theassessment of poor athletic performance and the risk ofsudden cardiac death during exercise. This paper describesthe assessment of heart rate and rhythm during exercise. Mostresearch has been undertaken on racehorses but, where dataare available for other disciplines, they have been included.Considerations regarding the choice, type and design ofexercise test were detailed in the rst paper in this series. Introduction -the athletic heart The horse is considered a supreme athlete when compared to other species, due to its superior aerobic capacity. The maximal oxygen capacity ( _VO 2 max) reached by the Thoroughbred racehorse during intense exercise is more than twice that of most elite human athletes (Jones and Lindstedt 1993), with maximal values reported to be over 200 ml/kg bwt/min (Evans 2007; Poole and Erickson 2011). This enhanced aerobic capacity is related to the superior cardiovascular capacity of this species. Cardiac output ( _Q)i s the major determinant of _VO 2 max (Poole 2004; Poole and Erickson 2011) and is in turn in fluenced by both heart rate (HR) and stroke volume (SV). Horses can experience an almost 10-fold increase in HR from rest to strenuous exercise, with maximal values of HR in the region of 210 -240 beats/min (Vincent et al. 2006). Training does not alter the horse 's maximal HR (HR max). However, the speed at which HR maxis reached does increase with training (Courouc /C19e 1999; Kobayashi et al. 1999; Vermeulen and Evans 2006). Stroke volume is related to heart size and horses have large hearts when compared with other species, with values for heart mass of approximately 0.9% of body mass in untrained horses (Poole 2004). Heart size and thus SV also increase further with training (Young 1999; Buhl et al. 2005).It has long been proposed that heart size is associated with athletic performance. Indeed, historically several of the greatest equine athletes have been reported to have extraordinarily large hearts, including Phar Lap, Secretariat, Mill Reef and Eclipse (Poole 2004). More recently, scienti c evidence has con rmed associations of left ventricular size with both _VO 2 max and race performance (Young et al. 2002, 2005; Buhl et al. 2005). In both human and equine athletes, long-term athletic training is associated with structural and functionaladaptations to the cardiovascular system. The cardiacremodelling that occurs with exercise results in eccentrichypertrophy, whereby there is an increase in the size of thecardiac chambers that is matched by an increase in the wallthickness (Young 1999; Cheng 2009). This 'benign ' physiological remodelling is often termed the 'athletic heart ' (Maron and Pelliccia 2006). Differentiating athletic eccentric hypertrophy from pathological left ventricular remodelling arising from cardiac diseases is challenging in all species. In human medicine, advanced imaging techniques such as tissue Doppler imaging and 2D speckle tracking show promise in distinguishing these conditions and might ultimately have value in horses where work is ongoing (Decloedt et al. 2014). There is increasing evidence of cardiac damage in athletes undertaking extreme exercise and this may explain why elite human athletes (Maron 2003; La Gerche 2013), dogs (Bharati et al. 1997) and horses (Kiryu et al. 1999; Young 2013) may be more susceptible to arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Equipment for measuring HR during exercise The gold standard method for measuring HR during exercise isthrough the use of electrocardiography (ECG), which permits visualisation of the QRS complexes and enables calculation of the HR by assessment of RR intervals. A number of HR monitors (HRMs) are also commercially available, which record interbeat intervals and provide the reader with a calculated HR value. Most devices calculate an average over a 5 s interval of RR collection, which can result in errors. Some models allow RR intervals to be exported, which allows for more detailed analysis. HRMs are cheaper and very user friendly compared to ECG. Furthermore, modern HRMs can be linked to global positioning systems, so that speed can be measured concurrently. Most systems have been developedfor human use, where they are commonly used to monitor training, and are adapted for use in horses. Compared with other indications of exercise intensity HR is easy to monitor, relatively cheap and can be used in a variety of settings (Achten and Jeukendrup 2003). However, not all systems \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd99 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2016have been validated for use in the horse, and while some studies have shown high correlation coef cients compared with ECG recordings, others have shown measurement related errors (Evans and Rose 1986; Sloet van Oldruitenborgh-Oosterbaan et al. 1988; Parker et al. 2010). Errors may be related to movement, loss of contact of the electrodes, or due to the high amplitude and variable T wave con guration in the equine ECG. The HRM electrodes are usually placed such that the one electrode is positioned on the left side of the thorax, under the saddle, and the other electrode is xed under the girth, over the left side of the heart or on the sternum. The coat should be wetted or electrode gel applied to ensure good electrical contact with the skin. In some cases it may be necessary to clip the area rst if the coat is long. Data are transmitted to a watch (usually worn by the rider, or xed to the horse). With most systems the information can be stored and downloaded to a computer for later analysis. Heart rate responses to exercise Typically, HR is monitored throughout the exercise session, including the warm-up and recovery periods. Typical HRs at different levels of exercise are shown in Table 1 and HRs during competition in the different disciplines are shown in Table 2 . An anticipatory response to exercise, leading to an increase in HR is seen in the equine athlete as in man (Fregin and Thomas 1983). In racehorses, high HRs have been observed in the starting stalls and pre-exercise in horses undergoing clinical exercise testing on the trainer 's own gallops (Krzywanek et al. 1970; Allen and Franklin 2010). Pre- exercise and submaximal HR elevations caused by excitement may interfere with the HR interpretation in the clinical setting.In general, there is a linear increase in HR with increasing speed up to HR max. This is the highest value of the HR that can be attained by an individual during an incremental exercise test and is observed as a plateau in the HR despite further increases in exercise intensity. Peak HR is the highest HR obtained during an exercise test, and this term is used when it is unknown whether HR max was achieved ( Fig 1 ). HRmax varies greatly between individuals and may be influenced by factors such as age, sex and breed (Vincent et al. 2006). When assessing HR and global positioning systems data from racehorses, a lag can often be seen whereby the peak HR is achieved after the peak speed (Fig 1 ). Heart rate recovery decreases in a bi-exponential manner (Rugh et al. 1992) ( Fig 1 ). Recovery is usually very rapid in the rst minute after cessation of exercise, followed by a slower decline towards resting levels. Effect of training/ tness and athletic capacity on HR responses to exercise In human athletes, numerous investigations have revealed an increase in SV as a result of training. This results in a corresponding decrease in HR at rest and during exercise (Warburton et al. 2008). Several studies have also demonstrated that the HR response to exercise may be influenced by tness in racehorses (Courouc /C19e 1999; Kobayashi et al. 1999; Vermeulen and Evans 2006). Although HRmax itself does not change with training, the speed at which a speci c HR is reached does increase with training. In horses performing intense exercise V 200(velocity at a HR of 200 beats/min) and V HRmax (velocity at maximal HR) may be used; whilst for horses performing less strenuous exercise parameters such as V 180,V170or V 140(velocity at HRs of 180, 170 and 140 beats/min, respectively) may be more appropriate. In racehorses and eventers when the discipline demands that exercise is undertaken close to aerobic capacity, V 200and V HRmax are the most useful indicators of tness and performance. However, for horses engaged in less aerobically demanding sports such as showjumping anddressage these HRs are not attained, therefore V 180,V170and V140 are recommended. The disadvantage of these parameters is that these values are far more susceptible to psychological in fluences on the HR. Repeated measures of any of these V HRparameters in the same horse can be used to demonstrate an increase in tness during a training programme (Vermeulen and Evans 2006). Individuals with the greatest athletic capacity will reach HRmax at the greatest speeds and a correlation has been shown between V HRmax and race earnings (Gramkow and Evans 2006) although other studies have not found V HRmax to change with either tness or to be a reliable indicator of performance potential in racehorses (Fonseca et al. 2010). It is possible that there may be confounding effects of trackcondition, rider/driver and distance exercised that mask the effect of training and athletic ability on the measured HR parameters and hence it is recommended that these variables also be accounted for in eld studies. In human athletes, HR recovery is routinely monitored to assess tness, with faster recovery rates occurring in highly trained individuals (Hagberg et al. 1980; Borresen and Lambert 2007). Although it seems intuitive that the same would be true for the horse, the evidence is con flicting. Seeherman and Morris (1991) found no evidence that HRTABLE 1: Typical heart rates at different exercise levels Speed Heart rate (beats/min) Walk 60 -80 Trot 80 -120 Canter 120 -180 Gallop >180 Max 210 -240 TABLE 2: Expected peak heart rates achieved during competition for various disciplines DisciplineExpected approximate peak heart rate (beats/min) Thoroughbred racing Flat: 240 National Hunt: 225 -230 Standardbred racing 230 Eventing: cross country phase 170 -200 Showjumping Up to 180 -190 Polo Up to 215 -225 Dressage Up to 140 -170 References: Krzywanek et al.

However, other studies in racehorses have found that post exercise HR recovery is improved with training (Foreman et al. 1990; Hada et al. 2006). Clinical signi cance of abnormal HR responses to exercise Identi cation of an abnormal HR response during an exercise test is a nonspeci cnding. Abnormalities should be considered as a 'warning sign 'that warrants further investigation and is not diagnostic of cardiac disease per se . Abnormal HR responses to exercise have been noted with arrhythmias, in particular atrial brillation (Buntenk et al. 2013). When valvular dysfunction or structural cardiac disease results in cardiac decompensation, affected horses show an increased HR during exercise because of failure to maintain forward stroke volume, before clinical signs of heart failure become evident at rest. However, abnormal HR responses to exercise are notsolely related to cardiac disorders and more often are associated with a variety of factors, including: excitement, lack of tness, respiratory disease, lameness, pain, anaemia, environmental factors, dehydration, high body condition score or a physiologically inferior horse (Littlejohn et al. 1977; Naylor et al. 1993; King et al. 1994; Courouc /C19e 1999). There are typically four situations when the HR response might be considered abnormal. 1 Abnormally high submaximal HRs: in addition to anticipation of exercise, elevated submaximal HRs may be due to inappropriate tness, dehydration, hot conditions, lameness, pain, respiratory or cardiovascular disease. 2 Abnormally high peak or maximal HR: the most common condition causing supraphysiological HRs (>250 beats/min) is atrial brillation (paroxysmal or sustained). 3 Abnormally low maximal HR: in human athletes, failure of the HR to increase appropriately is presumed to be due toischaemic dysfunction of the sinoatrial node (Cooper andStorer 2001). Low maximal HRs are not well reported inhorses and care should be taken to ensure that theexercise was suf ciently strenuous for HR max to be reached. 4 Abnormally high or prolonged HR in recovery: lack of tness may result in prolonged HR recovery. Poorly performing horses have also been reported to show higher post exercise HRs than good performers, with a prolonged slow phase of recovery (Cardinet et al. 1963; Bitschnau et al. 2010; Madsen et al. 2014). Dehydration appears to be the most likely cause of prolonged HR recovery in endurance horses (Naylor et al. 1993). In human patients, HR recovery is used as a prognostic indicator for cardiovascular disease (Cole et al. 1999; Smith et al. 2005) and in horses, prolonged HR recovery is associated with atrial brillation ( Fig 2 ). It is also necessary to consider whether other factors, such as anxiety and excitement are in fluencing the HR particularly if an unfamiliar place or unfamiliar exercise is used. For example, lungeing can elicit high HR in otherwise normal horses if they are unfamiliar with being lunged. Furthermore, in any situation where an unexpectedly high or low HR was obtained, it is also important to consider whether the equipment was functioning correctly. Cardiac arrhythmias In addition to HR measurements, ECG is also commonly performed during exercise in order to assess electrical activity of the heart and diagnose arrhythmias that occur during or immediately after exercise. There are several indications for undertaking an ECG during exercise: 1 To evaluate whether an arrhythmia detected at rest goes away with exercise. 2 In conjunction with echocardiography in horses with valvular regurgitation. For example, horses with aortic regurgitation may develop dilation of the left ventricle. This results in an increased myocardial oxygen demand when there is concurrent reduced coronary perfusion due to45 40 35 30 25mph20 Fig 1: Typical heart rate (HR) graph from a Thoroughbred racehorse doing a single gallop interval. The red line shows the HR (beats/ min) and the green shows the speed (mph). An anticipatory HR increase can be seen before the gallop, when the HR reaches valuesof 100 -130 beats/min whilst the horse is still at walk. The peak HR achieved is approximately 220 beats/min and is achieved after the horse reached peak speed. The graph also shows the initial rapid HR recovery. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd101 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / diastolic pressures. This can lead to ventricular ischaemia and hence ventricular ectopy during exercise and the predisposition to exercise associated collapse and/or SCD. The exercising ECG provides important information about the safety for continued ridden exercise. Similarly, advanced atrioventricular valvular regurgitation, which results in atrial enlargement, can predispose the horse to atrial ectopy. 3 In horses with sustained atrial brillation to ensure that the HR response to exercise is appropriate and that horses do not also have concurrent ventricular arrhythmias, which may jeopardise rider safety, especially where cardioversion is not pursued (Reef et al. 2014). 4 As part of a complete investigation of poor performance of unknown origin. Equipment for recording ECG during exercise Exercising ECG may be readily performed using portabledevices. Electrode placement may vary between clinicians and different devices. In the horse, precise location is of limited importance provided that the positive electrode is below and slightly caudal to the heart and the negative above and slightly cranial. Ideally the lead position allows some room for the girth to slip back and is not interfered with by the rider 's hands or legs. If the electrodes are placed in a visible position, the examiner will be able to see if they have been dislodged. The authors use a modi ed base-apex electrode placement during exercise in order to reduce movement artefact. The negative right arm (usually red) electrode and earth electrode (usually black) are placed on the left proximal scapula. The positive left leg (usually green) electrode and left arm (usually yellow) are placed at the cardiac apex (on thorax level with olecranon; Fig 3 ). This gives identical traces in Leads I and II. However, if it is possibleto separate the left arm and left leg electrodes so they are10-15 cm apart, this allows 2 subtly different leads to be recorded which helps recognition of artefact by reducing therisk of both electrodes being simultaneously knocked by the rider 's leg. During lungeing, the absence of a rider results in less interference and the right arm electrode could be placed on the right scapula. Whichever positioning is used it is imperative that the electrodes are placed prior to exercise, as, if the coat is moist with sweat, they will not adhere. Interpretation of exercise ECG recordings Electrocardiography in horses provides information on heartrhythm and not on myocardial function. It is important to note that equine ECG measurements are not indicators of heart size and should not be used for performance prediction. In the horse, depolarisation is different to that in man because of the widespread distribution of the Purkinje network; therefore, QRS duration does not accurately re flect cardiac size (Muylle and Oyaert 1977; Verheyen et al. 2010). The electrode con guration described above typically gives a bi d P wave and large QRS complexes. T waves are very labile and change in size and polarity with alterations inHR and sympathetic tone. Consequently analysis of their changes during exercise has no clinical value. During exercise the intervals between PR and QT shorten but there is little change in the duration of the QRS complex (Fig 4 ). An increase in T wave amplitude is seen and, as HRs progressively increase, the P waves disappear into the preceding T waves ( Figs 5 and 6 ). Slight changes in the amplitude of the QRS can occur due to respiration. Electrocardiography computer analysis will permit detection of the variation in RR intervals. When HR is very high during intense exercise, de nition of a premature complex requires understanding of RR variability (Physick-Sheard and McGurrin 2010). Generally at high HRs, there is only slight variation in RR intervals and the authors typically use a setting on automated software of 8% during exercise. Identifying arrhythmias on the ECG Firstly, it is important to review the ECG trace to ensure that itis of diagnostic quality. Although computer programs are readily available, it will always be necessary to review the Fig 2: A National Hunt racehorse undergoing clinical exercise testing in the eld. The blue line shows speed (mph) and the horse performed 2 intervals on an inclined gallop. The heart rate (HR; red line) shows a normal response to the rst interval. During the second interval the HR becomes abnormally elevated during exercise (peak HR 259 beats/min) and shows a characteristic erratic andelevated HR during FEBRUARY 2016P QRST Fig 4: Normal electrocardiogram during low level exercise. QRST Fig 5: Normal electrocardiogram during strenuous exercise. The heart rate is 225 beats/min. The RR interval is regular. P waves are hidden in the preceding T wave. Fig 6: Electrocardiography recording in the immediate recovery period. The heart rate is now slowing and P waves become increasingly visible on the edge of the T waves (red arrow). a) b) Fig 3: Placement of electrodes for lunged and ridden exercise. In the ridden horse it can be dif cult to separate the yellow and green electrodes because of the rider 's leg movement and hence a compromise is often needed. In Fig 3b ,both yellow and green electrodes have been placed more ventrally to avoid being disturbed by the rider. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd103 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2016entire trace manually. It is then important to determine the appropriateness of the HR and to determine whether the rhythm is regular or irregular. Normal irregular cardiac rhythms Classi cation of arrhythmias is usually based upon the origin of the complex. When the complex originates from the sinus node and passes through the normal conduction pathway, it is considered to be normal sinus rhythm. However these sinus rhythms can be in fluenced, particularly by parasympathetic tone, causing alterations of conduction. Generally speaking, the following arrhythmias are physiological and are a reflection of a high vagal tone in an individual horse when they will not be associated with clinical signs. They are most commonly seen before and immediately after exercise. When physiological arrhythmias are detected at rest, they will disappear during exercise as sympathetic tone increases. Rarely, these arrhythmias can also result from disease in theheart or of the conduction system, whereupon they will be associated with dramatic clinical signs and profound bradycardia. Irregularly irregular rhythms Sinus arrhythmia: A phasic increase and decrease in thePP interval is seen ( Figs 7 and 8). In contrast to other species, sinus arrhythmia is not associated with ventilationin horses. It is most commonly seen in the immediate recovery period after moderate or strenuous exercise particularly if the horse is brought back to halt or walk very quickly. In this context, the rhythm probably re flects nonlinear return of parasympathetic in fluence. Regularly irregular rhythms Sinus block: The normal sinus impulse is blocked at the sinus node resulting in a regular pause that is twice the preceding PP interval ( Fig 9 ). Second degree atrioventricular block: The ECG shows an isolated P wave that is not associated with a QRS complex because the impulse is blocked at the atrioventricular (AV) node ( Figs 10 and 11). Abnormal irregular cardiac rhythms Although occasional premature complexes at rest and at certain times during exercise or recovery may be considered clinically acceptable, the following complexes or rhythms do not originate from the sinus node and therefore from an electrophysiological perspective, are abnormal. These arrhythmias may be of clinical signi cance because they can cause poor performance or may predispose to collapse and/ or SCD. Fig 7: Resting electrocardiogram showing sinus arrhythmia. Fig 8: Electrocardiogram obtained in the immediate post exercise period showing transient sinus arrhythmia. A phasic increase and decrease in RR interval is seen. Fig 9: Resting electrocardiogram obtained showing a sinus block (red arrow). \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd104 EQUINE VETERINARY Atrial brillation: Atrial brillation can be sustained or paroxysmal. The ECG shows irregularly irregular RR intervals, the absence of P waves and presence of F waves. As the name suggests, sustained atrial brillation is present continuously and therefore can be detected on clinical examination and con rmed on a resting ECG ( Fig 12 ).Whereas the onset of paroxysmal atrial brillation is typically during or immediately after strenuous exercise (Fig 13 ), generally, most horses revert spontaneously back to sinus rhythm within 24 -48 h. However, horses have spontaneously reverted as long as 1 week after the onset of paroxysmal atrial brillation. Fig 11: Electrocardiogram obtained in the immediate post exercise period showing second degree atrioventricular block. There are 3 consecutive nonconducted P waves (red arrows).

The RR interval is irregular, no P waves are visible and F waves can be seen in the longer RR intervals. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd105 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2016 Supraventricular premature complex: A supraventricular premature complex (SVPC; also known as atrial premature complex) is an early beat originating from the atrial myocardium. As the premature complex does not originate from the sinus node, a difference in P wavemorphology can sometimes be detected. If the complex is very premature, the P wave may remain hidden in the preceding QRS or T wave. Furthermore, because of strong vagal in fluence on the AV node in the horse, it is also not unusual for the premature P waves to be blocked at the AV node.Typically, the morphology of the QRS complex is the same as that of sinus beats ( Figs 14 and 15), which is useful when trying to differentiate between SVPCs and ventricular premature complexes (VPCs). However, there are times when subtle alterations in the QRS or T may be seen with a SVPC and these should not be confused with VPCs. If the P wave of the premature complex coincides with the preceding QRS or T wave, this may cause a slight change in the con guration of the QRS or T. Also, for very closely coupled beats, the QRS of the premature beat can on occasion be taller than the sinus complexes (Broux et al. 2013); however, Fig 14: A supraventricular premature complex. The QRS is of similar morphology as the normal complexes. As supraventricular premature complexes are similar to the normal QRS they are more easily missed. The 2 electrocardiography traces above are identicalbut the second image also has the computer generated electrocardiography analysis marks. The red line highlights the prematurecomplex. Equipment with this facility aids recognition of supraventricular complexes. The numbers show instantaneous heart rate. Fig 15: Electrocardiography trace of the recovery period showing 2 supraventricular premature complexes (indicated by red line).Although on the rst premature complex the P waves is not identi ed the QRS morphology is the same indicating that these are probably supraventricular rather than ventricular in origin. The numbers show instantaneous heart rate. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd106 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2016they retain the same basic morphology, which generally aids in differentiation with VPCs. Supraventricular premature complexes are associated with what is classically termed a noncompensatory pause. This occurs when the premature complex depolarises the sinus node, following which it is reset and then resumes at its previous rate. The noncompensatory pause is less useful in horses for differentiating SPVCs and VPCs because on many occasions the sinus node resumes at a slower rate. Supraventricular (atrial) tachycardia is de ned as a run of 4 or more SVPCs. Ventricular premature complex: A VPC is an early beatthat originates from the ventricular myocardium or conducting system and the QRS morphology typically differs from that of sinus beats (higher amplitude/longer duration/abnormal morphology) ( Fig 16 ). The origin of the VPC dictates the morphology of the QRS complex. When the premature complex originates in the ventricular myocardium the QRS morphology appears most wide and bizarre. A junctional premature complex is a premature beat arising in the AV junction or His-Purkinje system. If the premature complex originates high in the Purkinje network it will be conducted using the normal pathway, and may not appear wide and bizarre; however, there is typically a small change in the R or S wave of the QRS complex. Ventricular premature complexes are usually followed by a compensatory pause, which is often the easiest thing tospot on the ECG. As the electrical impulse cannot passretrograde up the AV node, the sinus node is isolated from the VPC and consequently its rate of ring is unchanged. As a result, a P wave occurring at the normal rate may be visible within the premature QRS or diastolic interval. This P wave is not conducted because the ventricle is refractory (from the VPC) when the impulse arrives at the AV node. Consequently the next sinus impulse should occur at exactly double the normal RR interval. However, the presence of a compensatory pause is not truly diagnostic for VPCs. A SVPC may also result in a compensatory pause if it depresses the sinus node instead of resetting it. Furthermore in horses, interpolated VPCs can occur. This occurs when the VPC is so closely coupled that the next sinus impulse can be conducted because the ventricles are no longer refractory. In this situation, a VPC with no compensatory pause will occur. Therefore it is advised that more weight is placed on identi cation of abnormal QRS morphology (Conover 2002) when trying to differentiate between SVPCs and VPCs. Ventricular premature complexes can occur as isolated beats, couplets or triplets ( Fig 17 ). Four or more consecutive VPCs are termed ventricular tachycardia ( Fig 18 ). From an electrophysiological perspective, the T wave represents a vulnerable period for myocardial cells during which time ventricular brillation can more easily be triggered. Consequently, when VPCs are superimposed on the preceding T wave (R on T phenomenon), the rhythm is considered highly unstable because there is a high risk ofventricular brillation developing, which may lead to SCD. Fig 16: An isolated ventricular premature complex is seen (arrow). This complex is premature and of different morphology to other QRS complexes. Fig 17: A post exercise electrocardiogram showing two obvious ventricular premature complexes (red arrows) and 2 less obviousventricular premature complexes (blue arrows). \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd107 signi cance of arrhythmias occurring during exercise and the immediate recovery period Arrhythmias have been reported in both normal horses and poorly performing horses during exercise. Although for some arrhythmias, such as atrial brillation, the contribution to poor athletic performance is well understood, for others the clinicalsigni cance remains unclear. Interpretation of exercise- induced arrhythmias can therefore pose a signi cant dilemma to the veterinary surgeon. A recent joint ACVIM/ECEIM Consensus statement (Reef et al. 2014) has been released to guide veterinarians in the interpretation ofexercising arrhythmias. Strenuous exercise causes substantial increases hypoxaemia,hypercapnia, lactic acidosis, hyperthermia which can potentially contribute tocardiac arrhythmias. In both human and equine athletes, theimmediate post exercise period appears to be the mostvulnerable time for the genesis of cardiac arrhythmias andSCD. At this time there is a rapid decrease in HR due toparasympathetic reactivation and sympathetic withdrawal.Abnormal regulation of electrolytes and cardiacsympathovagal balance may increase the incidence ofarrhythmias during this time period (Paterson 1996;Beckerman et al. 2005; Physick-Sheard and McGurrin 2010). In contrast to human athletes, most racehorses develophypoxaemia and hypercapnia during strenuous exercise. Theextent to which this hypoxaemia and hypercapnia areinvolved in arrhythmogenesis is unknown. With many forms ofupper and lower respiratory disease, hypoxaemia andhypercapnia is further exacerbated, but the precise role ofrespiratory disease in cardiac arrhythmias is uncertain.Furthermore, hypoxaemia and hypercapnia are more evidentin trained horses and horses with a higher _VO 2 max;i ti s therefore also unclear whether elite equine athletes withhigher _VO 2 max and larger hearts are the most at risk of developing arrhythmias. Questions have certainly been raised in human athletes as to whether the athletic heart becomes more arrhythmogenic. In human athletes, arrhythmias are common and there is some research to suggest that certain arrhythmias are more common amongst trained athletes than their sedentary counterparts (Baggish and Wood 2011). There is also increasing evidence of cardiac damage and brosis in athletes undertaking extreme exercise and this may explain why elite human athletes may be more susceptible to arrhythmias and SCD (La Gerche 2013). It is likely that asimilar situation occurs in the equine athlete (Kiryu et al. 1999; Ryan et al. 2005; Lindholm et al. 2008; Young 2013). Prevalence of arrhythmias during and after exercise During exercise Supraventricular premature contractions are the most common arrhythmias detected during exercise. They are more commonly observed during the warm up phase (Ryanet al. 2005) but have been reported to occur in 10 -50% of Thoroughbreds and Standardbred racehorses during strenuous exercise -either in training, racing or on the treadmill (Ryan et al. 2005; Jose-Cunnileras et al. 2006; Lindholm et al. 2008; Buhl et al. 2013). Isolated VPCs have also been reported, albeit less commonly, in 3 -4.5% of racehorses during strenuous exercise (Ryan et al. 2005; Jose- Cunnileras et al. 2006; Lindholm et al. 2008; Buhl et al. 2013). In sport horses, exercise ECGs are more dif cult to interpret as speeds often vary; therefore, the HR is more variable and strict de nition of prematurity is more dif cult. Isolated premature beats have been reported in both dressage horses and showjumpers (Barbesgaard et al. 2010; Buhl et al. 2010). After exercise Arrhythmias have been more commonly identi ed during the immediate post exercise period than during the exercise period itself. In one study of healthy Thoroughbred racehorses during training 15% had second degree AV block and at least 28% had sinus arrhythmia in the post exercise period. Approximately 8% had VPCs or SVPCs in the post exercise period, and couplets, triplets and paroxysms were observed (Ryan et al. 2005). Similarly, following strenuous treadmill exercise 31% of horses had VPCs and 15% had SVPCs in theimmediate recovery period. On average one SVPC (but up to 4) and three VPCs (but up to 30) were seen (Jose- Cunnileras et al. 2006). In studies of Standardbreds, rhythm disturbances were frequently noted immediately after racing, with 46 -54% exhibiting one or more SVPC (Lindholm et al. 2008; Buhl et al. 2013) and 19 -28% showing one or more VPC (Lindholm et al. 2008; Physick-Sheard and McGurrin 2010; Buhl et al. 2013). In a recent study by Physick-Sheard and McGurrin (2010), complex ventricular arrhythmias were observed in 16% of horses. In about a third of horses, post exercise arrhythmias were associated with a sudden reduction in HR, suggesting autonomic instability and increases in vagal tone were contributing factors (Physick- Sheard and McGurrin 2010). The prevalence of atrial Fig 18: Two runs of ventricular tachycardia were observed in the early recovery period. This rhythm is at risk of deteriorating into ventricular brillation. \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd108 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2016brillation (detected post race) is reported to be 0.03% in Thoroughbred racehorses and 0.14% in Standardbred racehorses (Ohmura et al. 2003; Slack et al. 2015). Sinus arrhythmia, sinus block, second degree AV block, SVPCs and VPCs were also observed in sports horses during the recovery period. Effect of arrhythmias on athletic performance A reduction in cardiac output is the primary mechanismthrough which a cardiac arrhythmia might affect athletic performance. Atrial brillation (persistent or paroxysmal) is the most important arrhythmia affecting performance in athletichorses. In both cases, poor performance may arise becauseof the reduced cardiac output that occurs due toincomplete ventricular lling. The high HRs that often occur during atrial brillation further reduce the time for ventricular lling compounding the problem. Horses may be able to complete exercise successfully at low intensities but areaffected at faster speeds. In cases where AF arises duringstrenuous exercise, horses may become uncoordinated and'wobbly '. This is likely to be due to the sudden decrease in _Q and reduced O 2supply to the exercising muscles and/or central nervous system. The effect of SVPCS and VPCs on performance is less clear. Previously it was suggested that arrhythmias occurringduring maximal strenuous exercise or immediately afterexercise were of clinical importance and a potential causeof reduced performance (Martin et al. 2000). However, others have argued that it is unlikely that isolated VPCs or SVPCswould have a considerable detrimental effect on cardiacoutput and hence performance, and the prevalence ofSVPCs and VPCs in apparently healthy horses furtherreinforces this. One study reported that the presence ofpremature depolarisations did not appear to be associatedwith decrements in athletic performance during a strenuoustreadmill exercise test or decrements in race performance(Jose-Cunnileras et al. 2006). Similarly, it has been reported that winning time was not associated with the probability of arrhythmias during the post exercise period in racing Standardbreds (Physick-Sheard and McGurrin 2010). Whether post exercise arrhythmias are an indicator of increased abnormalities such as hypoxia or electrolyte disturbances which were present during the exercise period remain to be investigated. Risk of collapse/ Sudden cardiac death Ultimately, the risk of SCD in the horse during exercise is low; in Thoroughbred racehorses, rates of 1 -3 horse sudden deaths per 10,000 race starts are reported, of which approximately 50% can be speculated to have an arrhythmogenic cause (Boden et al. 2006; Lyle et al. 2011). Irrespective of the relatively low frequency, when SCD occurs during high-pro le competitions, there may be intense media interest and anegative effect on public perception of horse sports. Suddencardiac death during competition is thought to be mostcommon in racehorses, but has also been reported in otherdisciplines including eventing and elite showjumping. Suddencardiac death can occur during or immediately afterstrenuous exercise, but it is the immediate post exerciseperiod that is considered to be a particularly high risk for bothhuman and equine athletes (Physick-Sheard and McGurrin2010). It has been proposed that the concerning exercise-induced arrhythmias may be lessened or avoided by asustained and gradual warm down after exercise, which may help to moderate autonomic changes, rather than abruptly decreasing to walk (Physick-Sheard and McGurrin 2010). Ventricular arrhythmias are assumed to be the primary cause of SCD in horses (Kiryu et al. 1999). However, evidence is lacking as longitudinal studies are dif cult to perform and post mortem examinations are often unrewarding (Physick- Sheard and McGurrin 2010). In human athletes, sudden cardiac arrest during exercise is most commonly associated with hypertrophic cardiac myopathy, a relatively common genetic disease, with an incidence of 1 in 500 in the general population (Maron 2003). Sudden death in these individuals is most likely to be a consequence of an electrically unstable and unpredictable myocardial substrate with re-entrant ventricular tachyarrhythmias (Maron 2003). Horses with SVPCs do not appear to be at increased risk of collapse or SCD. However, it is thought that frequent SVPCs during or after exercise are a risk factor for atrial brillation (Hiraga and Kubo 1999). In rare cases, horses with atrial brillation may collapse or die during exercise. This has been reported in horses with both sustained (Deem and Fregin 1982; Lyle et al. 2010) and paroxysmal AF (Franklin and Allen 2013) and may be related to ventricular ectopy or aberrant conduction resulting in sudden changes in cardiovascular haemodynamics (Piercy and Marr 2010). Verheyen et al. (2013) recently reported that ventricular ectopy occurs frequently in horses with AF. Of 43 horses examined, 69% showed ventricular arrhythmias and 30% had R on Tphenomenon. Hence an exercising ECG is warranted in all cases that do not undergo cardioversion in order to determine whether it is safe to continue ridden exercise (Reef et al. 2014). Conclusions The athletic heart undergoes signi cant remodelling in response to training. Whilst this cardiac hypertrophy is an important factor for increasing oxygen delivery during exercise, it also predisposes the equine athlete to valvular regurgitation and development of exercise-induced arrhythmias. in most cases valvular regurgitation will not signi cantly affect performance, exercising arrhythmias may result in reduced performance and in some cases may predispose the equine athlete to an increased risk of SCD. Isolated premature complexes have been identi ed in apparently healthy horses and currently there are no xed guidelines on what prevalence of premature complexes constitutes an increased risk of collapse/SCD. Therefore clinical judgement becomes important particularly in interpretation of VPCs. In general, 'judge them according to the company they keep 'is good advice. For example a few isolated VPCs in the immediate post exercise period of a racehorse after a strenuous exercise test may be judged as not of clinical signi cance. However the same number of VPCs during walk and trot in a pleasure horse with an aortic regurgitation may be considered highly signi cant. Further research is warranted to con rm the repeatability of exercising arrhythmias and their relationship with horse/rider safety and SCD.

R. A. Parker Liphook Equine Hospital, Liphook, Hampshire, email: russell.parker@theleh.co.uk Introduction is a common heritable condition in horses and ponies and while retained testicles rarely release viable sperm,Leydig cells produce testosterone leading to undesirablestallion-like behaviour. Endocrine assays are frequentlyrequired to definitively diagnose retained testicular tissue. Search method A literature search of the Medline database was performedusing the PubMed search engine. The search term 'equinecryptorchidism' was entered and the results filtered using thecontents of the abstracts to retain articles relating specificallyto diagnostic testing for cryptorchidism. Quantity and quality of evidence The initial search yielded 139 articles which after filtering werereduced to 6 articles included for analysis. Retrospectiveanalysis of clinical cases comprising level IV evidence wasused to evaluate the use of serum oestrone sulphate andserum testosterone (alone and after human chorionicgonadotropin administration) for the detection ofcryptorchidism (Cox et al . 1986). Leung et al . (2011) also analysed a large number of normal horses but few cryptorchidanimals (n = 25, only 18 confirmed) were diagnosed using urinesteroid profiling. The remaining prospective experimentalstudies evaluated the use of serum testosterone 2003) and faecal oestrogens (Palme et al . 1994) to distinguish between gelded, entire and cryptorchid horses. This data was then variably extrapolated toprovide inferred relevance for the use of each test for thedetection of suspected cryptorchid animals. Of the 4 prospective experimental studies those by Silberzahn et al . (1989) and Palme et al . (1994) lack sufficient numbers or appropriate methodology to provide qualityevidence. Illera et al . (2003) evaluated the use of serum androstenedione but inconsistency in their results significantlyweakens the evidence provided by this paper. The mostrecent experimental study by Claes et al . (2013) provides the strongest evidence for the use of serum AMH. The quality of theevidence provided by the retrospective studies (Cox et al . 1986; Leung et al . 2011) is weak as the cryptorchid status of all the animals in the study, particularly those testing negative,was not confirmed. Clinical relevance Testosterone may be measured directly but serum levels varygreatly between individuals and fluctuate with age andseason (Cox et al . 1986; Claes et al . 2013) making it unsuitable as a definitive test. Measurement of testosterone pre and30 min post administration of hCG was reported to be more reliable with an accurate diagnosis achieved in 95% of cases(Cox et al . 1986). However , other studies have questioned the reliability of this elevation in testosterone so soon after hCGadministration (Silberzahn et al . 1989; Illera et al . 2003) and accuracy may be improved by testosterone measurement upto 72 h post hCG (Silberzahn et al . 1989). This claim has not been validated and such a time delay is less suitable for use inclinical practice. Measurement of serum oestrone sulphate in horses and ponies (not donkeys) >3-years-old was 96% accurate in weak early retrospective studies (Cox et al . 1986). However , evaluation of serum oestrone sulphate in a more clearlydefined population yielded reduced positive predictive values(PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) of 85% and 91%respectively for this test (Illera et al . 2003). Illera et al . (2003) reported serum androstenedione accuracy(92%) compared both andtestosterone of cryptorchids. However , this finding is weakenedby anomalies in the results of the study and, on the basis of this,evidence serum androstenedione cannot be recommended. Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) is produced in elevated amounts from Sertoli cells in cryptorchid testes (Ball et al . 2008) making it a potentially reliable and specific test for thepresence of testicular tissue. Claes et al . ng/ml); geldings were below or fractionally above the lower limit of detection for the test. Onlyanimals of >2 years of age were included in the study and AMH levels require investigation in cryptorchid pubertal animals. Thecalculated biological half-life was 1.5 days (Claes et al . 2013) making AMH a useful test if there is doubt over the success ofa recent castration procedure. Conclusions The evidence for many of the available endocrine assays isbased on poor quality retrospective or experimental studies.Currently, the strongest evidence exists for the use of AMH forthe detection of cryptorchidism, although the test warrantsvalidation in a large number of confirmed cryptorchid animalsand in animals <2 years of age.

Parker Liphook Equine Hospital, Liphook, Hampshire, UK.Corresponding author email: russell.parker@theleh.co.uk Introduction Many products exist for the treatment of equine tendinopathy which may be delivered systemically, regionally orintralesionally. Objective analysis of methods of delivery andthe persistence of products after delivery would be clinicallybeneficial. Search method Relevant literature was retrieved from the Medline databaseusing the PubMed search engine. The search terms 'equinetendon treatment' and 'intralesional tendon treatment' wereentered. Given the current interest in the use of regenerativetherapy and the ability to label these products, the terms'tendon stem cell' and 'equine stem cell' were also entered. Quality and quantity of evidence Articles were screened based on their abstracts to includethose with evidence relating to the delivery of products totendon lesions and their persistence in the lesion aftertreatment; evidence evaluating the effects of treatment wasdiscarded. Review articles were included if they evaluatedmethods of product delivery. Despite the large number of articles initially retrieved only 5 experimental studies were evaluated. All of the studiesinvolved low numbers of animals and variable methodology(method of cell labelling and detection, model oftendinopathy, duration of monitoring) making directcomparison difficult. Becerra et al . (2013) evaluated the distribution of labelled autologous mesenchymal stromal for 24 limb regional (IARLP) was similarlyevaluated by Sole et al . (2013) in a surgically induced model of superficial digital flexor tendonitis in 6 horses. Migration andpersistence of MSC post intralesional implantation has beenstudied using labelling with nanoparticles (Carvalho et al . 2014) and fluorescent proteins (Guest et al . 2010) in experimentally induced SDFT lesions. Fluorescent proteins werealso used by Lacitignola et al . (2014) to monitor the fate of MSC in a fibrin scaffold after intralesional injection in an ovinemodel of collagenase induced tendonitis in a blindedcontrolled trial. Specific recommendations regarding themethodology of intralesional injection are limited to level V orVI evidence (Schnabel et al . 2013). Despite the large amount of evidence evaluating the effects of tendon therapy, studies relating to optimal productdelivery and persistence within the lesion are limited. Whilethese have the potential to provide high quality level IVevidence the low numbers and/or study design limit their ability to influence clinical practice. Clinical relevance For diffuse or anatomically inaccessible lesions alternativemethods of product delivery are desirable. Intravenousadministration of labelled autologous MSCs resulted indistribution to the lung fields with no significant re-distribution tonaturally occurring tendon lesions over 24 h (Becerra et al . 2013) suggesting this route is not suitable. IVRLP with MSC in thesame group resulted in radiopharmaceutical uptake in thelesion in 75% of horses (Becerra et al . 2013). At 12 h post IVRLP 9% of MSC were retained in the lesion compared with 32%retention after intralesional administration. In anaesthetisedhorses IVRLP did not result in uptake in 10-day-old lesions, andproduced only mild uptake in 1/4 horses in 3-day-old lesions(Sole et al . 2013). Intra-articular (IA) RLP under general anaesthesia produced significantly higher uptake in10-day-old lesions compared with 3-day-old lesions which theauthors speculated may have resulted from earlyneovascularisation or the altered inflammatory profile ofmature lesions (Sole et al . 2013). However severe thrombus formation occurred in all of the IARLP treated limbs making itunsuitable for clinical use. Little objective data exist on the optimal method of implantation beyond the methodology described in clinicalstudies (Schnabel et al . 2013). The number of injection sites and volume of product injected at each site is usually dependenton the extent of the lesion and has not been critically assessed.Optimal needle size is also unknown but a minimum of 23gauge is recommended due to unpublished data suggestingsmaller diameters than this may cause mechanical disruptionto cellular products (Schnabel et al . 2013). Intralesional administration of labelled MSC and embryonic stem cells (ESC) in a surgical model of equine SDFTtendinopathy revealed 5% MSC survival at 10 days postimplantation, reducing to 0.2% at 90 days (Guest et al . 2010). In contrast the ESC showed survival of over 60% butquantification of this was impaired by low numbers andmigration between multiple lesions (Guest et al . 2010). The use of a fibrin scaffold was found to improve MSC survival in anovine collagenase induced model of achilles tendinopathywhere observers were blinded to control and treated limbs(Lacitignola et al . 2014). The use of intralesional scaffolds is promising to aid retention of products within the lesion afterimplantation. Conclusions There is a paucity of evidence on the optimal method ofimplantation and dosing regimen for treatment of equinetendinopathy. injection is currently the most \u00a92015 EVJ Ltd115 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / FEBRUARY 2016effective method of delivery but further work is needed to elucidate the persistence and survival of MSC afterimplantation and the optimal dose, number of treatments andtiming of implantation. Other routes of delivery, particularlyIVRLP , warrant continued investigation. Author's declaration of interests No conflicts of interests have been declared.
