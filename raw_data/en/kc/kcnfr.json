In this act adopted at Windsor, July 2, 1777, Section 40 states in part that \"one grammar school in each county and one university in the state ought to be established by direction of the General Assembly.\" No action was taken by the Assembly to establish a university except that in granting charters to towns, it did require that one right of land be established for the endowment of a college or university. By 1785 there was a substantial amount of public sentiment in favor of establishing a college or university in Vermont. In that year Elijah Paine of Williamstown offered the General Assembly the sum of 2,000 pounds. Four years later Ira Allen offered the sum of 4,000 pounds. These and other of\u00ad fers caused the General Assembly to appoint a committee to study the mat\u00ad ter and to canvass the state in order to determine where the university should be located. This committee reported to the session of 1791 at which time the General Assembly decided that a university was to be founded to serve the state. A ballot was taken on the question of location and a decision was made in favor of Burlington, presumably because of the substantial support offered by Ira Allen, the Rev. Samuel Williams, and their associates. The General Assembly further voted to create a committee to draft a charter of the University. The report of the committee was adopted with amendments on November 3,1791, as the charter law of The Universi\u00ad ty of Vermont. The University became the twentieth college in the United States and the fifth in New England chartered to confer the bachelor's degree. It is worthy of note that the University is the second to be estab\u00ad lished by a state legislature after the formation of the United States. The ac\u00ad tion of the 1791 Legislature also makes The Unversity of Vermont the oldest institution of higher education in the Green Mountain State. Thus did the founding Legislature of Vermont establish a university which was to develop like no other in the fledgling nation. While the enabling legislation provided for funding to come from rents, those were often fixed at \"$.25 per acre as long as grass is green and water runs,'' and in any event were not reliably collectable. One result is the tradition, born of necessity, which has seen The Univer\u00ad sity of Vermont develop in many of the same ways as the private institutions of the country have developed, with a substantial reliance on alumni and other private philanthropy. The first building was subscribed by citizens of Burlington and when fire destroyed that edifice in 1824, its successor, for which General Lafayette laid the cornerstone, was again made possible by the citizens of Burlington. That building, the Old Mill\u2014still in use today\u2014was only the first in a long line to be made possible by private philanthropy. The list includes all but one of the buildings on University Row: Ira Allen Chapel, Billings, Williams, Old Mill, and The Royall Tyler Theatre. Morrill Hall, the first UVM building to be provided by state funding, did not come until 1907. Other buildings made possible by private philanthropy include Waterman Memorial, Southwick, Fleming Museum, Converse, Dewey and Lafayette Halls. 3 4 | INTRODUCTION Medical alumni and other friends raised approximately $7,000,000 to match federal grants to make possible the Given Medical Building, its Medical Alumni Building wing, and the Dana Medical Library. In addition to a challenge grant from the Dana Foundation, the project attracted a $2,000,000 grant from the Given Foundation, the single largest building gift the University has received to date. Alumni and other friends also raised more than $1,000,000 of the $3,000,000 cost of the Patrick Gymnasium, Gutterson Field House, and For- bush Pool complex. The remainder is being paid by students, through retire\u00ad ment of a bond issue. In like fashion, student rents have made possible most of the campus residence halls, which currently house about 4,000 of the University's 7,670 undergraduates. The most recent major construction undertaking at the University is an addition to the Bailey Library which will nearly double the size of the ex\u00ad isting library. The $4,300,000 cost of the addition has been met by a bond issue secured by student library fees, a capital appropriation from the state, and $1 million in private contributions from the Chittenden County community. This latter figure includes $500,000 contributed by J. Warren and Lois H. McClure in memory of Mrs. McClure's father, David W. Howe, a 1914 alumnus and long-time publisher of The Burlington Free Press. When completed, the addition will be named to honor Mr. Howe's memory. The University of Vermont was founded in a day when U.S. colleges and universities existed primarily to educate men for the professions, especially for the ministry. Yet, in studying University history, Professor Emeritus Betty Bandel discovered that \"this small institution located in a frontier community of New England became a pioneer in the kind of practical education which later became the basis for the establishment of the Land Grant universities\u2014those institutions which made it possible for the sons and daughters of average citizens to aspire to a college education.\" For example, she noted that,the University is believed to be the first non- military institution to have offered engineering courses, and early alumni of the University included men such as John Kasson who was instrumental in founding the international postal system; and Henry Raymond, a founder of The New York Times. Tucked in the northwest corner of the Ira Allen Ghapel grounds is a memorial to a late 19th century graduate of this University, philosopher John Dewey, whose ideas about practical education are still debated with passionate vigor. Ten Academic Divisions By contemporary standards, the University of Vermont is a relatively small university. Its 7,670 undergraduates enrolling in eight colleges and schools\u2014the Col\u00ad leges of Agriculture; Arts and Sciences; Education and Social Services; and Engineering, Mathematics and Business Adminstration; and the Schools of Allied Health Sciences; Home Economics; Natural Resources; and Nursing\u2014share the 420 acre main campus with some 850 students enrolling in the Graduate College and another 320 in the College of Medicine. INTRODUCTION | 5 The Division of Continuing Education offers courses on campus and in many communities throughout the State of Vermont during the fall and spring semesters and during the Summer Session. The largest single share (about 30 per cent} of the University's current total operating budget of $77 million is obtained from student tuitions. Grants and contracts (the University is among the top 100 U.S. institutions of higher learning in competition for federal research, training and equip\u00ad ment grants] account for about 25 per cent of the budget. The state appropriation is currently about 18 per cent of the total budget. The remainder comes from a variety of sources, including alumni and other private philanthropy, endowment, sales and services and auxiliary enterprises. Endowed Chairs Since the establishment of the Williams Professorship in Mathematics in 1853, the University has been the recipient of a number of generous en\u00ad dowments intended to support teaching and research in various academic fields. Among them are: The Williams Professorship of Mathematics, 1853, honoring Azarias Williams of Concord, Vt., merchant and judge, native of Sheffield, England, who in 1839 deeded to the University extensive holdings in land, at that time valued at $25,000. In return he received a small annuity during the remain\u00ad ing ten years of his life. The Marsh Professorship of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy, estab\u00ad lished in 1867 to honor James Marsh, distinguished UVM president and philosopher of the 1830's. Many alumni contributed to the fund which established this chair. The Pomeroy Professorship of Chemistry, established in 1878 by John N. Pomeroy, A.B., 1809, who lectured on chemistry and later, during his career as a lawyer in Burlington, served as trustee of the University. He was awarded the LL.D. in 1861. The Howard Professorship of Natural History and Zoology, established in 1881 by John Purple Howard, a Burlington resident who was a generous benefactor both of the University and of the City of Burlington.

The Lawrence Forensic Professorship of Speech, established in 1965 by Edwin W. Lawrence, lawyer and financier of Rutland, Vt., A.B., 1901, generous patron of forensic activities at the University. The Sanders Professorship, established in 1968 as a chair endowed by the alumni, honoring the Rev. Daniel Clarke Sanders, first president of the University. Statement of Purpose THE UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT The University of Vermont is a community of scholars, and it exists to pro\u00ad mote the survival and enrichment of man and his environment by con\u00ad tributing to the improvement in the quality of life in Vermont and the larger society...broadly conceived to encompass the educational, cultural, social, medical, economic, and technological dimensions of human experience. The University aspires to contribute to the improvement in the quality of human experience and the conservation of the environment through the per\u00ad formance of three broad missions. These include transmission of knowledge and understanding through its education programs; Expansion and organization of knowledge and understanding though research and other creative endeavors; and Dissemination of knowledge and understanding and the application of such knowledge and understanding to solving problems of importance to Vermont, the region, and society at large. Together, these missions comprise the public service role of the Universi\u00ad ty of Vermont and they provide the basis for its general educational goals. The University Libraries In the Guy W. Bailey Library, the main unit of the University libraries, are located the services and collections relating to the humanities, social INTRODUCTION | 7 sciences, and many of the sciences. This library holds the largest book and map collection in Vermont, and maintains a representative collection of ma\u00ad jor periodicals, scholarly journals, indexes, and abstracting services. It is a depository for United States and Canadian government publications. The Special Collections Department includes the Wilbur Collection of Vermont- iana, rare books, literary and historical manuscripts, and the papers of many individuals associated with the state and the federal government. Space will nearly double with the completion of an addition to the Bailey Library in honor of David W. Howe, expected to open in the fall of 1979. A separate Physics and Chemistry Library is located in the Cook Physical Science Building. Collections in medicine and the health sciences are located in the Dana Medical Library. The University Archives in the Water\u00ad man Building contain the permanent, offical records of the University. Conferences and Institutes A large number of groups hold educational conferences, institutes and seminars on the campus of the University which is pleased to cooperate in making its facilities available for this purpose whenever it is possible to do so. Charges are made to cover costs to the University. Further information may be obtained through the Office of Conferences and Institutes. Vermont Educational Television Vermont Educational Television is the public television network owned and operated by the University of Vermont, serving the state. With studios and offices on the Fort Ethan Allen campus, the network pro\u00ad vides an instructional service to schools, college courses for credit, pro\u00ad grams for children out-of-school, and a broad spectrum of Eastern Educa\u00ad tional Network and Public Broadcasting Service programs. Locally pro\u00ad duced programs address the concerns and issues of Vermonters. Programs are broadcast over WETK-TV, channel 33, Burlington; WVTB, channel 20, St. Johnsbury; WVER, channel 28, Rutland; WVTA, channel 41, Windsor; and on channels 74, 76, 79 at Manchester, Wilmington, and Benn\u00ad ington. Student Life Division of Student Affairs A STATEMENT OF MISSION antil recently, the student personnel function at most universities was thought to be a function of control of student behavior through rule en\u00ad forcement and strict discipline. As modern universities began to re-evaluate their missions they assessed the total educational experience on their cam\u00ad puses. This led to a concern about the quality of student life on campus and the impact of campus environments on students. Such was the beginning of Student Personnel Services, which is known today as Student Affairs. As a result, student personnel educators began to develop programs to meet some specific developmental needs that were common to college age young adults. It should be recognized that students are going through a period of rapid personal growth while on the college campus. In addition to developing new academic skills, they are being challenged to pursue new ideas, evaluate their values systems, change existing attitudes, and investigate new life styles. They are exploring future career options and learning social and in\u00ad terpersonal skills. Therefore, the broad focus of the Division of Student Affairs at die University of Vermont is to provide support services to students during this time of intense personal development and intellectual growth, in addition to playing a leadership role in developing experiences, policies, and programs to provide learning and leadership opportunities for students in concert with the formal instructional mission of the institution. To accomplish this mission the student life areas are divided into various functional departments and programs. Each of these provides or coor\u00ad dinates support services and educational experiences to meet student needs. COUNSELING AND TESTING CENTER The Counseling and Testing Center provides a place for individuals and groups to consider how to live more effectively and confidently through greater understanding of their situation and the nature of change. A pro- fesssional staff, augmented by carefully selected and trained interns, offers confidential individual and group counseling and consulting for a wide range of concerns: educational, vocational, personal and social. The Center also offers testing services ranging from vocational and personal testing in conjunction with counseling, to national group examinations. The outreach program is redesigned each semester to respond to stuent requests for training in such areas as academic achievement enhancement, communica\u00ad tions skills, life planning, confidence building, men's and women's groups and stress management. The services of the Counseling and Testing Center are available on a no-fee basis to UVM students carrying six or more credits and on a limited way to faculty and staff. Referrals are frequently made to other special resources on campus and in the community. 8 STUDENT LIFE | 9 The Office of Specialized Student Services works closely with disabled students in locating and securing solutions to problems encountered in their university experience. With the provision of supportive services we hope to better equalize the competitive disadvantage caused by existing barriers at the University. This includes providing volunteer and paid workers to assist with necessary tasks, e.g., readers, interpreters, mobility aides, notetakers; providing academic, vocational, and personal counseling to encourage op\u00ad timal physical independence and eventual employability; and providing a support system and structure where students can begin to effect changes on campus, community, and personal issues. Prospective students having disabilities can contact the Coordinator of Specialized Student Services housed in the Counseling and Testing Center for assistance in their decision making and needs assessing regarding future schooling. Incoming students should contact the OSS in planning for housing, classroom, and mobility needs. Cooperation with other campus and community services is important for insuring that students have equal ac\u00ad cess to all offerings of the UVM campus. 146 South Williams Street (802) 656-3340 CENTER FOR CAREER DEVELOPMENT The Center for Career Development is organized to provide all students with comprehensive assistance in exploring and implementing their career objectives. This function consists of two major efforts. The first is to provide direct assistance to students in clarifying career objectives based on their own skills, interests, needs and abilities. The primary emphasis is through self-awareness, occupational awareness, skill development, and finally en\u00ad try into the career areas which are complementary to their desired lifestyles. This process is accomplished through one-to-one counseling and/or small group workshops. Along with providing career counseling, students will find the information contained in the Career Resource Library helpful in developing their career goals. The library, which is located within this office, contains literature on various fields, occupational outlooks, salary surveys which are updated four times per year, government op\u00ad portunities at all levels, as well as a variety of literature describing current career opportunities in both large and small corporations in the private sec\u00ad tor. For those students contemplating further graduate study, the library contains two complete guides to all graduate programs in the country and a variety of graduate school catalogues from other universities. This informa\u00ad tion is expanding and being updated continuously in the belief that effective choices must be based on current and reliable information. After helping a student to develop some tentative goals the office can assist in his/her attempts to implement these goals. The office has a very ac\u00ad tive on-campus recruiting program which brings local and national employer representatives to campus for employment interviews. All part- time and summer employment opportunities are posted and made available to students attempting to offset a portion of their educational expenses or gain experience in a field of their interest. To assist students in their employment search, the staff will provide help in developing an effective resume, conducting employment interviews,-developing a credential file, and assist in drafting an overall employment search program. 10 I STUDENT LIFE Students are encouraged to make use of the Center for Career Develop\u00ad ment early in their educational program. Having a goal or direction to his/her education will enable the student to make effective career-related decisions. 322 South Prospect Street (802)656-3450 FINANCIAL AID In order to be eligible to apply for financial aid you must be a U.S. citizen or in the U.S. for other than a temporary purpose and intend to become a permanent resident.

Some tutorial services are also available. The first semester classes are open primarily to freshmen whose college en\u00ad trance examinations indicate such a need. However, other students who are in need of improvement are urged to enroll in the reading program. Students who enroll are expected to attend regularly throughout die semester. 406 Waterman Building (802)656-3838 SPEECH AND HEARING CENTER Services of the Speech and Hearing Center, located in Allen House, are free to students in the University who have problems of speech, language, voice, and hearing: for example, problems of articulation, dialect, stutter\u00ad ing, inefficient voice production, hearing loss, and those problems associated with such conditions as cleft palate and cerebral palsy. Allen House (802)656-3861 CENTER FOR SERVICE-LEARNING It is the mission of the Center for Service-Learning to assist students in participating, with faculty, in the teaching, research and service missions of the University in the State. Service and learning have been linked in order to emphasize that struc\u00ad tured learning experiences in the context of public service to specific com\u00ad munity needs can result in simultaneous achievement of academic and social objectives. Service-Learning has been defined by the Sub-committee on Service- Learning of the Academic Affairs Committee of The Faculty Senate as oc\u00adSTUDENT LIFE | 13 curring \"beyond regular classroom instruction and primary course struc\u00ad tures, involving tasks with significant community impact and educational importance to students.\" Role of the Center Center for Service-Learning staff assist faculty, students and community representatives in identifying problems of mutual concern where student in\u00ad volvement in a service-learning project might be appropriate. The Center for Service-Learning services as an information, human resource, planning and technical assistance center for a wide range of in\u00ad dividuals, groups and organizations both within and outside the University. Assistance is offered in the areas of service-learning information, project development, program management, evaluation, participant support, train\u00ad ing and communications, and other related areas. The Center manages four programs, including: The University Year for Action, The Service-Learning Internship Program, The Student Community in Action Program and The Volunteer Referral Program. UYA The University Year for Action is a one-year internship program in which students work and learn for one calendar year with concentration in a specific community project. Students organize their academic program to coordinate with problem-solving tasks in the community. Students par\u00ad ticipate under a formal contract between the University and the sponsoring agency. The contract includes a stipend for students. UYA is an inter\u00ad disciplinary program involving students from many different departments and programs engaged in a wide variety of community tasks. Students work together in a structured Core Seminar to integrate service and learning ex\u00ad periences. They take additional courses in the regular departments of the University to relate faculty interest and expertise to their projects and to assure normal academic progress toward a degree in one of the disciplines of the colleges and schools of the University. SLIP The Service-Learning Internship Program is an internship option for students that requires a significant commitment of time to a community pro\u00ad ject, but that allows for variations in the amount of time and academic credit involved. Students select a community project and negotiate credit arrangements with faculty, usually in the department in which the student is a major. Students negotiate a service-learning contract prior to participa\u00ad tion. The contract outlines learning objectives and the method for documen\u00ad tation for faculty evaluation. A Core Seminar is provided to assist students integrate service and learning experiences. SGIA The Student Community in Action is a student organization within the Center that sponsors and administers ten to fourteen student volunteer pro\u00ad jects each year. Such projects typically include Big Brother/Big Sister Pro\u00ad grams, Council for Exceptional Children, Adopt-A-Grandparent, Vermont Children's Magazine, Vermont Special Olympics, King Street Youth Center, GYST, Urban Center, H.O. Wheeler Tutoring Program and others. Often projects which began as SCIA projects become self-sustaining. The UVM Rescue Squad, King Street Center, Vermont Special Olympics and Vermont Children's Magazine are examples. They are now independent community 14 | STUDENT LIFE projects, but with significant continued student participation in program operation. The SCIA organization is sustained with Student Association funding. Volunteer Referral The Volunteer Referral Program is the Center's response to literally hun\u00ad dreds of requests from the community for student assistance. Such requests are organized and catalogued according to field of interest. Students utilize this information in surveying the wide range of social problems, people en\u00ad vironments, skills and knowledge required to provide appropriate response. Most students work as volunteers and on an extra-curricular basis. However, many participate jn fulfillment of class assignments or as part of special projects for various academic program requirements. Faculty from many different departments encourage students to get involved in projects related to their area of knowledge. The volunteer program and the volunteer coordinate services of the Center for Service-Learning help meet needs for information and support.

The Student Activities office serves as a resource center for students seeking direction and support for the development of ex\u00ad periences and programs that offer recreation, learning, and leadership op\u00ad portunities. This office totally involves itself in working with students to ver\u00ad balize their needs and interests, determine their own goals and objectives, develop and produce their own programs, and evaluate their own ex\u00ad periences in terms of personal growth and future program direction. This is the kind of participation in university life that students have found to be a vital part of their total education. However, it is left up to the individual to contact the Student Activities Office to take advantage of these op\u00ad portunities. There are approximately 80 student organizations that exist on the UVM campus. These organizations develop out of a unique interest area common to a group of students. Some of the larger organizations are listed below: Alpha Lambda Delta Modern Dance Workshop American Society of Civil Engineers Mortar Board American Society of Mechanical News and Weather Engineers Outing Club Anthropology Club Panhellenic Council Ariel Pershing Rifles Billings Center Governing Board Phi Chapter of Omicron Nu Campus Crusade for Christ Physical Education Majors & Minors CatalinaClub Pre-VetClub Chi Epsilon Beta S.A.

As such, it is a multi-purpose building used as a focal point for student activities. The facilities of the building provide space for lectures, films, small theatre and musical presentations, small and large group meeting rooms, study and recreational lounges, and the Catamount Den, a snack bar facility. Billings also houses several student organization offices, i.e., Student Association, Greek Coordinating Council, Women's Organization, Gay Student Union, Billings Center Governing Board, Cynic, Ariel, Concert Bureau, Speakers Bureau, and Films Bureau.

There is also a sales desk for newspapers, can\u00ad dy, bookstore supplies, etc., which is open on weekends and evenings. UVM STUDENT ASSOCIATION All students enrolled in the undergraduate colleges and schools are charged a student activities fee and thus become members of the UVM Stu\u00ad dent Association. Student Association serves as the all-campus student governing body. It assumes responsibility for voicing student concerns and interests in the political activities of the University community. S.A. also determines the recognition of student organizations on campus and the allocation of funds to a large number of student organizations. They provide publicity and supply services for their constituents, and assume a major role in all campus programming through their Concert Bureau, Film Bureau, and Speakers Bureau. Each year S.A. holds elections for student senators who serve on S.A.'s standing committees. There are many opportunities for other students, as appointed by S.A., to serve on various University ad hoc committees throughout the year or work on the variety of programs S.A. involves itself with each year. INTER-RESIDENCE ASSOCIATION (IRA) The Inter-Residence Association is a government which represents the students living in University residence halls. The government, consisting of an executive board, legislative council, and judicial board, provides leader\u00ad ship for residence hall students, representing their interests to other consti\u00ad tuencies within the University community. IRA involves itself in all aspects of residence hall life, constantly seeking new ideas and avenues for the manifestation of these ideas to make the residence halls meet the needs of its residents. STUDENT LIFE | 17 FRATERNITIES AND SORORITIES The Greek System is an active and viable part of student life. It has long been acknowledged as an integral part of the social and extracurricular life on campus. The governing body of the system is the Greek Coordinating Council. The GCC performs several vital functions for the collective. It serves as a vehicle for communication between houses, assumes respon\u00ad sibility for conveying Greek interests and concerns to the University and provides social, educational and recreational programming for its members. In addition, the Panhellenic Council coordinates all sorority activities, and is probably most notably responsible for the design, development, and im\u00ad plementation of the semesterly rush program. The Assistant Director of Stu\u00ad dent Activities works with fraternities and sororities to accomplish those goals established in the best interest of the Greek and University com\u00ad munities. The houses are private corporations and thus are treated so by the University excepting those situations having a direct effect on the University community as a whole. The Fraternity Managers Association, 656-2066, offers a professional fiscal management service to each of the Greek houses. The office is main\u00ad tained in Billings Center on the balcony level. The following are active chapters of national and local fraternities: Acacia, Alpha Gamma Rho, Alpha Tau Omega, Delta Psi, Kappa Sigma, Lambda Iota, Phi Delta Theta, Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Mu Delta, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Nu, Sigma Phi, Sigma Phi Epsilon, and Theta Chi. Chapters of the following national sororities are represented: Alpha Chi Omega, Alpha Delta Pi, Delta Delta Delta, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Pi Beta Phi. ATHLETICS, CLUB SPORTS, INTRAMURALS & RECREATION The University encourages and supports a variety of sports at a variety of participatory levels.

A program of intercollegiate competition for men is maintained in baseball, lacrosse, gymnastics, basketball, cross country, golf, hockey, in\u00ad door track, soccer, swimming, tennis, and track. The athletic policies of the University are under the recommendation of the Athletic Council, composed of members of the faculty, the student body, and alumni. Athletic relations are maintained with colleges and universities in New England and the eastern seaboard. The University is a member of the \"Yankee Conference,\" which is composed of the State Universities in New England, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the New England Intercollegiate Athletic Association, and the Eastern College Athletic Conference. The Women's Intercollegiate Program offers a variety of team and in\u00ad dividual activities which are open to all full-time female students of the University. Intercollegiate competition is on the local and regional level under the auspices of the Eastern Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women, and the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women. Varsity teams included in the program are as follows: field hockey, soccer, tennis, volleyball, basketball, swimming, synchronized swimming, gym\u00ad nastics, skiing, lacrosse, Softball, track and field, and cross country.

The facilities of Patrick Gymnasium are available at various times during the week for recreational free play in a wide variety of sports activities. STUDENT PUBLIC ATIONS The opportunity for journalistic, literary, and editorial expression is open to students interested in membership on one of the three major student publication staffs: the weekly newspaper, Vermont Cynic, the literary magazine, The News and Weather, and the yearbook, The Ariel. These publications have all made unique contributions to the life of the campus. Students need not be \"professionals\" to become involved in any aspect of the production of these publications. The only requirement is a commitment of interest, time and effort. The Cynic and Ariel both have offices located in the downstairs of Billings Center. The News and Weather can be reached by leaving a message in their mailbox in the Student Association Office. RADIO The University community is served by a student-run FM radio station. WRUV-FM began operation as a 100-watt educational station in 1965. The station is an S.A.-recognized organization and as such is student-operated and programmed, offering full radio media services to the University com\u00ad munity. The station operates at a professional level, although it does have the informal atmosphere associated with a student organization. Any undergraduate interested in having a radio show or being involved in the station's operations should drop by the station, located at Pomeroy Hall. THEATRE The Royall Tyler Theatre is the home for the season of plays presented each year by the Department of Theatre with the University Players, as well as the home for the annual Champlain Shakespeare Festival. The great periods of theatre history are covered duri ng the course of four years in the Major Play Series.

The University Band appears at athletic events, presents formal concerts, and makes a spring concert tour. The University Choir and the Choral Union give three annual concerts and the Madrigal Singers sing for various groups around the state. The University Orchestra presents two annual concerts, and assists the Choir in a third. The music department is located in a new music building, located behind Redstone and Southwick on the Redstone Campus. The building houses the offices of the department as well as a beautiful recital hall accommodating one of the finest organs in the northeast. The new facility serves as a showcase for the musical talents of the department and its students, as well as those students seeking musical activity as a part of their extracurricular life on campus. THE GEORGE BISHOP LANE ARTISTS' SERIES \"...The George Bishop Lane Artists' Series should include musical produc\u00ad tions and ...other theatrical and artistic productions (and) should be open to the students of the University of Vermont and the public generally....\" \u2014from the will of Mrs. George B.Lane (April 27,1954J Since Mrs. Nellie Lane's generous bequest to the University of Vermont, the Lane Series has presented well over 650 concert and stage productions, over 100 film programs, and many events programmed especially for children.

In 1973, 20 | STUDENT LIFE the Lane Series help found and managed the Vermont Mozart Festival, and in the summer of 1976 helped co-found Stowe Performing Arts, a festival of outdoor events in Vermont's ski capital. As result of all of these activities, the Lane Series has led the way to the establishment of the Green Mountain Consortium for the Performing Arts, the membership of which represents virtually all presenters of the performing arts in Vermont. In 1979-1980, the Lane Series celebrates its 25th Anniversary. THE ROBERT HULL FLEMING MUSEUM The Fleming Museum houses a distinguished teaching collection of art and ethnography. Originally founded as the Park Gallery in 1873, the collec\u00ad tion owes much of its growth to the generosity of alumni and other friends. The O.B. Read American Plains Indian Collection and the David B. Pitman ('32} and Henry Schnakenberg Collections of American art are notable ex\u00ad amples. The spacious Marble Court is a center of activity.

There are a few local societies, i.e., Boulder Society, that acknowledge individuals by class. National Honorary Societies represented on the University of Vermont campus include: The Phi Beta Kappa Society established the Vermont Alpha Chapter at the University in 1848, and initiates are chosen primarily on the basis of high scholastic standing with emphasis on a broad distribution of liberal studies. A detailed statement of the criteria used is available from the chapter president. The local chapter was the first in Phi Beta Kappa to in\u00ad itiate women into membership. Mortar Board is a national honorary society for senior women and men. Although membership in Mortar Board comes as a high honor for a Univer\u00ad sity of Vermont student in recognition of outstanding service, scholarship, and leadership, it is also a challenge for continued sound and honest scholarship, and for unselfish service in the best interests of the college campus. The Society of the Sigma Xi, established at the University in 1945, in\u00ad itiates those who have proven their ability to do research in one of the sciences, including students who have a high scholastic standing.

Housing Full-time students may apply to live in University residence halls. All freshmen students, except those living at home and commuting, or those liv\u00ad ing with their spouses, must live in University housing. Upperclass students who are actives or pledges of a fraternity or a sorority may register for University residence hall housing or chapter housing. On-campus housing is seldom available to transfer students entering UVM for the fall semester. The possibility of obtaining housing for the spring term is considerably better though not guaranteed. In recent years most transfer students have been offered housing for the semester begin\u00ad ning in January. RESIDENCE HALLS A residence hall is more than a place to sleep, store one's belongings, and study. It is a place where a student can take advantage of the various op\u00ad portunities and experiences surrounding him or her. A diversity of residence halls and programs are offered. There are freshman halls, up\u00ad perclass halls, coed halls, single sex halls, an environmental hall, a French house, and the Living and Learning Center (additional information on the Living and Learning Center is on page 132). Each residence hall is under the guidance and direction of a Hall Advisor who is assisted by specially selected undergraduate Resident Assistants. These staff members en\u00ad22 | STUDENT LIFE courage the development of intellectual, social and cultural programs and assist the residents in their growth toward maturity and responsible self- direction. Each student in the residence halls is a member of his or her residence hall student government which represents student opinion and provides educational and social programs for its constituents. Contracts for room and board are binding for the college year unless cancelled for due cause with the approval of the Office of Residential Life. In August, each new student will receive notification of a housing assign\u00ad ment and the date of the opening of the residence halls. Rooms may not be occupied until the date specified. Each student is expected to leave the residence halls not later than twenty-four hours after his or her last ex\u00ad amination at the close of each semester. All students living in the residence halls must have board contracts. Student rooms are equipped for comfortable residence hall living. Each double room has two beds, with mattress pads, two desks and chairs, bureau space for each student, two closets and blinds or shades on the win\u00ad dows. Bookshelves are provided in some rooms. Students provide their own bed linen, towels, window draperies, pillows, wastebaskets, bureau covers, desk lamps and reading lamps. Facilities for doing personal laundry are provided in residence areas as well as space for storage of trunks, baggage, bicycles and skis during the academic year. Mansfield House 25 Colchester Avenue (802)656-3434 FRATERNITIES AND SORORITIES Chapters of Greek letter fraternities and sororities have long been recognized as part of the intellectual, social, and extracurricular life on the campus. These groups provide valuable experience for their members in the form of interfraternity athletic competition, dances, service projects, house operations, meal service, and educational programs. Fraternities and sororities are under the jurisdiction of the Dean of Students Office. Greek activities are coordinated by the Greek Coordinating Council, the central governing body of all of the Greek letter houses.

Detailed rental information may be obtained from the Manager of Family Housing, 600 Dalton Drive, Fort Ethan Allen, Winooski, VT 05404. OFF-CAMPUS HOUSING University students eligible to live off-campus may utilize the facilities of the Residential Life Office in locating housing in the greater Burlington area. This office provides a free listing service by which community landlords and rental agents are able to make known their housing availabili\u00ad ty to students at the University. Students may examine up-to-date listings for available apartments, houses, rooms and roommate requests at the Billings Student Center or on a bulletin board just off the College Street entrance of Waterman Building on the main campus. The University is not responsible for the approval of off- campus housing facilities. It is impractical to send information concerning individual listings by mail. A catalogue of available listings is issued each May, August and December. To reserve a catalogue, contact the Office of Residential Life, 25 Col\u00ad chester Avenue, Burlington, VT 05401. 24 | STUDENT LIFE University Health Services The University Health Service is designed to meet the primary and preventive health care needs of UVM college students. Through its out\u00ad patient clinics, athletic training program, in-patient capability, and health education programs, the Health Serives strives to focus on the particular health problems and concerns of college students. There are two fees associated with the Health Services: a mandatory, per semester fee which all full-time students must pay and an optional, annual student health insurance premium. Payment of the mandatory health fee en\u00ad titles the student to unlimited general out-patient clinic services, two days per semester of in-patient care at the Health Services facilities, and most other support services of the Health Services. The student insurance premium provides supplementary coverage for health care problems which either cannot be addressed by Health Services staff or which occur while the student is away from the UVM campus. If a student is not clearly covered by the Health insurance policy of a partent, guardian or spouse, it is strongly advised that the student purchase the supplementary student health insurance described above. The health fee alone provides a wide range of pre-paid services. These services include unlimited visits to the UHS physicians or nurses, physical therapy, the gynecology clinic, most laboratory work, and some limited prescription medications. X-rays are available for a fee. Orthopedic and psychiatric consultation are available at no charge for up to two visits each per semester. After two visits, a fee will be charged. If a student needs to be seen by a medical specialist, the student will be referred to one in the Burl\u00ad ington area. If a student needs long-term or sophisticated hospitalization, the student will usually be referred to the Medical Center Hospital of Ver\u00ad mont. These referrals are covered in-part by the supplementary student health insurance. The University Health Services is located at 284 East Avenue and is staff\u00ad ed and open 24 hours per day. The staff is composed of five phsycians, twelve nurses, two physical therapists, and six diagnostic and ad\u00ad ministrative support staff. In addition to the professional staff, many students are trained and employed as athletic trainers to work with teams and individual athletes at the Patrick Gymnasium. A group of volunteer students operates the UVM Rescue Squad, a fully functioning ambulance unit which serves as a back up ambulance for the Burlington Fire Depart\u00ad ment. UVM Rescue is housed at the Health Services. Entering students are required to provide the UHS with a complete health history. In addition, students planning to try out for athletic teams at UVM must have a physical examination by a Health Services physician. Students who elect to withdraw from the University for a medical reason must have the reason for withdrawal approved and administered by the Health Ser\u00ad vices. 284 East Avenue (802) 656-3350 Admissions to the University Applications and Deadlines The University of Vermont welcomes applications from all interested students regardless of race, religion, handicap, nationality, or sex. Prospec\u00ad tive freshmen and transfer students interested in applying for admission in either January or September can receive applications by writing to: Office of Admissions, University of Vermont, 194 South Prospect Street, Burl\u00ad ington, 05405. Applications for admission in January should be received in the Admissions Office by December 1, while applications for admission in September should be on file and complete by February 1. For transfer students, applications should be on file and complete by April 1 except for those applying to the Allied Health Sciences, or Professional Nursing. These students have a February 1 completion date. Upon filing an application all candidates are required to pay a non-refundable $25 application fee which is used to meet the cost of processing the application. Fall financial aid in\u00ad formation should be submitted by March 1. Early Notification for Vermont Students An early notification program is available for prospective freshmen who are Vermont residents (see residency rules, page 45). Vermonters applying under this program will be notified concerning admission during the first week of December if the application, high school transcript, SAT scores and recommendations have been received by November 1. Students who receive offers of admission under this program will have until May 1 to respond. Admissions Criteria Qualification for admission is determined on the basis of the secondary school record, rank in graduating class, recommendations, and College En\u00ad trance Examination Board Scholastic Aptitude and Achievement Test results. Each application is carefully reviewed by the Admissions Office staff and in many cases by the College or School to which the student is applying. The candidate's record is thoroughly examined in order to deter\u00ad mine whether the student has adequately prepared for the academic pro\u00ad gram of his/her choice and all qualified Vermont freshmen applicants will be offered admission. Non-resident applicants will be selected on the basis of overall academic qualifications, leadership potential, special talents and ability to add to the diversity of the undergraduate population. Sons and daughters of alumni of the University of Vermont are encour\u00ad aged to apply and are given special consideration. Increasing competition means that the University must evaluate the application of each alumni son or daughter in terms of the total number of applications, their relative qualifications, and the limitation which must be placed on the number of applicants who may be offered admission to the various academic programs which are available. 25 26 | ADMISSIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY Most prospective freshmen present at least 16 high school units, in\u00ad cluding a minimum of four years of English, three years of mathematics, two years of a foreign language, two years of science, and three years of social sciences. The three years of mathematics should be two years of algebra and one year of geometry. Students who plan to specialize in engineering, forestry, mathematics and science should present both a second year of algebra and a course in trigonometry for a total of four years of mathematics. Students applying to Business Administration are expected to be enrolled in the college preparatory curriculum at the high school level. These students should present a strong background in mathematics and have a generous exposure to the sciences, social science and humanities. Students planning to major in an allied health science must have taken high school courses in biology and chemistry, while physics is highly recommended. Physics is required for all students planning to major in Physical Therapy. For students planning to major in nursing a high school course in chemistry is required and courses in biology and physics are highly recommended. Exceptionally qualified students may in some instances be admitted even though they do not meet the above requirements in full. Additional courses in mathematics, history, science, the fine arts and music, and a third year in the foreign language are strongly recommended as desirable preparation for college. In evaluating the secondary school record, careful attention is given to the course load a student has been carrying and any advanced work is given special consideration. A student planning to major in music must arrange for an audition and interview with the chairperson of the department prior to the deadline for completion of the application. Interviews and Visits Students are encouraged to visit the campus to form their own first-hand impressions about the University. Prospective students may schedule an ap\u00ad pointment with a current UVM student or a staff member on most weekdays during the academic year in order to gain information about the academic and non- academic aspects of undergraduate life. On most Saturday mornings while the University is in session, information group sessions will be held on campus for interested students and parents. Students should write or call the Admissions Office (802-656-3370) for addi\u00ad tional information about the group meetings or individual appointments. New England Regional Student Program The University of Vermont is an active participant with the Universities of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island and with Lowell University, Southeastern Massachusetts University, and the public four-year and two-year colleges and technical institutes in a program of regional cooperation aimed at increasing educational opportunities for qualified young men and women of the New England States. Under the pro\u00ad gram, New England residents are given tuition privileges in certain ADMISSIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY | 27 specialized curricula which are not offered by public institutions in their home state.

Applications for mid-year admission should be filed by December 1. Applications for Fall transfer should be com\u00ad plete by April 1, except for those students applying to the Allied Health Sciences, or Professional Nursing. These students have a February 1 com\u00ad pletion date. Transfer candidates should see that SAT scores and official transcripts of their high school and college records are sent to the Office of Admissions in time for prompt consideration. A transfer applicant may not disregard the record of any previous education received at another institu\u00ad tion. A student who transfers to the University from another accredited college or university may be given provisional credit for all courses satisfactorily completed, provided that similar courses are counted toward graduation at the University of Vermont. Transfer credit is not allowed for work com\u00ad pleted with grade \"D\" or its equivalent, unless a more advanced course in the same subject has been passed with a higher grade in the institution from which the student transfers. Please note: GRADES do NOT transfer. The quality point average of transfer students is computed on the work taken at the University of Vermont only. The credit is provisional, pending satisfactory completion of a semester's work at the University. The provisional transfer credits are fully granted if the student is in good standing at the end of the first semester. The determination of how transferred course(s) listed on the EVALUA\u00ad TION OF TRANSFER CREDIT form fit a specific degree program rests with the academic dean/director of the college/school in which the transfer stu\u00ad dent subsequently becomes a candidate for a degree. The University of Vermont welcomes applications from high school students who have taken college level courses offered in their high schools under the Advanced Placement Program of the College Entrance Examina\u00ad tion Board. Scores of three or higher on advanced placement examinations are awarded appropriate credit by the Registrar. A student who has been granted Advanced Placement may, upon the recommendation of the department and the student's academic dean/direc\u00ad tor, use his/her Advanced Placement to satisfy distribution requirements for his/her concentration. Students who received Advanced Placement may also receive course credit toward graduation requirements, upon approval of the department and the student's academic dean/director. A degree student who wishes to do so may, under the following condi\u00ad tions, receive credit for a course by taking a special examination and paying the special examination fee charge of S^fper credit hour. The examination Advanced Placement and Advanced Credit Credit by Examination ADMISSIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY | 29 fee must be paid prior to taking the examination. A request for such an examination must be made in writing at least one month before the date of the examination, and it must be approved by the student's advisor, the chairperson of the department in which the course is given, and the academic dean/director, in that sequence. The student must neither have audited, previously received a grade, nor have attempted a prior special examination in this course at the University of Vermont or at any other institution of higher education. Upon passing the special examina\u00ad tion, as determined by the examiner and the chairman of the department in which the course is given, the student receives credit, but not a grade, for the course. Credit by examination forms are available in the Office of the Registrar. College Level Examination Program The University grants appropriate credit for the College-Level Examina\u00ad tion Program (CLEP) General Examinations for scores at the 50th percentile or higher. These scores fall between 489 and 495 on a 200 - 800 range of scores. The credit granted for acceptable total scores is a maximum of six (6) semester hours for each of the five General Examinations. Three (3) semester hours is granted for subscores of 50 or higher. All General Ex\u00ad aminations, with the exception of English, have two subscores ranging from 20-80. The minimum creditable score on CLEP Subject Examinations is the average scores of students who earned a grade of \"B\" in a comparable col\u00ad lege course. These scores fall between 50 and 57 on a 20 - 80 range of scores. To learn the score required for credit in a specific examination, con\u00ad tact the office of the Registrar, 360 Waterman Building. Credit granted for CLEP Examinations may be applied toward distribu\u00ad tion requirements and to the total semester hours specified for a particular degree program when approved by the dean/director of the college/school in which the student is subsequently a candidate for a degree. Information about CLEP and application forms are available at the Counseling and Testing Center, 146 South Williams Street.

Entering students are required to take the College Entrance Examination Board Achievement Tests in mathematics and a modern foreign language in all cases where these subjects are to be continued in the student's cur\u00ad riculum. It is recommended that students who expect to continue with biology take the College Entrance Examination Board Achievement Test in biology. The scores on all t ests are used in advising students regarding the course of study and the selection of courses. Following acceptance, students must submit a statement of medical history and physical examination record to the University Health Service. New students are also required to come to the campus for continuing orientation. Schedules and dates of these meetings are mailed in early spring. Senior Citizens Citizens of the state of Vermont, sixty-five years and older, upon presen\u00ad tation of proof or residence and age, are permitted to enroll for credit or audit in classes at the University without payment of tuition fees. In each of these instances, such enrollment must have permission of the dean/director of the college/school concerned or in the case of Evening Divi\u00ad sion and Summer Session, permission of the Director of Continuing Educa\u00ad tion, in order to safeguard overcrowding of any one class to the detriment of the regularly matriculated students.

General Information This section offers a summary of regulations and procedures for registration, change of enrollment, grades and advisement. It also gives a brief explanation of withdrawal, leave of absence, readmission rules, undergraduate degree requirements, and residency rules. The importance of these'regulations and procedures cannot be underestimated. REGISTRATION Students in attendance must pre-register for the next semester at the designated time. Unless excused in advance by the dean/director of the college/school concerned, students who do not pre-register will be considered as dropped and may apply for readmission after one semester. Specific directions are published for each semester. Written approval of the student's dean/director is required to pre-register for more than 18 credit hours. ACADEMIC ADVISING Effective academic advising involves an established rapport between student and teacher. Accordingly, each new student is assigned to a faculty advisor upon admis\u00ad sion to the University. The student remains under the gui dance of this advisor until a major has been selected, usually during the sophomore year at which time a depart\u00ad mental advisor will be assigned. Students with questions about academic planning should consult their advisor throughout the year and especially during the pre- registration period. To change academic advisors, students should contact the dean/director of their college/school. Each academic unit within the University main\u00ad tains its own system for advising students. ADVISING RESOURCES In addition to an assigned faculty advisor, there are a variety of other advising resources offices available to University undergraduates. They are: The Academic Advising Center: assists students who are undecided about their academic plans. The Center also helps students with complaints and grievances about course instructions, scheduling, and other academically related problems. Pre-Heaith Advisor: assists undergraduate studentB with the admissions re\u00ad quirements for dental and medical school. A library of resource materials is main\u00ad tained which includes literature on alternative health careers, school catalogs, and pre-medical education journals. Pre-Law Advising: die UVM Pre-Law Committee assists students by providing meetings and panel discussions regarding career options in law. Advising also includes specific information on applying to law schools. A current collection of law school catalogs is maintained for interested students. Pre-Veterinary Advising: is available to discuss plans for graduate school and employment in animal science career areas. A selection of catalogs, pamphlets, and other related literature is maintained. International Students and Scholars Advising; verifies immigration status, interprets immigration laws and immigration forms to foreign students, faculty, and scholars. American students planning to study abroad should also make their plans through this office. Minority Student Advising: is an effort to meet the needs of students entering the University who demonstrate that additional support services are needed. Incoming freshman minority students may elect to take part in a \"Summer Enrichment Pro\u00ad gram\" held on campus for a month (3 credits). Center for Career Development: assists students who are exploring a variety of 38 GENERAL INFORMATION | 39 potential career options early in their academic careers. A library of career informa\u00ad tion and school catalogues is maintained. Veterans Affairs Advising: advises students of their G.I. Bill benefits in education. Counseling and referral on academic matters are available to veterans. CHANGE OF ENROLLMENT A student may add courses during the first three weeks of classes and may drop courses without academic penalty during the first three weeks of classes. After the first week of classes, the instructor may refuse to allow the add if certain material may not be made up and the loss of this work would seriously affect the quality of educa\u00ad tional experience gained by the student in the course. Courses dropped after the third week (except if the student is enrolled by administrative error) will be included in the student's record on a \"Withdrawn passing\" or \"Withdrawn failing\" basis. Change of enrollment forms may be obtained from the Registrar's Office. PASS \u2014NO PASS PASS \u2014 NO PASS course enrollments were approved by the University Senate for implementation in September, 1968. The action was taken in two parts: FIRST, that any degree program student, not on academic trial, be permitted to take as many as six courses (three courses for two-year students; or as many courses as he/she has semesters remaining for future transfer students) during his/her undergraduate career on a pass-no pass basis, beginning in his/her sophomore year (second semester of his/her first year for two-year students). These courses may not in\u00ad clude any required by the student's major department, either for the major or for the degree. Only free electives (without condition) may be taken as pass-no pass. This op\u00ad tion may not be used for electives within the distribution requirements of a college or department. Students who have enrolled in ineligible distribution elective courses on a pass-no pass basis prior to September 1,1974, shall not be penalized. The student must complete all work normally required in these courses and he/she will receive full credit toward graduation for passing them. The instructor will NOT be informed of the stu\u00ad dent's status and the Registrar will record grades of \"D\" or higher as PASS and grades of \"F\" as NO PASSlNeiftOT^Fj<no^NF|grgjjjgj[yi>a2gjiyJia1fltu^raJ^l grad^jjjgtaverageJ I SECOND, that the following addition was approved by the Faculty Senate in January, 1974: \"Physical education (activity) courses, whether taken to fulfill a re\u00ad quirement or as electives, will be available to students on a pass-no pass basis and shall not be counted as part of the six (6) standard courses described above.\" Procedure \u2014 1. Obtain a PASS \u2014 NO PASS Request Form from the Registrar's Office and consult your academic advisor. 2. Obtain your advisor's endorsement that the request conforms to the policy established by the University Senate. Any question about a course or courses being appropriately elected as pass-no pass for a student will be resolved by the student's college dean. 3. Submit your request to be placed on pass-no pass status at the Registrar's Office during die first week of the semester. Requests to be removed from that status must be filed during the same period. Note: Non-degree students cannot take courses on pass-no pass basis. AUDITING COURSES With the approval of the dean/director and the instructor concerned, a regularly enrolled student carrying a normal program may audit a course. Others who do not wish to receive credit, or who have not met admission requirements, may also register as auditors. Auditors have no claim on the time or service of the instructor and no grade credit is given for the work. Tuition is charged at the applicable rate. Under no 40 | GENERAL INFORMATION circumstances will a change be made after the enrollment period to allow credit for courses audited. The approval of the Director of Evening Division and Summer Session is necessary for auditing courses in those divisions. REPEATED COURSES A student who repeats a course loses any previous credit on record for that course. The previous grade remains on the student's permanent academic record and is in\u00ad cluded in computing his/her cumulative grade average. ATTENDANCE Class Attendance \u2014 Every student is expected to attend all regularly scheduled classes. This is a major responsibility of the student toward himself/herself and toward the University. The primary penalty for non-attendance lies in the student's lessened grasp of the subject matter of the course. It is the responsibility of the student to inform the instructor regarding reason for absence from class. Absence from Classes \u2014 Each department is to inform all students in its classes at the beginning of each semester of its policy for handling absences and the penalties that may be imposed. Failure to do any work for which a grade is given, if due to unexcused absence, may result in a failing grade for that particular work. TARDINESS A student not present at the beginning of an exercise may be marked absent. RIGHT OF APPEAL Any student who believes that he/she has been unfairly treated in regard to absences may appeal to his/her academic dean/director. PRIORITY OF UNIVERSITY EXERCISES University academic responsibilities have priority over other campus events. Atten\u00ad dance at: 1. regularly scheduled classes have priority over specially scheduled common hour examinations. 2. common hour examinations have priority over attendance at other activities. FINAL EXAMINATIONS REGULATIONS 1. The examination period at the end of each semester is set by the official Univer\u00ad sity calendar. 2. Semester examinations shall be given only during the regular examination period except by permission of the dean/director of the college/school on request of the chairperson of the department. No examination shall be given during the last week of the semester except lab exams given in courses with specific lab sections. 3. The time and place of each final examination are determined by the Registrar and a schedule is circulated and posted. Any change in the scheduled time or place may be requested by the chairperson of the department concerned, when conditions seem to warrant such special arrangement. Decision on such requests rests wi th the Registrar. 4. In every course in which a final examination is given, every student shall take the examination unless excused by the instructor. 5. A student who is absent from a final examination for any reason must report that fact and the reason, in person or in writing, to his/her instructor within twenty-four hours. If the absence is due to any situation beyond the reasonable control of the student, (e.g., illness or family tragedy) the instructor must provide the student with the opportunity to complete the course requirements. At the instructor's discretion, this may be an examination or some other suitable GENERAL INFORMATION | 41 project. The instructor may require evidence in support of the student's reason for absence. 6. If the absence is not reported as provided above, or is not excused by the instruc\u00ad tor, the examination is regarded as failed. GRADES Grades are reported and recorded as letter grades. Averages are calculated from quality point equivalents. A Excellent 4 points per semester hour B Good 3 points per semester hour C Fair 2 points per semester hour DPoor 1 point per semester hour F Failure 0 points per semester hour Other grades are: AU Audit. Inc. Incomplete. This grade applies to work of acceptable quality when the full amount is not completed because of illness or emergency. It can be awarded only with the permission of the student's college/school dean/director. The dean/director may set the limit of time when the work of the course is to be completed. In no case shall this time be set longer than the beginning of the corresponding semester of the next academic year. XC Extended Course. This grade is awarded at the end of the semester to a student who is enrolled in an identified course, the nature of which makes it unreasonable or impossible for the student to complete the required work within the regular semester. NP, Not Passed, not used in grade point average computation. P Passed, not used in grade point average computation. W Withdrawn, without ponalty; not uood in grade point avorogo computation. WF Withdrawn, failing. This grade is weighted as an \"F\" in the computation of the grade point average. M Missing \u2014 Grade not turned in by the Instructor. UjP /r CLASS^TANDING The designation of a student's class shall be determined by the number of credits completed. The divisions are as follows: Freshman 0 - 28.9 credit hours Sophomore 30.0 - 59.9 credit hours Junior 60.0 - 89.9 credit hours Senior 90.0 and over credit hours TRANSCRIPTS Currently enrolled, as well as former undergraduate and graduate students, may ob\u00ad tain an official transcript of their permanent academic record by writing or telephon\u00ad ing the Office of the Registrar, 363 Waterman Building (802) 656-2045.

The University reserves the right to withhold registration material and all informa\u00ad tion regarding the record of any student who is in arrears in the payment of fees or other charges, including student loans and dining and housing charges. ACCESS TO RECORDS Students have the right to review any of their educational records maintained by the University. Students also have the right to have all educational records maintained in a confidential manner. In appropriate situations, students may choose to waive some or all of these protections, but such waivers must be clearly s tated in writing. If a student 42 | GENERAL INFORMATION feels an educational record to be misleading, or containing information which is inac\u00ad curate, a hearing may be scheduled to seek appropriate modification. Requests for review of records should be made to the Registrar. HONORS The Bachelor's and Associate's degrees may be conferred with honors, by vote of the Senate, in recognition of general high standing in scholarship. Three grades are distinguished and indicated by inscribing on the diploma the words cum laude, magna cum laude, or summa cum la ude. Honors are determined in the following manner: Within the graduating class of each college or school, students in the top one percent will receive summa cum laude; the following three percent will receive magna cum laude; the next six percent will receive cum laude. The total number of honors awarded will not exceed ten percent of the graduating class of each school or college. Honors will be calculated on all grades received at this university. In order to be eligible for eonsideration, a student must have taken at least sixty hours (thirty hours for two-year programs) at this university in which a letter grade of A, B, C, D, or F has been awarded. DEAN'S LIST The deans/directors of the undergraduate colleges/schools publish at the beginning of each semester the names of those full-time students who stood in the top 20% of each class of their college/school during the preceding semester. Full-time enrollment in this case shall amount to a minimum of twelve-credit hours in courses in which grades of A, B, C, D or F have been given. STUDENT LEAVE OF ABSENCE POLICY A leave of absence means that a student who is eligible for continued enrollment ceases to be enrolled while in good standing and is guaranteed readmission. This policy benefits both the student and the University in that it enableB a student to plan on readmission to the University and allows the University, by having records on the expected date of return of its students, to refine further the planning of the size of the student body. The following statements further define a leave of absence; a. Upon application to his or her academic dean/director a student may be granted a leave of absence by that dean/director when that application merits the commitment of the University to insure the student's readmission. b. A leave of absence must be granted for a finite period of time. c. A leave of absence normally may not exceed four semesters. d. A leave of absence normally may not be granted for the current semester after the day on which courses can be dropped without penalty. e. A leave of absence may not be granted to students currently on academic trial or disciplinary probation. f. A leave of absence is distinct from withdrawing for medical reasons and is not granted for medical reasons. g. A leave of absence does not guarantee housing upon the student's return. h. A leave of absence guarantees readmission to the student's college/school in the University, if the student confirms his or her intent to return by the closing date for a normal readmission application (October 31 and March 31 preceding the appropriate semester). i. While on a leave of absence, an individual's student status is temporarily ter\u00ad minated. A leave of absence guarantees an individual's readmission only if he or she takes the appropriate action. j. Financial aid awarded but not used prior to a leave of absence will not be carried over. Reapplication for aid for the readmission period must be made according to normal Office of Financial Aid policies and procedures applicable to that period. k. A leave of absence should be confirmed by the appropriate form signed by both the student and the dean/director of the college/school involved. GENERAL INFORMATION | 43 WITHDRAWAL A student who wishes to withdraw from college must first notify his/her academic dean/director in person or in writing. READMISSION Any degree student who has left school for one semester or more must write to his/her dean's/director's office to request readmission. Students must apply for read- mission by October 31 or March 31 preceding the appropriate semester of return. LOW SCHOLARSHIP The information below describes the general University regulations for low scholar\u00ad ship standing. The Studies Committee of each college/school may determine additional or supplementary requirements. Students with questions regarding their academic standing should consult with their college/school dean/director. 1. \"On Trial\" \u2014 a. \"On trial\" is an intermediate status between good standing and dismissal. The student remains enrolled according to stated academic conditions of his/her college/school. b. A student is placed \"on trial\" by the dean/director or the designated committee of the college/school concerned. Special academic conditions may be set in each case. Normally the period of \"trial\" status is one semester. c. The circumstances under which a student is placed \"on trial\" are as follows: (1) Any student who is readmitted to the University after having been dismissed for low scholarship re-enters \"on trial.\" (2) Generally a student is placed \"on trial\" if in any semester he/she has failed half or more of the hours of his/her enrollment but has been permitted to con\u00ad tinue in college/school. (3) A student whose record has been consistently below the graduating average or generally unsatisfactory in any semester may be placed \"on trial\" or con\u00ad tinued \"on trial\" even though he/she does not come within the provisions of Section (2). d. A student who has earned fewer than thirty semester hours of credit and is \"on trial\" is barred from participation in all athletic and other student activities. 2. Separation \u2014 a. A student is dismissed from the University if he/she receives grades below pass\u00ad ing in one-half or more of the semester hours of his/her enrollment in any semester unless he/she is allowed to continue by action of the designated committtee. b. A student who fails to meet the condition of his /her trial or whose record has been unsatisfactory and consistently below the graduation average may be dismissed for low scholarship even though he/she does not come within the provision above. c. A student dismissed for low scholarship must address his/her application for readmission to the college/school taking the action. d. Any student dismissed for academic or disciplinary reasons must receive written approval from his/her previous academic dean/director {or the Dean of Students for disciplinary cases) before enrolling in any University course. INTERCOLLEGE TRANSFERS A student who is or has been a member of any college/school of this University may transfer to another college/school of the University only with the consent of the deans/directors of the two colleges/schools concerned. In the case of veterans receiv\u00ad ing educational benefits through the Veterans Administration, the change must also be approved by the advisor to veterans in the Center for Career Development. 44 | GENERAL INFORMATION UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Degrees are conferred on the recommendation of the colleges/schools and specific requirements will be found in the sections devoted to the respective colleges/schools. In addition to the course requirements of the curricula, students must also fulfill the general requirements in physical education. To be eligible for graduation, a student must have attained a cumulative average sufficient to meet the minimum requirements for the college/school in which the stu\u00ad dent is officially enrolled. Grades in courses accepted for transfer credit are excluded in computing this average. Every candidate for a degree is required to have taken 30 of the last 42 semester hours of credit (15 of the last 21 for two-year students) in residence at the University except that those who have completed three years of premedical study in the Univer\u00ad sity are awarded their degrees after successful completion of one year of study in any approved college of medicine. Other exceptions to this rule may be made only on recommendation of the Academic Council and in cases of undue hardship. To qualify for a second bachelor's degree the candidate must have fulfilled all the requirements for the degree and must have taken a full year of work, usually thirty hours, in addition to that taken to qualify for the first degree. PHYSICAL EDUCATION One year of physical education, normally completed during the freshman or sophomore years, is required of all undergraduate students in four-year programs. The two credits earned in activities classes will be included in the total number of hours required for graduation. Students may opt to take activities classes on a pass-no pass basis. (For further details see the pass-no pass heading under General Informa\u00ad tion.) Medical examinations are required of all new students. Those with serious defects may be given restricted work or may be excused by the Director of University Health Services. The Physical Education requirement for students pursuing two-year degree programs shall be one credit of course work earned in activities instruction. Students twenty-five years of age or older are exempt from physical education re\u00ad quirements. UNIVERSITY RESPONSIBILITY Many courses involve instruction in and the use of various types of power equip\u00ad ment, laboratory apparatus, and specialized facilities. The University takes every precaution to provide competent instruction and supervision of such courses. It is ex\u00ad pected that students will cooperate by following instructions and exercising precau\u00ad tion. In case an accident does occur resulting in personal injury, the University can assume no responsibility except for medical care that is provided by the University Health Service. USE OF ENGLISH Correct English usage is demanded by all departments of the University. Written work of any kind which is unsatisfactory in manuscript form, grammar, punctuation, spelling, or effectiveness of expression may be penalized, regardless of contents. Students whose written work falls below the standard of correct usuage may be re\u00ad ferred to the English department for additional instruction, even though the freshman course in English has been passed. Before they may be admitted to the University, foreign students must offer evidence that they are capable of reading and writing English on the college level. STUDENT HEALTH INSURANCE Through an arrangement with a commercial insurance company, students are able to procure a student health insurance policy. Married students may procure coverage for their spouse and children. Further details may be obtained from the University Health Service. GENERAL INFORMATION | 45 POLICY STATEMENT ON DISCRIMINATION As a public institution, the University of Vermont opens its doors and facilities to any student on the basis of his or her character and ability and irrespective of race, religion, ethnic origin, sex, or handicap. In addition, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. No person shall be excluded from participation in or denied the benefits of any program or activity at the University on such a basis. Students, either individually or in groups, who are unable to resolve a grievance arising out of sex discrimination may have a hearing before a special committee appointed by the Presi\u00ad dent. Persons wishing to pursue this course of action may contact the President's Office. ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE The University expects each student to maintain high standards of personal conduct and social responsibility at all times both on and off campus. All students, as respon\u00ad sible citizens, are required to ob serve and to share in the support of all local, state and federal regulations. Any student who fails to uphold these standards is subject to disciplinary action by the University. The disciplinary authority of the University is vested in the President. In such cases as he/she considers proper, this authority may be delegated to the several deans/direc\u00ad tors and to appropriate judicial bodies. The continuance of each student at the Univer\u00ad sity, the receipt by him/her of academic credits, his/her graduation and the conferring of any degree or the granting of any certificate are strictly subject to the disciplinary powers of the University. The University is free to cancel his/her registration at any time on any grounds, if it considers such action to be for the welfare of the institution. University policy on the above matters is explained in detail in \"The Cat's Tale: A Student's Guide to the University of Vermont,\" Each student is held responsible for knowledge and observance of these rules and regulations. UNIVERSITY RESIDENCY REGULATIONS The Vermont Legislature has established a lower rate of tuition for students who are Vermont residents. Such a policy appears to have as its objective the attempt to more evenly distribute the cost of operating and supporting the University of Vermont be\u00ad tween Vermont residents whose taxes have previously supported the University and non-residents who have not done so. The Legislature has stated that enrollment at an institution for higher learning or presence within the state for purposes of attending an institution of higher learning shall not constitute residence for tuition purposes. IN-STATE STATUS REGULATIONS Adopted by the Board of Trustees, December 14,1974 Amended, December 2,1978 The following requirements must be met by a student prior to being granted resident status for the purpose of admission, tuition and other University charges: 1. The applicant shall be domiciled in Vermont, said domicile having been con\u00ad tinuous for one year prior to the date of application for a change in residency status. Changes in residency status shall become effective for the semester following the date of application. 2. Domicile shall mean a person's true, fixed and permanent home, to which he/she intends to return when absence. A residence established for the purpose of at\u00ad tending an educational institution or qualifying for resident status for tuition pur\u00ad poses shall not of itself constitute domicile. Domicile shall not be determined by the applicant's marital status. 3. The applicant must demonstrate such attachment to the community as would be typical of a permanent resident of his/her age and education. 46 | GENERAL INFORMATION 4. Receipt of financial support from the applicant's family will create a rebuttable presumption that the applicant's domicile is with his/her family. 5. An applicant becoming a student at an institution of higher learning in Vermont within one year of first moving to the state shall have created a rebuttable presumption of residence in Vermont for the purpose of attending an educational institution. 6. A student who is eligible for tuition purposes to enroll as a resident student in another state shall not be enrolled as a \"Vermont Resident.\" 7. A student enrolling at the University of Vermont shall be classified by the appro\u00ad priate officer (designated by the President], as a resident or non-resident for admission and tuition purposes. The decision by the officer shall be based upon information furnished by the student and other relevant information. The officer is authorized to require such written documents, affidavits, verifica\u00ad tions or other evidence as he/she deems necessary. 8. The burden of proof shall in all cases rest upon the student claiming to be a Ver\u00ad mont resident and shall be met upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence. 9. The decision of the officer on the classification of a student as a resident or non\u00ad resident may be appealed in writing to the Committee on Residence whose decision shall be final. The College of Agriculture Agricultural Economics Agricultural Technology Animal Science Biochemical Science Biological Science Botany \u2014 Agriculture Dairy Technology Environmental Studies (Coordinate Major) General Studies Occupational & Extension Education Plant and Soil Science Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Science The College of Agriculture performs four public functions: it teaches resident students, investigates problems, brings information to the peo\u00ad ple, and performs related services. These four areas of work are performed by the resident instruction division, the research division (Vermont Agricultural Experiment Station), the extension division (Vermont Cooperative Extension Service), and the Related Services Division. The curricula of the resident instruction division prepare students for professional careers. Upon receiving the bachelor's degree, students usual\u00ad ly enter management, specialized services, education, or research \u2014 all these in areas related to agriculture, basic biological sciences, conserva\u00ad tion, and international service. The evolution of society necessitates continual progress and change. Thus the challenge of preparing students to excel now, yet adjust to future changes, is being met through programs designed to give a foundation both in the social sciences and the humanities plus a fundamental technical education. All programs in the College of Agriculture leading to the Bachelor of Science degree require 120 semester hours of prescribed and elective courses, plus two credit hours in physical education. The normal semester program includes fifteen to eighteen credit hours of courses. In each area of study certain courses are prescribed, with allowance made for the election of additional courses, to provide a well-balanced and integrated educational program and to insure reasonable concentration. Faculty advisors counsel students in the selection of elective courses and educational problems. The College of Agriculture awards the degree of Bachelor of Science in each of the following programs: PROGRAMS OF STUDY Agricultural Economics Agricultural Technology Botany Dairy Technology Environmental Studies (Coordinate Major) General Studies Occupational and Extension Education Plant and Soil Science Animal Sciences Biochemical Science Biological Science 47 48 | THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE The programs are broad and flexible, with sufficient areas of concentration and electives to meet the specific needs and desires of the student. Therefore, responsible departmental advising is important in the development of each student's program. Every candidate for a degree, in consultation with his/her advisor, must choose one of the above programs upon entering the college. The candidate must then fulfill the re\u00ad quirements stated below. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS A. The successful completion of a minimum of 120 credit hours of course work plus two credit hours in physical education. B. A minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.00 (Students admitted prior to Fall 1978 are still under 1.70 minimum.) C. The successful completion of at least two courses in each of the following areas: 1. Writing, communication and public address 2. Science, mathematics and statistics 3. Fine arts, philosophy, language and literature 4. Social sciences D. Courses as specified in individual programs. Applicability of courses to specific areas will rest with the advisor and if necessary, with the concurrence of the dean of the college. It is further recommended that courses chosen to fulfill these requirements be taken outside the department in which the stu\u00ad dent's program of study is located. Students desiring to complete teacher education programs and teacher certification must apply for admission to Teacher through the Vocational Education and Technology Department prior to their junior year and enroll in appropriate courses in the College of Education and Social Services (see College of Education and Social Services.) Preprofessiorial Preparation Students who are striving for admission to professional colleges such as dentistry, medicine and veterinary medicine can meet the undergraduate requirements for these programs through enrollment in the College of Agriculture. Those interested in human medical sciences usually enroll in biological sciences while individuals interested in veterinary medicine usually enroll in either animal sciences or biological sciences. Any student indicating a specific professional interest will be assigned a faculty advisor knowledgeable in that area. Competition for places in professional schools is very keen and a superior academic record throughout an undergraduate program is necessary to receive consideration for admission. Due to this intense competition, all potential candidates are encouraged to also complete the requirements in an area of secondary interest. Students applying to the College of Agriculture, and expressing an interest in medicine or preveterinary medicine, should present evidence of high performance in high school level science and math courses, plus additional supporting documentation such as high SAT scores and strong letters of recommendation. Biological Sciences Core Students initially interested in the broad area of biological sciences may enroll in this core curriculum for the freshman and sophomore years. The curriculum is designed to permit students to continue in basic biology or to transfer to one of the THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE | 49 applied biology programs. In addition to the general college requirements listed, students should complete during the first two years the following courses or their equivalents: Biology 1, 2 or Zoology 9 and Botany 4; Math 19, 20 or Math 21; Chem 3, 16 or Chem 1, 2 and 16 or Chem 1, 2 and 131,132; Microbiology and Biochemistry 55 (Microbiology). Course descriptions are listed under the appropriate departments. Programs available upon completion of the core curriculum are listed below. Students may wish to select offerings from these programs during the freshman and sophomore years in addition to the required courses stated above. Freshman & Sophomore Years: Take Biological Science Core Junior & Senior Years: Continue in Biological Science or transfer to Animal Science, Biochemical Science*, Botany or Plant and Soil Science * See Microbiology & Biochemistry A description of programs and concentrations follows. They are in alphabetical order along with the other programs of the College.

RESOURCE ECONOMICS For a description of the program in Resource Economics, refer to the School of Natural Resources. Each student majoring in programs offered with this department shall successfully complete a minimum of eight semester courses in Animal Science, including at least five of advanced standing. Additional courses must be selected in consultation with the departmental advisors in order that the selected program can be individualized to more nearly meet the professional aims and goals of the student. DAIRY TECHNOLOGY This program has been designed to provide the scientific, technical, and practical instruction necessary to prepare the graduate for the numerous positions available in the dairy and food science field. The students who elect to place greater emphasis on the scientific aspect of Dairy Technology will find that they are prepared to work in quality control, research laboratories, and to do graduate study in dairy and food chemistry or bacteriology. The student who desires to place greater emphasis on business and the social sciences may become qualified for numerous supervisory and management positions in the dairy and food industry. BASIC ANIMAL SCIENCE This program has been designed specifically for those individuals who are interested in careers in industrial research and development or university positions. The students who elect this program will be provided with the strong science background that is necessary for advanced study in such areas as physiology, nutrition, genetics, veterinary medicine, and related biological fields. ANIMAL TECHNOLOGY This program provides formal training in the theories and practices of the animal sciences with special emphasis on management and technical competence. It prepares the student for employment as a farm owner, manager, or field work with state and federal extension services, breed associations, hatcheries, farm organizations, and various commercial companies. ANIMAL INDUSTRY This program is primarily for those students who are in\u00ad terested in business. It prepares them for supervisory and management positions in in\u00ad dustries related to Animal Science, such as those involved with the processing and sales of dairy, meat and poultry products; feed and fertilizer companies; farm equip\u00ad ment and supply agencies; advertising and public relations; and other areas of public service. Animal Sciences 52 | THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE Biological Science This program is designed to provide flexibility in developing a background in biological sciences. Students may fulfill their course requirements by selecting basic and applied courses from the several biologically oriented departments (Animal Science, Botany, Microbiology and Biochemistry, Plant and Soil Science, Zoology, and others). Graduates of the program may continue their education in graduate school or pro\u00ad fessional schools or they may obtain employment in a variety of areas. Possible job opportunities would include basic and applied research in educational institutions and governmental agencies, technical writing, employment with environmental con\u00ad sultants, etc. The following courses are required of all students in the Biological Science program following completion of the core requirements: genetics (one semester), biochemistry (one semester), physics (two semester sequence), and statistics (one semester). In addi\u00ad tion, all students must take six additional courses in basic or applied biology. These courses should be selected to include at least one course in botany or applied plant science, one course in zoology or applied animal science, one course in the area of evolution and diversity of life, one course in ecology, and two courses in physiology or biochemistry. Of these, at least one or more courses at the 200 level should be in\u00ad cluded. These courses are selected in consultation with the advisor from the diverse offerings of the various colleges and departments. Botany Students in the Colleges of Agriculture or Arts and Sciences may major in Botany. Each undergraduate plans a program in consultation with a personal departmental ad\u00ad visor. The emphasis on flexibility permits a choice of electives when planning for each individual's career. Cross-disciplinary study is encouraged as Botany, a fundamental science, is the base upon which education, research, and careers in both applied and basic plant science is built. Many students aim specifically for careers that do not re\u00ad quire formal education beyond the Bachelor's degree, e.g., preparation for numerous positions in: agriculture, business, education, administration, government, industry, medicine, research, or their own businesses. Many other students prepare themselves for graduate education and professional careers requiring advanced degrees, e.g., careers in botany, biology, medicine, dentistry, agriculture, biochemistry, or en\u00ad vironmental sciences. In either case, close attention is given to increasing the student's choices after college. Students are also encouraged in their senior year to enrich their botanical experience through individualized, original research and study with faculty members. Areas of interest include: anatomy, cell botany, cytology, ecology, phycology, physiology, plant development, plant pathology, and taxonomy. Required courses: Mathematics 22; or Mathematics 21 and Statistics; or Mathematics 19, 20, and Statistics, Physics 11,12 or preferably 15,16; Chemistry 16 or preferably 131,132; Biology 1,2; Botany 101,104,107,108, and 109 or 160; two ad\u00ad ditional semester courses in Botany, one at the 200 level. Botany 4 and Zoology 9 may be substituted for Biology 1,2. Six hours of modern foreign language are strongly recommended, students may peti\u00ad tion the department to substitute other courses for certain requirements in the plan\u00ad ning of individual programs. THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE | 53 Environmental Studies The College of Agriculture participates in the interdisciplinary University En\u00ad vironmental Program as described on page 127. Most students select the Coordinate Major Program and fulfill the requirements in one of the major programs available in the College. General Studies This program is designed for students seeking a general rather than a specialized knowledge in the field of agriculture and related subjects. Through the proper selec\u00ad tion of electives, a student m ay choose an area of concentration w ithin the college and also select courses that contribute to a liberal education. Required: In addition to the basic College requirements each student must satisfac\u00ad torily complete forty credit hours in the College of Agriculture, twenty of which must be at the 100 level or above. All additional courses must be selected in consultation with and have the approval of the student's advisor. Microbiology and Biochemistry BIOCHEMICAL SCIENCE Contemporary biology increasingly demands knowledge of events at the molecular level. Students who plan a career of research or teaching in biology are well-advised to concentrate on the principles and methods of biochemistry during their undergraduate years. To this end the program in \"Biochemical Science\" provides a coordinated sequence of study in chemistry, biology, and biochemistry. Depending on the student's future plans and capability, three areas of concentration are possible: (1) Cellular Biochemistry which emphasizes the physiological and metabolic reactions of organisms; (2) Molecular Biology which focuses on the chemical and physical structures of subcellular particles; and (3) Nutritional Biochemistry which emphasizes the synthesis and utilization of nutrients. Specialization in one of these concentrations normally commences in the Junior Year after completion of the Biological Sciences Core (pg 48). Students are required to complete a minimum of three hours of physical chemistry {or eight hours for the Molecular Biology option), twelve hours of biochemistry and three advanced biology courses, two of which would be in their specialty (e.g., Nutrition, Physiology, Genetics, etc.). Plant and Soil Science The Plant and Soil Science program is designed for students interested in hor\u00ad ticultural crops, agronomic crops, soils, and insect pest management as they relate to the science of food, feed, and fiber production or to recreation and the environment The program is flexible and allows students to place their primary emphasis in either science or agri-business. Suggested groupings of courses have been developed by the department to be used as guides for students interested in General Plant and Soil Science, Soil Science, Plant Science, Ornamental Horticulture and Landscape Design, Horticultural Therapy, and Insect Pest Management. Specific courses, in addition to the core courses, are worked out between the student and the advisor. All students majoring in Plant and Soil Science must take Principles of Plant Science, Introductory Soil Science, Plant and Soil Career Orientation, Soil Fertility and Management, one semester of Seminar, two semesters of Chemistry (one semester of inorganic and one semester of organic), one semester of Mathematics or Statistics, Plant Pathology, and Insect Pest Management. A minimum of 6 additional courses in 54 | THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE Plant and Soil Science at the 100 level or above are required, to be selected in the stu\u00ad dent's area of interest and approved by his or her advisor.

The overall mission of the College of Arts and Sciences is to provide the highest possible caliber of undergraduate general education in the liberal arts and sciences. This ranges from the utilization of intellectual tools and skills (articulative, quantitative, scientific and creative) to the theoretical 57 58 | THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES exploration of man and his natural, social and cultural environment. It is accomplished through critical analysis, which the educated mind is trained to bring to bear upon that environment and interrelationships among elements of the environment and student's years on campus and thereafter. The core missions are: \u2014 To provide opportunities for undergraduates to concentrate in specific disciplinary approaches (i.e., majors), which may lead to pre-professional preparation, graduate studies, general education as a citizen who con\u00ad tributes to rather than draws upon the society, or a combination of these. \u2014 To provide through distribution requirements an awareness of how the diverse intellectual, cultural and creative aspects of the liberal arts and sciences approach the study of man and his environment: The humanities, through the study of the great individual creative geniuses of mankind, past and present, in literature, the arts and philosophy. The performing arts, by providing opportunities for self expression through active participation in fields such as music, art, theatre and creative writing. The social sciences, through their focus upon the human experience and behavior, individual and collective, via the application of analytical methods and their concern with the human species and its relationships with the various environments evolved through time, and with the diversity of the human conditions at any time. The natural sciences, through an understanding of the order of nature, the organization of the universe from the microcosm to the macrocosm, their relationship to man and his powers of observation, imagination, ratiocination and consequent understanding and appreciation of the scope, logic, precision and limitations of scientific methods, principles and challenges. \u2014 Further, to provide graduate training in selected areas in which local, regional or national needs coincide with and complement strengths of par\u00ad ticular undergraduate departments or programs, as well as in selected areas where our position as an institution of higher learning benefits in\u00ad tellectually and educationally from the presence of more specialized, rigorous and advanced study for the further development of educated mind. \u2014 To carry out quality scholarly activity and research as a continuing con\u00ad tribution to the world's knowledge and understanding of humanity and the universe. As a necessary prerequisite to the maintenance, of the intellectual competence required of a faculty providing an environment for mutual in\u00ad tellectual stimulation, curiosity, and growth. It must be emphasized that the integrity of the whole College effort re\u00ad quires the continued emphasis on the excellence of each of the missions above.

A student not on trial who fails (F, NP, WF) half or more of his/her credits (not in\u00ad cluding Physical Education and Military Studies) during any semester is dismissed for low scholarship unless he/she is permitted to continue by action of the Committee on Academic Standing. VIII. COMMITTEE ON ACADEMIC STANDING The Committee on Academic Standing reviews all requests for special considera\u00ad tion in regard to College regulations, changes in enrollment, curriculum stand\u00ad ards, and graduation requirements. Students may petition to this Committee through the Dean's Office. IX. MAJORS: DEPARTMENTAL REQUIREMENTS For the Bachelor of Arts degree the major field must include a minimum of 36 semester hours, at least 18 of which must be in the major discipline. Concentration requirements, including courses and necessary prerequisites may not exceed 60 semester hours. For the Bachelor of Science degree the major field must include a minimum of 36 semester hours, at least 18 of which must be in the major discipline. No more than 94 semester hours of the total program, including distribution re\u00ad quirements and major field, may be in specifically designated courses. ANTHROPOLOGY 27 hours in Anthropology including 21 and two of the following three: 24, 26,50. In addition, 225,228, and four other advanced courses. Every student must take at least three courses in other disciplines related to anthropology. Consult the Department on this last point. AREA AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES Entering students are invited to consider the option of concentrating in Area and International Studies. Courses in several academic disciplines can be combined so as to focus on a particular area of the world, thus providing an opportunity to test generalizations against the particular reality of a geographical area and its people. Undergraduates who major in Area Studies usually accumulate sufficient credit to enable them to also fulfill department requirements in one of the social sciences, humanities, or foreign languages. The four areas presently available for concentration are: CANADA, LATIN AMERICA, RUSSIA/EAST EUROPE, EUROPE (Western, Northern, Mediterranean). Courses in ASIAN Area Studies are available to interested students as indicated on the following page. However, they are not currently being offered as a major field of concentration. This relatively novel method of undergraduate education combines exposure to the traditional disciplines with integrative knowledge and appreciation of a foreign culture and thus combines the broad liberal arts education with a more specific area competence. Students who plan on majoring in Area Studies should take during their freshman and/or sophomore years the required foreign language courses of the selected area, as well as humanities, which are beginning courses in the social sciences and humanities which are prerequisites of subsequent required courses and do also meet the general distribution requirements. Students interested in concentrating in Area Studies are urged to contact the Direc\u00ad tor, Area and International Studies, Extension4062. Specific requirements of the individual programs (with the exception of ASIAN) are as follows: THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES | 63 ASIAN STUDIES (currently not available as a major field) WESTERNASIA Anthropology 166 Anthropology 170 History 35 History 36 History 105 Religion 114 Religion 116 Religion 145 SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST ASIA Anthropology 163 Anthropology 165 Geography 109 Religion 131 Religion 132 Religion 168 Religion 196 EASTASIA Geography 108 History 131 History 132 Political Science 175 Religion 132 Religion 141 Religion 145 Religion 166 Peoples of the Middle East Pastoral Peoples The Rise of Islam Modern Middle East History of the Ancient Near East Hebrew Scriptures Judaism Primitive Christianity Peoples of Oceania Peoples of South Asia Southeast Asia and India Hindu Tradition Buddhist Tradition (Religion 21, Introduction to Asian Religions, is recommended as a prerequisite.)

Those who have concentrated on a foreign language in I shall offer six hours of a second foreign language at the 100 level or above in addition to the re\u00ad quirements of II. Variants in the language requirement may be made by the advisor, depending upon the area of interest, (e.g., Ancient/Medieval History or Archaeology, where an ancient and a modern language would be required.) IV. The student would, of course, also fulfill the Arts and Sciences general distribution requirements and would be encouraged to do so through a broad selection of courses dealing with Europe. ART Students may major in one of the following: Studio Art Twenty-four hours in studio, including 2, 3, 4, with three different in\u00ad structors; four at the 100 level, and one advanced seminar or tutorial course on the 200 level in the senior year; nine hours in Art History, including 179 proceeded by either 5, 6, or 9, 172; and six hours of related advanced critical, social or creative studies. The Studio area of the Art Department requires that the student present a body of work completed within the Department for critique by three members of the faculty. The intent of this requirement is to give a studio major and the faculty an op\u00ad portunity to identify the student's growth within the Department, and also to have the opportunity to discuss possible future directions open to that student. A student may do this in one of two ways. He/she may choose to have a critique at the end of one of his/her last three semesters before graduation, or he/she may have an exhibition in the Colburn Gallery during that same period. A Studio Art major in the College of Arts and Sciences will not be eligible for graduation unless he/she meets this requirement.

Preprofessional Preparation Students who plan to enter professional colleges requiring previous collegiate preparation will find the variety of courses offered in the College of Arts and Sciences and the freedom of election in that college is such that all the requirements for any pro\u00ad fessional school may be met. Many students will desire so to direct their four-year undergraduate courses as to provide, in addition to a sound general education, appropriate preprofessional training for later work in the medical sciences, law, or theology. Special advising is available in the College for students preparing for careers in education, journalism, law, and medical sciences. BIOLOGY A major in Biology is offered to students enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences. It has been designed for the student who wished to concentrate in Biology while pursuing a liberal arts education. It will also serve as a basis for pro\u00ad grams leading to graduate study in biological fields and as an appropriate major for students in premedical and predental programs. The concentration consists of a year of elementary biology and single-semester courses in genetics, ecology, cellular biology, animal structure and function, and plant structure and development. This core is followed by three elective courses selected from a wide range of offerings in biologically oriented departments at the University. A year of chemistry, a year of physics, and mathematics (calculus or statistics) are also required. JOURNALISM Admission to schools of journalism is generally open to academ\u00ad ically qualified students who hold the Bachelor of Arts degree with concentration in any discipline. Interested students should take a broad program in the liberal arts, in\u00ad cluding work in the social sciences, in mass communication, and in English. LAW American law schools, as a rule, require graduation from a four-year college with a Bachelor's degree prior to admission. There is no prescribed curriculum which is requisite for admission, but the student is advised to develop a command of the English language as well as a comprehension of American politics, social, and economic institutions. For further details, kindly consult: Professor D.N. Hoffman, Department of Political Science; (Department of Sociology); or Professor P.H. Hutton, Department of History. THEOLOGY Graduation from a four-year college is prerequisite for admission to most theological seminaries. Although no prescribed curriculum is demanded as preparation for such professional schools, the student is advised to elect substantially from the departments of languages (particularly classics), history, philosophy and religion, psychology, and social studies. OPTOMETRY The requirements for admission to schools of optometry vary, but typically they include courses in English, mathematics, physics, chemistry and zoology with a minimum of two years of college work. THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES | 73 PHARMACY Under the Regional Plan (page 26) Vermont residents may prepare for pharmacy school at Connecticut or Rhode Island. This is a five-year program with two years of preprofessional work which includes English, mathematics, botany, chemistry, zoology, physics, social science, a course in fine arts, and orientation to pharmacy. MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY The prevailing requirements for admission to an accredited medical college include a minimum of three years of undergraduate work but most institutions recommend four years. It is strongly urged that a student desiring to enter medical college should during his/her sophomore year consult catalogues of colleges to which he/she expects to apply, and arrange to include in his/her program courses required by those schools. Each student, in consultation with his/her advisor, plans a four-year program of courses which will fulfill the requirements for a Bachelor's degree. To meet the minimum requirements of most medical colleges, the program should include the following: Mathematics, one of the following options: a) Mathematics 21, 22 (recommended for able students) b) Mathematics 19, 20 (recommended) c) Mathematics 21 (adequate) d) Mathematics 9,19 (adequate) e) Mathematics 9, 2; 21 or 19, 20 (suggested for students not immediately prepared to enter calculus) f) Mathematics 7,8 (not acceptable) Chemistry, two years minimum, with laboratory Chemistry 1,2 or 11,12 (recommended for potential Chemistry majors) Chemistry 131,132 (required) Physics, one year minimum, with laboratory Physics 15, 16 or 24, 25 (recommended for students concentrating in the physical sciences or engineering) Biology, one year minimum, with laboratory Biology 1,2 Students who enter an accredited medical college after three years (90 hours) of undergraduate work may, on application and after completing one year of medical study, qualify as candidates for a Bachelor of Science degree. The requirements for admission to colleges of dentistry vary, but in all cases include at least three years of college work. (The majority of applicants will have completed four years.) In general, the minimum requirements given above should be used in plan\u00ad ning a program leading to entrance into a dental school. A student should consult catalogues of the dental colleges to which he/she expects to apply in order to make cer\u00ad tain all requirements are met. In general, students should avoid taking courses at the undergraduate level in those areas taught at the professional level: i.e., human anatomy, human physiology, microbiology, biochemistry. Many medical colleges now strongly recommend or require that students enroll in courses in the humanities and social sciences. SECONDARY TEACHING Students in the College of Arts and Sciences may, upon application to the Dean of Education and Social Services, be accepted into the teacher training program for secondary education. Application should be made before the end of the sophomore year. The prescribed courses in education, up to 24 credit hours, can count as electives towards the Bachelor of Arts. Students completing this program are eligible for Secondary Teacher's Certification. 74 | THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES College Honors The honors program at both the junior and senior level is designed for the superior student with unusual initiative and intellectual curiosity, and provides an opportunity to pursue a special project without the restrictions of classroom routine. Such a stu\u00ad dent enters a program of reading, research, or creation under the direction of the department of his/her choice. A student may take honors in either or both years. A student in the College of Arts and Sciences who, at the end of his/her junior year, has an average of 3.00 or above for the work of the sophomore and junior years may become an applicant for college honors in a particular subject. His/her program for the senior year must be approved not later than the end of the junior year by the depart\u00ad ment in which honors are sought and by the Committee on Honors, and he/she must present a satisfactory written report and pass an oral examination on the field of special study. A program called junior honors, which may be considered introductory to but distinct from college honors, is available to juniors who have a sophomore average of 3.00 or above and who have the permission of their department chairperson. The pro\u00ad gram for each junior honors candidate will be determined by the department chairper\u00ad son concerned. Departmental Honors A senior whose overall average is 2.50 or above, or who has been specially recom\u00ad mended by the department in which he/she is concentrating, is eligible to take a com\u00ad prehensive examination. Upon successfully completing the examination he/she will be granted his/her degree \"with Departmental Honors.\" Some departments have in\u00ad stituted seminars or other programs designed to help the student gain the requisite breadth and depth of knowledge. The Center for Area Studies The Center for Area and International Studies is an inter-department activity, with a director and five programs, each of which has its own director. The purposes of the Center are to encourage and coordinate interdisciplinary and comparative study and research for selected foreign areas. The Center also sponsors interdisciplinary seminars and guest lectures. The Center for Area Studies administers the program of concentration in Area Studies and offers the B.A. degree in the College of Arts and Sciences, based on the successful completion of courses in several academic disciplines with concentration in one of five foreign areas: Canada, Latin America, Russia, and Eastern Europe and Western Europe. Requirements for concentration in\u00ad clude the general distribution requirements in the College of Arts and Sciences, the foreign language of the selected area usually through the intermediate level; several options of courses in the social sciences and humanities related to the selected area; and specialized area courses, reading and research, college honors, and area seminars based on team teaching and supervised research. Special courses offered for Area Studies include: \"Introduction \"Seminar.\" The Government Research Center Social Science Research Center The Government Research Center provides research and informational services for students, state and local officials, members of civic groups, and the public. Activities THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES | 75 include: developing opportunities for students to become acquainted with, and to gain practical experience in, the operation of government, maintaining liaison with state and local officials relative to the use of University resources in the study of problems in state and local government, and conducting research projects. The Social Science Research Center is operated by the political science department and the Academic Computing Center as data archives, a research facility, and a teaching resource. The Center is the depository of data sets made available to the University of Vermont by the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research, and also holds several data sets from other sources (including UVM resear\u00ad chers). The Center's historical, social, economic, and political archives are available to any student or faculty member. Computer analysis may be done at the Research Center which contains three terminals and two keypunch machines. Advanced students provide assistance for faculty and student projects. The director of the Center will aid researchers using SPSS (Statistical Packet for the Social Sciences). Many students enrolled in social science courses learn data analysis and use of the computer at the Research Center. Anyone who feels that the Research Center's resources might be of use is urged to drop by or to contact the director.

THE RESPONSIVE TEACHER PROGRAM The Responsive Teacher Program is a two-year concentration for students majoring in elementary, secondary or physical education. This program trains regular classroom teachers with special education skills. The responsive teacher is trained to educate all children through individual teaching/learning procedures. Using a data- based individual model of instruction the responsive teacher learns to set goals for all students and assures that these goals are met by use of individualized instruction and the application of behavior analysis theory. Candidates for the Responsive Teacher Program are chosen at the end of their sophomore year and must meet specified entrance requirements. The cqmpetency based program begins in the fall of the junior year with a consecutive two-year schedule, in addition to the regular elementary or secondary program. Responsive Teachers-in-Training attain competencies in specifying minimum objectives in the basic skill areas, measurement systems, individualized instruction and learning theory. A full-time commitment is expected of each Responsive Teacher-in-Training during the spring semester. Working with a partner, they spend each morning in a classroom where at least one child has been designated as eligible for special educa\u00ad tion services. Each afternoon students engage in course work and seminars designed to increase the rate of learning for Vermont's eligible children. During their senior year Responsive Teachers-in-Training will spend a full semester student teaching in a Ver\u00ad mont classroom that contains at least one child eligible for special educational ser\u00ad vices, Students who successfully complete this program will be recommended for certifica\u00ad tion as regular elementary or secondary teachers, with an endorsement f or Teacher of the Handicapped.

The program requires a nine credit on-campus residency unit. Residency may be fulfilled during any academic semester or summer and is part of the total 30-36 program credits. Further information may be obtained from the College of Education and Social Services Center for Student and Field Ser\u00ad vices, Waterman Building. THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION AND SOCIAL SERVICES | 87 INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION FIELD STUDY The College of Education and Social Services now offers a comparative education field experience in England and has plans to develop programs in other parts of the world. The purpose of these programs is two-fold: 1) to provide an in-depth experience in the educational system of another country; and 2} to give students an opportunity to live in a society different from their own. Traveling abroad has a number of advantages. First, it broadens the outlook of the person involved in the experience whether it be social, educational, or political. Second, it affords one an opportunity to observe people in their indigenous environ\u00ad ment. Third, it allows for an exchange of ideas and philosophies. Finally, it adds a new dimension to one's life in being able to share one's thoughts and feelings with others of a different culture. Specifically, the field experience in England is designed primarily to offer students something more than the usual \"study abroad\" program. In addition to the usual visits to places of local cultural interest, this program offers an opportunity for each student to relate his/her professional needs, interests, goals and aspirations to a specific educational area. Students will have the opportunity to visit many areas of cultural and personal interest but, in addition, will live with a family in the host country and work as a paraprofessional in one or more of the host nation's schools. For further information contact Coordinator, International Education Program, University of Vermont, College of Education and Social Services, Burlington, Vermont 05405. The College of Engineering, Mathematics and Business Administration The College of Engineering, Mathematics and Business Administration offers professional undergraduate programs in the following areas: A. business administration and management science B. engineering, and engineering science C. mathematical sciences. Within each of these broad areas there are a variety of curricula, options, and concentrations designed to satisfy more specific interests. Each of the programs offered by the College provides a basis for professional practice and for further study in the same discipline or in other professional areas; business, law, or medicine, for example. The specific programs and degrees offered are: Business Administration B.S. in Business Administration (for specialty options see p. 94) Engineering and Engineering Science: General B.S. in Engineering (for specialty options see p. 94) Civil Engineering B.S. in Civil Engineering Electrical Engineering B.S. in Electrical Engineering Mechanical Engineering B.S. in Mechanical Engineering Engineering Science (for specialty options see p. 101) B.S. Mathematics (for specialty options see p. 102) B.S. in Mathematics Statistics B.S. in Mathematics Computer Science B.S. in Computer Science Professional Education Graduates of professional schools are expected to fulfill unique and significant roles in planning and directing the work of the world and in effecting and managing change. The primary objective of professional education is, therefore, to develop skill in the \"problem solving art.\" This in\u00ad cludes not only intellectual knowledge of complex and high order, but also the intelligent and intuitive application of that knowledge to the situations of life. Professional graduates must have the ability, the confidence, and the self- discipline to identify and define a problem, break it down into operable com\u00ad ponents, marshal the necessary resources from the natural and social sciences, mathematics and the humanities, and to employ these resources in a systematic, effective, and efficient fashion to derive a useful solution. To enhance and promote these qualities in students, the College's curricula all emphasize the balanced development of conceptual understanding and specific skills. The professional graduate is also often required to act on the basis of in\u00ad complete knowledge and with limited time and resources. The College 88 THE COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, MATHEMATICS AND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION | 89 therefore requires that its students exhibit certain personal qualities in addition to the intellectual achievement expected of all university graduates. Foremost among these are integrity, acceptance of responsi\u00ad bility, and reliability in independent work. The College is also committed to the idea that learning is a life-long endeavor. Our undergraduate programs therefore provide a base upon which students may build as the demands of their professional careers in\u00ad crease and their personal interests broaden. General Requirements and Academic Regulations DIVISIONS The instructional programs of the College of Engineering, Mathematics, and Business Administration are made up of a lower division (the Pre-Professional Program) and a variety of upper divisions curricula (majors). Each upper division cur\u00ad riculum is administered by one of the College's departments or programs, or through the office of the Dean. Admission to the College as a freshman does not guarantee admission to an upper divi\u00ad sion program. In order to enter one of these programs the student must: (a) be in good academic standing in the Pre-Professional Program of the College or in another college/school of the University. Where appropriate, applicants for transfer from colleges outside UVM will be considered for admission to an upper division pro\u00ad gram simultaneously with consideration of their application for admission to the University. (b) meet specific requirements established by the department or program respon\u00ad sible for the upper division curriculum to which they seek admission. These re\u00ad quirements include (1) the completion of specific prerequisite courses, and (2) a minimum grade-point average in these prerequisite courses. PRE-PROFESSIONAL PROGRAM All newly admitted freshmen are assigned to the College's Pre-Professional Pro\u00ad gram. This College-wide activity is conducted by a staff of qualified advisor- counselors and faculty consultants representing the various upper division programs. The objectives of the Pre-Professional Program are not only to advise students with respect to curriculum requirements but also to help them in their adjustment to the col\u00ad lege environment and to provide guidance in choosing an appropriate upper division program. ADMISSION TO UPPER DIVISION PROGRAMS Students admitted to the College as freshmen, and transfer students admitted with less than 30 credits that have been approved by the UVM Registrar for transfer, may apply for admission to an upper division program upon completion of the freshman year (or 30 credits). To be considered for admission, these students must have com\u00ad piled a grade-point average of 2.5 or better in the prerequisite first-year courses specified for the program of their choice. A list of these prerequisite courses may be obtained from the Dean's Office or the Pre-Professional Program Office. Students who are in good standing in the College, but have not satisfied the re\u00ad quirements for admission to an upper division program after completing 30 credits, may continue in the Pre-Professional Program up to a maximum of 60 credits. These students should apply for admission to an upper division program during the spring 90 | THE COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, MATHEMATICS AND B USINESS ADMINISTRATION semester of their sophomore year (or after completing 45 credits). In order to be con\u00ad sidered for admission, they must meet the specific requirements for the program of their choice. Detailed statements of these requirements may be obtained from the Dean's Office, the Pre-Professional Program Office, or the appropriate department or program office. Students who have completed 60 or more credits (including transfer credits) in the Pre-Professional Program and have not been admitted to one of the up\u00ad per division programs, will not be permitted to enroll further in the College. Transfer students from other divisions of UVM, or from other institutions, who have 30 or more transferable credits, should apply for admission to an upper division pro\u00ad gram simultaneously with their application to admission to the College. The criteria for admission of these students are identical with those applying from the Pre-Professional Program. In any year, places in the several upper division programs may be limited by available resources (faculty, laboratory facilities, etc.). In such cases only the most qualified students will be accepted, and some students who have satisfied the minimum requirements (above) may not be admitted. INDIVIDUALLY DESIGNED MAJORS Occasionally students whose interests fall within the overall curricular domain of the College are nevertheless unable to find a program or option which addresses their specific educational objectives. In such cases the student may propose an \"individually designed major.\" Any such proposal must be sponsored by a faculty member who is willing to act as the student's advisor and must be approved by the Studies Committee of the College. Proposals for individually designed majors must be presented to the Dean's Office and approved before the student can be admitted to the upper division of the College. CORE COURSES A group of fundamental, or \"core\", courses is identified in each of the three primary program areas: business, engineering, and mathematics. These courses provide the foundations needed, both for advanced work and for specialization within the respec\u00ad tive fields. Some core courses deal with essential concepts and skills and must be com\u00ad pleted during the first and second years. Others treat material which, though more ad\u00ad vanced, is common to all branches of the field. These courses are found primarily in the second and third years. ELECTIVE S All curricula offered in the College provide elective choices, a part of which must be used to satisfy the College's requirement for a minimum of 18 credit hours in the humanities and social studies.

In addition, students receiving a B.A. degree in Arts and Sciences may specialize in Statistics as a part of their Mathematics major. Statistics is a mathematical science extensively used in a wide variety of fields. Indeed, every discipline which gathers and interprets data uses statistical concepts and procedures to understand the information implicit in their data base. Statisticians become involved in efforts to solve real world problems by developing and-investigating stochastic models, designing surveys and ex\u00ad perimental plans, constructing and interpreting descriptive statistics, and developing 104 | THE COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, MATHEMATICS AND BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION and applying statistical inference procedures. To investigate new statistical pro\u00ad cedures requires a knowledge of mathematics and computing as well as statistical theory. To apply concepts and procedures effectively also calls for an understanding of the field of application. The program is designed for students who plan to enter business, industry, or government as statisticians or plan to continue to graduate school in statistics or a related quantitative field (biostatistics, operations research, demography, biomathematics, etc). The courses and curricula are administered through the Statistics Program Steering Committee which includes faculty from Mathematics, Business Administration, Economics, Psychology, Forestry, Epidemiology and En\u00ad vironmental Health, the Agricultural Experiment Station, and the Academic Com\u00ad puting Center. This broad representation of disciplines affords students excellent opportunities for gaining direct experience in the application of statistics. Students specializing in statistics are required to complete the requirements given above for the B.S. in Mathematics with the following specific requirements: a. Mathematical science courses must include 21 semester hours of statistics in\u00ad cluding 141 or 211,151 or 251,162 or 262,221 or 227 or 229, and 281. b. Allied field courses must include a laboratory science course (8 credits). The stu\u00ad dent in consultation with his/her Statistics Program advisor must plan a sequence of allied field courses consistent with his/her professional and career goals. Students in\u00ad terested in pursuing intensive studies in an area not specifically listed are encouraged to plan a program with their advisor and submit it to the Studies Committee for review and approval. c. Humanities and Social Studies must include English 1 and Communication 11 or 14- Further details on the statistics curriculum may be obtained at the Statistics Pro\u00ad gram Office. COMPUTER SCIENCE Computer Science is one of the mathematical sciences although there are strong ties to electrical engineering. It is the study of the theoretical basis, design and application of electronic computing machines. The program in Computer Science is a new administrative unit at the University. A student interested in majoring in computer science will have a faculty member from the Computer Science Program assigned as advisor. The program offers the B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science. The Computer Science curriculum provides a broad basic training in Computer Science with required courses in the theory of computing, hardware design and soft\u00ad ware techniques.

THE CURRICULUM The curriculum consists of three parts: the Basic Science Core, the Clinical Core, and the Senior Major Program. Basic Science Core Instruction in the Basic Science Core is carried out during the entire first year and a major portion of the second. During this period students are instructed in the basic sciences that undergird clinical medicine. Emphasis is placed on that body of knowledge common to all types of medical practice, avoiding the minute details rele\u00ad vant only to individual specialties. In addition, seminars in Environmental Health, Medical Sociology, Human Sexuality and Human Behavior provide the medical student with an awareness of social, cultural and psychological factors affecting health and illness. The Basic Clerkship introduces the student to one of the most fundamental of all medical skills: clinical observation. This involves learning to interview a patient and perform a physical examination. Clinical Science Core The Clinical Core extends from March of the second year until February of the third year. During this twelve-month period each student receives twelve weeks of instruc\u00ad tion in medicine, twelve weeks of instruction in surgery, eight weeks in pediatrics, eight weeks in obstetrics and gynecology, and eight weeks in psychiatry. There is a brief summer vacation. During this year the student works under the supervision of physicians in the Medical Center Hospital of Vermont, the Champlain Valley Physi\u00ad cians Hospital in Plattsburgh, New York, and the offices of physicians in the commu\u00ad nity in providing primary care to patients. Senior Major Program The final portion of the curriculum, the Senior Major Program, extends through the final one and one-half years prior to graduation. This period is divided into fourteen rotations of one-month duration. The major program enables each student to select that course of study best suited to his/her career objectives. Majors arfe offered in each of the preclinical sciences, plus medicine, family practice, surgery and its subspecialties, obstetrics\u2014gynecology, pediatrics, neurology, psychiatry, and rehabilitation medicine. An integral part of each clinical major includes a number of required clinical and laboratory experiences as well as elective rotations. These elective rotations are not restricted to the disciplines in which the student is majoring and may include approved learning experiences away from Burlington. Many students see this as an opportunity to work and study in a large urban setting, at another medical school or a foreign THE DIVISION OF HEALTH SCIENCES | 109 medical center. Students should anticipate spending variable periods of time away from Burlington in the course of pursuing their required training. A system of faculty advisors has been developed to counsel each student on a one-to-one basis throughout the planning and course of this major program and in anticipation of later graduate education. Although the majority of students elect to pursue a clinical major, students so desiring may commit their entire major program to study in one of the preclinical sciences. While these programs are individualized, it is expected that graduate study and research will form the basis for each. Qualified students may simultaneously enroll in the Graduate College of the University as candidates for the Master of Science degree while fulfilling the requirements for the M.D. degree within the College of Medicine.

It sTeeks to serve the needs of students for sound education and career preparation and the needs of society \u2014 two goals that strengthen one another in practice. The Environmental Program is an interdisciplinary venture involving students and faculty from throughout the University, as well as community professionals, recognizing that study of the environment involves all disciplines and professional fields. Thus, the Program is not a unit of any single college or school of the University, but works cooperatively with a wide range of academic programs and action organizations on campus and in the community. While the Environmental Program attempts to serve a wide array of en\u00ad vironmental interests, its primary focus is the individual student. A Director and interdisciplinary faculty assist students in planning an individualized program of studies which combines a broad, comprehensive understanding of the environment and depth in a specific discipline or profession leading to a future career. Program offices are located in The Bittersweet where students are invited to visit with the staff regarding their academic plans, to gain assistance with research or action projects, and to seek information about community internships and future employment. The Environmental Studies Curriculum The curriculum in Environmental Studies offers students several alternatives leading to an individualized program of studies: The Coordinate Major in Environmen\u00ad tal Studies combines study of the environment with a traditional disciplinary major or professional field. The Major in Environmental Studies provides a unique opportunity for the student seeking an individually-designed interdisciplinary major. Students entering the University may apply for admission to Environmental Studies through several of the undergraduate colleges and professional schools. Choice of the appropriate college or school will depend on the individual's interests and educational objectives or, in the case of the Coordinate Major program, on the major or profes\u00ad sional field to be coordinated with Environmental Studies. It is recommended that in\u00ad coming students consult with the Director of the Environmental Program before mak\u00ad ing application to the University.

Students live in the Living/Learning Center by participating in programs developed either by faculty members in their areas of academic expertise or by students whose program proposals have been accepted for Living/Learning Center support of space, facilities, and budget. Living/Learning Center programs may supplement an existing course of study or define a totally new educational direction, and they must in\u00ad corporate those educational objectives basic to the purpose of the Univer\u00ad sity and the Living/Learning Center \u2014 acquisition of knowledge, develop\u00ad ment of skills, development of creative abilities and discipline, and personal and group development. All academic credit is administered by the Univer\u00ad sity's regular departments. The Living/Learning Center does, however, maintain rigorous and ongoing evaluations of all of its programs to insure continuing benefit to the academic goals of the students and the University. Above all, the Living/Learning Center is a community of people \u2014 students, faculty, and administrative staff \u2014 who share the goal, work, and excitement of together improving the scope and quality of their University experience. Recent programs have included American Cluster Experience, German, Theatre, Architectural and Environmental Design, Asian Religions, Braille, Outdoor Recreation Management and Journalism. For information contact the Office of the Director, Living/Learning Center (x4200). 132 The Graduate College The mission of the- Graduate College is to serve the needs of college graduates who desire a broader and more thorough knowledge of scholarship and research in their chosen fields.

Information about the certificate program may be obtained by contacting the Dean of the College of Education and Social Services. UNDERGRADUATE ENROLLMENT FOR GRADUATE CREDIT The Dean of the Graduate College must receive a written request from the dean/director of the undergraduate college/school to have a UVM student in the senior year to take an appropriate course for graduate credit. This must be received prior to enrollment for the particular course, the course must not be computed as part of the bachelor's degree, and the total enrollment including the course in question for that senior semester must not exceed 12 credit hours. Such graduate credit is limited to 6 hours, and is not available for transfer to another institution as graduate credit. It can be used only at UVM if and when the student enters a UVM graduate program and only if the course is judged appropriate by the student's advisor for the particular graduate program. Continuing Education Through Continuing Education the University provides opportunities for formal and informal study to persons who have not attended college, who require additional training in their work, or who wish to pursue previously unexplored areas of study. The Summer Session Summer session offers courses in many subjects at both the graduate and undergraduate level. The offerings are diversified to meet the needs of students who desire courses leading to an undergraduate or graduate degree. Offerings are scheduled to enable students to accelerate their programs or explore new areas of interest. Special courses are developed for school personnel, both administrators and teachers, who desire fundamental or specialized courses or who wish to broaden their knowledge of special subjects. All courses are open to persons interested in study for self- improvement. It is recommended that any regularly matriculated student at the University of Ver\u00ad mont obtain prior approval from his/her academic dean/director for any courses to be taken in the Summer Session. The purpose of this recommendation is to insure such courses are appropriate for the degree for which the student is working. The master's degree in several (but not all) areas may be earned through work in the Slimmer Session. Enrollment in courses for graduate credit does not imply admission to the Graduate College. Details about available courses and programs will be sent on re\u00ad quest by the Director of Continuing Education. Evening Division The University's Evening Division program provides educational opportunities for adults. Members of the faculty at the University, and others working under temporary appointment, offer evening or extension courses in many disciplines both at the Burl\u00ad ington campus and at locations throughout Vermont. Most courses may be taken for credit but some non-credit courses are offered in specialized areas of interest. Courses are given in towns and cities throughout the state wherever a group of ten or more individuals register for a course. Arrangements for Evening Division courses are made through the Evening Division, Grasse Mount. Length of courses varies from ten to fifteen weeks. It is recommended that any regularly matriculated student at the University of Ver\u00ad mont obtain prior approval from his/her academic dean/director for any courses to be taken in the Evening Division. The purpose of this recommendation is to insure such courses are appropriate for the degree for which the student is working. All persons desiring graduate credit must secure the approval of the Dean of the Graduate College at the time of registration. 135 136 | CONTINUING EDUCATION Non-Degree Student Enrollment Non-degree students are persons who have presented minimum credentials and are permitted to undertake limited course work in the day program for purposes other than that of earning a degree. Credits earned by non- degree students who later apply and gain admission to a degree program will be evaluated and, if appropriate, will be accepted toward completion of their degree. Non-degree students may enroll for a maximum of 6 credits (or two courses) per semester in the day program; additional courses may be enrolled for only with permission from the appropriate academic dean/director. Undergraduate non-degree students may not exceed a total accumula\u00ad tion of 30 semester credit hours without permission of the Division of Continuing Education. Graduate students are limited to a total accumulation of 9 semester hours. Non-degree students, those not in a degree program, but who seek credit for course work taken, apply for approval to the Division of Continuing Education which will act as their college office. Graduate non-degree students anticipating admission to a graduate degree program should seek advice in the Graduate College, Watermap Building. Selection of courses for those having long-range plhns of earning a degree should be made on the basis of information given in this catalog. Students interested in making a formal application for admission to the University should contact the Office of Admis\u00ad sion, Clement House. Students presently enrolled and in good standing at another institution may take courses at the University of Vermont to transfer to their institutions. Visiting students are considered non-degree students and should contact the Division of Continuing Education for information and registration material. All non-degree students who would like assistance in planning educational programs and selecting courses should contact the Division of Continuing Education at Grasse Mount (telephone 802-656-2085). Conferences and Institutes Conference activity is a rapidly increasing part of University life. Throughout the regular college year and during the summer, many conference groups make use of University classroom and auditorium facilities as well as University dormitories and dining services. Groups interested in arranging for meetings or conferences at the University should contact the Conferences and Institutes Office, Grasse Mount This office will also plan and coordinate conferences, seminars, short courses and meetings to be held at off-campus locations. Church Street Center for Community Education The Center, located in the restored Ethan Allen Firehouse on Burlington's Church Street is a clearinghouse for information on University and community educational ac\u00ad tivities and operates a year-round program of lectures, films, readings, study groups, and non-credit mini-courses and workshops, in response to expressed and perceived community needs. It draws upon the combined talents and resources of the University and the larger community. Study Abroad The Office of Overseas Programs at B178 Living/Learning Center main\u00ad tains information about overseas study programs and helps students make arrangements for foreign study. The Office also assists in the evalua\u00ad tion of credits for study abroad. Students intending to study overseas and receive credit from UVM must contact the Office of Overseas Programs and complete the Study Abroad Approval form prior to departure. This applies even to students intending to pursue independent study overseas under University of Vermont auspices. In addition to providing information about hundreds of non-UVM overseas study programs, the University offers the following programs in which it has a direct involvement: \u2014 The Vermont Overseas Study Program (VOSP) at the University of Nice in France provides a year of study abroad for a selected group of undergraduates from the University of Vermont and from other colleges and universities. Intended primarily for students concentrating in French, the program is also open to qualified students from other fields, such as the fine arts or the social sciences. Stu\u00ad dent selection will be based on the following criteria: 1. Sophomore, junior or senior class standing with a minimum grade point average of 2.0 (C). 2. A working knowledge of French. 3. An interest in and potential for capitalizing on a year of study abroad. 4. A sound educational program. 5. Creditable personal qualifications. Upon the successful completion of his/her work, the student receives appropriate credit (usually thirty hours) toward his/her degree. For further information about the Vermont Overseas Study Program, an interested student should speak to his/her academic dean/director or to the director of the program. \u2014 The University is a member of the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome. Properly qualified students may attend one or two semesters at the Center and receive full credit. For further information consult with the chairperson of the Depart\u00ad ment Of Classics. \u2014 The University of Vermont Summer Program in the Province of Quebec: At a rural center near Nicolet where the program is located, teachers, and intermediate and advanced students of French participate in a wide variety of activities in an in\u00ad troduction to the heritage of French Canada and the culture and civilization of Quebec today. Through readings, lectures and discussions the major characteristics of French- Canadian thought, culture and civilization are introduced. With the total integration of the group into the Nicolet community each member becomes involved in the social life of the center's neighbors. Workshops include handweaving, folkdance, history, folksongs, literature, geography, recipes, holidays, language, traditional materials, furniture and tools, introduction to architecture, the oral tradition in literature. Each participant prepares a special project, alone or with others as part of the required evaluation. Five weeks; six credits. For further information contact the Department of Romance Languages. 137 138 | STUDY ABROAD \u2014 Issues in Contemporary Education: Seminar Abroad-Education in England: This program is designed to offer students something more than the usual \"study abroad\" program. It offers an opportunity for each student to relate his or her professional needs, interests, goals, and aspirations to a specific educational program. There will be opportunities to visit many areas of cultural and personal interest. In addition, the student will live with a family in England and work as a paraprofessional in one or more of the host nation's schools. Time allowed for independent travel. Participants will be affiliated with a teacher training college in England. Contact David Shiman, College of Education and Social Services. \u2014 Medieval Studies in Italy: The University of Vermont has developed a summer program of interdisciplinary Medieval/Renaissance studies. Centered in Rome and Assisi, the program offers three academic credits in history and features travel to many historical sites. All instruction is in English. For further in\u00ad formation, contact Professor Alfred Andrea, Department of History. \u2014 Scandinavian Seminar: A total cultural immersion program consisting of a year's study in folk schools in Norway, Denmark, Sweden, or Finland. No prior language competency required. Apply to this national program through the Overseas Programs Office. Courses of Instruction (Adopted by the Faculty Senate in May, 1978, to become effective July 1,1979) The University reserves the right to change these course offerings at any time. The departments and areas of instruction are arranged alphabetically, and the college in which each is located is indicated. A student who lacks the stated prerequisites for a course may be permit\u00ad ted to enroll by the instructor. Such students must inform the instructor that they lack the prerequisites, and the instructor will make appropriate efforts to ascertain that they are properly qualified. Courses are divided into three levels: introductory, intermediate, and ad\u00ad vanced. Where appropriate, a department may limit enrollment in a par\u00ad ticular course. Such limitations, other than class size, must be explicitly stated. Courses numbered from 1-99 are introductory courses. Introductory courses emphasize basic concepts of the discipline. In general, they presup\u00ad pose no previous college work in the subject. The only exceptions to this rule are those cases in which there is a two-semester introductory sequence. In such cases, the second semester course may have the first semester course as a prerequisite. Courses numbered from 100-199 are intermediate courses. An in\u00ad termediate course covers more advanced material than that treated in in\u00ad troductory courses. Students will be expected to be familiar with the basic concepts of the subject and the course will present more difficult ideas. In\u00ad termediate courses will generally be more specialized than introductory courses. An intermediate course will always have a minimum prerequisite of three hours prior study in the discipline or in another specified discipline. Courses numbered from 200-299 are advanced courses. An advanced course presents concepts, results, or arguments which are only accessible to students who have taken courses in the discipline (or, occasionally, in a related discipline) at the introductory and intermediate levels. Prior ac\u00ad quaintance with the basic concepts of the subject and with some special areas of the subject will be assumed. An advanced course will always have a minimum prerequisite of three hours prior study at the intermediate level in the discipline, or in a related discipline, or some specified equivalent preparation. Some departments make further subdivision of courses at some levels. Where this applies, an explanation can be found at the beginning of the department's list of courses. Two numerals separated by a comma (as in 17, 18) indicate that the separate semester courses may be taken independently for credit. Two numerals separated by a hyphen (as in 17-18) indicate that the semester courses may not be taken independently for credit, and, unless otherwise stated, they must be taken in the sequence indicated. In cases where two numerals are separated either by a comma or by a hyphen, the odd- numbered course will be taught in the Fall and the even-numbered course in the Spring. 139 The number of credit hours per semester is stated in each course descrip\u00ad tion. For some courses, the course title is followed by a pair of numerals con\u00ad nected by a hyphen and enclosed in in (2-3)); this form in\u00ad dicates the number of class hours respectively of lecture and laboratory.
