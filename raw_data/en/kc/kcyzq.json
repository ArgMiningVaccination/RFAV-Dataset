Cinnamon is a pungent, sweet and hot spice that can warm and invigorates the body and support function of the respiratory and digestive systems. It can also help to promote circulation to the joints and support immune function.

Herbalists value burdock for helping to detoxify the liver. The root is served as a food in Japan, where it is known as gobo. Resembling a long brown carrot, burdock can be prepared in the same way you might enjoy a carrot, such as fresh juice or in a stir-fry dish. Dandelion Root Cardamom Clove Bud Clove Buds are the aromatic dried flower buds of a tree in the Myrtle family. The English name clove derives from Latin clavus (nail), as the shape of the buds resembles small nails. Clove bud is widely used as a spice in ancient Asian herbal traditions. With a warming quality, clove supports circulation and digestion. Black Pepper Not only is Black Pepper one of the most widely used culinary spices in the world, it also has a long history of use in traditional herbal medicine. A spicy herb that can help support digestion, it also supplies antioxidants, which can help to reduce free radicals. As a diuretic, black pepper can support water balance in the body. Juniper Berry Extract A juniper berry is not a true berry, but is a seed cone with unusually fleshy and merged scales that give it a berry-like appearance. Used as a spice in European cuisine, juniper berry has been used in traditional herbal medicine to support kidney and urinary tract function, as well as to help maintain healthy blood pressure levels that are already within the normal range. The essential oil can be stimulating to the kidneys. The warming and bitter properties support digestion and can soothe intestinal gas. Juniper berry can also be warming for the joints. Yellow Dock Root Yellow dock (Rumex crispus) is leafy-green plant distinguished by its yellow carrot-shaped root. In herbal medicine, it has a long history of use as a detoxifying herb, as well as to support the skin and liver; for those purposes it is often combined with dandelion root. A mild laxative, it contains anthraquinone glycosides, the active ingredients also found in senna leaf. A rich source of iron, yellow dock root has been traditionally used to supply iron to the diet.
