I (and on behalf of my heirs and successors) hereby waive and release, covenant not to sue, discharge, and hold harmless the APA, its employees, agents, and representatives, of and from any such claims, including all liabilities, actions, damages, costs, or expenses of any kind arising out of or relating to COVID-19 or any other communicable diseases and/or pandemics (including for quarantine, isolation or delay) because of travel to or participation in the APA Convention and/or Convention-related activities. I acknowledge the contagious nature of COVID-19 and accept sole responsibility for the risk of exposure or infection by participating in or traveling to the Convention and Convention-related events, and that such exposure or infection may result in personal injury, illness, disability, and/or death to me, and/or others with whom I have contact. I understand that the risk of becoming exposed to or infected by COVID-19 to and from and during and after the APA event(s) may result from the actions, omissions, or negligence of others who may participate in the Convention and Convention-related activities, or visitors, vendors, presenters or others with whom they may have had contact. In addition to all other rules and regulations relating to my participation in the APA event(s), I agree to comply with all COVID-related policies and procedures that may be established by APA, the Convention Center, and the hotel in which I'm staying, including, but not limited to mask-wearing requirements. I further understand that I have the responsibility to protect others. Therefore, I agree to not attend the APA Convention or Convention-related activities if I feel ill or had recent exposure to a COVID-19 case. Moreover, I will immediately stop participating in the APA event(s) if, once at the Convention, I have a temperature, am experiencing COVID-19-like symptoms, or have been exposed to an individual with COVID-19. In such cases, I will seek immediate medical attention, including taking an FDA-approved COVID-19 test, and report to a designated APA representative and my hotel if the test results are positive. "}
