We investigated the type and frequency of IT use and determined whether the use of IT correlated with demographic, social, or disease-specific characteristics in our patient population. Results. A total of 231 (89.5%) of 258 patients with ALS were eligible for the study and 229 (99% of all) of 231 reported the use of at least one IT for the treatment of ALS. Vitamins and Chinese herbdecoctions, Chinese herb compounds, massage therapy, and acupuncture were the 5 most commonly used therapies. There was a strong association between education level, income, and use of IT. A household income of more than 75,000RMB ($49,995) correlated with multiple IT use, and married patients used IT more often than single individuals. The main reasons for using ITwere to treat weakness and fatigue, muscle atrophy, the development of ALS, depression, insomnia, limb pain or numbness, and side effects associated with Riluzole. Conclusion . The use of IT is common in patients with ALS in Shanghai. Vitamins and TCM arethemostusedadditionaltherapiesandthewidespreadandlargelyunexamineduseofITforALSrequiresmoreattention. 1. Introduction Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a relatively rare, adult-onset, rapidlyprogressive, and fatal disease that involves degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons [ 1]. Individuals with ALS most commonly die of respiratory failure or pneumoniawithin 2-5 years of diagnosis. There is currently no effective2 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine treatmentfor ALS. Riluzole, the current standard of care for ALS,onlyextendslifespanby2-3monthsandhasundesirablesideeffectssuchasnauseaandfatigue[ 2].Integrativetherapy (IT), as a holistic medical concept, might make contribu-tionsinboostingmedicaladvancesandsafeguardinghumanhealth [3,4]. Many neurologists attempt to identify effective treatments as IT in order to deal with various symptoms in ALS patients and to improve the activities of daily living(ADL) of the patient. The current study investigated theuse of IT in patients with ALS in 12 hospitals in Shanghai,China, to determine the prevalence and spectrum of IT useby patients with ALS and to determine whether the useof integrative administration correlates with demographic,social,ordisease-specificcharacteristics. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Subjects. Data were collected by interview from 231 patientswithALStreatedin12hospitals,including7Western medicine hospitals and 5 integrative medicine hospitals, in Shanghaiovera6-monthperiod(betweenDecember1,2012,to May 31, 2013). Patients with definite or probable sporadicALS, according to the revised El Escorial criteria [ 5], were enrolled. The ages of the patients ranged from 20 to 80years. Patients with dementia were excluded. The ShuguangHospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of TraditionalChineseMedicineapprovedtheprotocol,andallparticipantsprovidedinformedconsent. 2.2. Survey Tool. The patients were asked to fill out a struc- tured questionnaire (original questionnaire printed in Chi-nese) that included demographic information, previous andcurrent use of Western medicine, use of IT such as Chineseherbal decoctions, Chinese herbal compounds, acupunctureor acupressure and moxibustion, massage therapy, wildJinsheng and Chinese caterpillar fungus (these 6 therapiesare also defined as traditional Chinese medicine, TCM),Ginkgo biloba, vitamins, nutritional supplements, art ther-apy, magnets, music therapy, energy healing, homeopathy,chiropractic techniques, reflexology, healing, imagery, acids from fish oilconcentrate, lipoic acid, Qi Gong exercise, Tai Chi quan,and antidepressant or other additionaltherapies. If a subjectdid not understand an item on the list, a standardized explanation of the therapy was provided. When a patient or caregiver/relativerespondedaffirmativelytotheuseofoneormoretherapies,theywerefurtheraskedaboutthefrequencyanddurationofitsuse.Wealsoaskedhowtheylearnedaboutsuch therapy and whether the physician treating their ALSwasconsultedbeforeinitiatingitsuse.WeconsideredtheuseofvitaminEtobeanITbecauseithasbeenprovennottobeofuseinthetreatmentofALS. ALS-related symptoms that have been treated were also evaluated, and the rationale for using IT was calculated forevaluation. The questionnaire forms were filled out by thepatients or a caregiver (spouse or family member) in thepresence of the physician and interviewers. Twelve speciallytrainedinvestigatorsperformedallassessmentsasinterview- ers.Oneinvestigator(P.R.R.)conductedallinterviews,whichranged from 7 minutes to 1 hour depending on the extent ofITuse. In addition to the use of IT, the patients were also asked abouttheirmaritalstatus,householdincome,andeducation level. Additional data on each patient included the age at onset of ALS, its duration, and any surgical procedures forALS. The ALS functional rating scale revised (ALSFRS-R)total score [ 6] was also used to evaluate the clinical severity ofthedisease. 2.3. Statistical Methods. EpiData software (version 3.2) was usedfordataentryanddatadocumentation.TheoriginaldatawereconvertedtotheSASsystem(version9.2)forstatisticalanalysis[7].Alldataareexpressedasthemean \u00b1SD.Therate or constituent ratio was calculated for categorical variables.The independent samples-test was used to compare the m e a n sb e t w e e nm a l e sa n df e m a l e sa n dt h ec h i - s q u a r et e s tw a su s e dt oc o m p a r et h ec o n s t i t u e n tr a t i ob e t w e e nt h et w ogroups.Asignificantdifferencewasdefinedas <0.05. 3. Results 3.1.PatientCharacteristics. Initially,258subjects(patientsor theirspouseorrelative)wereinvitedtofilloutthequestion-naires with their physicians and the interviewers in the 12 hospitals. Of these 258 patients, 231 (89.5% overall response rate, age62.8\u00b114.7 years, mean\u00b1SD) were eligible for the studyandcompletedtheinterview.Atotalof27patientswereexcluded: 16 because they refused to provide informationabouttheiradditionaltreatmentsand(or)households,5whowerediagnosedwithdementia,and6becausetheycouldnotbe diagnosed as having definite or probable sporadic ALS.Otherwise, the data set was complete. The characteristics oft h e2 3 1p a t i e n t sa r es h o w ni nT a b l e 1. There were 148 male patients (64%,57.2\u00b115.6 years) and 83 (36%,64.9\u00b117.3 years) female patients. The percentage of respondents 40yearsofageorolder(212/231,135malesand77females)were91.77% and 8.33% in those younger than 40 years of age (13males and 6 females). The mean postelementary educationlevel was6.8\u00b13.9 all eligible subjects ( 7.3\u00b13.1 yearsformalesand5.6\u00b13.3yearsforfemales). 3.2.UseofIT. Atotalof229(99%)patientsreportedtheuse of at least one IT for the treatment of ALS; 96% reported using two therapies and 87% reported using more than two.Specifically, 47% used 5 or more therapies. Vitamins andChineseherbaldecoctions,Chineseherbalcompounds,mas-sage therapy, and acupuncture were the 5 most commonlyusedtherapies.BothvitaminsandChineseherbaldecoctionsand/orChineseherbalcompoundswereusedby209patients(90.5%). The most common were vitamin E (95%) at anaverage daily dosage of433.14\u00b1138.29 IU Chinese compounds (94.8%),and followed Coenzyme Q10 Vitamin Chinese caterpillar Ginkgo biloba Acupuncture Relaxation techniquesMassage Ginkgo biloba (67%) (Figure 1(a)). Other acupuncture (51.32%), relaxation techniques (16.44%), fatty acids from fish oil concentrate(15.92%), and magnets (5.27%). Most of the patients learnedabout IT from a family member or friend (68.11%), fol-lowed by the media (53.34%) and a healthcare professional(35.69%). The Internet was the referral source for 66.37% ofpatientsorcaregivers.Mostpatients(89.03%)didnotuseITbefore the diagnosis of ALS. More than two-thirds (78.19%)ofITusersdidnotconsulttheirphysicianbeforestartingIT.Among the demographic factors, gender was not correlatedwith the use of IT. Among the social variables, there wasa strong association between education level, income, anduse of IT. Patients with a college education or beyond usedmore IT (=0.799 ,=0.048 ). A household income of more than 75,000 RMB ($49,995) was also correlated withmultiple AfterdividingthepatientsintoaTCMgroupandnon-TCMgroup, those had a higher daily dosage of Riluzolecomparedwithnonusers( =0.004 ),buttherewas no difference in the ALSFRS score between the two groups.I Tu s ew a sn o tc o r r e l a t e dw i t hd u r a t i o no fA L S ,d u r a t i o no fdiagnosis,ordurationoftreatmentwithRiluzoleforALS. 3.3. Reasons for Using Integrative Therapies. The most com- mon reason for using IT was to treat weakness and fatigue(68.72% of male IT users) in males and muscle atrophy(66.35% of female IT users) in females (Figure 1(b)).

Cost of Integrative Therapies. The mean cost of IT for all IT users was 1669 RMB ($270) per month. The mostexpensive was 6000 RMB ($595) per month, while thecheapest was 200 RMB ($33) per month. As of the time ofthis study, the mean total cost was 20,677 RMB ($3,434) forall IT treatments. The most spent was 53,275 RMB ($8,850)over 29 months, and the least spent was 8,360 RMB ($1,389)over5months.4. Discussion I d e n t i f y i n ge ff e c t i v et r e a t m e n t sf o rA L Si sa ni m p o r t a n ttask for neurologists. IT might be one choice for treatingvarious symptoms of ALS due to the benefits that have beenreportedinclinicalstudies [ 8-10]. We foundthat, among all respondents with ALS, there were more males than females,andmostwere40yearsoldorolder(Table 1).AtleastoneIT w a su s e db y9 9 %o ft h e s ep a t i e n t sa n d9 6 %u s e dm o r et h a ntwotherapies. OnereasonforusingITmightbeduetotheinsufficiency of ALS therapies. There is currently no effective therapy fortreatingthesymptomsanddevelopmentofALS.Thereisonedrug,Riluzole;however,itsefficacyispoor.Patientsandtheircaregivers are desperately hoping for the development of aneffectivetherapy,nomatterwhatthemethodis.Inthepresentstudy, we found that starting IT may not have been recom-mended by their physicians. Family members, friends, andeven patients themselves often try to find effective methodsto improve symptoms or delay the development of ALS. Wefound a strong correlation between IT use and higher levelsof education and income. Patients or family members withhigh education level might gain more personal insight intothe IT market easily, and they might have more payment capacity to pay the extra charges because the higher income reflectsthefactthatmostITareout-of-pocketexpenditures.Married subjects used IT more often than singles becauseof their higher levels of education and income, and familymembers might have been more able to obtain informationabouttreatmentmethodsmoreeasilythansinglesubjects. TheITusedmostoftenwerevitaminEandTCMdecoc- tion or compounds (about 90.5% of IT users). The reasonsforthismaybeasfollows.First,vitaminEisoftenintroducedas a complementary therapy for neurodegenerative disease[11], may function to prevent or delay senility [ 12-14], and is very cheap (200UI\u00d7100 pills = about 8-20 RMB ($1.33- 3 . 3 2 ) )i nC h i n a .S e c o n d ,i th a sa l m o s tn os i d ee ff e c t si nt h egeneralChinesepopulationandisavailableover-the-counter(OTC). Furthermore, elderly people like to take it if they a r ef e e l i n gw e a ko rt i r e d .M a n yo ft h e s et h e r a p i e sa r eu s e d withouttheknowledgeofthetreatingphysician.Third,TCMdecoctions and compounds have proven effects on Chinesepeople and a long history of use in China, and they believeTCMdecoctionsandcompoundsmightimproveanydisease.Furthermore,comparedwiththecostoftakingotherITandRiluzole, vitamin E and TCM decoctions and compoundsare much cheaper. From January 2012 to May 2013 in China,the mean price of TCM decoctions and compounds wasa b u 2 3t o7 2 . 8 7R M B / p e rd a y ,w h i l e wild Ginseng is 92.36 RMB/per day, Chinese caterpillar fungus supplementsrangefrom190.28to365.37RMB/perday,andRiluzolecosts160 RMB/per day (exchange 6 yuan/USdollar). Therefore, TCM decoctions and compounds aresuperiortoRiluzolefromapriceperspective. ThemostdebilitatingsymptomsofALSareweaknessand fatigue, and with the development of ALS, atrophy becomesmoregrievousforthepatient.However,notherapyiseffectiveat treating these symptoms. Interestingly, the fourth mostcommon reason for using IT was to treat the side effects ofEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 5 Riluzole, suggesting that Riluzole has more side effects than IT. Even though no evidence-based research has definitivelyidentified the effects of IT in the treatment of ALS, familymembers,friends,andsomephysiciansstillwanttotryITforseriousproblemswiththehopeitwillbeeffectivefortreatingthe symptoms. We found no correlation between the use of ITanddiseaseseverity,asmeasuredbytheALSFRS-Rscores.

The strong correlation between IT use and higherlevelsofeducationandincomedemonstratethatmostITareout-of-pocketexpenditures. TCM decoctions and compounds seem to be chosen by most patients. The most cited TCM decoctions for increasing immunity and physicalfitness in TCM [ 16-18] and according to TCM theory can \"nourishthespleenandenrichvitality\"whichmeettheTCMguideline in treating weakness and atrophy, and has beenidentifiedfromotherstudies[ 8,19,20].Mostusedacupoints also could \"nourish spleen and enrich vitality\" too in TCMtheory. The present results indicate that a high proportion of the ALS patients responding to this questionnaire did or would use IT without informing their physician, indicating that patients and physicians are not communicating effec-tively concerning the use of IT and that most patients arem o t i v a t e dt ou s eI Tb yf a m i l y ,f r i e n d s ,a n dt h em e d i a .I naddition to improving communication between physiciansa n dp a t i e n t sa b o u tI T ,t h i ss u r v e y ,a l t h o u g hl i m i t e d ,h a sprovided an insight into IT utilization and referral patternsin ALSpatientsinShanghai.Furtherinvestigationisneededto identify and quantify IT offered to ALS patients and thedecision-making criteria used.
