Zika , a flavivirus transmitted by mosquitos , can cause seve re neurodevelopmental abnormalities including microcephaly in the newborns of the infected mothers . Vaccine design is complicated by concern that elicited antibodies may also recognize other epidemic- causing flaviviruses that share a similar envelope prote in, such as dengue virus, West Nile Virus, and yellow fever virus. This cross - reactivity , if non- neutralizing, may worsen symptoms of a subsequent infection through antibody -dependent enhancement (ADE). To better understand the neutralizing antibody response and risk of ADE, we compared germline and mature antibody binding to Zika and other flaviviruses. We show ed that affinity maturation of the light chain variable domain is important for strong binding of VH3- 23/VK1 -5 neutralizing antibodies to Zika virus envelope domain III (EDIII) and identified interactions that contribute to weak, cross -reactive binding to West Nile Virus EDIII . These findings informed our design of EDIII -conjugated mosaic nanoparticles as a pan -flavivirus vaccine candidate . Sera from immunization trials with EDIIIs and dengue serotypes e binding to Zika, dengue 1 -4, and West Nile Virus, a promising step towards the development of safe and effective flavivirus vaccines. Coronaviruses are another group of viruses responsible for widespread morbidity and mortality, including the severe acut e respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS -CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS -CoV) epidemics and current SARS - CoV- 2 pandemic . Given concerns regarding new SARS -CoV- 2 variants and the possibility for additional zoonotic betacoronaviru ses to cause future outbreaks, we investigated how the epitopes on the SARS -CoV- 2 receptor binding domain (RBD) targeted by VH3- 30-derived antibod ies correlate with their neutralization potency and breadth of betacoronavirus recognition. Analyses showed how variations in antibody light chains and CDRH3 lengths facilitate the diverse RBD epitopes, cross -reactivity, and neutralization profiles of VH3- 30 Abs, illustrating their importance for vaccine design and therapeutic antib ody development. vi PUBLISHED CONTENT AND CONTRIBUTIONS Esswein SR, Gristick HB, Jurado A, Peace A, Keeffe JR, Lee YE, AV, Saeed M, Nussenzweig MC, Rice CM, Robbiani DF, MacDonald MR, Bjorkman PJ.

Although most viruses infect bacteria, viruses can infect all domains of life; in humans, there are over 300 trillion viruses1,3,4. Although most of these are bacteriophages, humans are exposed to an average of 10 different species of human viruses (out of a pan el of 206) over life5. Viruses are best known for their association with disease; however, some viruses show beneficial f unctions , such as supporting intestinal homeostasis6, providing immunity to bacterial infections6-8, conferring drought or cold tolerance in plants9, or informing virus -based cancer therapies10-12. The intricate host -virus relationship is influenced by many factors, including viral cooperation during infection through a communication system using peptide signals13. With such viral diversity and complexity, greater insight into the impact of viruses on health and the environment may be achieved through interdisciplinary, collaborative approaches and methodology. Therefore, the work presented here utilizes a variety of technique in biochemistry , virology, immunology, and structural biology to increase our understanding of the immune response to flavivirus and coronavir us infection and to briefly explore techniques for quantifying virus production in marine sediment. Flaviviruses Flavivirus , a genus in the family Flaviviridae , contains over 7 0 different viruses, several of which are responsible for widespread morbidity and mortality in humans14,15. These single - stranded, RNA -positive, enveloped viruses are often transmitted to humans by arthropods, including mosquito -borne viruses such as yellow fever virus (YFV)16, West Nile Virus 2 (WNV)17, dengue virus (DENV)18, and virus (ZIKV)19 as tick-borne encephalitis virus and Powassan virus15,20. The global diseases caused by flaviviruses range from mild febrile symptoms to severe hemorrhage, encephalitis, and neurological disorders15,20. Flavivirus s tructure, fusion mechanism and life cycle Flaviviruses are icosahedral and contain seven non -structural proteins and three structural proteins : C (capsid), E (envelope), and M (membrane). The C protein is surrounded by a lipid membrane derived from the endoplasmic reticulum with integrated E and M proteins (in mature vir uses) or E and precursor of M (prM) proteins (in immature vir uses) (Figure 1.1)21-23. Mature viruses enter cells by various receptors on the cell surface, such as v3 integrins, C-type lectin receptors (CLR), and phosphatidylserine receptors and TIM (T cell immunoglobulin mucin domain)24. After flaviviruses infect cells by receptor the acidic pH in endosomes causes a conformational change in the E protein and induces membrane fusion , thereby uncoating viral RNA (Figure 1.2)25-27. Figure 1.1. Mature and immature ZIKV structures . Created with Pymol using PDB 6CO828 and 3 Viral assembly proceeds reticulum , forming immature During subsequent exocytosis, the prM is cleaved to M by the cellular protease furin in the slightly acidic trans -Golgi network. After the viruses are released into the neutral pH of the extracellular environment, the cleaved pr falls off, forming smooth , fully mature viruses (~50 nm) with 90 E antiparallel, homodimers arranged in 30 rafts , each with 3 sets of dimers. Subviral particles (byproducts of viral production that lack a capsid but contain prM and E) are also released from infected cells15,23,25 -27. Figure 1.2 . Schematic of ZIKV life cycle and fusion mechanism. Created with BioRender.com. 4 E proteins contain three domains ( EDI, EDII, and EDIII), two transmembrane helices that anchor E to the viral membrane, and a stem region that is partially embedded in the viral membrane (Figure 1.3)22,23. DII contains a conserved fusion peptide that becomes exposed after viral entry into cells and initiates endosomal fusion , and DIII is thought to be critical for receptor binding. Flexibility of E protein s at the hinges between domains is important for the conformational changes that occur during viral assembly and maturation and is also thought to facilitate dynamic changes (known as \"breathing\" ) in flavivirus structures23,29. Figure While cryo -EM flavivirus structures21,22,28 show one static envelope structure, evidence suggests envelope proteins of both mature and immature virions are dynamic and sample different conformations30-32. As demonstrated by antibody ( Ab) neutralization at viral epitopes inaccessible in static models of virions29,30,33,34, the phenomenon of flavivirus \"breathing\" to expose cryptic Ab epitopes may results from conformational changes of the E protein during the viral lifecycle, such as during fusion. Further evidence is provided by the finding that the potency of Abs against DENV is affected by mutations distant from the epitope, suggesting these mutations can modulate virus \"breathing\" and epitope accessibility29. A cryo- EM \"breathing\" structure of DENV2 was obtained by heating the virus to 37\u00b0C32, while ZIKV re mains stable in a mature conformation upon heating35. Although potently -neutralizing Abs that bind cryptic epitopes on ZIKV E proteins have been identified36,37, there are no known cryo -EM structu res of Fab -flavivirus complexes capturing major conformational changes. This structural information is important for understanding the virion conformations targeted by neutralizing Abs and how these Abs prevent membrane fusion and infection. Zika virus The flavivirus ZIKV was first discovered in 1947 , the potential for an epidemic was not realized until large outbreaks occurred in 2007 and 2013 -2015 38-45. The virus can be transmitted by mosquitoes or sexually and persists in infected individuals for several months46-49. Infection is usually asymptomatic or mild, causing symptoms such as fever, rashes, conjunctivitis, arthralgia, and headaches in approximately 20% of cases . In rare cases, severe neu rologic problems such as meningoencephalitis or Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome can occur41,50- 52. However, there is major concern ZIKV infection during pregnancy, which can cause severe ocular and neurodevelopmental abnormalities, including microcephaly, due to 6 the ability of t he virus to cross the placenta47,53- 56. Given the demonstrated potential for large- scale spread, symptom severity , and lack of treatment or prophylaxis, a safe and effective ZIKV vaccine is urgently needed. Since the E protein is involved in cell receptor binding and membrane fusion , it is a key target for neutralizing Abs to prevent infection57-59. Epitopes for neutralizing Abs have been found on all three domain s (EDI, EDII, and EDIII), between multiple domains, and across the E protein dimer ; however, Abs against EDIII are often the most potently neutralizing and an important component of the Ab response that mediates protection15,36,60 -72. Some neutra lizing Abs have -electron microscopy (cryo -EM) structures of ZIKV, indicating the structure is dynamic36,37. Antibody- dependent enhancement Since the ZIKV E protein is similar to that of other flaviviruses, including dengue virus serotypes 1-4 (DENV1 -4), West Nile Virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV)23,73,74 (Figure 1.4), there is concern that Abs against ZIKV may cross -react with other flaviviruses. This cross -reactivity complicates vaccine design since Abs at concentrations that are weakly neutraliz ing or are non- neutralizing against ZIKV and other flaviviruses could result in enhanced infection through Ab -dependent enhancement (ADE)23,75- 79. It is thought that ADE result s from the binding of cross -reactive, but non -neutralizing Abs that promote viral entry into Fc gamma receptor (FcR)- expressing cells, thereby enhancing infection and causing increased symptom severity23,76,77,80 -83 (Figure 1.5) . ADE is thought to underly the finding that the live attenuated tetravalent DENV vaccine , Dengvaxia , can increase the risk of severe symptoms if vaccinated individuals later becomes infected. However, this is only observed in individuals who were never previously exposed to DENV before vaccination84-87. Additionally, prior DENV or ZIKV infection that results in low or intermediate Ab titers 7 increases the risk of worsened disease severity from a subsequent DENV infection with a different serotype88-94.

These three highly pathogenic coronavirus es are from the betacoronavirus genus, and epidemics were caused by zoonotic transmission from animal reservoirs : MERS- CoV originated in dromedary came101,102 and SARS -CoV and SARS -CoV- 2 most likely originated in bats100,103 -106. Due to the possibil ity for newly -emerging zoonotic betacoronaviruses to cause future outbreaks104,105,107 -110, it is necessary to develop therapeutics and vaccines that provide broad protection against different SARS -like betacoronavirus (sarbecovirus) strains. The SARS -CoV-2 spike protein of SARS- CoV- 2 displays spike (S) trimer proteins that facilitate entry into host cells and are targeted by Abs during the immune response to infection. Each protomer in the S trimer comprises two subunits : S1 and S 2. S1 is responsible for binding to the host cell and includes the N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor binding domain (RBD), while S 2 is responsible for fusion of the viral and cellular membranes111- 113. RBDs are the portions of the SARS -CoV- 2 S trimer that interact with the cellular host receptor, angiotensin -converting on the S trimer, but ACE2 in an 'up' conformation112- 114,118 -123 (Figure 1.6) . Abs that target the SARS -CoV- 2 RBD are an important component of the prot ective immune response against infection112- 115,124 -134. The potent neutralization demonstrated by many of these Abs has been attributed to their ability to prevent viral entry by block ing the RBD from binding ACE2114- 117,135 -139. 9 'up' .

Summary Given the global impact and disease burden of viruses, it is important to thoroughly understand the immune response to viral infection. The work presented here utilized interdisciplinary approaches in virology, biochemistry, and structural biology to inves tigate the immune response to flavivirus and coronavirus infection, with an emphasis on the viruses underlying recent epidemics, ZIKV and SARS -CoV- 2. Investigation of how Ab properties correlate with epitope recognition, neutralization potency, and cross -reactivity is essential for the develop ment of safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics . 10 Chapter 2 presents a comparison of binding by germline and mature versions of potently - neutralizing Abs to ZIKV and other flaviviruses , providing insight into the affinity maturation process that gives rise to potently -neutralizing Abs and evaluating the risk of ADE . The ability of germline versions of VH3- 23/VK1 -5 Abs to bind ZIKV indicates the potential for a vaccine to successfully el icit this class of Abs . Additionally, X-ray crystal structures of Fab -EDIII complexes and site -directed mutagenesis experiments reveal ed that somatic hypermutation in the light chain variable domain of this class of Abs is particularly important for high affinity binding . Chapter 3 presents a pan- flavivirus, nanoparticle -based vaccine candidate designed to elicit a cross -neutralizing response to reduce the risk of ADE. Immunization trials in mice showed that that these nanoparticles elicit a cross -reactive binding response against ZIKV, DENV1 - 4, and WNV, a promising step towards the development of safe and effective vaccine s. Chapter 4 presents a brief discussion of progress using cryo -EM to investigate the phenomenon of flavivirus \"breathing \" that expose s cryptic Ab epitopes. Determining the conformational changes of virion envelope proteins is key to understanding how neutralizing Abs prevent membrane fusion and infection. Chapter 5 presents a structural characterization of SARS -CoV- 2 Abs derived from the VH3- 30 gene segment , which is frequently enriched in convalescent COVID -19 donors. We showed that these Ab s bound varie d epitopes on the SARS- CoV- 2 spike trimer. The diverse epitopes, neutralization potencies, and cross - reactivity profiles of these Abs are an important consideration for the design of vaccines intended to elicit a protective immune response against different betacoronavirus strains. 11 Chapter 6 presents an exploratory project evaluating techniques to assess viral production in environmental samples. Here I quantified viruses in marine sediment incubations using biorthogonal non -canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) . 12 CHAPTER 2 Structural basis for Zika envelope domain III recognition by a germline version of a recurrent neutralizing antibody Abstract Recent epidemics demonstrate the global threat of Zika virus (ZIKV) , a flavivirus transmitted by mosquitoes. Although infection is usually asymptomatic or mild, newborns of infected mothers can display severe symptoms including neurodevelopmental abnormalities and microcephaly. Given the large- scale spread, symptom severi ty, and lack of treatment or prophylaxis, a safe and effective ZIKV vaccine is urgently needed. However, vaccine design is complicated by concern that elicited antibodies (Abs) may cross -react with other flaviviruses that share a similar envelope protein, such as dengue virus, West Nile virus, and yellow fever virus. This cross -reactivity may worsen symptoms of a subsequent infection through Ab -dependent enhancement (ADE). To better understand the neutralizing Ab response and risk of ADE, further informatio n on germline Ab binding to ZIKV and the maturation process that gives rise to potently neutralizing Abs is needed. Here we use binding and structural studies to compare mature and inferred -germline Ab binding to envelope protein domain III (EDIII) of ZIKV and other flaviviruses. We show that affinity maturation of the light chain (LC) variable domain (V L) is important for strong binding of the recurrent VH3- 23/VK1 -5 neutralizing Abs to ZIKV EDIII and identify interacting residues that contribute to weak, cross- reactive binding to West Nile virus. These findings provide insight into the affinity maturation process and potential cross -reactivity of VH3- 23/VK1 -5 neutralizing Abs, informing precautions for protein -based vaccines designed to elicit germline vers ions of neutralizing Abs. 13 Significance Statement There is concern for design of a safe vaccine for Zika virus because Abs elicited against Zika may also bind flaviviruses that share a similar envelope protein. If Abs elicited by a Zika vaccine bind, but do not effectively neutralize other flaviviruses, they may enhance virus entry into cells through the process of Ab -dependent enhancement of infection, potentially leading to more severe disease. By directly comparing how mature Zika -neutralizing Abs and their germline precursors bind different flaviviruses, we provide insight into the Ab maturation process and the molecular interactions important for strong, neutralizing binding to Zika versus weak, cross -reactive binding Lee YE, AV, Saeed M, Nussenzweig MC, Rice CM, Robbiani DF, MacDonald MR, Bjorkman PJ. Structural basis for Zika envelope domain III recognition by a germline version of a recurrent neutralizin g antibody. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S 10.1073/pnas.1919269117. is an arthropod -borne flavivirus first discovered in 1947, with the first reported human case in 1 964 and large outbreaks in 2007 and 2013 -201538-45. Although commonly transmitted by mosquitoes, ZIKV can also be transmitted sexually and can persist in infected individuals for up to several months46-49. Infection is either asymptomatic or causes mild symptoms, including fever, conjunctivitis , headache, rash, and arthralgia, in approximately 20% of cases, and severe neurologic problems such as meningoencephalitis or Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome in rare cases41,50- 52. There are major concerns about ZIKV infection during pregnancy, which can cause fetal neurodevelo pmental abnormalities such as microcephaly47,53- 56. Given the large -scale spread, symptoms severity, and lack of treatment or prophylaxis, a safe and effective ZIKV vaccine is urgently needed. The ZIKV envelope (E) protein, containing domains EDI, EDII and EDIII, is similar to the E protein of other flaviviruses, including dengue virus serotypes 1 -4 (DENV1- 4), West N ile virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV)23,73,74. EDIII is an important target for neutralizing Abs57-59. Indeed, many Abs against the ZIKV EDIII domain are strongly neutralizing and are an important component of the response to infection36,60- 71. A set of recurrent Abs (commonly occurring in multiple individuals, also referred to as \"public Abs\") identified from a large cohort of patients in Brazil and Mexico potently neutralize both ZIKV and DENV1 by binding the lat eral ridge of the EDIII domain 36. These Abs share the germline variable heavy (VH) gene segment VH3- 23 and the germline variable kappa (VK) gene segment -5. One of VH3- 23/VK1 -5 Abs, Z004, exhibited protection against ZIKV infection in mice, and when used in combination with another Ab, Z021, reduced viremia and prevented the emergence of ZIKV escape mutations in infected macaques36,62. Strongly neutralizing anti -ZIKV Abs that are derived from known germline Ab precursors represent a potential target for a germline -targeting approach to vaccine design. Such 15 approaches rely on the Ab response to an antigen being initiated through antigen binding to a B cell receptor in its germline configuration, triggering B cell activation and subsequent affinity maturation through the process of somatic hypermutation140. However, a potential concern for vaccine design efforts targeting the epitope for VH3- 23/VK1 -5 Abs or other flavivirus epitopes is that generation of weakly neutralizing or non -neutralizing Abs against ZIKV that cross -react with different flaviviruses could result in enhanced infection through the process of Ab -dependent enhancement (ADE)23,75- 79. It is thought that ADE can result when the binding of cross -reactive, but non - or only poorly -neutralizing, Abs promote viral entry into Fc gamm a receptor (FcR) -expressing cells, thereby providing an alternative route of infection and causing increased virus production and symptom severity23,76,77,80 -83. Therefore, understanding the ability of germline Abs to bind flavivirus envelope proteins and mature into specific, potently -neutralizing Abs is important for development of a safe vaccine. The Ab affinity maturation process for EDIII recognition c an be investigated by structural comparisons of germline and mature Ab recognition of antigen. This approach provided insights into the affinity maturation of Abs against other viruses, including an increased understanding of modes of binding and somatic h ypermutation in broadly neutralizing Abs against HIV -1 141- 145. In the case of ZIKV, knowledge of how both germline and mature versions of potently neutralizing Abs bind flaviviruses may enhance our understanding of the interactions that give rise to potent neutralization versus weak cross -reactiv ity that could contribute to risk for ADE. Here we report binding and structural studies to gain insight into affinity maturation and cross -reactivity of the VH3- 23/VK1 -5 class of anti -ZIKV Through surface plasmon resonance (SPR), neutralization assays, ADE assays, and structural studies, we compared mature and inferred germline (iGL) Ab binding to -4, WNV, and YFV. As part of this analysis, we 16 compared two new crystal structures, an iGL Ab bound to ZIKV EDIII and a cross- reactive mature Ab bound to WNV EDIII, with two previously -determined crystal structures of potently neutralizing mature Abs bound to ZIKV and DENV1 EDIII36. These findings revealed components of germline maturation, including contributions of somatic hypermutation in the V L domain of the Fab, important for development of VH3- 23/VK1 -5 Abs that potently neutralize ZIKV and inform cross -reactivity precautions for flavivirus vaccine design and passive delivery of ZIKV Abs. 17 Results Selection of anti -ZIKV Abs for binding and structural studies. Potent neutralizing and recurring VH3- 23/VK1 -5 Abs against ZIKV and DENV1 were previously identified in multiple donors exposed to ZIKV in Mexico and Brazil36. To investigate germline Ab maturation and cross -reactivity of VH3- 23/VK1 -5 Abs, we selected a set of seven Abs identified from the memory B cells of three of the donors: Z004 mature from donor MEX 18; Z006 mature from MEX 105; Z031 mature, Z032 mature, Z034 mature, Z035 mature, and Z036 mature from donor BRA 112 (SI Appendix, Figures S 2.1-S2.3). Since crystal structures were previously determined for Z004 mature and Z006 mature Fabs (PDBs 5VIC and 5VIG), these Abs were of particular interest for comparison to germline versions. Additionally, Z031 mature, Z032 mature, Z034 mature, Z035 mature, and Z036 mature, which we term the Z03X mature series, were selected since VH3- 23/VK1 -5 Abs from patient BRA 112 were previously shown to neutralize ZIKV, but no structural information on EDIII recognition was known 36. Design of inferred germline (iGL) versions of anti -ZIKV Abs. Z004 iGL and Z03X iGL were constructed based the germline gene assignments of mature VH3- 23/VK1 -5 Abs identified from donors MEX 18 and BRA 112 (SI Appendix, Figures S2.1 -S2.3)36,146. There are 16 amino acid differences in the V H and nine differences in th e V L of the Z004 mature and Z004 iGL sequences (Figure 2.1), some occurring in complementarity determining regions (CDRs) (three in CDR1, six in CDR2, and five in CDR3) (Figure 2.1A). Amino acid differences between the Z03X mature series and the Z03X iGL range d from 13 to 23 for V H and 8 to 11 for VL (Figure 2.1B). The Z03X iGL VH all Z03X mature except Z035 mature, and the V L CDR1 (CDRL1) differed from all Z03X mature sequences except Z03X iGL CDRH2 differed from all Z03X mature sequences by at least three amino acids, and CDRL2 was the same as all Z03X mature sequences except Z034 mature. The 18 CDR3s of the Z03X iGL VH and V L differed by at least two amino acids from all Z03X mature sequences. Assess ing binding of anti -ZIKV IgGs with flavivirus EDIIIs. To investigate whether iGL versions of Abs bind ZIKV EDIIIs and whether any of the mature anti -ZIKV Abs cross -react with EDIIIs of other flaviviruses, we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to determin e Ab binding affinities for EDIII domains. To avoid avidity effects, the monomeric EDIII domains were injected over mature and iGL versions of IgGs coupled to biosensor flow ZIKV and DENV1 EDIII to all mature IgGs, with low or equilibrium dissociation (Figures Appendix, Z032 mature, Z034 e, and 14x lower for ZIKV stronger to ZIKV EDIII. Z031 mature was the only IgG to bind more tightly to DENV1 than ZIKV EDIII. Mature IgGs showed weak binding to some of the EDIIIs; specifically, Z004 mature, Z006 mature, and S 2.1). Although the binding of Abs to DENV2, DENV4 and WNV is weak (SI Appendix, Figures S2.8A, S2.10A, S2.11A), it is clearly detectable compared to negative controls that show no binding (SI Appendix, Figures S2.8B, S2.9, S2.10B, S2.11B, S2.12). However, with a subset of VH3- 23/VK1 -5 Abs showed mature Abs neutralize ZIKV and DENV1, but not WNV (SI Appendix, Figure S 2.13). Additionally, RVP -based ADE assays showed no ability of mature Abs to induce ADE of DENV2 or WNV (SI Appendix, Figure S 2.14). 19 Figure 2.1.

As expected, the iGL IgGs bound EDIII with lower affinities (e.g., low \u00b5M to high nM KDs for the interactions ZIKV (Figure higher affinity than DENV1 EDIII, similar to the trend shown by mature IgGs (Figure 2.3). The only other EDIIIs that showed detectable interactions with and 0.82 ng/m L, respectively) and DENV1 RVPs and 40 ng/m L), these iGL IgGs also showed ability to induce some ADE of ZIKV and DENV1 (but not DENV2 or WNV) 2.1. (nM) of mature and detectable binding at concentrations 150 \u00b5M. To characterize affinity maturation of anti -ZIKV Abs and the structural correlates of Ab cross -reactivity, we set up crystallization screens for all seven Fabs and for the 31 Fab -EDIII complexes that exhibited detectable binding interactions (Table 2.1). Crystals were obtained and X- ray structures determined for two complexes: Z004 iGL Fab with ZIKV EDIII Fab EDIII (2.9 \u00c5 resolution) (SI Appendix, Table S2.1). 23 Comparing iGL and mature Fab interactions with flaviviru EDIIIs. Crystals of the Z004 iGL Fab- ZIKV complex two Fab -EDIII in the asymmetric unit (root mean square deviation, rmsd, of 0.37 \u00c5 for 279 C a atoms in the V H-VL and EDIII domains) (SI Appendix, Table S 2.1). The structure reveale d that Z004 iGL binds the same epitope on the EDIII lateral ridge as Z004 mature. Alignment of the EDIII portions of both complexes revealed similar binding interactions, including recognition of the EDIII EK amino acid motif (E393 -K394) that is central to t he binding SI S2.15A, Table S 2.2). To compare the binding interfaces of the iGL and mature Abs with EDIII, we calculated buried surface areas (BSAs) on the Fab and EDIII in each complex (Figure 2.5). Increased BSA generally correlates with a larger number of interface residues and a higher binding affinity147. As expected from the low affinity of the Z004 iGL Fab interaction with EDIII, less surface area was buried by EDIII on Z004 Fab Z006 (~890 \u00c52) in Fab BSA between Z004 iGL and Z004 mature was largely accounted for by interaction s with V L rather than V H. Specifically, the V H BSA was similar for Z004 iGL (~410 \u00c52) (~400 (~410 (~250 \u00c52). There was more EDIII surface area buried by V H than by V L for all complexes (Figure 2.5). Since the Z004 iGL-ZIKV EDIII and Z004 mature-DENV1 EDIII structures do not directly compare iGL and mature Z004 binding to the same EDIII, we also made a homology model of Z004 mature-ZIKV EDIII binding by threading the of Z EDIII structure. \u00c52) for the Z004 mature-ZIKV EDIII model showed the same trend as Z004 the V H BSA similar (~410 whereas L (~380 \u00c52) than Z004 iGL (~250 Recognition ZIKV EDIII by Z004 iGL and mature Fabs.

Quantification of BS A (\u00c52 and percentage of total surface area) and number of interface residues buried on the entire EDIII (left) and V H and V L of the Fab (right) based on the interfaces mapped in A and B. The column labeled total buried surface area for Fabs includes the su m of BSA for the V H and V 26 Z004 iGL showed only 5 residues that interact with the ZIKV EDIII antigen compared with 10 interacting residues for Z004 mature (with DENV1 EDIII in the crystal structure and with ZIKV EDIII in the homology model) and 13 residues in Z006 mature Fabs that interact wi th ZIKV EDIII ( SI Appendix, Figure S 2.16A- D, Table S 2.2). The finding of fewer interacting residues is consistent with the weaker binding of Z004 iGL demonstrated by SPR (Figures 2.2, 3; Table 2.1). Similar to the trends with differences in BSA, differences in the number of Fab residues predicted to interact with EDIII was pronounced for V L: 1 by Z004 iGL VL, 4 by Z004 mature VL (with ZIKV the model), 5 by Z004 mature VL (with DENV1), 6 by Z006 mature VL (with ZIKV) (SI Appendix, Figure S 2.16A- D, Table S 2.2). Among Fab residues that interact with EDIII by either Z004 iGL or Z004 mature, we observe that the only residues that differ in sequence between the iGL and mature version are in the V L VL, Y92 these VL, interact with the ZIKV EDIII EK motif. In contrast, the only residues that interact with EDIII by both Z004 mature and Z004 iGL are in the V H and share the same sequence: S56 VH (CDRH2), Y58 VH (FWRH3), and E100C VH (CDRH3). Z006 mature Fab also shared one of the same V H interacting residues: Y58 VH (framework region (FWR)H3) ( SI Appendix, Figure S 2.16, Table S 2.2). To further investigate the effects of affinity maturation in the V H versus the V L domain for high affinity EDIII binding, we prepared two Z004 chimeric IgGs for SPR and neutralization assay analysis: one with mature V H and iGL V L and the other with iGL V H and mature V L. The SPR sensorgrams for ZIKV EDIII binding to the Z004 chimeras were fit to a 1:1 binding model (SI Appendix, Figure S 2.18) and showed 10- fold higher affinity binding to the V iGL HC-Vmature LC chimera ( mature V rate), whereas the V mature HC -ViGL LC sensorgrams were more similar to the iGL V H- 27 VL sensorgrams (fast off -rate), consistent with the importance of ligh t chain maturation in the development of high affinity recognition of Zika EDIII. Neutralization assays comparing the two chimeric Abs showed that while both Z004 chimeras can fully mature 1.00) (SI Appendix, Figure S 2.13). To assess which residues are important for high affinity binding, we first prepare d ZIKV EDIII with the EK motif (central to the binding epitope and involved in several interactions with Z004), mutated to alanines (E393A -K394A) for binding studies Binding of Z004 mature IgG to ZIKV EDIII AA mutant was nearly abolished with a KD of >>100 \u00b5M (SI Appendix, Figure S 2.17B, Table S 2.3). To verify that the Z004 V L residues that interact with EDIII and differ Z004 to ZIKV EDIII, we prepared Z004 mature IgG variants with two or all three residues mutated to alanines. When the two EK -interacting residues were mutated (Z004 mature IgG: V L F91A- Y92A), we observed affinity to ZIKV EDIII ( KD: 35 nM). When all three residues mutated (Z004 mature IgG: V L F91A- Y92A- V94A), we 230 nM) ( SI Appendix, Figure S2.17C- D, Table S 2.3). Structural correlates of weak Ab cross -reactivity. We were able to crystallize a complex of Z032 mature Fab bound to WNV EDIII despite the low affinity of this interaction ( KD 100 \u00b5M) (Table 2.1). Perhaps correlating with the low affinity of the complex, the crystallographic asymmetric unit contained one Fab -WNV EDIII complex and four unbound Fabs (Figure 2.6A; SI Appendix, Table S 2.1). The four unbound Fabs were similar to each other (rmsds ranging from 0.22 \u00c5 to 0.47 \u00c5 for pairwise superimpositions of 203 -214 C residues (SI Appendix, Table S2.4). WNV EDIII -bound and Fabs were similar from 0.35 \u00c5 to 0.45 \u00c5 for pairwise superimpositions 28 of 210- 217 C residues in the V H-VL domains), indicating no major structural changes upon EDIII binding ( SI Appendix, Figure S 2.19, Table S 2.4). Figure 2.6. Cross -reactive recognition of WNV EDIII by Z032 mature Fab. Fab-EDIII complex structures are shown as cartoon representations with Fab V H-VL domains only and the EQ or EK motifs of WNV and DENV1 EDIIIs highlighted as sticks (panels A and B). A. Z032 mature Fab- WNV EDIII that Z032 mature interacts with WNV EDIII at the lateral ridge epitope recognized by Z004 mature, Z006 mature, and Z004 iGL, with SI iGL, the VH (420 \u00c52) contributes more to the total Z032 mature Fab BSA than V L (210 \u00c52). The low Fab BSA correlates with fewer interacting residues at the binding interface: only 8 Z032 Fab residues were found to interact with 6 WNV EDIII residues ( SI Appendix, Figure S2.16, Table S2.2). Some Z032 mature Fab interacting residues were also involved in interactions in other Fab -EDIII structures: S56 VH (in (SI Appendix, Figure S 2.16, Table S2.2). This suggests that these residues contribute to enhanced cross -reactivity of anti -ZIKV VH3- 23/VK1 -5 Abs. 30 Discussion Understanding the structural basis of Ab recognition of ZIKV and other flavivirus antigens informs considerations and precautions for vaccine design to elicit EDIII -specific Abs. Here we conducted binding and structural s tudies comparing interactions of mature and iGL VH3- 23/VK1 -5 Abs isolated from ZIKV -exposed donors with a panel of flavivirus EDIII domains to provide insight into the affinity maturation process of this class of potently -neutralizing ZIKV Abs. In addition to revealing interactions critical for potent binding to ZIKV, we also identified weaker interactions that may contribute to cross -reactivity and potentially ADE. By comparing mature and iGL VH3- 23/VK1 -5 Ab binding to EDIIIs, we identified the mutations introduced through somatic hypermutation that facilitate tight binding of the Z004 Ab to ZIKV. As expected, a crystal structure of a Z004 iGL-EDIII complex showed fewer Fab residues that interact with EDIII than observed for EDIII complexes including mature Fabs such as Z004 mature, Z006 mature, and Z032 mature36. In a direct structure, the only three Fab residues invol ved in interactions with EDIII that differed in sequence between Z004 mature and Z004 iGL are in V L. In contrast, the three interacting residues that are shared by both Z004 mature and Z004 iGL are in V H. This suggests that affinity maturation of V L CDRL3 may be particularly important for higher affinity binding to EDIII. This is further supported by the finding that the increased BSA on Z004 mature compared to Z004 iGL was largely accounted for by an increase in the V L BSA. Comparison of the binding affinities a nd neutralization potencies of Z004 mature/iGL chimeras also suggests the importance of V L maturation for EDIII recognition. Through investigation of the effects of site -directed mutations in Z004 mature IgG and ZIKV EDIII on binding, we showed that interactions with the EDIII EK motif are critical for high affinity binding. While both V H and V L residues interact with the EK motif, the only EDIII - 31 interacting residues that differ between Z004 mature and Z004 iGL are in V L (F91, Y92, and V94). The reduced binding affinity when these residues are mutated to alanines supports that affinity maturation of the V L is important for high affinity binding. The importance of V L somatic hypermutation was also observed in a previous longitudinal analysis of a ZIKV -infected patient to trace the lineage of ZK2B10, a protective VH1 -8/VL1- 47 Ab against ZIKV that binds a different part of the EDIII lateral ridge148. Two residues in the VL1- 47 lambda V L, N31 (CDRL1) and S91 (CDRL3), were shown to be necessary and sufficient for functional maturation of the VH1 -8/VL1- 47 Ab lineage to achieve potent ZIKV neutralization. They observed low somatic hypermutation in germline - like somatic variants of V H, concluding that restricted V H gene segment usage, rather than somatic hypermutation in the V H domain, was important to achieve high affinity a nd potency. While ZK2B10 is derived from different germline genes and binds a different part of the EDIII lateral ridge than the VH3- 23/VK1 -5 Abs studied here, we observed a similar trend for the VH3- 23/VK1 -5 Ab Z004: affinity maturation of V L was importan t for strong binding and neutralization, while V H interactions were restricted to residues already present in the germline gene. Through assessment of VH3- 23/VK1 -5 Ab binding to a panel of flavivirus EDIIIs using SPR, the Abs tightly bound ZIKV and weakly bound DENV2, DENV4, and WNV EDIII, indicating a potential for cross -reactivity. Although this class of mature Abs was shown to neutralize DENV1 in additi on to ZIKV 36, the ability of iGL Abs to bind DENV1 EDIII as well as the apparent weak binding of both mature and iGL Abs to other flaviviruses suggests the possibility of ADE upon subsequent infection with a different flavivirus in humans. The EK motif, which is only present in ZIKV and DENV1 EDIII, likely contributes to initial recognition by germline Abs that leads to the tighter binding and neutralization of these two flaviviruses by VH3- 23/VK1 -5 Abs. The importance of E393 in the EK motif for neutralization of ZIKV strains was also previously described for the VH3- 23/VK1 -5 Ab 32 ZIKV -11637. In contrast to IKV and DENV1, the lateral ridges of DENV2, DENV4, and WNV EDIIIs all contain motifs other than EK, yet still showed weak binding to at least one mature or iGL Ab by SPR. This suggests the interactions that contribute to cross -reactive binding of Abs to these flaviviruses are different from, or only partially overlap with, the interactions that contribute to high affinity and neutralizing binding to ZIKV and DENV1 EDIIIs. Apart from DENV1, WNV EDIII was only flavivirus for which all seven mature VH3- 23/VK1- 5 Abs showed cross -reactivity (Table 2.1). Given that binding to DENV2, DENV4, and WNV EDIIIs is weak ( K D 100 \u00b5M ), it is unclear whether this cross -reactivity could facilitate ADE of these flaviviruses upon infection. However, our RVP -based assays showing no ADE for DENV2 or WNV infection suggests this is of low concern. The potential for cross -reactivity of other Abs with ZIKV and WNV EDIII was shown in studies demonstrating that previous exposure to WNV enhances subsequent ZIKV infection in mice, although immunodominant DII -specific fusion loop Abs might explain this in vivo enhancement 76. The crystal structure of Z032 mature Fab complexed with WNV EDIII provided an example of the structural basis of cross -reactive recognition. This structure shows that the Z03X Abs bind the same lateral ridge epitope as other VH3- 23/VK1 -5 Abs36. are also involved in at least one other interaction in the Z004 iGL, Z004 mature, and Z006 mature complexes with EDIII domains. This suggests th ese residues, including the one in a conserved FWR (Y58 VH), may contribute to cross -reactivity of VH3- 23/VK -15 Abs, potentially even precursor germline versions, with different flaviviruses. These residues are present in iGL sequences, suggesting that resi dues that contribute to cross -reactivity may already be present prior to affinity maturation. The weak, cross -reactive binding of Z004 iGL DENV2 and DENV4 further supports this suggestion. Five of the eight Z032 mature Fab 33 residues predicted to bind WNV EDIII are in the V H, suggesting the V H may contribute more to weak, cross -reactive binding, whereas somatic hypermutation in the V L may contribute more to tight binding of mature VH3- 23/VK1 -5 Abs to ZIKV. Comparison of t he structures of bound and unbound Z032 mature Fabs indicated the VH3- 23/VK1 -5 class of Abs does not require major conformational changes for binding. Superimposition of the bound and unbound Z032 mature VHVL revealed a low calculated rmsd and no major differences in the backbone structure, suggesting that conformations were preformed prior to binding. This suggests that VH3- 23/VK1 -5 mature Abs use a lock- and- key mode of binding, involving minimal conformation al changes between the bound and unbound states of antigen and Ab149- 151. Germline versions of VH3- 23/VK1 -5 DENV1 EDIII in the nM and low \u00b5M range. This was also previously observed for the germline version of the VH3- 23/VK1 with germline -reverted forms of most broadly neutralizing Abs against HIV -1, which generally do not bind HIV -1 envelope152. The ability of germline versions of neutralizing Abs to bind antigens is of particular interest for vaccine design, as this suggests immunogens may effectively elicit precursors of the desired Ab class, which could then mature into neutralizing Abs. Initi al studies of the potential of ZIKV EDIII to serve as a safe and effective immunogen are underway, and indicate potential to elicit a specific and potent neutralizing Ab response to ZIKV in mice 153- 155. Increased understanding of the differences in the interactions that contribute to neutralization versus cross- reactivity leading to ADE may enable strategic immunogen design. The in vitro ability of germline and mature156 VH3- 23/VK1 -5 Abs to induce some ADE for ZIKV and DENV1, bu t not for DENV2 or WNV suggests there may be minimal risk of ADE due to 34 weak cross -reactivity for this class of Abs. While this is not indicative of in vivo ability to enhance infection, there may be concern that Ab titers falling below neutralizing levels may be a risk for ADE. These findings indicate the importance of examining the cross -reactivity and ADE -potential of other anti -ZIKV classes of Abs under consideration for vaccine design or passive delivery. Understanding which residues contribute to cros s-reactivity versus potent neutralization may also inform the necessity of modifying passively -delivered Abs to reduce cross- reactivity and prevent ADE by introducing Fc of mutations that prevent FcR binding. 35 Materials and Methods Design of iGL versions of Abs against ZIKV. Sequences of iGL versions of anti -ZIKV Abs are based on V, D and joining J gene segment assignments from IgBlast36,146. All mature IGHV3- 23/IGKV1 -5 Ab sequences from donors MEX 18 and BRA 112 were considere d for design of the Z004 and Z03X iGLs, respectively. CDR1 and CDR2 of the iGLs were based on the V gene segment assignment of the mature sequences, specifically IGHV3- 23 for the HC and IGKV1- 5 for the LC. The CDRH3 of the iGL was based on a consensus of t he V, D, and J gene segment assignments for the mature HC sequences, and CDRL3 of the iGL was based on a consensus of V and J gene segment assignments for the mature LC sequences (SI Appendix, Figures S 2.1-S2.3). Protein expression. Abs were produced as pr eviously described 36,157. Briefly, Z006 mature, Z031 mature, expressed by transient transfection of HEK293 -6E cells with equal amounts of Ig HC and LC expression vectors. After seven days, IgGs were purified from supernatants using Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare). Z004 mature, Z004 iGL, and N6 IgGs were expressed by transfection and purified from supernatants using a HiTrap MabSelect column (GE Healthcare) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl. Fabs with C -terminal His -tags were produced by transient transfection of Expi293F cells with equal amounts of HC and LC expression vectors. The Fabs were purified from supernatants with Ni -NTA affinity chromatography and SEC with a Superdex 200 column in 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl. Flavivirus EDIIIs were expressed in E. coli and purified from inclusion bodies as previously described 36,69,158. Briefly, EDIII genes from ZIKV transformed into BL21 (DE3) competent cells and cultures were grown in LB with carbenicillin at 37\u00b0C. Expression was induced with IPTG at an O.D. of ~0.6, and the culture was harvested after four hours and stored overnight at -20\u00b0C. The pellet was res uspended in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, cells were lysed and centrifuged at 21,000 x g for 30 minutes, and the pellet was resuspended in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 100 mM Tris -HCl pH 8.0. This suspension was centrifuged again at 21,000 x g for 30 min utes, and then 20 mM beta -mercaptoethanol was added to the supernatant. EDIII in the supernatant was refolded by dropwise, rapid dilution into 400 mM L -Arginine, 100 mM Tris- base pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM reduced glutathione, 0.5 mM oxidized glutathione, and 10% glycerol at 4\u00b0C. The protein was then concentrated and purified by SEC with a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN 3. SPR binding assays. SPR experiments were performed using a Biacore T200 instrument (GE Healthcare). Binding assays were done by flowing EDIII analytes over IgG ligands bound to a chip in 0.2 \u00b5m -filtered HBS -EP+ running buffer. The protein A-coupled chip was prepared from a CM5 chip (GE Healthcare) by coupling 1 \u00b5M His - tagged Protein A at pH 4.5 to each flow cell to a final density of ~3000 response units (Rus). IgGs were then injected onto each flow cell at 50 nM. An irrelevant HIV -1 Ab, N6159, was used as a control on a reference flow cell. To remove IgGs from the chip between runs, a solution of 10 mM glycine 50% v/v pH 1.5/ pH 2.5, 1 M guanidine hydro chloride was applied. For interactions with measurable on - and off -rates, kinetic constants were derived from sensorgram data using global fitting of the association and dissociation phases of binding 37 curves in the working set using Biacore T200 Evaluatio n Software (GE Healthcare). The sensorgrams were fit to a binding model that assumed a single class of non -interacting binding sites in a 1:1 binding interaction. KD values were derived as KD = kd/ka, the ratio of the association ( ka) and dissociation ( kd) constants. For interactions with fast on- and off- rates, KD values were derived by nonlinear regression analysis of plots of R eq (the equilibrium binding response) versus the log of the injected protein concentration. Data were fit to a 1 :1 binding model, and each KD was determined as the concentration at which half -maximal binding was observed. If a saturated binding response was not achieved at the highest injected concentration of analyte, we approximated the saturated response as the h ighest R eq achieved. For SPR runs used to running buffer using a Slide -A-Lyzer MINI Dialysis Device with 3,500 Da molecular weight cutoff (ThermoFisher) to minimize refractive index changes between the association and dissociation phases. W e used concentrations of ZIKV and DENV1 EDIII ranging from 0.04 to 10 nM in a three -fold dilution series flowed over immobilized mature IgG, and concentrations of ZIKV, DENV1 and ZI KV AA mutant EDIIIs ranging from 2.3 nM to 150 \u00b5M in a four -fold dilution series flowed over immobilized iGL IgGs or Z004 \u00b5M in a four -fold dilution series were flowed over immobilized mature and iGL IgGs. Concentrations of ZIKV EDIII ranging from 0.036 nM to 150 \u00b5M in a four- fold dilution series were flowed over immobilized Z004 iGL/mature chimeric IgGs in two independent experiments. Concentrations EDIII ranging from 0.036 nM to 37.5 \u00b5M in a four -fold dilution series were flowed over immobilized Z004 IgG V L site-directed mutants. The injection flow rate was 10 \u00b5L/minute over three minutes and the dissociation time was two minutes. For repeate d SPR runs for ZIKV and DENV1 EDIII flowed over mature IgGs, concentrations of EDIII from 1.4 to 1000 nM in a three -fold dilution series were injected at a flow rate was 30 \u00b5L/minute over one minute and a 38 dissociation time of five minutes ( SI Appendix, Figures EDIII and DENV1 EDIIIs were calculated as the average of two independent experiments. Crystallization trials. For the Z004 iGL Fab- ZIKV and EDIII were incubated at a 1:1.8 molar ratio for three days and then purified by SEC on Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare). For the Z032 mature Fab- WNV EDIII complex, Fabs and EDIII were incubated at a 1:1 molar ratio for three days. Crystallization trials were sitting- drop plates with a Mosquito micro -crystallization robot and stored at room temperature. Crystals were cry o-protected with 25% glycerol. Crystallization conditions corresponding to tryptone, 0.001 M sodium azide, iGL Fab- ZIKV were collected at Lightsource (SSRL). Data for the Z032 mature Fab-WNV EDII I complex were collected at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne, IL, Z032 mature Fab- WNV EDIII complex data were processed using iMosflm161. Data were scaled using Pointless and Aimless162,163. Structures were solved by molecular replacement (MR) u sing Phaser -MR164. For the Z004 iGL Fab-ZIKV EDIII structure, the structure was first using Z004 mature Fab- DENV1 EDIII (PDB 5VIC) as the initial search model36. This gave a partial solution with two Z004 mature Fab-DENV1 EDIII molecules in the asymmetric unit, wi th one of the Fabs containing an incorrectly placed constant (C HCL) domain. This C HCL domain was removed 39 and MR was repeated using the initial partial solution and one Z004 mature CHCL as search models. The structure was then determined at 3.1 \u00c5 using a similar method, except the Fab with the incorrectly placed C HCL domain was completely removed and MR was repeated using the initial partial solution and the corresponding Z004 mature Fab-DENV1 EDIII from the 3.3 \u00c5 structure as a search model. For the Z032 mature Fab- WNV 5VIG) domains were used as the initial search models36, which produced a partial solution with four V HVL and four C HCL. MR was repeated using th is partial solution and WNV EDIII (PDB 1ZTX) as search models66. This generated a partial solution with one WNV EDIII placed correctly and three placed incorrectly, so all molecules were removed except for one Fab bound to WNV EDIII. For this Fab -EDIII partial solution, Fab residues were mutated to match the Z032 mature sequence, and then to generate Z032 mature Fab, Z032 mature VHVL, and Z032 mature CHCL search models. MR was repeated using the Z032 mature Fab-WNV EDIII partial solution and Z032 mature VHVL and C HCL as search models. This gave a partial solution with two unbound Fabs and one EDIII -bound Fab correctly placed; again, incorrectly placed molecules were removed. MR was repeated with this partial solution and Z032 mature Fab as a search model. This gave a part ial solution with four correctly placed Fabs, one EDIII -bound and three unbound. MR was repeated with this partial solution and an additional Z032 mature Fab as search models, resulting in the final structure with four unbound and one EDIII -bound Fab. Prote in models were refined with phenix.refine using torsion angle refinement, group B factors, and non -crystallography symmetry restraints165. PDB accession codes and X- ray data collection and refinement statistics are in SI Appendix, Table S 2.1. Figures were prepared and rmsds of superimposed C atoms were calculated using Pymol166. A Z004 Fab -Zika EDIII homology model was created using SWISS -MODEL167. A control for the homology model was prepared by threading ZIKV 40 Z021 Fab -ZIKV EDIII homology structure (PDB 6DFI) resulted in of for 239 C atoms62.

Plasmid construct ion. pWNV/TX02/CprME was generated by assembly PCR. Using pZIKV/HPF/CprME (obtained from Ted Pierson, see ref.36) and CMV promoter linked to the begi nning of the WNV capsid protein was amplified. The WNV CprME region with upstream overlap with the CMV promoter was amplified using Oligos infectious clone (obtained from Ilya Frolov 169) as a template. The two fragments were assembled by PCR using oligos RU -O-24611 and RU- O-24621, and the product was digested with SnaBI and SacII and cloned into similarly digested pZIKV/HPF/CprME. All PCR derived DNA regions were verified by sequencing. RVP production. RVPs were generated as previously described36 by and a C -prM- E expression plasmid encoding structural proteins of ZIKV strain HPF with the PRVABC59 E protein (pZIKV/HPF/CprM*PRVABC59E*)170, DENV1 obtained from Pierson), seeded at 5x105 cells/well in collagen- 41 coated 6- well plates one day befo re DNA transfection. One g of pWNVII -Rep- REN- IB (WNV replicon expression construct) and 3 g of the flavivirus CprME expression construct were co -transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 4 -5 hours, media (containing l ipid- DNA complexes) was removed and replaced with DMEM containing 20 mM HEPES, 3% FBS. Cells were then incubated at 34\u00b0C for 48 -72 hours before supernatant (containing RVPs) was harvested, filtered through a 0.22 \u00b5m filter, and frozen at 80\u00b0C. RVP- based n eutralization assays. Abs were diluted then serially diluted in BA - 1 diluent using five -fold dilutions. RVPs were diluted in OPTI -MEM to a concentration that results in 1x106 relative light units (RLU) per 25 \u00b5L (determined based on a titration of the harvested RVPs on Huh- 7.5 cells). Serially diluted Abs were mixed with equal volumes of RVPs, and incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. 50 \u00b5L of RVP- Ab complex was added to Huh -7.5 cells seeded in 96 -well half -area plates at 7.5x103 cells/well in 50 L the day prior. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours, media was removed, cells were lysed in 35 L 1X Lysis Buffer, and 20 L was used for Renilla luciferase measurement on a activity, measured as RLUs, was normalized as the percentage of luciferase activity relative to activity from RVPs incubated without Ab. Experiments were repeated twice and plotted on the same graph. The N6 Ab (negative control) was assessed at 10 ug/m L final concentration in the well. IC 50 values (the Ab concentration that resulted in 50% inhibition) were determined by nonlinear regression fitting of the curve in GraphPad Prism. ADE assays . Abs were diluted in triplicate in BA -1 diluent to 40 ug/m L and then serially diluted three -fold dilutions. RVPs were diluted in OPTI- MEM with a goal of achieving 1x106 Huh- 7.5 cell relative light units (RLU) per 12.5 \u00b5L (determined based on a titration of the harvested RVPs on Huh -7.5 cells in the absence of Ab). For some RVPs this goal was 42 not attainable and lower RLU were used. Serially diluted Abs were mixed with equal volumes of RVPs, and incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. 25 \u00b5L of RVP- Ab complex was added to K562 cells seeded the prior day in poly -L-lysine coa ted 96- well half -area plates at 5.0 x103 cells/well in containing 10% FBS and 1X NEAA . Every plate included a no Ab control, an N6 negative control, and Z004 wt Ab (10 ng/m L final concentration) with the ZIKVHPF/PRVABC59*E* RVP as a positive control. Each plate also included Huh -7.5 cells seeded the day prior at 7.5 x103 c/w in 50 \u00b5L to serve as a positive control for RVP activity. After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24 hours, media was removed, cells were lysed in 35 L 1X Lysis Buffer, and 20 L was used for Renilla luciferase measurement on a as RLUs, was normalized to respective RVP luciferase activity determined on fully pe rmissive Huh- 7.5 cells (positive control). Experiments were repeated twice and plotted on the same graph. The HIV -1 Ab N6 (negative control) and cross -reactive Ab Z015 mature (WNV positive control) were assessed at the highest concentration (10 \u00b5g/m L). Z004 mature Ab (positive control156) was assessed at 0.01 \u00b5g/m L, a concentration known to show ADE for ZIKV. Data availability .

Due to high sequence identity of their envelope proteins, there is concern, particularly for DENV and ZIKV, that infection with one virus will elicit antibodies (Abs) that also recognize, but do not neutralize other flaviviruses. Non -neutrali zing cross -reactivity can enhance viral entry into cells, leading to increased disease severity upon a subsequent flavivirus infection. This phenomen on, termed antibody -dependent enhancement (ADE), presents challenges for the design of vaccines that do not induce ADE and suggests vaccines need to elicit potent cross -reactive flavivirus neutralization to be safe. Here we designed homotypic nanoparticles displaying envelope domain III (EDIII) of WNV and YFV individually as well as heterotypic (mosaic) nanoparticles co-displaying all seven or just five (ZIKV, -4) of these EDIIIs on the same nanoparticles. Immunizations in mice with mosaic and mixes of homotypic nanoparticles elicited antibody responses superior to t hose elicited by ZIKV EDIII homotypic nanoparticles for binding and DENV1 superior to ZIKV, DENV1- 4, and WNV EDIIIs compared to mixes of homo typic nanoparticles even though WNV EDIII was not present on the immunized nanoparticles. These findings are a promising step towards the development of a pan -flavivirus vaccine candidate that offers cross -reactive neutralization with reduced risk of ADE. 71 Significance Statement Design of safe and effective vaccines for Zika, dengue and other flaviviruses is challenging due to concern that antibodies that neutralize one virus will also bind, but not effectively neutralize other flaviviruses. This non -neutral izing cross -reactivity causes risk for increased viral entry into cells through antibody -dependent enhancement of infection, which worsens the severity of disease symptoms. We developed vaccine candidates with envelope domain III of Zika and dengue viruses 1-4 displayed together on the same nanoparticles (mosaic) or individually on separate nanoparticles (homotypic) for immunization trials. In mice, immunization with mosaic nanoparticles demonstrated an advantage over mixes of homotypic nanoparticles for el iciting antibodies that showed cross -reactive binding to Zika, dengue 1- 4, and West Nile Virus even though envelope domain III of West Nile Virus was not present on the immunized nanoparticle. This a promising step towards the development of a safe vaccine intended to provide pan -flavivirus neutralization to lower the risks of antibody -dependent enhancement. 72 Introduction The Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in 2015 -2016 was a reminder of the enormous global disease burden of epidemic -causing flaviviruses, including dengue serotypes 1 -4 (DENV1- 4), West Virus (WNV), and yellow fever virus (YFV)20,171,172. These flavivirus are primarily transmitted by mosquitos, particularly Aedes aegypti , and cause febrile disease with a broad spectrum of symptoms20,23,171. Although ZIKV was first discovered in 194743,44, the potential for epidemics was not realized until large outbreaks occurred in 200739, 2013 - 201440,41, and when cases spread to the Americas in 2015 -201638,42,173. Infection usually causes mild symptoms in approximately 20% of cases and severe neurologic problems such as Guillain -Barr\u00e9 Syndrome only in rare cases41,50- 52. However, ZIKV can cause severe fetal neurodevelopmental abnormalities such as microcephaly in the newborns of infected women47,53,54,56,174. DENV infects an estimated 400 million humans each year and causes disease ranging from febr ile illness with flu -like symptoms to severe hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome with plasma leakage, coagulopathy, and bleeding18,20,171. WNV has spread widely throughout the western hemisphere and can cause severe neurological symptoms, including meningitis, encephalitis , and acute flacc id paralysis175,176. Despite the existence of a YFV vaccine, YFV is still endemic in many parts of the world and causes febrile illness with potential for hepatitis, renal failure, hemorrhage , and shock20,177. Given the global threat of ZIKV, DENV, and other flaviviruses, there is urgent need for the development of effec tive vaccines safe for widespread use. Since the flavivirus envelope (E) proteins share ~40 -80% amino acid between ZIKV, DENV1 -4, and YFV , and there are other highly conserved regions within the structural and non -structural proteins23,73,74,178, there is concern that antibodies (Abs) elicited by infection or vaccination against one flavivirus can cross -react with other flaviviruses, but not provide potent neutralization. Non - or only weakly- neutralizing cross - reactive Abs can enhance viral entry into cells that express the Fc gamma receptor (Fc R) by 73 antibody -dependent enhancement (ADE), facilitating an alternative route of infection and enhancing viral pr oduction and disease severity23,75- 82,179,180. The greatest observed risk of ADE is for ZIKV and DENV1 -4, which are closely related, often co -circulate, and have caused widespread disease23,181,182. Abs against the immunodominant fusion loop and precursor membrane (prM) proteins were found to be particularly cross -reactive and are often w eak neutralizers and strong promoter of ADE179,183 - 186. The live attenuated tetravalent D ENV vaccine Dengvaxia in creases the risk of severe DENV symptoms in people who were never previously exposed to any DENV infection before, limiting its safety and use84-87. Prior DENV infection does not seem to increase risk of severe ZIKV symptoms in humans or cause congenital Zika syndrome in ZIKV -infected pregnant women187- 190, and there is some evidence that prior DENV infection may even reduce the risk of ZIKV infection and complicated symtoms191- 193. However, prior DENV or ZIKV infection that results in low or intermediate Ab titers increases the risk of worsened disease severity from a subsequent DENV infection with a di fferent serotype88-94. High Ab titers resulting from multiple DENV infections protects against severe subsequent DENV disease90, suggesting a vaccine strategy with consistent boosting may be necessary to generate protective titers. Multivalent antigen display was shown to be an effective strategy for inc reasing the immunogenicity of protein subunit vaccine s and providing longer lasting immuniy194,195. Antigens can be multimerized on nanopa rticles approaches such as the SpyCatcher -SpyTag system196- 198. This system utilizes spontaneous isopeptide bonds conjugate antigens tagged with a 13 -residue peptide (SpyTag) to multiple copies of engineered protein domains (SpyCatcher) fused on a virus- like particle (VLP)196- 199. Antigens multimerized on nano particles with this approach were previously shown to elicit potent neutralizing responses200- 204. Additionally, the development of mosaic nanoparticles displaying heterotypic antigens from different virus strains is a stra tegy intended to 74 selectively engage B cells that tolerate antigenic variability versus strain -specific B cells140,202,203. Immunizations with mosaic nanoparticles were shown to successfully elicit cross -reactive antibody response for SARS -like betacoronaviruses and influenza202,203. Several antibodies against E protein domain III (EDIII) are potently neutralizing and demonstrate less non -neutralizing cross -reactivity than antibodies against other conserved epitopes, making EDIII a target for protein -subunit based design and t herapeutic antibody development36,57- 64,64- 71,205- 209. Immunization trials in mice using ZIKV EDIII or E protein vacci ne candidates, some of which are VLP -based, or EDIIIs215- 218 or co -displaying the EDIII or E protein of one, two or four of the DENV serotypes also showed ability to generate neutralizing Abs207,219 -227. Due to concerns of ADE associated with flavivirus infection and vaccination, a ZIKV vaccine that generates an immune response that is potently cross -neutralizing against other flavivir uses may minimize the risk of ADE. Here we used the S pyCatcher -SpyTag whether mosaic nanoparticles can elicit cross -reactive Ab responses. We showed that mosaic nanoparticles displaying ZIKV and DENV1- 4 EDIIIs (5 -mosaic) elicited cross -reactive binding that is superior to that of mixes of homotypic nanoparticles. Additionally, 5 -mosaic nanoparticles elicited cross -reactive binding against WNV EDIII despite this EDIII not being present on the immunized nanoparticles. These findings are a promising step for the development of safe and effective vaccines to protect against ZIKV and other flaviviruses. 75 Results EDIIIs were efficiently conjugated on mi3 nanoparticles. cher003- mi3 (up to 60 attachment sites possible) to prepare homotypic nanoparticles, and equimolar amounts of five (ZIKV, DENV1 -4) all seven conjugation to SpyCat to prepare -mosaic nanoparticles, respectively (Figure 3.1A,C)204,228. Conjugation was evaluated by purification of the nanoparticles from excess unbound EDIII -SpyTag003 by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) followed by dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS -PAGE). SDS -PAGE showed 100% conjugation with efficiencies for each EDIII -mi3 construct, although DENV1 conjugation showed some relative reduction (Figure 3.1D). This suggests 5 -mosaic and 7 -mosaic nanoparticles contained approximately equimolar mixtures of different EDIIIs. Combinations of five (ZIKV, DENV1- 4) or all seven homotypic nanoparticles were mixed in equimolar amounts to prepare 5 -admix and 7 -admix nanoparticles, respectively, for immunization trials. Sera from immunizations binding to ZIKV, DENV1 -4, and WNV EDIIIs. Immunization trials were performed in mice for the following groups of nanoparticles: homotypic ZIKV unconjugated SpyCatcher003 Each group ha d five mice except SpyCatcher003 -mi3, which had three mice. Mice were injected with equal doses of nanoparticles plus adjuvant for the prime (day 0) and subsequent boosts at days 14, 28, and 42. Mice were bled before each injection and at day 60 for sera analyses (Figure 3.1B). One mouse from the 7 -admix group died between the day 14 and day 28 timepoints. 76 Figure 3.1.

Sera were analyzed by ELISA area under the curve ( AUC) for ability to bind ZIKV, DENV1 binding only to ZIKV EDIII and the response increased from day 14 (after the prime) to 42 (after 2 boosts) (Figure 3.2, red bars). The 7 -admix group showed an advantage compared to the 5 -admix group for binding to WNV and YFV, consistent with the presence of WNV and YFV EDIIIs on the 7 -admix nanoparticles, but a comparable response was observed for these two groups for bind ing to ZIKV and DENV1- 4 (Figure 3.2, yellow and purple bars). The 5 -mosaic and 7 -mosaic groups showed comparable binding to ZIKV and DENV1 -4, although 5 -mosaic sera showed an advantage for binding to ZIKV EDIII at day 42 (Figure 3.2, dark blue and teal bar s). Interestingly, both 5 -mosaic and 7- mosaic sera showed binding to WNV EDIII, despite this EDIII not being present on the 5 - mosaic immunized nanoparticle. Additionally, 7 -mosaic nanoparticles showed no advantage over 5 -mosaic nanoparticles, except for da ys 28 and 60 against WNV. On the timepoint when the highest binding response was observed, day 42, the 5 -mosaic and 7 -mosaic sera showed comparable binding to WNV EDIII. 78 Notably, the 5 -mosaic nanoparticles consistently showed a superior response compared to 5-admix nanoparticles for binding against ZIKV, DENV1 -4, and WNV. Although there is clear binding to the EDIIIs by day 28, the consistent advantage of sera from mice immunized with 5 -mosaic compared to 5 -admix nanoparticles was first evident at day 42. The 7 -mosaic nanoparticles also showed an advantage compared to 7 -admix nanoparticles at some timepoints for binding to a few EDIIIs (days 28 and 60 for ZIKV, day 60 for DENV1, days 14 and 28 for DENV2, day 14 for DENV4, and days 28 and 60 for WNV ), although this advantage was less consistent across timepoints. Of all the EDIIIs, the 5 -admix, 5 -mosaic, 7 - admix, and 7- mosaic sera showed the strongest responses to DENV1 and DENV3. Binding to YFV EDIII was weak by all sera groups, although the 7 -admix group showed an advantage compared to the mi3 control, indicating an advantage of homotypic nanoparticles for binding to YFV EDIII. Assays to assess the neutralization potencies and ADE of the sera samples are in progress. Flow cytometry analys es of B cells from harvested spleens will also be performed to determine whether B cells show cross -reactive binding to multiple EDIIIs. 79 80 Figure 3.2.

The design and evaluation of vaccine candidates that elicit pan -flavivirus neutralization with reduced potential for ADE is critical for addressing global epidemics. Here we multimerized EDIIIs of seven flaviviruses on \"plug and display\" SpyTag -SpyCatcher strategy197 and showed that immunization with either mosaic nanoparticles or a mix of homotypic and WNV. These initial findings show promise for using mosaic nanopartic les as a candidate for the development of safe and effective pan -flavivirus vaccines. Notably, our findings showed a superior immune response after immunizations with 5 - mosaic (ZIKV and DENV1 -4) nanoparticles compared to a mix nanoparticles for binding to ZIKV and DENV1 -4 as well as for eliciting a cross -reactive response against WNV EIII (Figure 3.2). Of all the EDIII amino acid sequences, WNV EDIII is most similar to ZIKV EDIII, which is consistent with the cross -reactive sera recognition we observed (Figure 3.1E- G). Additionally, the superior response of 5 -mosaic nanoparticles ZIKV EDIII homotypic nanoparticles for binding EDIII reinforces the advantage of using mosaic nanoparticles. Since the strongest binding response was obser ved on day 42 after a prime and two boosts, this supports that a vaccination strategy with multiple boosts is favorable for generating high titers. The lack of a superior response for 7 -mosaic nanoparticles over 5 -mosaic nanoparticles for binding to any ED IIIs on day 42 indicates 5 - mosaic nanoparticles are sufficient and advantageous for eliciting pan -flavivirus binding to ZIKV, DENV1 -4, EDIII homotypic nanoparticles only elicited a spec ific binding response again ZIKV 82 EDIII is consistent with previous studies that performed immunizations with ZIKV EDIII153- 155,210,214. The reduced binding detected for all sera samples to YFV EDIII indicates using mosaic nanoparticles or mixtures of homotypic nanoparticles is not an advantageous strategy for eliciting binding to YFV EDIII. This is consistent wit h the observation that the YFV EDIII amino acid sequence is the least similar to the ZIKV, DENV1, DENV3, and DENV4 sequences compared to the other panel (Figure 3.1E- G). While homotypic YFV EDIII nanoparticles are an alternative possibility t hat may be more effective, YFV is the only flavivirus of the seven for which a vaccine is already universally available and there is no conclusive known risk of ADE due to YFV infection in humans 232- 234. These initial findings show promise for development of mosaic nanoparticles as a pan - flavivirus vaccine candidate. Neutralization and ADE assays are underway to evaluate their effectiveness. 83 Materials and Methods Sequence comparisons. Using Geneious 11.0.5 software, EDIII protein sequence alignments were performed with ClustalW235, the phylogenetic tree was built with the Jukes -Cantor distance model and neighbor -joining tree buil ding method, and pairwise percent identities were calculated.

Immunizations were carried out with subcutaneous injections of 5 \u00b5g of conjugated EDIII (calculated as the mass of the EDIII, assuming 100% efficiency of conjugation of 50% v/v AddaVax adjuvant (Invivogen). The mice were boosted at 14, 28, and 42 days after the prime with the same quantity of antigen in adjuvant. Animal s were bled via tail veins on day 0 (before the prime) and at days 14, 28, and 42 (before each boost). On day 60, the mice were euthanized and bled via cardiac puncture and spleens were harvested. Animal experiments were performed in accordance with Protoc ol 18074 at Rockefeller University approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

As demonstrated by antibo dy (Ab) neutralization at viral epitopes inaccessible in static models of virions29,30,33,34,36, the phenomenon of flavivirus \"breathing\" to expose cryptic Ab epitopes may results from conformational changes of the E protein during the viral lifecycle, such as during fusion237. Further evidence is provided by the finding that the potency of Abs against dengue virus is affected by mutations distant from the epitope, suggesting these mutations modulate virus \"breathing\" and ZIKV ) have been solved at resolutions as high as 3.1 \u00c5 with and without Fabs from neutralizing Abs21,22,28,35,61,238 -241. Known structures of Fab -bound ZIKV do not show major conformational differences from mature ZIKV unbound by Fab. However, crystal structures of Fabs neutralizing VH3- 23/VK1 -5 Abs, Z004 ZIKV envelope domain III (EDIII)36 superimposed onto the cryo- EM mature22,28 or immature21 ZIKV virion structures show these Abs cannot bind to the virus in the crystallographically -observed conformations due to steric hinderance (Figure 4.1). ZIKV und ergoes change, or \"breathing \", upon VH3- 23/VK1 -5 Fab binding. Here, I show ed progress using cryo- EM to capture the \"breathing\" conformation of Fab -bound mature ZIKV. 88 Figure 4.1.

Surface representations of the 89 Z004 mature binding epitope on EDIIIs (green) showing the portion that is accessible (light green) and the portion that is buried (dark green). Initial screening of Fab-mature ZIKV was performed for several Fabs using a Talos Arctica microscope with a 16M Ceta CMOS camera. An incubation time of 30 minutes to one hour at 4\u00b0C was sufficient to visualize \"spiky\" particles, indicating Fabs were bound to ZIKV. Molar ratios of 0.01-1 of Fab to E protein were assessed, with an increased molar ratio associated with the appearance of spikier virus particles (Figure 4.2). Figure 4.2. Electron micrographs of Z004 Fab -mature ZIKV. 90 Molar ratio s of Fab to E protein ranging from 0.01 to 1, incubation temperatures of 4\u00b0C or 40\u00b0C, and incubation times of 1 hour or overnight (O/N) were analyzed. Four data sets were then collected on a Titan Krios microscope with a K3 detector (Table 4.1). Processing for the first two datasets, Z004 Fab -ZIKV at a 0.1:1 molar ratio of Fab to E protein and Z006 Fab -ZIKV at a 0.01:1 ratio, resulted in a model without Fab bound , indicating the Fab to E protein molar ratio was too low . For the second two datasets, Z004 Fab- ZIKV and Z006 Fab -ZIKV, both at 0.5:1 Fab to E protein, the lat ter set was prioritized for processing due to the higher quality of the viruses on the micrographs. Both sets sh owed \"spiky\" particles, suggesting Fab was bound. For Z006 Fab -ZIKV, processing with cryoSPARC software showed a promising initial model with the lipid bilayer visible. However, further processing is necessary since the presence of heterogenous particles complicates model interpretation. 91 Table 4.1.

While class 1 and class 2 anti -RBD antibodies that block ACE2 binding are strongly neutralizing, clas s 4 antibodies target less accessible regions of the RBD base, and generally show weaker, but more broadly cross -reactive, neutralization. Understanding how antibody properties and epitopes correlate with neutralization potency and breadth is critical for vaccine design and developing antibody therapeutics. Here we focused on VH3- 30-derived antibodies, comparing potent neutralizers with tightly -neutralizing, antibodies. Single -electron microscopy structures of Fab -spike com plexes showed that Fabs from five weakly -neutralizing and one potently -neutralizing VH3- 30 antibody the spike trimer, with the potently -neutralizing antibody binding to a hybrid class 1/4 epitope. Analyses showed how variations in an tibody light chains and CDRH3 lengths affected VH3- 30 Ab targeting of class 1 epitopes, and how epitopes correlated with across diverse epitopes, 93 cross -reactivity, and neutralization profil es of VH3- 30 Abs illustrate their importance for vaccine design and therapeutic antibody development . Significance Statement The detection of new SARS -CoV- 2 variants and potential for new coronaviruses to spread from other species to humans has demonstra ted the importance of developing therapeutic approaches that provide broad protection against infection and severe symptoms. Eliciting class 4 Abs is a potential therapeutic strategy since these antibodies bind epitopes on the RBD that are more conserved a mong coronaviruses and SARS -CoV- 2 variants. By directly comparing the different epitopes, neutralization potencies and cross -reactivity profiles of VH3- 30 class 4 antibodies, we provide insight into the molecular features that determine the breadth and pot ency of antibody recognition and the potential for causing SARS -CoV- 2 spike trimer dissociation. 94 Introduction The previous SARS -CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS -CoV) epidemics and current SARS -CoV- 2 pandemic demonstrated the necessity of investigating immune responses to betacoronavirus infection and vaccination95-97,99,100. Given concerns regarding new SARS- CoV- 2 variants and the possibility for newly -emerging zoonotic betacoronaviruses to cause future outbreaks104,105,107 -110, it is important to thoroughly understand possible strategies that may confer broad protection against different SARS -like betacoronavirus (sarbecovirus) strains. Determining how the properties and epitopes of antibodies (Abs) correlate with their neutralization mechanism and cross -reactivity is critical for informed design of vaccines and Ab therapeutics that effectively accomplish this aim. Abs that target the receptor -binding domains (RBDs) of the SARS- CoV- 2 spike (S) trimer represent an important component of the protective immune response against infection112- 115,124 -134. The potent neutralization demonstrated by many of these Abs has been attributed to their ability to block the RBD from binding the SARS -CoV- 2 host receptor, angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 114- 117, therefore 'up' and 'down' conformations on an 'up' conformation 112- 114,118 -123. Abs that target the RBD have been described using a simplified classification scheme: class 1 VH3- 53/VH3- 63-derived Abs with short heavy (CDRH3s) that bind only 'up' RBDs at an epitope 95 overlapping with the ACE2 binding site, cla ss 2 Abs that bind 'up' or 'down' RBDs and also overlap with the ACE2 binding site, class 3 Abs that do not block ACE2 and bind 'up' or 'down' RBDs on the surface adjacent to the glycan at residue N343, and class 4 Abs that usually exhibit weaker neutraliz ation potencies and bind a cryptic surface of an 'up' RBD that faces the S trimer interior132. While the class 4 surface of the RBD is less accessible than other RBD epitopes, it is more conserved than the class 1 and 2 epitopes and has been suggested as a potential target for vaccine design to elicit broadly neutralizing Abs against other sarbecovirus strains 122,136,242 - 245. Ab binding to class 4 cryptic epitopes has been proposed to disrupt the prefusion - conformation of the spike and potentially cause spike shedding as a neutralization mechanis m 122,136,137,244. However, some class 4 Abs ar e only weakly neutralizing, possibly due to the reduced accessibility of the epitope122,134,135,137,244 -247. There are some exceptions that potently neutralize SARS -CoV- 2, including COVA1 -16 evolution)252, ADG -2, and ADI -56046 sh ow relatively potent cross - neutralization of SARS -CoV and/or other sarbecoviruses127,136,249,250, 252,253. Among RBD -targeting Abs, one of the germline heavy chain V gene segments that was reported as enriched or overrepresented compared to the human Ab repertoire is VH3- 30 and the closely- related VH3- 33 or VH3- 30-3 V gene segments124,126 -129,134,254. These and other Abs against S ARS- CoV- 2 show a relatively low number of somatic hypermutations compared to Abs isolated from individuals with other chronic infections124,126,127,245. Notably, VH3- 30 Abs have been found to bind class 2, 3, and 4 epitopes on the RBD122,127,132,135,136,255 - 257. While some VH3- 30 Abs have been reported as weak or non -neutralizing122,134,135,137, potently -neutralizing VH3- 30 Abs have also been 2)256, 96 C002 Understanding which Ab properties and epitopes correlate with potent versus weak neutralization and broad versus narrow cross- reactivity is important for guiding the design of vaccines intended to elicit broadly neutralizing VH3- 30 Abs. Here we report binding, neutralization, and structural studies to compare the epitopes, cross - reactivity and characteristics of weakly versus potently neutralizing Abs with a VH3- 30 or a closely -related V gene segment. From a panel of VH3- 30 RBD- targeting Abs previously isolated from COVID -19 convalescent donors127, we selected six Abs that bound comparably to SARS -CoV- 2 RBD (half maximal binding (EC 50s) within 3.8 -fold of each other127), one of which ( IGHV3- 30 or IGHV3- performed s tructural, cross -reactivity, and neutralization studies for these six Abs and compared them with other VH3- 30 Abs that were previously structurally characterized, including -EM) and X -ray crystallography, we showed that the five weak neutralizers bind distinct cryptic class 4 epitopes and cause S trimer dissociation. We also determined the structu re of the potent VH3- 30 neutralizer C149 bound to a hybrid RBD epitope midway between the class 1 and class 4 epitopes that is more accessible than class 4 epitopes, partly overlaps with the ACE2 epitope, and also causes S trimer dissociation. Our findings describe insights into the epitopes and properties of VH3- 30 Abs that correlate with weak versus potent neutralization and trimer dissociation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the VH3- 30 class 4 weakly -neutralizing Abs showed diverse cross -reactivity, a n important consideration for the development of vaccines aimed at eliciting a protective response against multiple sarbecovirus strains. 97 Results VH3- 30 Abs that bind SARS -CoV- 2 RBD showed variable neutralization potencies. From a collection of 534 anti -RBD Abs isolated from convalescent COVID -19 donors, 105 were encoded by VH3- 30 or a closely -related V gene segment, and some of these exhibited weak or no neutralization in vitro (50% inhibitory concentrations, IC50s, of >1000 ng/mL)127. From this panel, we five or non -neutralizers (C008, C027, C030, C113, and -CoV- 2 and SARS- CoV pseudovirus- based neutralization assays259 starting at Ab concentrations higher than 1000 ng/mL. The IC 50s we determined under these conditions \u00b5g/mL) showed that these Abs can neutralize SARS -CoV- 2, alth ough weakly (Figures 5.1A,C; Table 5.1). Our neutralization assays also confirmed that C149 (IC 50 = 14.1 ng/mL) neutralizes SARS- CoV- 2 (Figures 5.1A,C; Table 5.1) with a potency comparable to those of other VH3- 30 Abs, (Table 5.1). Of the six VH3- 30 Abs we investigated from the collection in Robbiani et al. (2020)127, only C027 neutralized SARS -CoV (IC 50 = 43.8 \u00b5g/mL). The other Abs showed no neutralization above background levels observed for a negative control Ab against SARS -CoV at concentrations 500 \u00b5g/mL (Figure 5.1B -C). VH3- binding to other sarbecovirus RBDs. We next assessed whether the six VH3- 30 Abs showed cross -reactive binding to a panel of sarbecovirus RBDs. ELISA measurements demonstrated that the VH3- 30 Abs showed variable cross -reactivity 98 profiles (Figure 5.1D; SI Appendix, Figure S5.1). While the potent neutralizer C149 did not show any -reactivity, Abs C008, C027, C030, C113 and C133 all showed strong cross -reactivity to a t least two other RBDs besides SARS -CoV- 2 (Figure 5.1D; SI Appendix, Figure S5.1). The weakly neutralizing Ab C133 showed the broadest cross -reactivity with binding to all RBDs, although binding to SARS -CoV and Rs4081 was relatively reduced. Additionally, C133 was the only one of the six Fabs that showed binding to BM4831. The weakly neutralizing Abs C027 and C030 showed -CoV, SHC014, RaTG13 and Rs4081), although binding to SARS -CoV was again reduced. Cross -reactivit y by C008 and C113 was more limited: C008 showed strong binding to WIV1 and SHC014 and reduced binding to RaTG13, which shares ~89% protein sequence similarity to SARS -CoV- 2 RBD (SI Appendix, Figure S5.2). C113 demonstrated strong binding to RaTG13 and red uced binding to WIV1 and SHC014 (Figure 5.1D). Structures of VH3 -30 Fabs revealed RBD epitopes and evidence for S trimer dissociation. To further investigate the different neutralization potencies and cross -reactive RBD -binding profiles, we used X- ray crystallography and single -particle cryo -EM to solve structures of Fab-RBD and Fab -S trimer complexes, respectively. We set up crystallization trials for each of the six Fabs in complex with SARS- CoV- 2 RBD, obtaining crystals from which a structure solution wa s possible for two complexes: C133 -RBD- C119 (where the Fab from the C119 neutralizing Ab 127,132 was added to aid in crystallization) C008 -RBD, resulting in 3.15 \u00c5 Tables Figure S5.3 -5.5). We also determine d cryo- EM structures of Fabs in complex with SARS - CoV- 2 6P S trimer260 for C149 (Figure 5.3; SI Appendix, Figure S5.3 - 5.5). 99 Classes corresponding to S trimers were observed in all cryo -EM datasets except C149; however, they were not complexed with Fab(s) with the exception of the C133 -S comp lex, which showed a Fab -bound trimer with increased separation between RBDs compared with other anti -RBD Fab- S complexes. The cryo -EM dataset is still being processed. The crystal structure showed C133 bound low on the RBD at a class 4 epitope similar to t hat of the VH3- 30-18 Ab EY6A122 and non -VH3- 30 weakly -neutralizing such as CR3022244,245, S2A4137, (Figures 5.2 SI Appendix, -5.5).

Fabs from weakly neutralizing VH3- 30 Abs bound to S protomers showed variable class 4 epitopes where the RBD sequence is more conserved, consistent with their observed cross -reactivity122,136,245,249,250,252,253 (Figure 5.1D, 5.4). C027, C030, and C113 bound overlapping epitopes laterally oriented on the class 4 surface that are distinct from epitopes of other structurally -characterized class 4 Abs (Figure 5.4). C008 bound more centrally on the class 4 region of the RBD, with an epitope simil ar to that of the VH3- 30-3 C027 - SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-2 C030 Fab - SARS-CoV-2 S C113 Fab - SARS-CoV-2 S C133 Fab - SARS-CoV-2 S Fab - SARS-CoV-2 S CR3022 Fab C008 rotated 45 -90\u00b0 compared to C118 V H-VL with less overlap between the V Hs than the V Ls (Figure 5.2D). Comparisons of buried surface areas (BSAs) on the RBDs and interacting residues at the binding inter faces revealed that the C008 VK1- 5 VL made fewer contacts with the RBD (7 vs.11 residues) with 50% less BSA (160 \u00c52 vs. 320 \u00c52) than C118 VL4 -69 V L (SI Appendix, Table S5.5). This difference was largely accounted for by increased contacts from the C118 V L framework region 3 (FWRL3) and complementarity determining region 2 (CDRL2). While the BSA on the RBD contributed by the V H domain was similar between C008 and C118, C008 showed more CDRH2 interactions whereas C118 more CDRH1 and CDRH3 interactions. 6M0J)117 structures, the C008 V L showed a clash with the ACE2 similar to that previously reported for C118 V L136 (Figure 5.2C). Apart from pairing with light chains derived from different V gene segments, other notable differences between C008 and C118 are the CDRH3 length (13 vs. 20 residues) and the presence of an N- linked glycan at C008 V L residue N26 (Figure 5.2B, Table 5.1; SI Appendix, Tables S5.1, S5.5). This residue corresponds to a serine in V Ls of all other VH3- 30 Fab- RBD structures that we compared except REGN10987 Figure S5.4 ). Of the structures, the epitope of the potent neutralizer C149 was highest on the RBD, being located midway between the epitopes for class 1 and class 4 ant -RBD Abs, a previously -unreported binding site for anti -SARS- CoV-2 VH3- 30 Abs 5.3 -5.5). This epitope partly overlapped with the ACE2 binding site and with class 1 epitopes typically targeted by VH3- 53/VH3- 63-derived Abs132. The location of 105 the epitope high on the RBD where the sequence is less conserved, is consis tent with the lack of cross -reactivity observed by C149122,136,242 -245 (Figure 5.1D, 5.3 epitopes of VH3- 30 and non- VH3- 30 class 4 Abs, but would be less buried at the S trimer center (Figures 5.4; Ab non-VH3-30 class non-neutralizing Absvariable conserved 106 Figure 5. 4.

Comparisons of buried surface areas (BSAs) on the RBDs and interacting residues at the binding interfaces revealed that the C008 VK1- 5 VL made fewer contacts with the RBD (7 vs.11 residues) with 50% less BSA (160 \u00c52 vs. 320 \u00c52) than C118 VL4- 69 V L (SI Appendix, Table S5.5). This difference was largely accounted for by increased contacts from the C118 VL framework region 3 (FWRL3) and complementary determining region 2 (CDRL2). While the BSA on the RBD contributed by the V H domain was similar between C00 8 and C118, C008 showed more CDRH2 interactions whereas C118 showed more CDRH1 and CDRH3 interactions. 6M0J) 117 structures, the C008 V L showed a clash with the ACE2 similar to that previously 107 reported for C118 V L136 (Figure 5.4C). Apart from pairing with light chains derived from different V gene segments, other notable dif ferences between C008 and C118 are the CDRH3 length (13 vs. 20 residues) and the presence of an N -linked glycan at C008 V L residue 5.1; SI Appendix, Tables S5.1, S5.5). This residue corresponds to a serine in V Ls of all other VH3- 30 Fab- RBD structures that we (SI S5.2 ). VH3- diverse cross- profiles against other sarbecoviruses. Since class 4 RBD epitopes are highly conserved among sarbecoviruses and have been proposed as a potential target for vaccine design to elicit a cross -reactive neutralizing res ponse122,136,242 -245, we assessed whether the six VH3- 30 Fabs we structurally characterized showed cross - reactive binding to a panel of sarbecovirus RBDs as assessed by ELISA122,136,242 -245,262,263. ELISA measurements demonstrated that the VH3- 30 Fabs showed variable cross -reactivity profiles (Figure 5.1 D; SI Appendix, Figure S5.4). The class 1/4 potent neutralizer C149 did not show any cross -reactivity, consistent with the location of the C149 epitope high on the RBD near the ACE2 binding site where the RBD sequence is less conserved122,136,242 -245 (Figures 5.2-5.3). In contrast, the class 4 Fabs weakly neutralizing Abs C008, C027, C030, C113, and C133 all showed strong cross -reactivity to at least two other RBDs besides SARS - CoV- 2, consistent with the cross -reactivity previously reported for other class 4 Abs122,136,245,249,250,252,253. The Fab of the weakly neutralizing Ab C133, which binds the lowest class 4 epitope on the RBD, showed the broadest cross -reactivity with binding to all RBDs, although binding to SARS -CoV and Rs4081 was relatively reduced. Additionally, C133 was the only one of the six Fabs that showed binding to BM4831. The weakly neutralizing Abs C027 and C030, which bind lower lateral epitopes on the RBD, showed cross -reactivity and Rs4081), although to -CoV was again relatively reduced. Cross -reactivity by C008 and C113 was more limited: C008 showed strong binding to WIV1 and SHC014 and 108 reduced binding to RaTG13, which shares ~89% protein sequence similarity to SARS - CoV- 2 RBD (SI Appendix, Figure S5.5). This contrasts with C118, which binds an overlapping epitope but cross -reacts with all the RBDs in the panel136. C113 demonstrated strong binding to RaTG13 and reduced binding to WIV1 and SHC014 (Figure 5.1D). Given that SARS -CoV and WIV1 RBD protein sequences are ~95% identical, it was interesting that Fabs of all five weakly -neutralizing Abs showed cross -reactive binding to WIV1, but reduced or no binding to SARS -CoV (Figure 5.1D, SI Appendix, F igure S5.5). The only two amino acids that differ between SARS -CoV and WIV1 that are near the RBD binding interface of the six VH3- 30 Abs we characterized are S373 RBD (near interface residues) and T430 RBD (an interacting residue) (numbering based on SARS -CoV- 2 RBD) (SI Appendix, Figure S5.3, S5.5)103,109,262. These residues (S373 and T430) are shared by SARS - CoV- 2 and WIV1, but correspond to a phenylamine and methionine, respect ively, in SARS - CoV. These differences may contribute to why these Abs bind SARS -CoV- 2 and WIV1, but show reduced binding to SARs -CoV. 109 Discussion Understanding the role of tightly binding but weakly neutralizing Abs in the immune response against SARS -CoV- 2 and determining structural correlates of weak versus potent neutralization is important for the development of vaccines and Ab therapeutics. Her e we performed cross -reactivity, neutralization, and structural studies for six VH3- 30 Abs (five weakly neutralizing and one potently neutralizing) isolated from COVID -19 convalescent donors127 to compare with previously characterized VH3- 30 Abs. In addition to determining the different epitopes targeted by these Abs, we provided insights into the ability of VH3- 30 Abs to target diverse RBD epitopes with varied neutralization and cross -reactivity profiles. Structural characterization of the binding epitopes of weakly neutralizing Abs with the VH3- 30 or a closely related V gene segment showed that all five Abs bound cryptic, but varied class 4 epitopes. Despite four of the five Abs sharing light chains derived from the same V L gene segmen t (VK1- 5) and three of the five sharing the same HC J gene segment (JH4*02 ), the Abs bound distinct epitopes with some overlap (Figure 5.4, Table 5.1; SI Appendix, Table S5.1). The Fab -bound protomers observed by cryo- EM for all five weakly neutralizing Fa bs and the potent class 1/4 neutralizer C149 indicated that Fab binding causes the trimer to dissociate under conditions for cryo -EM. Spike trimer disruption has also been observed for the class 4 Ab CR3022244, and the cryo -EM structure of C118 Fab bound to SARS -CoV- 2 showed Fab -bound trimer as well as Fab -bound protomer classes136. Although it is unknown how spike trimer dissociation correlates with neutralization, it has been suggested that class 4 Fab binding may promote spike shedding or disruption of the prefusion conformation o f the spike122,136,137,244. Despite binding the lowest class 4 epitope on the RBD of all the Fabs we characterized, only the C133 Fab -S complex showed Fab -bound trimers. The finding that the C133 -bound S trimer structure showed increased trimer opening similar to the C118 - bound S trimer136 is consistent with this mechanism. However, the location of the class 4 110 epitopes, buried at the trimer center, may also contribute to the reduced neutralization potency observed for several of these Abs. Since the potential to hinder ACE2 binding is uni formly observed among strong class 4 neutralizers, this supports that ACE2 blocking is the most important determinant of whether a class 4 Ab can potently neutralize SARS- CoV- 2136,248 ng at angles that clashed with ACE2 when an ACE2 -bound RBD structure117. The neutralizing C149 antibody bound an epit ope that reaches higher on the RBD than class 4 but lower than class 1 epitopes, thereby directly overlapping with part of the ACE2 epitope. The only other neutralizing VH3- 30 Abs that we identified that directly blocks part of ACE2 epitope were P17256 and C002132, class 2 anti -RBD Abs. While the C008 epitope overlapped with that of (C118136, C022136, COVA1- 16248, H014249, and DH1047251) and the Fab showed clashes when superimposed with the structure of ACE2 -bound RBD117, C008 unexpectedly did not show potent neutraliza tion. The neutralization demonstrated by C008 (IC 50 = 7390 ng/mL) was ~7-48-fold more potent than the weakest class 4 neutralizers (C027, C030, C113, and H014249, and 5.4). The C008 V genes ( VH3- 30/VK1 - 5) are similar to many of the weak neutralizers (C027, C030, and C113) and may not be ideally suited for potent neutralization at this epitope. Notably, the potent neutralizer C008 shares a similar V H V gene segment ( VH3- 30-3; 80% identity), while gene ( VK1- 5; 94% identity), but with a different light chain or heavy chain respectively (SI Appendix, Table S5.1). Compared to C118, the C008 V L buried 50% less surface area on its RBD epitope, demonstrating the impact diverse light chain pairing can have on VH3- 30 epitope and neutralization potency (SI Appendix, Table S5.5). It is also possible that the N - 111 glycan on C008 V L residue N26 may contribute to its lower potency, although it does not block the binding interface. The class 4 epitopes can be further subclassified b y Abs that bind low, laterally, centrally, or high on the class 4 surface (Figure 5.4). The low binders, including VH3- 30 Abs C133 and EY6A122 and non- VH3- 30 Abs CR3022244,245, S2A4137, and S304134, tend to show weak or inconsistent neutralization against SARS -CoV- 2135 (Figures 5.1, 5.3, Table 5.1). This correlates with the reduced accessibility of this epitope at the trimer center and the increased distance from the ACE2 binding site. The lateral binders, VH3- 30 Abs C027, C030, and C113, bound the left lateral aspect o f the class 4 surface and tend to be weakly neutralizing135 (Figures 5.1, 5.4I). The central binders, VH3- 30 Abs C008 and C022136, COVA1- H014249 and DH1047250,251, show the potential to hinder ACE2 binding and tend to be potently neutralizing, with the exception of C008, as described above (Figures 5.1, 5.4H- J). Finally, the high binder, the class 1/4 VH3- 30 Ab C149, directly blocks the ACE2 epitope, but its epitope reaches lower on the RBD than other class 1 binders (Figure 5.4C). The ability of potently and weakly neutralizing Abs derived from VH3- 30 or related V gene segments to bind diverse epitopes, the four class 4 subclasses and class 1 -3 epitopes, is impacted by their varied light chain pairings (Figure 5.4; SI Appendix, Table S5.1). Anti - SARS- CoV- 2 VH3- 30 Abs showed pairing with a variety of light chains, including but not limited to VK1- 39, VK1- 5, VL1 -5, VL2- 14 and VL4 -69126,127,129,254,264. This is consistent with the ability of the VH3- 30 Abs with different light chain V genes to bin d similar epitopes, but with varying neutralization potencies and different angles of approach. For example, C118136 and C008 both bind central class 4 epitopes, and P17256, C002132 and COVOX -75135 all bind class 2 epitopes, but only one or two of the Abs, respectively, are potently neutralizing in each case. The reduced potency of COVOX -75 was attributed to the finding that the ma jority of RBD interactions were with V L outside the ACE2 binding site. The V H interactions were 112 limited to the 20- residue long CDRH3 that may be displaced by ACE2 binding135. When comparing VH3- 30 Abs, weak neutralizers showed more V L BSA than potent neutralizers on average (360 vs. 230 \u00c52 VL BSA) (SI Appendix, Table S5.5). These observations indicate the light chain impacts where the VH3- 30 Ab binds and whether or not Abs bound at a particular epi tope are neutralizing. However, some VH3- 30 Abs paired with light chains of the same V gene can bind different epitopes; for example, the VH3- 30/VK1- 5 Abs bind class 3 (C135) or (C008, C027, C030) epitopes, and the VH3- 30/VK1- 39 Abs bind class 1/4 (C149), class 2 (C002) and class 4 (C133 and EY6A), indicating that other factors contribute to epitope variability. The anti - SARS- CoV- 2 VH3- 30 Abs showed large CDRH3 length variability, ranging from 12 -20 residues in the Abs we compared and in other stud ies135 (Table 5.1; SI Appendix, Figures S5.3, S5.4, Table Variation in the CDRH3 accounts for over 56 -70% of the amino acid differences of the V H of C135 compared to C008, C027 and C030 and 70 Appendix, Figures S5.3 -5.4). For the VH3- 30 Abs compared in this study, average CDRH3 length was similar between potent (15 residues) and weak neutralizers (17 residues) (Table 5.1). Additionally, CDRH3 lengths by binding class were simi lar for class 1/4 (18), class 2 (16), and class 4 (17), but shorter for class 3 (13) VH3- 30 Abs (Table 5.1). The large variations in CDRH3 sequences are consistent with the unique ability of VH3- 30 Abs to bind multiple RBD epitopes. Understanding which Abs are able to cross -react with other sarbecovirus RBDs is critical for vaccine development aimed at eliciting a broad immune response against multiple coronavirus strains. While it has been suggested that eliciting Abs that target the conserved class 4 epit ope may be an effective therapeutic strategy122,136,242 -245, the ability of several weakly neutralizing class 4 Abs to show high affinity cross -reactive binding with weak or no cross -neutralization is an important consideration and possible complication for the effectiveness of this approach. Despite bi nding different class 4 RBD epitopes, all five C133) showed strong cross -reactive binding to at least two different RBDs, but only C027 showed any cross -neutralization. The cross -neutralizatio n by C027 against SAR -CoV (IC 50 = 43.8 \u00b5g/mL) was 10 -fold weaker than the cross -neutralization reported for the class 4 VH3- 30 potent SARS- CoV- 2 neutralizer C118 against (IC 50 3870 ng/mL)136. These cross -reactive but not cross -neutralizing A bs may exhibit protective effects in vivo through Fc effector functions, but this requires further investigation265. The ACE2 blocking epitope targeted by the potent neutralizer C149 is more accessible but less conserved than class 4 epitopes, explaining the lack of cross -reactive binding observed by C149. Given that SARS -CoV and WIV1 RBD protein sequences are ~95% identical, it was interesting that Fabs of all five weakly -neutralizing Abs showed cross -reactive binding to WIV1, but re duced or no binding to SARS -CoV (Figure 5.1D; SI Appendix, Figure S5.2). The only two amino acids that differ between SARS -CoV and WIV1 that are near the RBD binding interface of the six VH3- 30 Abs we characterized are S373 RBD (near interface residues) a nd T430 RBD (an interacting residue) (numbering based on SARS -CoV- 2 RBD) (SI Appendix, Figure S5.2, S5.5)103,109,262. These residues (S373 and T430) are shared by SARS - CoV- 2 and WIV1, but correspond to a phenylamine and methionin e, respectively, in SARS - CoV. These differences may contribute to why these Abs bind SARS -CoV- 2 and WIV1, but show reduced binding to SARs -CoV. Cross- reactive binding and neutralization against SARS -CoV and other sarbecoviruses was previously observed for anti-SARS- CoV- 2 potently C022, DH1047, ADG- 2, and ADI -56046127,136,249,250,252,253. However, similar to our observation for the weakly neutralizing Ab C027, the potently neutralizing class 4 Ab COVA1- 16 cross- reacted with SARS -CoV, but showed only weak cross -neutralization (IC 50 >1 \u00b5g/mL)248. Despite binding a similar epitope and at a similar Fab orientation as C022136, COVA1- 16248 used different V genes and did not show the potent cross -neutralization of 114 SARS- CoV exhibited by C022136,248,266. Comparisons of these Abs indicate that potent class 4 SARS -CoV- 2 neutralizers use a variety of different V H and V L genes and are not all potent cross -neutralizers. Since both weak and potent class 4 SARS -CoV- 2 neutralizers can show cross -reactive binding without cross -neutralization, efforts to use a conserved class 4 - based immunogen for vaccine design may not necessarily elicit Abs that are broadly - neutralizing. The ability of class 4 Abs to bind highly similar epitopes does not indicate those Abs will show the same cross -neutralization profiles. Consequentially, these findings demonstrate the importance of understanding the structural correlates of diverse neutralization and cross -reactivity profiles in order to inform the design of effective vac cines and targeted Ab therapeutics. 115 Materials and Methods Sequence alignments and analysis.

Fabs and IgGs were further purified with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide. RBDs with a C- terminal His -tag were produced as previously described 132,136,202 by transient transfection of Expi293F cells. RBD constructs included following Ni -NTA affinity chromatography and SEC using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide. PM site, a foldon trimerization motif, an octa- His tag, and an AviTag. S trimer was expressed by transient transfection of 116 Expi293F cells and purified with Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and SEC using a Super dex 200 column (GE Healthcare)in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide. Peak fractions were identified by SDS -PAGE and combined. Crystallization trials. For the C008 Fab -SARS- CoV- 2 RBD complex, Fabs and RBD were incubated on ice for 1 hr with a Fab:RBD molar ratio of 2:1 for C008 Fab -SARS- CoV- 2 RBD. The complexes were then purified by SEC on a Superdex 200 10/300 Increase column (GE Healthcare) and concentrated to 8 mg/mL. Crystallization trials we re set up in sitting -drop MRC plates with a Mosquito micro -crystallization robot and stored at room temperature. Crystals were cryo - protected with 25% glycerol. Crystallization conditions corresponding to determined structures included 2 -propanol, 0.1 M X-ray data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Light Source (SSRL) beamline 12 Fab -C119 Fab-SARS- CoV- 2 RBD complex data were processed using iMosflm161. Data were scaled using Aimless162,163. Structures were solved by molecular replacement (MR) with Phaser -MR164. For the C008 Fab-SARS- CoV- 2 RBD structure, the structure was first determined at 2.7 \u00c5 using C110 CHCL and V HVL (PDB 7K8P)132 as initial search models36. This gave a partial solution wi th one Fab. The sequence was mutated to correspond to the sequence of the C008 Fab, and this was used to generate C008 V HVL and C HCL search models. These were used, along with SARS- CoV- 2 RBD (PDB 7K8M)132, as search models in additional rounds of molecular 117 replacement. Three Fabs bound to RB D were identified in total. After a few rounds of rigid-body refinement with torsion -angle non -crystallographic symmetry restraints and group and individual B factors using phenix.refine165, the R -free flags were transferred to th e map processed at 3.0\u00c5. Further refinement with torsion -angle non -crystallographic symmetry restraints, individual B factors and TLS parameters was performed using this map. The C133 Fab- C119 Fab- SARS- CoV- 2 RBD structure was determined by initially using a 3.5 \u00c5 map for molecular replacement with C110 C HCL (PDB 7K8M)132 as search models. A partial solution with a correctly placed C110 C HCL and C110 V HVL was mutated to correspond to the sequence of C133 Fab, and this was used to generate C133 V HVL and C HCL search models. These were used, along with C119 C HCL and V HVL and SARS -CoV- 2 RBD as search models for molecular replacement using a map processed at 3.15\u00c5. Correctly placed Fabs and RBDs were used as partial solutions in iterative rounds of molecular replacement until all components, three RBDs bound by two Fabs each, were correctly placed. Refinement was performed using phenix.refine165 with torsion -angle non - crystallographic symmetry restraints, group and individual B factors, a nd TLS parameters and with manual refinement in Coot270. PDB accession codes and X -ray data collection and refinement statistics are in SI Appendix, Table S5.2. Figures were prepared using PyMOL (Version LLC)166 or UCSF Chimera271. Fab- RBD interfaces were mapped as residues within 4 \u00c5. BSAs (calculated using a 1.4 \u00c5 probe) and interacting residues at Fab -RBD interfaces (calculated using a distance of <3.89 \u00c5 and an A -D-H angle >90\u00b0 for H -bonds and a distance <4 \u00c5 for salt bridges) were determined with PDBePISA168. The PDB accession codes of the structures used for RBD BSA representations and are based on Fab -bound structures of SARS- CoV- 2 RBD except for C118, which is based on SARS -CoV136,272. Amino acid sequence conservation was calculated with ConSurf273 and shown on a surface representation of a SARS -CoV- 2 RBD (PDB 7BZ5)274. Cryo- EM sample preparation. Fab incubated with 3 mg/mL SARS -CoV- 2 S trimer at a 1.2:1 molar ratio of Fab: protomer on ice for 30 minutes. A PELCO easiGLOW Glow Discharge Cleaning System (Ted Pella) was used to glow discharge 300 mesh, 1.2/ 1.3 QuantiFoil grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 1 minute at 20 mA. Octyl -maltoside, fluorinated solution (Anatrace) was added to the complex at a final concentration of 0.02% w/v, immediately before applying 3.1 \u00b5L of the complex to the grid. Sampl es were blotted for 2.5- 3.5 s. with Whatman No. 1 filter paper before vitrification in 100% liquid ethane using a Mark IV Vitrobot (Thermo Fisher) at 22\u00b0C and 100% humidity. Cryo- EM structure data collection, processing and analysis. Single -particle cryo -EM data were collected on a Talos Arctica transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher) operating at 200 kV. Movies were collected with SerialEM v3.7 automated data collection software275 using beam -image shift over a 3 by 3 pattern of 1.2 \u00b5m holes with one exposure per hole. Movies were recorded in super -resolution mode (0.435 \u00c5/pixel) on a K3 camera (Gatan ). When data processing is completed, data collections parameters will be included. Cryo- EM data processing was performed with cryoSPARC v2.15.0 and v3.2.0276. Movies were patch motion corrected for beam -induced motion after binning super -resolution movies. Non- dose- weighted images were used to estimate CTF parameters usi ng the patch CTF estimation job, and micrographs with power spectra showing poor CTF fits or crystalline ice were discarded. Blob picker was used for reference -free selection of particles with a 140 - 240\u00c5 diameter using the circular blob option. Particles w ere extracted for subsequent 2D 119 classification. The best class averages were used to generate five ab-initio models (S trimer, Fab -bound S protomer, or junk/noise classes). All particles were then used in heterogeneous refinement against the five ab initio volumes generated with the smaller subset. Particles assigned to the volume with Fab -bound S protomer were further cleaned via iterative rounds of ab-initio reconstruction, heterogenous refinement, 2D classification, and homogenous refinement. Trimer clas ses were also further cleaned, but only in one case, for C133 Fab -SARS- CoV2 S6P, was a trimer found have Fab bound. To improve resolution at the Fab -RBD interfaces, volumes were segmented in UCSF Chimera271 and the regions corresponding to the RBD domains and Fab V H-VL domains were extracted and used to generate a soft mask (5- pixel dilation radius, 10 -pixel soft padding width). Local refinement with the mask resulted in modest improvements of the Fab- RBD interface. Cryo -EM processing is still in progress. ELISAs. ELISAs were performed at previously described136,202. RBDs at 2.5 \u00b5g/mL in 100 mM NaH CO 3 pH 9.8 was coated on Nunc MaxiSorp 384 -well plates (Sigma) and stored at 4\u00b0C overnight. Plates were then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 20 mM 0.02% sodium azide, 0.1% Tween20 (TBS -T) for 1 hr. at room temperatur e. After blocking solution was removed, IgGs at 50 \u00b5g/mL were four -fold serially diluted in 3% BSA , TBS -T and added to plates at room temperature for 3 hr. Plates were then washed with TBS- T and incubated with a 1:15,000 dilution of secondary HRP - conjugate d goat anti -human IgG (Southern Biotech) at room temperature for 45 minutes. Plates were washed with TBS -T, developed using SuperSignal ELISA Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (ThermoFisher), and read at 425 nm. ELISAs were performed in duplicate. AUC me asurements were determined after sigmoidal nonlinear regression (least - squares method without weighting with GraphPad Prism 9.0.0 software). Neutralization assays. Abs were four -fold serially diluted in PBS and incubated with SARS - CoV or SARS- CoV- 2 pseudot virus at 37 \u00b0C. Pseudotyped HIV- 1 lentiviral 120 reporter particles were prepared as previously described127,136,202,259 using genes encoded for S glycoproteins with deletions in the C -terminal cytoplasmic tail: a 21 amino acid deletion for SARS- CoV- 2 and 19 amino acid deletion for SARS -CoV. The SARS -CoV- 2 S gene also included th e D614G mutation. Final starting concentrations against SARS -CoV- 2 were \u00b5g/mL The mixture of Ab and pseudotyped virus was added to HEK 293T ACE2 cells127 seeded the previous day on poly- Lysine -coated 96 -well plates. After incubating for 48 hours at 37\u00baC, target cells were lysed with Britelite Plus (Perkin Elmer) and luciferase activity was measured as relative luminesce units (RLUs) and normalized to valu es derived from cells infected with pseudotyped virus in the absence of Ab. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50) were determined using a 3 -parameter (for SARS -CoV) or 4 -parameter (for SARS -CoV- 2) nonlinear regression (least -squares method without weigh ting) (GraphPad Prism 9.0.0). Experiments were repeated twice; curves from one experiment are shown in Figure 5.1A -B, and reported IC 50 values are the averaged IC 50s from the two independent experiments. 121 SI Appendix Figure S5. 1.

With an estimated 1028 daily viral infections, viruses are thought to be responsible for ~50% of microbial mortality. Marine sediment, accumulated on the ocean floor, is a large carbon sink where organic carbon is buried and degraded; consequentially, assessing the impact of viruses on microbes in marine sediment is particularly important. Viral production is often assessed by a sediment dilution-based method that relies on nucleic acid staining over a time series. An alternative method for quantifying viral production utilizes biorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) to fluorescently label viruses after lysis of translationally - active host microorganisms 277. Here we showed preliminary res ults towards a comparison of the two methods, dilution-based and BONCAT, for quantifying viral production in marine sediment near a deep -sea methane seep in Monterey, California. Understanding the efficacy and limits of these methods is important for accur ately quantifying viral production and obtaining deeper insight into virus -host interactions critical for nutrient cycling and biogeochemical cycles. 132 Introduction The effects of viruses in marine ecosystems. At an average concentration of 10 million per milliliter of surface seawater, viruses are the smallest, yet most abundant biological entities in the ocean, outnumbering bacteria by approximately ten -fold278. These highly abundant entities play critical roles in bacterial mortality, microbial population dynamics, food webs, horizontal gene transfer, and biogeochemical cycling. With ~1028 viral infections occurring per day, viruses are responsible for an estimated 50% of marine bacterial mortality with 20-30% of bacterial cells infected at any time278,279. Lysis of infected bacteria results in the release of up to three gigatons of carbon into the ocean each year278,280. Consequentially, viral lysis is a major player in altering microbial populations and rapid recycling of carbon and other nutrients in the ocean281,282. Although more is known about viruses in the upper water column, understanding of viral production and infection rates, host specificity, and viral diversity in marine sediment remains limited. Viruses in marine sediment may impact biogeochemical cycles. Marine sediment accumulated on the ocean floor is a primary source of carbon burial and degradation 280. As the largest biome in the world, marine sediment is host to an abundance of viruses (benthic viruses) responsible for prokaryotic mortality 280,283. Through virus-induced bacterial lysis, viruses transform heterotrophic production into enormous amount of dissolved organic material important for sustaining resource-limited benthic ecosystems280,283. The impact of viruses on bacteria and archaea in sediment near methane seeps is of particula r interest. Microorganisms consume methane through anaerobic oxidation, preventing this greenhouse grass with potent warming potential from reaching the atmosphere284- 286. Therefore, it is important to fully understand virus -host interactions that influence these microbial communities280. To evaluate the biogeochemical impact of virus -host interactions in sediment near methane seeps, it is essential to develop accurate methods to measure viral production rates and virus -induced mortality. 133 The dilution-based method quantifies viral production by nucleic acid staining. The dilution-based approach is the current conventional method for determining viral production. This approach is based on time course incubations of sediment diluted with virus-free seawater followed by recovery of virus, a second dilution, staining of viral particles using nucleic acid stain (SYBR fluorochromes, and counting virus-like particles (VLPs) with epifluorescence microscopy283. The rationale for this method is that by reducing environmental virus and host densities by dilution, the effect of new infections is minimized, thus permitting measurement of the number of viruses released from their hosts at the end of the lytic cycle. Viral loss from protozoa and other predators or possible enzymatic degradation will also be minimized 283. However, this method relies on the assumption that all stained nucleic acid -containing particles are viruses, and newly produced viruses cannot be distinguished from viruses already present at the start of the incubation. BONCAT facilitates quantification of viral production by labeling newly-translated viral proteins. Fluorescence-based biorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) can be used to directly quantify viral production and detect newly synthesized viral proteins in environmentally-relevant virus-host model systems 277. BONCAT works through addition of a non-canonical amino acid, specifically the methionine derivative L - homopropargylglycine (HPG) in this case, which is taken u p by translationally active cells287. HPG is incorporated into newly synthesized proteins in bacteria and archaea, including those of new viral proteins. To visualize viral production over time, samples are passed through a 0.2-\u00b5m filter to remove cells. Then, upon addition of fluorescence -based click-reaction reagents, including an azide-containing fluorescent dye, a reaction this azide with alkyne in HPG (F igure VLPs can be visualized with epifluorescence microscopy, and viral production can be quantified by imaging at timepoints over the course of an incubation277. 134 Figure 6.1. BONCAT click chemistry using the non -canonical amino acid HPG. The key difference between the dilution -based method and BONCAT is the reliance on nucleic acid staining versus protein labeling to quantify viruses, requiring that BONCAT stained viruses are produced from metabolically active hosts that have taken up HPG . To assess differences in outcomes and the accuracy of viral quantification techniques, here we showed progress comparing the dilution-based and BONCAT approaches for quantification of viral production in environmental water and marine sediment samples. We evaluated sediment from the top 20 cm of a core extracted from a microbial mat of an active methane seep site, located at a depth of 965.8 m in the Monterey submarine canyon, to provide insight on the impact of viruses on microorganisms associated with these productive zones of greenhouse gas emission.

Comparisons of BONCAT and the dilution-based method were initially practiced using a readily available environmental sample: water from the Caltech Turtle Pond. Microcosm incubations of 250 mL pond water without HPG and 250 mL with 50 \u00b5M HPG were prepared and harvested at 0, 6, 9, and 12 hours and 1 week timepoints. At each timepoint, 1 mL of each sample was 0.2 \u00b5m-filtered (to remove cells) for BONCAT, 1 mL of each unfiltered sample was harvested for the dilution method, and 1 mL of each unfiltered sample was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for later assessment of bacterial counts. For the dilution method, samples without HPG were prepared in a dilution series to identify the optimal dilution that would allow enumeration of between 20 and 40 VLPs per optical field283. A twofold dilution series, ranging from 15-fold to 480-fold, was used to prepare six dilutions of the sample in virus-free salt mix buffer (100 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgSO 4, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5). This was followed by DNase treatment to remove free nucleic acids and then nucleic acid staining with SYBR Gold. VLPs were visualized using a 100x immersion objective on an upright epifluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51). Images were collected using CellSens software and a QIClick Mono 12-bit and to monitor SYBR Gold nucleic acid staining) (Figure 6.2). Images were analyzed in Image J, and signal in images with a FITC filter were counted as VLPs . The optimal dilution for this sample was determined to be ~60-fold, yielding 20 to 40 VLPs in the optical field. 136 Figure 6.2. Nucleic acid -stained VLPs in an environmental water sample dilution series . Water from the Caltech Turtle Pond was diluted and nucleic acids were staine d with SYBR Gold (detected with a FITC filter; green). The dilution factor can be optimized to separate VLPs from cells and enable counting of individual VLPs . The scale bar is 10 m. To practice the BONCAT protocol with environmental samples, 1 \u00b5m alkyne -conjugated magnetic beads (positive controls) were added to filtered pond water that was previously incubated with and without HPG. Samples underwent a copper-catalyzed click reaction to label HPG-incorporated proteins (and the positive control , alkyne-conjugated magnetic diazo biotin-azide. A fluorescent streptavidin-Alexa 647 conjugate was then added to bind the biotin to facilitate visualization. This was followed by nucleic acid counter-staining with SYBR Gold (Figure 6.3). Samples were visualized with an Olympus BX51 epifluorescence microscope (100x oil objective as described above), and images were collected using CellSens software (Olympus) and a QIClick Mono 12-bit 700/75 nm emission to monitor BONCAT-labeling). Images were analyzed in Image J, and overlapping signal in the images from FITC and Cy5 filte rs were counted as VLPs . successful visualization of BONCAT-labeled VLPs and nucleic acid staining demonstrated the feasibility of proceeding with marine sediment samples. 137 Figure 6.3. Visualization of newly -produced VLPs in BONCAT -labeled environmental water samples . Water samples from the Caltech Turtle Pond were incubated with or without HPG before staining with SYBR Gold (detected with a FITC filter; green) and click-addition of a fluorophore to newly translated proteins (detected with a Cy5 filter; red). Here, the 12 hour timepoint is displayed. Merged images from FITC and Cy5 filters display successful BONCAT labeling (yellow). One m azide-beads were added to both samples as a positive control, and are displayed yellow as expected. Newly produced VLPs , ~50 nm288 are also displayed yellow, as shown in the enlarged inset on the right. Preparing incubations of sediment from an active methane seep. After testing BONCAT and the dilution-based methods on environmental water samples , we set up incubations of a marine sediment sample relevant for understanding the impact of viruses on microorganisms from methane seeps. Sediment below a sulfide -oxidizing microbial mat 138 from an active methane seep in the Monterey Submarine Canyon (36 46.5799 N 122 5.0935 W, depth of 965.8 m) was collected using a push coring device operated by a remotely operated vehicle in December, 2018 and stored near the in situ temperature (4\u00baC) under anaerobic conditions. Using N 2-sparged 0.02 \u00b5m-filtered virus-free seawater collected from the same site, the anoxic sediment from 0-20 cm horizons was diluted by ~50% and split into 120 individual 4.5 mL anaerobic incubations (in 50 mL rubber- stoppered glass serum bottles on ice): half with 50 \u00b5M HPG added and half without HPG (three replicates per method per timepoint) (Figure 6.4). Nitrogen gas was exchanged for methane, and incubations were stored in the dark at 4\u00b0C. Harvesting incubation timepoints. Individual incubations with and without HPG were harvested at 0, 48, 51, 54, 57, and 72 hours, and 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks (Figure 6.4). For each timepoint, six of the incubations with HPG and six of the incubations without HPG were harvested with the aim of having sufficient samples available to test the two different virus quantification methods (BONCAT versus dilution-based) and two different methods of virus recovery from sediment (centrifugation versus tetrasodium pyrophosphate) in triplicate. Both short (hours) and long (weeks) incubation times were utilized to facilitate comparison with previous dilution-based studies 283. No samples were harvested during the 1-48 hours after the start of the incubation to allow sediment to be refreshed from the previously \"dormant\" state during storage. 139 Figure 6. 4. Incubation setup of sediment slurry from Monterey Submarine Canyon. Sediment slurry was split into 120 individual 4.5 mL anaerobic incubations in serum bottles, half with 50 \u00b5M HPG and half without HPG. Samples were harvested in triplicate at ten different timepoints ( 0, 48, 51, 54, 57, and 72 hours, and 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks) with and without HPG and for two different possible methods of virus recovery (centrifugation or addition of tetrasodium pyrophosphate before centrifugation). Not all samples were ultimately processed. Samples were harvested by pouring the 4.5 mL of sediment slurry from each serum bottle into individual 15 mL Falcon Conical Centrifuge Tubes on ice. To assist with transferring residual sediment, 2-3 mL of virus-free seawater (4\u00b0C) was added to the serum bottles (1 140 mL at a time) and then the bottles were shaken and the remaining sample was added to the Falcon tube. This addition of 2-3 mL of virus-free seawater was done during the transfer for all timepoints except the 0 hour timepoint, for which 2 mL of seawater was added directly to the Falcon tubes. The Falcon tubes were then vigorously shaken to evenly mix the sediment and virus -free seawater. To prepare a fixed sample cellular background, 500 \u00b5l aliquots of each sediment slurry were removed and combined with 500 \u00b5l 4% PFA, 1x PBS in 2 mL Eppendorf tubes and stored at 4\u00b0C overnight. The remaining sediment slurry in the Falcon tubes was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20\u00b0C. The next day, the fixed cellular background samples were centrifuged at 14,000g for 5 minutes in an Eppendorf 5425 centrifuge and PFA supernatant was removed. Residual PFA was removed by resuspending the pellets in 1 mL 1x PBS with a Vortex mixer and pipettin g. Samples were again centrifuged (14,000g, 5 minutes) and PBS supernatant was removed. These wash steps, resuspension in PBS and centrifugation, were repeated a second time. The pellets were then resuspended in 1 mL of 50% EtOH, 50% 1x PBS, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -20\u00b0C. Virus recovery from sediment using centrifugation. Three harvested sediment slurry samples with HPG and three without HPG from each of the 10 timepoint ( 0, 48, 51, 54, 57, and 72 hours, and 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks) were thawed on ice for recovery of the virus from the sediment using centrifugation. The other half of the samples were left fr ozen at -20\u00b0C for possible use at a later date if a different method of virus recovery (addition of tetrasodium pyrophosphate before centrifugation) is needed. The 60 samples were centrifuged at 800g, 4\u00b0C for 2 minutes using a Beckman Coulter Allegra X -15R centrifuge to isolate the virus in the seawater supernatant from the sediment pellet . The volume in each Falcon tube was recorded (Table 6.1) before the supernatant was extracted with a pipet. For the supernatant samples with HPG, two 500 \u00b5l aliquots were prepared for BONCAT: one was passed through a 0.2-\u00b5m filter and one was unfiltered. For supernatant 141 samples without HPG, four 500 \u00b5l aliquots were prepared: one filtered and one unfiltered for BONCAT (to serve as the negative control s to account for autof luorescence ) and one filtered and one unfiltered for the dilution -based method.

One 0.2-\u00b5m filtered supernatant sample with HPG and one filtered supernatant sample without HPG from each of four timepoints (72 hours and 1, 2, and 3 weeks) as well as a salt mix buffer control were loaded onto Whatman Anodisc inorganic filter membranes (25 mm, pore size 0.02 \u00b5m) in preparation for BONCAT. The samples were prepared by diluting 20 \u00b5L into 5 mL of 0.02 -\u00b5m-filtered salt mix buffer to help ensure the VLPs would be equally distributed on Anodisc surface. Anodiscs were first washed using a filter tower with an attached vacuum pump. The fritted glass support base was washed with Nanopure water before a Durapore 5 \u00b5m PVDF or PES membrane (25 mm) filter was placed on top. The filter was then wet with 1 mL of 0.02 \u00b5m-filtered water using a pipet before the Anodisc was placed face up on top of the filter. Due to prior instances of contamination, the Anodiscs were slowly washed multiple times in a drop-wise fashion with a pipet as follows: 1 mL of 0.02 \u00b5m-filtered 1x PBS, 1 mL of 50% ethanol (EtOH), 1 mL of 70% EtOH, and 1 mL of 80% EtOH. The 5 mL of sample was then slowly loaded onto the Anodisc in a circular dropwise fashion, letting the liquid pass through the filter before applying more, to help ensure the VLPs would be evenly distributed. The Anodisc was then washed with 1 mL 0.02 \u00b5m-filtered 1x PBS two times. Once dried, the Anodisc was lifted off the support base by grasping the rim with clean forceps and transferred to a petri dish for storage at 4\u00b0C until proceeding with the click reaction (no longer than one day later). 143 BONCAT labelling of samples on Anodiscs. BONCAT labeling was performed by a copper-catalyzed click reaction to label HPG -incorporated proteins with Alexa Fluor Dye 647 conjugated to picolyl azide (spectrally almost identical to Cy5 dye). A 250 \u00b5l click cocktail was prepared by combining 0.5 \u00b5l of 10 mM Alexa Fluor 647 picolyl-azide fluorphyl in DMSO, 2.5 \u00b5l of 0.2 \u00b5m-filtered 50 mM THPTA, and 1.25 \u00b5l of freshly prepared 20 mM cooper sulfate in 0.02 \u00b5m-filtered water. The click cocktail w as incubated at room temperature in the dark for 3 minutes before 12.5 \u00b5l of freshly prepared 100 mM aminoguanidine in 0.02 \u00b5m-filtered 1x PBS, 12.5 \u00b5l of freshly prepared 100 mM sodium ascorbate in 0.02 \u00b5m-filtered PBS, and 221 \u00b5l of 0.02 \u00b5m-filtered 1x PBS were added. The click cocktail was mixed by tube inversion and Vortex machine and kept in the dark. A 25 \u00b5l aliquot was placed on a petri dish, and the Anodisc (with previously loaded sample) was carefully placed face up over the click cocktail aliquot, making sure no air bubbles were present. The Anodisc was then covered with a glass square coverslip to prevent possible oxidation and stored in the dark for 30 minutes. The Anodiscs were then transferred to a new petri dish and washed three times, first with 0.02 \u00b5m-filtered 1x PBS, then 0.02 \u00b5m- filtered water, and finally 0.02 \u00b5m-filtered 50% EtOH, by filling the petri dish with enough solution to completely cover the Anodisc, keeping the dish in the dark for 3 minutes, and then carefully pouring out the solution. Nucleic acid staining. Once BONCAT-labelled Anodiscs dried, nucleic acid staining was performed with SYBR Gold. A 25x working solution of SYBR Gold Samples was prepared in 0.02 \u00b5m-filtered water. A 25 \u00b5l aliquot was then placed in a drop on the petri dish and the Anodisc was placed face up on top. After staining for 15 minutes at room temperature in the dark, the Anodisc was transferred and washed in a new petri dish by filling the dish with 0.02 \u00b5m-filtered water, waiting three minutes, and carefully pouring out the solu tion. These wash steps were repeated a second time with 50% ethanol. The Anodiscs were then transferred to dry on a glass slide. A 30 \u00b5l aliquot of antifade (0.01% PPD, p- 144 phenylendiamine in 50% 1x PBS, 50% glycerol) was placed on the Anodisc and covered with a glass coverslip. Slides were stored at 4\u00b0C until imaging. Imagine VLPs. on an Olympus BX51 microscope (100x oil objective as described above), and 20-25 images per Anodisc were collected using Ocular software (QImaging) and a 700/75 nm emission to monitor BONCAT-labeling). Images were analyzed in Image J, and VLPs were manually counted as overlapping signal in the FITC filter and Cy5 filter (Figure 6.5, Table 6.2). The averaged counts and standard deviation of newly produced VLPs from five images at each timepoint were plotted, revealing that that the number of newly -produced VLPs increases until around two weeks (Figure 6.6). By three weeks, the number decreases, likely due to the diminished availability of HPG for incorporation into new viral proteins. The standard deviation between the five images/timepoint ranged from 0.4 to 1.3 counts for samples without HPG and 4.4 to 23.4 counts for samples with HPG (Table 6.2). Table 6.2.

However, multiple challenges were encountered during attempts to repeat these experiments with additional replicates and timepoints . One problem was contamination visualized on the Anodiscs that auto- fluoresced, particularly with the Cy5 filter . Efforts to plasma clean the Anodiscs, replace all reagents, 0.02 \u00b5m -filter solutions, an d continue the extensive washing steps described for the preliminary experiments did not fully resolve this problem. Another problem was low signal to background noise when trying to identify VLPs. Even for the successful quantification described above, at tempts to automate identification of VLPs failed due to low signa l and necessitated manual counting. Low signal was a problem for both the FITC and Cy5 signals, but more so for Cy5. Use of an alternative dyes, Cal Fluor 488, instead of Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated to picolyl-azide, did not resolve this problem . The delay in processing additional replicates, storage of unfixed samples at -20\u00b0C, and background autofluorescence may all have contributed to this low signal. The dilution- method, which only uses nucleic acid staining, also showed low signal with the FITC filter; the length of DNase treatment may have been an additional parameter contributing to the signal problem for the dilution -based method . In an attempt to address the problem of auto- fluorescent contamination on Anodiscs, in- solution BONCAT was tried . This approach BONCAT - labels and nucleic acid -stains samples in-solution by using a 100 kDa Amicon filter device and visualizing the sample directly on glass slides in the presence of an analytical standard (Sigma micro particles based on silicon dioxide ). While P1 bacterio phage controls could be detected with the FITC filter, the signal was too low to detect VLPs in the sediment sample; the signal in the FITC filter using in -solution BONCAT was even lower than when using Anodiscs. Overall, the multiple wash steps, extensive time for manu al counting, and 148 challenges with contamination and low signal limit the ability use BONCAT in a high - throughput format for VLP quantification. Despite the challenges, the promising initial results suggest BONCAT could be a useful tool for quantifying virus production in marine sediment samples. For a thorough comparison of the dilution -based method versus BONCAT , a repeated experiment with fresh sediment incubations may benefit from the following changes to the experimental setup: 1) only include samples in duplicate for one method of virus recovering (instead of two) at only six timepoints (0 and 72 hours, and 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks) to maintain a feasible processing timeline, 2) store samples at 4\u00b0C and perform VLP quantification analysis within 24 -48 hours after harvesting, and 3) minimize the number of wash steps for loading samples on Anodiscs and dilute the VLP aliquot into a volume smaller than 5 mL, since loading samples onto Anodiscs is currently the most time consuming step in this experiment apart fro m manually counting VLPs. Additional ly, aspects of analysis not yet explored for the Monterey Submarine Canyon sediment samples included evaluating the fixed cellular background samples, measuring the sediment wet weight to determine the total VLP count pe r mg of sediment, and performing additional optimization of the proce dure to recover VLPs from sediment. While centrifugation was the method used to recover VLPs in these experiments, the addition of tetrasodium pyrophosphate before centrifugation could al so be evaluated. Further efforts to evaluate the utility of BONCAT compared to dilution -based approaches may inform optimal methodology for quantification of viral production and facilitate evaluation of the impact of viruses on microbial communities in ma rine sediment. Coupling these approaches with additional studies may provide insight into how virus production correlates with virus morphology, sediment depth, and virus- host dynamics . 149 BIBLIOGRAPHY 1.
