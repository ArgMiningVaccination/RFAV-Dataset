Science and quantum physicists show that energy is in the building block of all matter, so this means your physical body, your house, the trees and the device in which you are reading this are all entangled through invisible forms of energy that interconnect you and everything to the universe itself. Long before scientific influential characters such as Sir Isaac Newton who stated \"Energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be changed from one form to another\" and Albert Einstein who produced the formula E=mc\u00b2 that expresses the fact that mass and energy are the same entity and can be changed into each other; there were advanced Ancient Cultures around the world who understood and worked with the cosmic universal laws with energy healing being the oldest form of medicine. One of these laws in relation to energy medicine is the law of vibration. Your body is composed of energy-producing particles, each of which is in constant motion, constant vibration. These vibrations generate electromagnetic waves of which transfer energy as radiation from the source of the waves to an absorber. So, how does all of this relate to our health and wellbeing? The vibrations and the electromagnetic energy associated with them can cause changes in your cells, which can then affect how your body functions. Illness, disease, troubling emotions and disempowering thoughts and beliefs are usually associated with a low or unbalanced vibration or energy flow, meaning energy can appear to be uneven or blocked in the body. Energetic stagnation in the body is what leads to physical and spiritual ailments. When we come to this understanding that everything starts on an energetic level before it reaches tangible form, we can begin to embody the concept of so within, so without. Everything in our internal world has an effect on our outer physical reality, what you think, you create, what you feel, you attract and what you imagine you become. Through this lens we can realise the power we possess as energetic beings, and it is through energy medicine or vibrational energy healing that activates the body's energies toward equilibrium and balance. Energy medicine also referred to as complementary medicine or alternative medicine is becoming increasingly popular and will continue to rapidly increase further. Why? Well because we are beginning to bridge the gap between ancient wisdom and conventional medicine. It is documented that ancient cultures around the world had what were known as medicine men/women (witch-doctors or shamans) who maintained the health of their tribe by gathering and distributing herbs, performing healing and spiritual ceremonies and working individually with the transmutation and manipulation of energy for overall wellbeing and restoration of health. These Ancient known medicines such as Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ayurveda and Shamanic traditions have revolved around a radically different model of the human body and healing based on the body as an entire energy field treating it as one whole, mind-body-spirit. Whereas conventional and western medicine has embraced the anatomical and biochemical model, material body of flesh and blood and focus on curing symptoms rather than eliminating the root cause. Now you can understand that the root cause of all found tangible disease within the body always begins in energetic form. The core principle in energy medicine is that prevention is better than cure, so through understanding that low vibrational frequency can cause disease within the body it is important to maintain our energy to receive a higher vibration. There are many energy medicine modalities that you can benefit from frequently to maintain energetic homeostasis. Some that you may have come across or heard of are Reiki, acupuncture, reflexology, ayurveda, breathwork and sound healing to name but a few, in fact, the National Center of Complementary and Integrative Health identifies more than 200 approaches of which can consist of a combination of 2 or more different traditional modalities. What is important to note is there is no right or wrong form of energy healing, it truly is a felt resonance as to which you feel more comfortable in exploring. The same principle applies to any form of energy medicine with the aim being to restore, rebalance and reharmonise energy flow within the body. There are many reasons as to why energy can become blocked in the body such as toxins, muscular or other constrictions, prolonged stress, un-dealt past trauma, suppressed emotion and expression or even interference from other energies (people, environments, situations etc). 5 Thing You Need To Know About Energy Medicine 1. It Can Help Ease Physical And Emotional Trauma All traumas we carry within the body whether emotionally, physically or psychologically impact the overall functionality of our energy systems creating blockages which for good health and wellbeing require a constant state of flow and balance. 2. It Can Help You Achieve Your Goals And Intentions Maintaining a higher vibrational state creates a more positive outlook on your way of thinking and being to motivate you in achieving your life goals. 3. It Can Improve The Body's Self-Healing Ability Energy healing modalities activate your body's subtle energy system and rebalance your energy centres. By doing this, you stimulate your physical body's own inherent ability to heal. 4. There Are No Side Effects Or Contraindications Clients experience a rebalancing process that may evoke some emotional or physical sensations that usually occurs when a deeply embedded trauma or attachment is finally released. Energy medicine also works in conjunction with all other medical or therapeutic techniques to relieve side effects and promote recovery. 5. It Is Available To Everyone Everyone who is interested and willing to receive energy medicine can do so, you do not need to be spiritual or hypersensitive to energies to benefit from it. Some energy medicine modalities such as reiki treatments transcend time and space and therefore you do not even need to be in the same room. Whilst you can explore your own energy medicine practice at home through widely available online videos that guide deep breathing, meditation or yoga to boost your vibrational energy you may also want to experience working with an Energy Healer for more in-depth transformational shifts.
