Summer is the most Yang time of the year, the peak of heat, activity, and intensity. Heavenly moxibustion utilizes the strength of the summer to store the Yang Qi into the body, thus treating and preventing winter diseases come winter. In the summer, the Qi is at the most superficial layer in the skin. (Heat tends to rise in nature, as well as in the body, and you sweat more easily). Thus, the body is able to absorb the constituents of the herbs readily. Basic process: Herbal paste is applied topically to specific points on the back, on 3 specific sunny days in the summer, at noon. Each application is left on for a few hours. Repeat for at least 3 summers. 2016 Dates: -Sunday July 17 -Wednesday July 27 -Saturday August 6 (extra day) -Tuesday August 16 ***These are ideal dates; at the least, treat 3 days ~10 days apart in the summer May be beneficial for: -Preventing respiratory illnesses, including bacterial/viral infections, esp. in people who run cold -Asthma (chronic) Benefits: -Convenient: quick application and infrequent treatment -Controllable: can control intensity by removing paste and washing off Side effects: Local sites will likely burn, blister, itch, and/or scar. Contraindications: pregnant women, or people with very sensitive skin. Caution with children. Some more logistics: -Sign up for 3 appointments. Each appointment will be about 15 minutes, so I can thoroughly explain the process, and answer any questions you may have. I will always be available via email for follow up or further questions. -Avoid scheduling the appointments too late, especially if you sleep early. A 6 hour retention time is average and optimal. -Avoid coming to the appointment with tight clothing, particularly sports bras, as it may be difficult to put back on, once the patches are in place. -To remove the patches, you will either need to be flexible enough to reach behind, or have someone who can help you. You should also gently wash your back after removing the patches. -Avoid bathing during the treatments, esp. if blisters form. Showers are okay. -$40 for the series. Sign up by calling Alpine "}
