Basic Policies and General Information A Note About Career Technical Education Courses Students planning to pursue a bachelor's degree at New Mexico State University after completing their studies at DACC need to be aware that not all career technical education courses taken at DACC can be used to satisfy degree requirements at NMSU. The number of DACC credits that may be counted toward a bachelor's degree depends on the major selected and any agreements providing for the acceptance of career technical education courses. Programs already having such agreements are called \"articulated\" programs, and are listed at Applying DACC Credit Toward Bachelor's Degree Programs (p. 56). It is best for students to consult advisors at both DACC and NMSU early in their associate degree program to insure that the maximum number of credits will apply toward the bachelor's degree program selected. Tuition Differentials DACC students enrolling in courses on any other NMSU campus pay the tuition rate in effect at that campus. Nondiscrimination It is the policy of Do\u00f1a Ana Community College not to discriminate on the basis of age, color, disability, gender, national origin, race, religion, sexual orientation, or veteran status in employment or other college- administered programs.

In 1971, the boards of education of the Gadsden, Hatch, and Las Cruces school districts requested that New Mexico State University establish a branch community college located on its campus in Las Cruces to offer postsecondary vocational- technical education in Do\u00f1a Ana County. The NMSU Board of Regentsapproved the request in 1972, and the voters in Do\u00f1a Ana County approved an operational mill levy in May 1973. The institution became an ofcial entity on July 1, 1973. It began offering vocational training programs on September 4, 1973, as the Do\u00f1a Ana County Occupational Education Branch of New Mexico State University.

Applications should be submitted 30 days before the beginning of the semester or summer session for which the student plans to enroll. A student who has attended other institutions during an absence from DACC / NMSU must have ofcial transcripts forwarded directly to the DACC Admissions Ofce by the registrar of each institution and must be eligible to return to the college or university last attended. Transcripts must be received prior to the date of registration. Admission status at the time of readmission will normally be determined by previous DACC academic standing. However, academic performance at other institutionsattended during the applicant's absence from DACC may be taken into consideration in determining the student's academic admission status. How Transfer Students Are Admitted Transfer students from other colleges or universities may be accepted if their cumulative GPA is at least 2.0, they are eligible to return to the college or university they last attended. Students who transfer less than 30 credit hours must meet the rst time freshman admission requirement. Transfer students follow the same procedures as those outlined under \"How to Apply.\" Ofcial transcripts from all colleges and/or universities previously attended must be sent directly to the DACC Admissions Ofce by the registrar of each college or educational institution. An academic credit evaluation will be mailed to the student from DACC Academic Advising. Coursework from non-accredited institutions may be evaluated only after the student has completed 12 credits at DACC with a minimum GPA of 2.0. The student should initiate the request for evaluation of this coursework with the academic department chair or program director. If approved by the division dean and vice president for academic affairs, coursework will be applied toward certicate or associate degree completion. A student who conceals the fact that (s)he has attended another college or university and who has not had transcripts submitted by each institution previously attended\u2014whether or not credit was earned\u2014will be subject to immediate suspension.

Contact the DACC Admissions Ofce at (575) 528-7244 for more information. How Non-Degree Students Are Admitted IMPORTANT: Students enrolling under non-degree status are ineligible for nancial aid, student employment, veteran's benets, and participation in intercollegiate athletics and student government. Furthermore, courses taken while one is enrolled under non-degree status may not be used to meet NMSU requirements for regular admission. Non-degree admission is designed to meet the needs of mature, part-time students who do not wish to pursue a degree. Those who prefer not to receive a grade may choose to audit. (See \" Audit Option (p. 26)\" in Academic Regulations section.) Transcripts from previous institutions (including high school) and/or results of college entrance exams may be required to assure readiness for university-level courses. Non-degree students are subject to the same regulations as regular students. They may not transfer more than 30 credits that were taken while in this status to any degree program. Admission requirements include a non-degree application and a nonrefundable $20 application fee. Changing from Non-Degree to Degree-Seeking Status. A non-degree student in good academic standing with a GPA of 2.0 or better may apply for a change of status from non-degree status to regular (degree-seeking) status. Requirements for regular admission must be met, including submitting ofcial high school transcripts as well as ofcial college transcripts from all previously attended institutions of higher education. The status will be effective on or before the census date of the semester in which all ofcial transcripts are received. If all ofcial transcripts are received after the census date of the current semester, the change of status will take effect in the next immediate term. Application Materials All documents submitted as part of the admissions process become property of DACC/NMSU and will not be returned to the student. Application materials are retained for one calendar year for students who apply but do not attend. Early Admission for High School and Adult Education Students It is possible for a current junior or senior high school student to be admitted to DACC, provided the following criteria have been met: 1.The student has obtained written permission from the high school principal/counselor and the parents. 2.The student's cumulative grade-point average is at least 3.0. 3.The student has attained the established minimum scores on the ACT/SAT assessment or English and Math portion of NEX GEN assessment that is required to enroll in ENGL1110G Composition I and MATH 1215 Intermediate Algebra. For more information about the NEX GEN assessment contact the DACC Testing Center at 575-527-7569 or by email, testing@dacc.nmsu.edu To apply, high school students must provide the following documents to the admissions ofce:written permission from the high school counselor or principal/ counselor, written permission from parents, an ofcial high school transcript sent directly to DACC, and a complete DACC/NMSU admissions application. Students currently enrolled in an Adult Education (AE) Program at DACC may also apply for early admission. Current AE students applying for early admission must provide TABE scores of 580 or above on every section (reading, writing, math), written permission from the AE executive director, pass two out of three sections of the Accuplacer assessment, and submit a complete DACC/NMSU application for admission. Under the Early Admissions Program, all students are admitted in a non-degree status. For more information regarding non-degree status, please refer to the subsection titled, \"Non-degree Admission (p. 13).\" Non-degree students are ineligible to receive federal nancial aid funds. Students admitted under this program are also limited to seven (7) credit hours per semester and incur all costs associated with enrollment, including books. Developmental courses are not available for enrollment under the Early Admissions Program. Early admissions students who wish to enroll at DACC or NMSU upon graduation from high school or obtaining a GED must reapply under their new status as a rst-time freshman. Dual Credit Program The Dual Credit Program (DCP) is designed to give high school students the opportunity to enroll at Do\u00f1a Ana Community College prior to high school graduation. Students must be enrolled at least half time as a junior or senior in a New Mexico public high school. Under a Dual Credit Master Agreement between DACC and the local school district, students who enroll in approved dual credit courses are eligible to have the full cost of tuition and general fees waived. Textbooks are typically paid for by the school district, however, students do pay for their own supplies, protective apparel, and tool sets as required by the course(s) selected. Students may be responsible for any course-specic fees, such as lab or online fees. Home-schooled students are also eligible for the DCP but are responsible for purchasing their own materials including textbooks, digital course materials, tools, or any other course specic fees. In the DCP students take college-level courses that simultaneously satisfy high school electives for graduation and college credits toward a future certicate, associate degree or bachelor's degree. Completion of a degree or certicate prior to graduating from high school is not typical for dual credit high school students unless they are enrolled in a special program. Most dual credit students will complete one or two courses per semester while they are enrolled in the DCP. Students will normally need to attend additional semesters at DACC following high school graduation as a traditional, tuition paying student to complete a degree or certicate. Students should inquire about and apply for DCP opportunities with their high school counselor. They must complete an Application for Admission, the State Dual Credit Request Form, and provide a high school transcript. Requirements to be admitted to the DCP are a minimum high school grade-point average (GPA) of 2.0 and possibly a placement assessment. Students must also meet the criteria agreed upon by their school district and DACC. After a student is admitted to the DCP, an academic advisor14 Aggie Pathway will assist the student in the registration process. For further information, contact the appropriate high school counselor. High school students enrolled in a high school that does not have a Dual Credit Master Agreement with DACC may be eligible for enrollment as Early Admission students; however, as such, they would be responsible for all costs related to enrollment. For further information, contact the DACC Admissions Ofce at (575) 528-7244. NOTE: Not all DACC courses taken through the DCP are transferable for college credit to other colleges and universities. Early College High School Program The Early College High School Initiative is designed to allow students to simultaneously earn a high school diploma while earning up to two years (60 hours) of college credit. Many early college students will complete a college certicate or associate degree by the time they graduate from high school. The facilities, usually located on a college or university campus, gives students access to higher education courses earlier while students are still in high school and helps students become more comfortable in a higher education environment. The key to the success of this initiative is a strong partnership between the school districts and higher education institutions. In the State of New Mexico, Do\u00f1a Ana Community College has created a partnership with the Las Cruces Public School District and the Gadsden Independent School District to offer enrollment in early college high schools. DACC is currently serving more than 500 students through this program. For further information on the admission requirements for early college high school, contact one of the high schools directly. Information about the Arrowhead Park Early College High School and the Arrowhead Park Medical Academy (both part of LCPS) may be obtained by calling (575) 527-9540; for Alta Vista Early College High School (GISD), call (575) 882-6400. Special Admissions Requirements Certain programs at DACC have special admissions requirements: Culinary Arts (p. 203) Dental Assistant (p. 207) Dental Hygiene (p. 210) Diagnostic Medical Sonography (p. 216) Dual Credit (concurrent enrollment) (p. 13) Emergency Medical Services-Paramedic (p. 272) Nursing (associate degree program) (p. 312) Radiologic Technology (p. 334) Respiratory Therapy (p. 341) In addition to fullling the general requirements for admission to the community college, individuals seeking admission to these programs must also fulll certain special admissions requirements. Since these programs generally have limited enrollment, completion of the admissions requirements for a specic program does not guarantee acceptance into the program. Acceptance may be competitive, based on individual academic performance in previous coursework and other criteria. Information regarding the application procedure for a specic program may be obtained from the department offering that program. Students must reapply to special admissions programs each time they wish to be considered for acceptance. For example, a student who has fullled the special admissions requirements, yet was not admittedbecause of space limitations, will not automatically be considered for a subsequent semester; (s)he must reapply. Similarly, one who may have been accepted during a particular semester, but failed to accept an offer to enroll, must also reapply in order to be considered again. Standards for Program Participation Some programs may require technical standards for admissions and/ or continued program participation. Technical standards may include possessing or acquiring skills or behaviors to complete performance- based tasks. Completion of these tasks may be required for program completion. See individual program descriptions for further information. Security Background Checks. Certain programs of study require that students complete and pass a security background check. Past criminal violations may prevent a student from completing his/her degree and from being hired after graduating. Programs requiring a security background check disclose this fact in their program description sections found in this catalog. Aggie Pathway In the Aggie Pathway program, NMSU's system works together to assist students who do not meet the admission requirements to the university. Aggie Pathway students begin at one of NMSU's community college campuses and may transition to the university campus upon meeting the following requirements: Successful completion of 24 credits, in addition to any required developmental courses 2.0 cumulative college GPA All students participating in the Aggie Pathway program can attend academic, cultural and athletic events on the NMSU Las Cruces campus. Students enrolling through NMSU Do\u00f1a Ana Community College campus also have access to on-campus housing, dining, and activities. More information about Aggie Pathway is available at https:// aggiepathway.nmsu.edu/ or call (575) 646-8011 Academic Advising and Registration Academic advising at DACC is an ongoing, shared partnership between a student and an advisor that focuses on assisting the student to identify, plan and achieve academic goals aligned with their career and life aspirations. It is a part of the educational process that aims to assist students to become active and effective agents of their own learning. In the academic advising process, students and advisors work together to: Develop an awareness of values, interests, abilities, skills and potential Identify academic and career goals and options Choose an academic program Strategically plan out steps toward graduation, or the completion of an academic goal Identify effective academic study skills and habits Learn how to solve problems that impede progress toward an academic goal Identify appropriate campus resources Learn how to use the my.NMSU.edu account and STAR Degree AuditNew Mexico State University - Do\u00f1a Ana 15 Select courses Register for classes Targeted student-learning outcomes underlying the DACC academic advising process include critical thought, self-appraisal, decision making, healthy independence, responsibility, and respect for self and others. These outcomes are the ideal product of quality academic advising. Structure of DACC Academic Advising Students declared into a specic major or academic program are advised by a specic professional academic advisor and/or a DACC faculty advisor in that academic program. Students may identify their DACC academic advisor by going to https://dacc.nmsu.edu/advising/who-is- my-advisor/ or contacting the Academic Advising Center, DASR 103, (575) 528-7272. Students who are exploring majors or who are in transition between programs, are advised through the Academic Advising Center, which serves as a central resource for the following categories of students: Degree-seeking students pursuing the Associate Degree in General Studies Exploratory (undecided) students Non-degree-seeking students When to Seek Academic Advising NEW STUDENTS will meet with an academic advisor and register for classes after attending a new student orientation. TRANSFER AND READMITTED STUDENTS should make an appointment to see an academic advisor once their DACC admission is complete. CONTINUING STUDENTS should plan ahead and meet with their academic advisor every semester, well in advance of continuing-student registration. Special Requirements for DACC Pre-Health Majors All students declared into the following Technology Pre-Respiratory Therapy are required to identify and declare a second major (associate degree or certicate) in any DACC non-selective program. See the Academic Advising Center for details. Additionally, all DACC pre-health majors with a college cumulative GPA of less than 3.0 will be required to be academically advised prior to course registration each semester. Registering for Classes After a student is advised, they have the option to register for classes either online or in person. REGISTERING ONLINE. After being admitted and meeting with an academic advisor, eligible students may register for classes on the Web at my.NMSU.edu (https://my.nmsu.edu).Students need to log in with their NMSU email and passphrase to access web registration. In the event that a student forgets their passphrase, the system will allow the student to reset it online, provided they answer a pair of security questions correctly. If attempts to do so fail, the student must consult with the ICT Student Help Desk in NMSU Hardman Jacobs Undergraduate Learning Center, room 105, (575) 646-4433. The web registration system will not accept requests for the S/U grading option unless the course is offered exclusively on an S/U basis. Likewise, the system will not accept requests for the \"audit\" grading option. To request S/U or audit grading for courses, students will need to consult with their academic advisor. Upon completing online registration, students may view their complete semester schedule by accessing the Concise Student Schedule link within their my.NMSU.edu (https://my.nmsu.edu) account. Students may also ask for a print out of their schedule at the DACC Information Center on the East Mesa Campus (DASR 101H), at any other DACC location, or at the NMSU Student Records Ofce. REGISTERING IN PERSON. Students must obtain a Change of Schedule Form online at records.nmsu.edu (https://records.nmsu.edu/), then complete and submit the form to the DACC Information Center in DASR 101H on the East Mesa Campus, or to the NMSU Student Records Ofce, or to a registration ofce at any other DACC location. In some cases, the student must obtain the instructor's signature on the Change of Schedule Form before submitting it to the Information Center. Once registered, students should obtain a copy of their class schedule, which is available at the DACC Information Center or at any other location where one may register. REGISTERING FOR COURSES ON OTHER NMSU CAMPUSES. Students may register for courses at another campus in the NMSU system if the course is not offered at their home campus, or if the course is full at DACC. Terms and Conditions of Course Registration Students must complete registration for all courses prior to the rst day of class to avoid incurring late fees. Students who subsequently decide not to attend, and have not ofcially withdrawn from DACC / NMSU, will earn failing grades while remaining nancially liable. When students have a previous balance, their courses for the current term may be canceled if they have not made the appropriate arrangements to pay the debt owed. See https://uar.nmsu.edu/payment- options/ for payment options and payment plan information. Drop of Courses Due to Prerequisite Course Grade Each semester when grades are reported, DACC proactively drops students out of future semester courses in which the student did not earn the minimum prerequisite grade in the prior semester. The student is notied of this drop through their NMSU email. Academic Sanctions Students placed on academic warning, probation, or suspension during the end-of-term grading process will be emailed a notication to their NMSU email. Students placed on suspension will have any courses in which they may be registered for future semesters canceled, and applicable refunds will be made by the Business Ofce. For additional information on Academic Standing and Probation please refer to The NMSU System Academic Regulations - Academic Standing/Probation (p. 46).16 Academic Advising and Registration Adding, Dropping and Withdrawing from Courses Registration changes may be processed only in accordance with university regulations and with appropriate signatures. If a student decides to stop attending a course, it is the responsibility of the student to initiate ofcial drop or withdrawal from the course and to obtain all necessary signatures on the Change of Schedule Form. Failure to do so could result in failing grades. Forms are available from academic advisors, at the DACC Information Centers, or on the NMSU Student Records Ofce website at https:// records.nmsu.edu/forms/ (https://records.nmsu.edu/forms/forms/). Students may add, drop or withdraw according to the dates published online at records.nmsu.edu (https://records.nmsu.edu/), with the exception of petitions for retroactive withdrawals processed in accordance with Policy 6.92. If a student withdraws from a course after the last day to drop/cancel a course with a 100% refund, no refund in any amount will be issued. ADDING A COURSE. Students wishing to add a course to their current registration schedule should do so in consultation with their academic advisor. The deadline for adding courses during a given term is listed online at records.nmsu.edu (https://records.nmsu.edu/). If the desired course is still open, the student may add it online through their my.NMSU.edu (https://my.nmsu.edu) account. If the course is closed, the student will need the instructor's permission and signatures on a Change of Schedule Form. Once the Change of Schedule Form has been completed and all necessary signatures have been obtained, the student may take the completed form to the Information Center for processing. The Information Center will provide the student with a revised class schedule, which the student should review immediately to ensure there are no inaccuracies. Any errors should be reported immediately. DROPPING A COURSE. The process for dropping (also called cancelling) a course is similar to the process for adding a course. The deadline for dropping courses is published online at records.nmsu.edu (https:// records.nmsu.edu/). The student should consult with their academic advisor and drop the course by the deadline either online through their my.NMSU.edu (https://my.nmsu.edu) account, or with a Change of Schedule Form. Dropping/cancelling a course removes the course from the student transcript and issues a 100% refund for the course. WITHDRAWING FROM A COURSE. After the drop/cancellation period comes the withdrawal period. To withdraw from a single course, the student must consult with their academic advisor or complete a Change of Schedule Form and process it at the DACC Information Center or the NMSU Student Records Ofce. The deadline for withdrawing from a single course is published online at records.nmsu.edu (https:// records.nmsu.edu/). Withdrawing from a course produces a W grade on the transcript, and no refund is issued for the course. A student may not withdraw from courses after this deadline, unless the student requests a Full Withdrawal from DACC / NMSU. NOTES: 1.A student found to be insufciently prepared for a particular course may be transferred to a more elementary course in the same subject area, provided that a.the instructor of the more elementary course has given his/her consent, and b.the transfer is completed before the last day to ofcially withdraw from an individual course. Commonly referred to as a \"drop-back,\" this type of transfer is usually, but not always, employed in casesof sequenced courses such as mathematics, English, or foreign languages. 2.Financial aid or other third-party funding sources should be consulted when enrollment changes occur. Anyone attending under the Veterans Educational Assistance Program should notify the Veterans Ofce in DASR 111 on the East Mesa Campus or by email at VetProg@dacc.nmsu.edu when dropping or adding courses, as such changes could cause a reduction in the benets received. Full Withdrawal from DACC/NMSU A Full Withdrawal from DACC or any other NMSU campuses terminates enrollment in all courses and effects a full withdrawal from the entire NMSU system. It is an ofcial procedure requiring signed approvals as indicated on the withdrawal form. As such withdrawals will be noted on the student's transcript. To process a full withdrawal from DACC/ NMSU or for further information refer to the NMSU System Academic Regulations - Withdrawals (p. 44) section of this catalog.

Tuition and Fees For the most up-to-date information please visit New Mexico State University's Accounts Receivable (http://uar.nmsu.edu/tuition-fees/). Prices, rates, and fees are subject to change at any time and without notice. Application Fee A one-time $20 application fee and a completed application must be submitted to DACC. The fee, which is not refundable, is required of students who have not previously enrolled at New Mexico State University or one of its community colleges. Tuition and Mandatory Fees For academic year 2022-2023, tuition rates, including mandatory fees, at DACC are as follows: $76.75 per credit, or $921 per semester, for in-district students (residents of Do\u00f1a Ana County); $85 per credit, or $1,119 per semester, for out-of-district students (residents of other counties within New Mexico); and $236.75 per credit, or $2,940 per semester, for nonresident (out-of- state and international) students. However, when nonresidents enroll in a summer session, or when they enroll in six credits or fewer during a regular term, they pay the in-state (but out-of-district) rate. Per-semester costs for tuition and mandatory fees are calculated by multiplying the number of credits by the applicable per-credit rate. Students taking between 12 and 18 credits are charged for only 12, provided that all credits are taken exclusively at DACC. Then, beginning with the 19th credit, the per-credit charge is again imposed. At NMSU, tuition with mandatory fees for academic year 2022-2023 are $278.60 per credit for residents and $907.10 per credit for nonresidents (out-of-state and international students).

Financial Aid The Ofce of Financial Aid administers a broad spectrum of grant, loan, scholarship, and work-study funding in an attempt to meet the nancial needs of DACC's students. DACC's Financial Aid and Scholarship Services awards nancial aid to students according to their individual needs. Parents of students are expected to contribute to their child's education according to their ability, taking into account their income, assets, number of dependents, and other relevant information. Students themselves are expected to contribute from their own assets and earnings, including appropriate borrowing against future income. All information provided to Financial Aid is regarded as condential. Students applying for nancial aid must complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), designed to determine in accordance with state and federal guidelines, the difference between what the student and/or family is expected to contribute and the cost of attending DACC. Among the factors that determine the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) are: 1.annual adjusted gross income as reported to the Internal Revenue Service; 2.savings, stocks, and/or bonds; 3.other assets in the form of a business, farm, or real estate;4.nontaxable income and benets; and 5.student's prior year income and assets. Students applying for nancial aid should complete a FAFSA by visiting studentaid.gov (https://studentaid.gov/) and then clicking on \"Apply for Aid\" and then \"Complete the FAFSA form \". Priority deadline for FAFSA completion is March 1 of every year, but applications will still be accepted thereafter. General Eligibility Requirements To receive nancial aid you must demonstrate the following: Have a high school diploma or a General Education Development (GED) Certicate, pass a test approved by the U.S. Department of Education, meet other standards your state establishes that are approved by the U.S. Department of Education, or complete a high school education in a home school setting that is treated as a home school or private school under state law. See your nancial aid advisor for more information. Be enrolled or accepted for enrollment as a regular student working toward a degree or certicate in an eligible program. (You may not receive aid for correspondence or telecommunications courses unless they are part of an associate's or bachelor's degree program.) Be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-citizen (state funded scholarships may be available to undocumented students). Have a valid Social Security number. If you don't have a Social Security number, you can nd out more about applying for one at www.ssa.gov (https://www.ssa.gov). Be meeting satisfactory academic progress (SAP).

Register with the Selective Service, if required. No applicants will be denied nancial assistance on the basis of age, color, disability, gender, national origin, race, religion, or sexual orientation. Sources of Financial Aid GRANTS. The foundation for nancial aid is the Federal Pell Grant, available to undergraduate students with documented nancial need. Pell Grants range from $639 to $6,135 (subject to change each year). In some instances, students may be eligible to receive other types of aid, including the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) or Leveraging Education Assistance Partnership Program Grant (LEAP), and/or other miscellaneous grants. These grants are awarded on a rst-come-rst-served basis to undergraduate students who show exceptional nancial need. Typically, all three types of grants do not have to be repaid; funding is limited, however, and it is therefore very important that students complete their nancial aid les by the priority deadline. For more information, contact DACC's Financial Aid and Scholarship Services Ofce, or visit dacc.nmsu.edu/fa (http://dacc.nmsu.edu/fa/ ) on the Web. SUBSIDIZED AND UNSUBSIDIZED FEDERAL DIRECT LOANS. These loans are need and non-need-based, long-term loans available to undergraduate students. Students receiving a subsidized or unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan, must complete an initial In-Person Entrance Counseling session and then a yearly online session every year after that. All students wishing to receive a Federal Stafford Loan must also complete a Master Promissory Note (MPN). Both the MPN and the online entrance20 Financial Aid counseling can be found at studentaid.gov. (https://studentaid.gov/) In addition, students must complete an exit interview upon graduation or withdrawal from the University. Repayment of a Stafford Direct Loan begins six months after graduation or six months after enrollment drops below 6 credits for undergraduate students. The interest rate is variable but will not exceed 8.25%. More information will be available at the time the loan is made. WORK-STUDY PROGRAMS. The Federal Work-Study Program provides employment opportunities for selected undergraduate students with demonstrated nancial need. The New Mexico Work-Study Program also provides employment opportunities for students; however, only New Mexico residents are eligible to participate in the program. Both federal and state work-study are limited in funding and can be awarded to those who are meeting Satisfactory Academic Progress requirements, have requested work-study from the Financial Aid Ofce, and completed their nancial aid les.

Financial Aid Awards All nancial aid awards are based on information provided by the student and parents, availability of funds, and eligibility requirements. Any award may be revised based on changes in enrollment, cost of attendance, family contribution, or failure to meet satisfactory academic progress. Withdrawals or reductions in enrollment may affect an award or any future awards. Financial aid will not pay for audited courses or some repeats. Some certicate programs do not meet federal aid eligibility criteria, therefore students enrolled in certain certicate programs may not be eligible to receive nancial aid. SCHOLARSHIPS. All scholarships are contingent upon availability of funds. Individual scholarship criteria are subject to change. Students are encouraged to apply online at http://scholarships.nmsu.edu/ (https:// scholarships.nmsu.edu ). The online application for the upcoming year becomes available in October and remains open year round. Preference is given to those who apply prior to March 1.

Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Federal regulations require that nancial aid recipients meet certain academic standards to be eligible for Federal nancial aid. To ensure that nancial aid recipients are making satisfactory academic progress, academic transcripts are reviewed at the end of each term to determine eligibility for the next term. All terms of attendance are reviewed, including periods in which the student did not receive nancial aid. All transfer credit hours are taken into account when satisfactory progress is reviewed. Qualitative Progress. Undergraduate students must maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 (a C average). Grade point values are: A = 4.0, B = 3.0, C = 2.0, D = 1.0, F = 0. Grades of I, CR, RR, PR, NC, W, AU are not calculated in the GPA. Adjusted Credit Options are not taken into consideration for nancial aid purposes. Completion Rate. Students must complete a minimum of 70 percent of all coursework (registered credit hours) attempted at DACC/NMSU. Any course with a grade of withdraw ( W), incomplete ( I), repeats (RR), failure (F), audit ( AU), or no credit (NC) is not considered completed coursework. Repeated courses are included in the calculation. Maximum Time Frame. Undergraduate students must complete their program within 150 percent of the credit hours required by the program. (Most Associate degree programs at DACC require 60 hours, therefore maximum allowable attempted hours would be 90 credits.) Students who have reached the maximum allowable time will be suspended from receiving nancial aid. Up to 30 developmental/ remedial hours are excluded from this calculation. Total attempted hours including repeated courses and transfer coursework are included in the student's maximum time frame calculation.New Mexico State University - Do\u00f1a Ana 21 Student Liability.

Financial aid eligibility is reinstated when all standards of satisfactory progress are met. The Appeals Process Students suspended from nancial aid may appeal the suspension if there are extenuating circumstances affecting their progress.

Please see the Tuition, Fees and Other Expenses section for more information. Time Limit Students must complete the master's degree program within seven years (or eight successive summers) of the start of the degree, including completion of the master's thesis or nal project. Inclusion of any coursework more than seven years old at the time of the nal examination will be at the discretion of the department. Master's Accelerated Program (MAP) The master's accelerated program provides an opportunity for academically qualied undergraduate students to begin working on a master's degree during their junior and senior years while completing a bachelor's degree. Typically, a bachelor's degree requires four years to complete and a master's degree requires an additional two years. The master's accelerated programs allow students the opportunity to complete a graduate program in an accelerated manner. Undergraduate students may apply for acceptance to a Master's Accelerated Program available at New Mexico State University after completing 60 semester hours of undergraduate coursework of which a minimum of 25 semester credit hours must be completed at New Mexico State University and apply towards the undergraduate major. The grade point average must be a minimum of 3.0; departments participating in the master's accelerated program may have requirements that exceed these minimum requirements. It is the student's responsibility to meet with their nancial aid advisor. Awards may be adjusted to reflect enrollment in an undergraduate/graduate program. Graduate departments within the colleges may allow academically qualied undergraduate students to substitute a maximum of 12 graduate course credits for elective courses in an undergraduate degree program. Graduate programs have the discretion to use up to 12 credits of NMSU coursework (450/4500 level or higher) that can logically beNew Mexico State University - Do\u00f1a Ana 31 applied towards the completion of master's program of study. A grade of B or higher in this coursework will be required . Program Participation Requirements: 1.Students must obtain prior approval by the graduate program 2.Student's course work must be general or discipline electives in the student's undergraduate course of study. No required courses from the undergraduate program will be accepted towards the Master's Accelerated Program. 3.Students will enroll in approved graduate level courses. If the course(s) requires instructor approval, it is the students responsibility to obtain the necessary approval 4.Students participating in MAP are required to submit a completed Master's Accelerated Program Referral Form to the Graduate School by the rst Friday of classes, with all required signatures. 5.Students participate in the Developing New Scholars Program (DNSP) through the Graduate School.

Upon awarding of the Bachelor's degree and formal admissions into a master's/graduate program at NMSU, the approved credits (up to 12) will be recorded on both the undergraduate and the graduate transcript. Interdisciplinary Master's Degree Interdisciplinary studies, at New Mexico State University, are intended for individuals specializing in programs that require the integration of more than one discipline to fully engage in the eld of study. The programs provide a mechanism to address emerging scholarship, innovation and research, as well as, allow graduate students to engage in emerging technologies that optimize their education outside the traditional disciplinary boundaries. An Interdisciplinary study takes advantage of traditional academic training within specic departments and also allows students to customize their own career preparation. In these programs, a coherent common core is expected and is intended to combine existing courses across disciplines to meet unique objectives. The interdisciplinary studies option should not be used in cases where the applicants' objectives can be realized by admission to a specic department with a degree program, and inclusion of up to two minor areas in the program of study. Admission Students interested in pursuing an Interdisciplinary Master's Degree (IMAS) degree must meet with the Graduate School for advisement. The advisement session will include information on completing the IMAS admission application: 1.Develop a proposal for interdisciplinary studies 2.Create the IMAS graduate committee 3.Once the student's graduate committee is designated, the committee can require additional materials such as a statement of interest, letters of recommendation, GRE or GMAT scores and a personal interview. 4.Complete the IMAS referral form and procure committee members IMAS program approval. 5.Procure academic department head IMAS referral form approval. 6.Submit IMAS referral form and proposal for interdisciplinary studies to Graduate School for admissions.Degree(s) Awarded Students receive a Master of Arts (MA) or a Master of Science (MS) and a concentration in the designated interdisciplinary study area. Other conditions for being awarded a degree within the interdisciplinary studies program are: 1.The student must present a written description of the program concept consisting of the following, as well as, the designated degree being sought and a name of the interdisciplinary area: a.The objective of the program of study should include, proposed areas of skill development and proposed courses in more than one graduate degree granting department at NMSU. b.A justication for not using an existing degree program. 2.The student's program of study must include a minimum of 30 graduate-level credits and a maximum of 36 graduate-level credits. Students may take six credits in departments that do not grant a graduate degree, but the courses must be numbered 450/4500 or above and be pertinent to the program of study. 3.The majority of the departments involved in the student's program will be master's degree granting departments. The student is expected to take at least 15 credits in the primary area of study within one department. The department selected by the student will receive a copy of the student's application for admissions to the Graduate School. In addition, the student is required to select a minor area of study in another department that consists of at least 9 graduate credit hours. 4.The student will form a committee composed of members of the graduate faculty and select an advisor who will chair the committee. The chair must be from the primary department where the student has taken at least 15 credit hours listed in the proposal submitted. The other committee member must be from the department in which the student has selected a minor area of study from the approved list. 5.The student will be required to submit the Candidacy Form after they have satisfactorily completed 12 credits. 6.The program will meet all requirements of a master's degree, with the interpretation, that \"major eld\" includes courses from two or more departments and in the designated interdisciplinary study area. 7.The program of study will include the completion of a research thesis or project. The work may be submitted in the form of a publishable manuscript, technical report, thesis or creative option. 8.The student may enroll on a part-time basis keeping in mind that coursework cannot be more than seven years old at the time of the nal examination. 9.The student will be administered a nal comprehensive exam that is consistent with the department selected for the primary area of study. For example, if a department requires a written exam, the student in the interdisciplinary masters will also be required to take a written exam. 10. The nal oral comprehensive exam will consist of questions pertinent to the area of study and the defense of the research thesis or project. In both cases, an integrated approach to the areas of study chosen should be followed. 11. All other rules for graduate study at NMSU must be followed. Thesis/Non-thesis Option As with any graduate student, the student in interdisciplinary studies can select to follow a thesis or non-thesis option. Students enrolled in the thesis option register for six thesis credits. Students not wishing to follow the thesis option will be required to complete a project report. The project32 The NMSU System Academic Regulations must reflect the interdisciplinary nature of the program which the student is pursuing. Comprehensive Exam Students in interdisciplinary studies take a comprehensive exam composed of questions designed by the student's committee. The committee consists of two individuals in the area of study, the dean's representative who must be outside of the department/program/ interdisciplinary study option, and a committee chair. Second Master's Degree A student who has earned one master's degree at NMSU may be allowed to count a maximum of six semester credits earned on the rst degree toward a second master's degree, if those credits t into a logical graduate program. The number of shared credits may be increased for joint degree programs. Teacher Licensure Students wishing to take graduate courses for licensure, renewal of licensure, or for personal enrichment must be fully admitted to a department in order to do so. Undeclared students may not register for teacher licensure classes.

Twenty- four of these credits must be completed at NMSU to meet the campus residency requirements. Students must maintain a 3.0 GPA, no more than 6 credits of C level work are allowed for this program. Program of Study After the completion of one year of enrollment, each beginning graduate student should prepare a complete program of study with the student's advisor. The program of study can be tentative, should be kept in the student's le within the department, and is not considered an \"Application for Admission to Candidacy.\" Major Field All course work taken for the degree should apply directly, through a logical program of study, to the specialty which candidate has selected. Each department is responsible for dening the required sequence of courses.Candidacy Following the successful completion of 12 credits the student is eligible for admission to candidacy. With the achievement of candidacy, a committee is appointed to work with the candidate on the remainder of the program. The committee consists of three members of the graduate faculty in the College of Education. Internship Each candidate will earn from three to six semester credits in an internship. This experience will consist of supervised performance of duties related to the candidate's specialty. The student's department will determine the structure of the internship and a research project will be conducted in conjunction with the internship. Oral Examination The oral examination committee will consist of the student's committee and a dean's representative appointed from the graduate faculty by the dean of the Graduate School. This committee will conduct an oral examination at the conclusion of the research project and no earlier than the candidate's last semester of enrollment. The examination will consist of a defense of the project along with general questions on subject matter related to the candidate's eld of study. Any candidate who fails the oral examination may upon recommendation of the advisor and with the approval of the graduate dean, be granted a second examination after a lapse of at least one semester. Failure in the second examination disqualies the candidate from obtaining the degree. Time Limit The specialist in education degree must be completed within seven years following admission to the program. Inclusion of any coursework more than seven years old at the time of the nal examination will be at the discretion of the department. Doctoral Degrees The doctoral degree requires signicant scholarly study beyond the master's program. Prospective candidates are expected to hold bachelor's or master's degrees from accredited institutions, based on curricula that include the prerequisites for graduate study in the department of their subject. To be considered for admission to a doctoral program, the applicant must have a grade-point average of at least 3.0. Prospective candidates are urged to consult the department in which they wish to study for information concerning specic requirements. Professional Doctoral Degrees Doctor of Economic Development (DED) Students enrolled in the Doctor of Economic Development are required to complete and pass a comprehensive examination. Since a dissertation is not required, students are expected to complete an internship experience and a project paper as dened by their program.

In order to resume their studies, the student must formally apply for readmission to the Graduate School and satisfy any requirements that are in effect at the time of reapplication. Declaration of Approved Minor Any doctoral applicant for candidacy may declare up to two approved minors in addition to the major area of study. Demonstration of competency in the minor area will be required at both comprehensive and nal examinations. Qualifying Examination Doctoral students must pass a qualifying examination that is scheduled by the student's advisor and is administered by the major department. Its purpose is to determine the areas in which the student shows strength or weakness, as well as the ability to assimilate subject matter presented at the graduate level. A student may not register for dissertation credits prior to the successful completion of the qualifying examination. The following conditions apply to students who wish to take the qualifying examination: 1.For students who enter the Graduate School with little or no previous graduate experience but wish to proceed directly to the doctorate, the qualifying examination should be taken after 12 credits of graduate work 2.For students who enter with a master's degree or equivalent from another university, or another department, the qualifying examination should be taken before the completion of one semester of graduate work. 3.For students who earn their master's degree at New Mexico State University and will continue in the same department, the department may allow the master's nal examination to serve as the doctoral qualifying examination or may require a separate examination. Based on the result of the qualifying examination, the department will take one or more of the following actions: 1.Admit the student to further work toward the doctorate 2.Recommend that the program be limited to the master's degree 3.Recommend a re-evaluation of the student's progress after the lapse of one semester 4.Recommend a discontinuation of graduate work In all cases, the Graduate School shall be notied by the department of the results of the qualifying examination. Students will be admitted to the doctoral program once the qualifying examination is passed. The student's advisor and department head will then appoint the doctoral committee to prepare the student's preliminarydoctorate program of study. The student must submit the program of study to the Graduate School immediately following admission into the doctoral program and before registering for additional coursework. Doctoral Graduate Committee The doctoral committee will be composed of at least four members of the graduate faculty who hold doctoral degrees. The following rules apply to the composition of the committee: The committee chair must be from a discipline within the student's major area. At least one additional member of the committee must also be from a discipline within the student's major area. If an approved minor is declared, at least one (but no more than two) members of the committee must be from the minor area. At least three committee members must be members of the graduate faculty and be from a doctorate-granting department Only one member may be outside of the student's department. One member of the committee must serve as the dean's representative. In programs where more than one department participates, the dean's representative may not be from any of those departments. The dean's representative may be one of the following the member from the related area a member from the minor area An independent member, not from the student's department, that is appointed by the Dean of the Graduate School. Departments may structure committees that include more than the minimum number of members, as long as the following conditions are satised. No changes can be made to the doctoral committee membership without prior approval from the Dean of the Graduate School. Additional voting and nonvoting members may be any person approved or appointed by the Dean of the Graduate School All members of the committee will attend the comprehensive oral and nal defense for the student's dissertation. Program of Study Students should le the Program of Study Form once they have: Completed 1 year of enrollment while at NMSU that are beyond the master's degree Successfully completed the qualifying examination The Program of Study Form should be completed and submitted to the Graduate School before registering for any additional courses. The individualized program of study is designed to meet the campus residency requirement and includes a minimum of 30 graduate credits beyond the master's. If the Doctoral degree requires a dissertation, at least 18 credits of dissertation work must be included. The professional doctoral degree includes a practicum or special project that culminates in a written report which demonstrates a command of the relevant scholarly literature and links it to the specic clinical or practical experience. Comprehensive Examination The Graduate School should receive the Program of Study and the Committee for Doctoral Students Form and the Doctoral Qualifying Examination Form.New Mexico State University - Do\u00f1a Ana 35 Students will be admitted to the comprehensive examination only after the following conditions are met 1.Completion of adequate course work, to the satisfaction of the major department and the Graduate School 2.The graduate committee determines the student is adequately prepared for the examination 3.Successful completion of all language requirements (where applicable) Students must be registered for 3 credits of graduate course work during the semester in which they take the comprehensive examination. A student taking an oral examination during the summer must enroll for at least one credit for that term. The Doctorate of Philosophy Examination or Professional Doctorate Examination Form must be on le at the Graduate School at least ten working days prior to the proposed date for the examination. The examination must be part written and part oral. The results of the oral examination will be reported to the Graduate School by the Dean's Representative of the committee. Any student who fails the comprehensive examination may either be terminated from the doctoral program or upon recommendation of the committee and approval of the Dean of the Graduate School, be granted a second examination after a lapse of at least one semester. NOTE: In general, there should be a time lapse of at least one year between the comprehensive and nal oral examination. However, due to the type of research required and the method of administering the written comprehensive in some departments, such a time lapse is not always practical. In all cases there must be one semester between the comprehensive and the nal oral examinations. Time Limit for the Comprehensive Examination If more than ve years have passed since the date of the comprehensive examination, the candidate will be required to take another comprehensive examination before admission to the nal examination. Advancement to Candidacy Advancement to Candidacy recognizes that the student has demonstrated the ability to sustain a level of scholarly competency commensurate with the successful completion of degree requirements. Upon advancement to candidacy, the student is cleared for the nal stages of the graduate program which may include a dissertation, project or written examination. For advancement to candidacy the following criteria must be met 1.Successful completion of the comprehensive examination 2.Recommendation of the graduate committee 3.Approval of the Dean of the Graduate School Upon receiving advancement to candidacy, students must establish residency and follow the Dissertation Registration Requirements (see Residency Requirements below). Residency Requirements The minimum campus residency requirements for the doctoral degree include enrollment in a minimum of 9 credit hours of program course work, including a minimum of 3 credit hours of dissertation, in at least two semesters of classes taught at NMSU. In some cases the minimum credit hour enrollment for the two semesters required to establishresidency may vary based on the instructional delivery of the program, and must have prior approval from the Dean of the Graduate School. Dissertation Registration during Fall/Spring Sessions After becoming a candidate, students must continue to register for at least 3 credits of dissertation or graduate course work, each spring/ fall semester until the dissertation is approved by the Graduate School and the dissertation format review has been completed. The total number of dissertation hours must be 18 credits. The doctoral committee can impose additional requirements for courses numbered 700/7000. A student who fails to abide by these regulations will be considered withdrawn from the university and in order to resume studies, must formally apply for readmission and satisfy the requirements in effect at the time of reapplication. Dissertation Registration during Summer Sessions If the nal examination is to be held during the summer or the dissertation is to be completed during the summer, students must register for one credit during the summer session in which the nal examination will be held or the dissertation will be completed. Dissertation Leave of Absence Students may seek a leave of absence from their dissertation. A leave of absence requires that a student must get prior approval from the Dean of the Graduate School, which means the student must receive permission for the leave of absence before discontinuing their formal studies. Final Examination NOTE: If more than ve years have elapsed since the date of the student's passed comprehensive examination, the candidate will be required to take another comprehensive examination before admission to the nal examination. Every student working toward the doctoral degree will submit a dissertation embodying the results of original research. The dissertation is expected to demonstrate the student's ability in independent investigation and to be a contribution to human knowledge. The dissertation shall display a mastery of the literature of the subject eld, present an organized and coherent development of ideas with a clear exposition of results, and provide a critique of the limits and validity of the student's conclusions. When a complete draft of the dissertation has been prepared, the student's doctoral committee (appointed after the qualifying examination) will conduct the nal examination. The nal examination is concerned primarily with the research work of the student as embodied in the dissertation, but it may be much broader and extend over the candidate's entire eld of study. The intention of the nal examination is to verify that the candidate has a satisfactory grasp of the major subject as a whole and has a general acquaintance with the elds of knowledge represented by the course of study. The nal examination is oral and is open to the public. Every student meeting the nal examination qualications must be enrolled in a minimum of 1 credit hour in order to defend. The nal examination must be completed in accordance with the schedule provided in the academic calendar. Ten working days before the examination is taken the department must submit the form requesting this examination to the Graduate School. This form may be found on the Web at http://gradschool.nmsu.edu/graduate-forms/ and is also available from the Graduate School and departmental ofces.36 The NMSU System Academic Regulations Students must ensure that each member of the examining committee receives a copy of the dissertation, no later than seven working days before the date of the nal examination. Any candidate who fails the nal oral examination may either be terminated from the doctoral program or upon recommendation of the committee and approval of the Dean of the Graduate School, be granted a second examination after a lapse of at least one semester. Failure in the second examination disqualies the candidate from obtaining the degree. Finalizing the Doctoral Dissertation After successful completion of the nal examination, electronic submission of the approved dissertation must be submitted to ProQuest ETD, no later than the deadline posted to the Graduate School website. The format review of dissertation will be performed electronically by the Graduate School. The form and style of the dissertation must comply with the regulations given in Preparing your manuscript for submission located at https://gradschool.nmsu.edu/doctoral-dissertation-students/. (https://gradschool.nmsu.edu/doctoral-dissertation-students/.html) The dissertation is not complete until the required forms are received at the Graduate School. Required forms may be found at https:// gradschool.nmsu.edu/doctoral-dissertation-students/. Registration at NMSU is a process that includes: (1) academic advising, (2) registering for classes, online or with your academic advisor, and (3) payment of tuition and fees. For rst time freshman and transfer undergraduate students (at the Las Cruces campus), the registration process occurs during Aggie Welcome/Transfer Student Orientations.

Class Schedule Each semester and summer session, the University Student Records Ofce provides an online schedule of classes which can be accessed through myNMSU or the NMSU website. Note that not all courses listed in this catalog are offered every semester. Registration Schedule by Classication Several groups of students (e.g. Crimson Scholars, Students with Disabilities, Veterans) receive priority dates for course registration. For other students, registration dates are determined by the student's current classication at the time of registration. A student's classication is determined by the number of credits completed, and does not include courses in progress. A student's classication depends upon the number of credits completed toward graduation. Sophomore classication is achieved with successful completion of 28 credits; Junior classication, 60 credits; Senior classication, 90 credits. University Credits The unit of university credit is the semester hour, which is based upon one hour of lecture class or a minimum of two hours of practice/lab per week during one semester, and assumes a minimum of two hoursadditional, by the student, outside of class. The number of credits associated with each course is indicated in the course schedule. Course Load for Undergraduate Students The full-time course load in a regular semester (fall or spring) for a main campus undergraduate students is 12-18 credits. A full-time course load for a summer term is 9-12 credits, with a maximum of 6 credits per session. Some scholarships have a 15 credit course load eligibility requirement. Each student is responsible for meeting their own scholarship eligibility requirements. An overload is classied as more than 18 credits for a regular semester and more than 12 credits for the summer term. A one-credit course in physical education or supplemental instruction will not create an overload. Registration for a course overload requires written permission from an Associate Director of the Center for Academic Advising and Student Support (CAASS) or the Associate Dean for Academics in the student's academic college. A \" Change of Schedule (https:// records.nmsu.edu/les/2022/02/Change-of-Schedule_Updated-1.pdf)\" form is required and available on the University Student Records Ofce website (https://records.nmsu.edu). Freshmen and students with a grade of D or F, or a cumulative grade-point average of less than 2.5, in either of the last two semesters, are not eligible for overloads. Concurrent enrollment in non-NMSU courses at other post-secondary institutions requires prior approval from the Associate Dean for Academics in the student's college, and these courses are counted as part of a student's class load. Course Load for Graduate Students A full-time course load in a regular semester (fall or spring) is 9 credits, with a maximum of 15 graded credits. A full-time course load for a summer term is 6 credits with a maximum of 9 credits. Course Numbering The course numbering system at NMSU indicated the levels as follows: 100-299/1000-2999 - Lower Division (Las Cruces and Community College Campuses) 300-499/3000-4999 - Upper Division (Las Cruces Campus) 450-499/4500-4999 - Senior and graduate courses (Las Cruces Campus) 500-799/5000-7999 - Graduate courses (Las Cruces Campus) All undergraduate students must demonstrate Basic Academic Skills in both English and mathematics before enrolling in any upper-division course (numbered 300/3000 or higher). These requirements ensure that each student in the upper-division courses has the ability to succeed without compromising the learning experience of other students. Class Delivery Classes at NMSU are delivered in a variety of modalities. Students may see any of the following schedule types when viewing the class schedule through myNMSU or the NMSU website. CL (Classroom/Lecture): traditional in-person class meetings that occur on specied days and times in a specied location. LB (Lab): traditional in-person lab meetings that occur on specied days and times in a specied location.New Mexico State University - Do\u00f1a Ana 37 HY (Online with In Person Meetings): hybrid delivery that is offered both online and with required in-person class meetings that occur on specied days and times in a specied location. ONL (Online with Synchronous Meetings): online class meetings that require all students to meet virtually on specied days and times WB (Online with no Synchronous Meeting): online class meetings that do not require students to meet virtually IND (Independent Meeting): students and instructors schedule meetings on an as needed basis to discuss course content and student progress TD (Thesis/Dissertation): thesis/dissertation with implied meetings on an as needed basis to discuss course content and student progress PC (Practicum): practicum/clinical with implied meetings on an as needed basis to discuss course content and student progress Prerequisites and Corequisites Some courses require advance or concurrently acquired specic knowledge and skills. Prerequisite(s) and corequisite(s) for each courses are indicated in the course description section of this catalog. Students must have completed (or be presently enrolled in the prerequisite(s)) courses in order to register for a course with prerequisites. Where a student was allowed to register for a course while completing the prerequisite(s), and then subsequently fails to successfully complete a prerequisite course, the student shall be dis-enrolled from the course requiring the prerequisite. In the case of a corequisite, a student must enroll in the courses during the same semester. In some instances, where a course has an enforced \"pre/corequisite\" the student can elect to either take the requirement before registering for the course, or take the courses at the same time. Registration Changes Subject to any registration \"holds\" and any applicable deadlines, students may change their course registration online. Caution should be exercised as registration changes may negatively impact eligibility for scholarships, nancial aid or athletic participation, the student's ability to progress through their degree program in a timely manner, and the student's obligations with respect to tuition and fees. The University Student Records Ofce publishes an online schedule of \"Important Dates for Students (https://records.nmsu.edu/important- dates-students/ )\" for each semester. The student is responsible for reviewing and adhering to the Important Dates, including the deadlines to add, drop or withdraw from course(s) for the relevant semester. Adding Courses: There are two different types of deadlines for adding courses: 1.Last day to add a class without instructor's signature - during this period courses may be added online through myNMSU, or through your academic advisor (if necessary). 2.Last day to add a class with instructor's signature - during this period courses may only be added with either the \"Change of Schedule (https://records.nmsu.edu/les/2022/02/Change-of- Schedule_Updated-1.pdf )\" form signed by the instructor (available online on the University Student Records Ofce website (https:// records.nmsu.edu)). * Students taking classes online and who do not live in the Las Cruces Area must email the instructor, using the NMSU email, in order to get permission to be added to the course. If the instructorapproves the addition, the approved response must be sent to either the student's academic advisor or to record_grade@nmsu.edu with the student's name, ID number and course CRN number they are wanting to add. Withdrawing from Courses: There are two different types of deadlines for withdrawing from courses: 1.Last day to drop without a \"W\" grade - during this period, the student can drop the course and not have it appear on their ofcial transcript in any form, and the student will have no nancial obligation related to the course (students will receive a 100% refund if tuition has been paid for the course). 2.Last day to drop with a \"W\" grade - during this period, the student can withdraw from the course, but the course will appear on their ofcial transcript with the withdrawal (W) designation as the grade, and the student will be responsible for the full tuition and fees related to that course. Students are responsible for initiating ofcial withdrawal from any course(s) they do not intend to complete. Students who experience extraordinary circumstances that prevent timely registration changes should consult with their Academic Associate Dean or the Registrar. For more information about the process for adding or withdrawing from a course(s), please speak with your academic advisor or contact the University Student Records Ofce. Any student attending under Veteran Educational Assistance must notify the Military and Veteran's Programs ofce before processing registration changes to determine if changes will affect their enrollment status or benets. A student found insufciently prepared for a course they are enrolled in may be transferred to a more elementary course in the same subject any day before the last day to withdraw from an individual course. Waitlisting Waitlisting is available for all courses across the NMSU system, except for labs that are linked to a specic lecture class. Waitlisting is an electronic list of students who are waiting to register for a lled course. Once students are put onto the waitlist, the process to get into that course is as follows: 1.A currently enrolled student must drop the course for a seat to become available. 2.The rst student on the waitlist is notied through their NMSU email. 3.The notied student has 24 hours to login to their myNMSU and register themselves for the class. 4.If the rst student fails to register within their allotted 24 hours, then the rst student is dropped from the waitlist and the next student on the waitlist is notied. This continues until the empty seat is lled. A student who fails to register for the class during their allotted 24 hours is automatically dropped from the waitlist and can add themselves back onto the bottom of the waitlist for that course. Students cannot be added to the waitlist after the rst day of classes. Instructor overrides can only be made after the second day of class, at which point the instructor's signature is required on either the \"Change of Schedule (https://records.nmsu.edu/les/2022/02/Change-of- Schedule_Updated-1.pdf )\" to add a course.38 The NMSU System Academic Regulations Graduate Registration Requirements for Summer Students who have scheduled their nal examination, or who are completing their thesis during a summer session, must be registered for one credit hour during the same summer session. In order to graduate during a summer session, the student must have led the Application for Degree by the deadline posted on the Academic Calendar. Repeating Courses for A Change in Grade See the Grading portion of the Academic Regulations section of this catalog. Substitutions and Waivers Students registering for their nal semester must have all course substitutions and waivers of required, for their degrees, courses approved before two weeks after the last date of registration for full or summer terms. Auditing a Course (No Credit) An audited course is one in which the student registers for the learning experience but does not seek to earn academic credit for the course. A student seeking to audit a course must register and pay tuition and fees for the course and have the consent of the instructor to take the class in audit form. A student who has registered to audit a course may be dis-enrolled from the course at any time before the registration deadline expires if necessary to accommodate a student taking the course for credit. After the last day to register, the student cannot change the course option from audit course to a for credit bearing course. Audited courses are not used in determining a maximum class load (overload) for undergraduate students in good academic standing, however, the audited course will be counted as part of the maximum allowable course load for graduate students and undergraduate students who are on academic probation. Attendance and Student Performance Academic success is closely correlated to student participation and attendance. Accordingly, students are expected to attend all their classes regularly. Each course instructor will establish the specic attendance and course requirements via the course syllabus. Only students who are currently enrolled in a course for either credit or audit are permitted to attend the classes ofcially. However, individual instructors may allow an occasional visitor and may allow a student who formally withdrew from the course to continue to participate for the remainder of the semester. Absences from Class and Failure to Complete Assignments Students who must miss class due to accident or illness or other circumstances beyond their control should consult the course syllabus and the instructor for guidance. Students may be administratively withdrawn from a course due to excessive absences (consecutive absences in excess of the number of class meetings held within a week or any number of absences, including failing to use the online Learning Management System, which are impairing the student's performance), or for persistent failure to complete assignments. In such cases, the Instructor may recommend administrative withdrawal by providing a completed \"Student Absence/Lack of Progress Report\" form to the Academic Associate Dean. If the Academic Associate Dean agreeswith the recommendation of the course instructor, the student will be administratively withdrawn from the course. To appeal the decision see the Administrative Withdrawal (http://catalogs.nmsu.edu/nmsu/nmsu- system-regulations-procedures/#withdrawalstext) section. Any absences due to the student's participation in a university-sponsored event (e.g. ASNMSU president representing NMSU at legislative session, student-athletes competing in NMSU scheduled athletic events, or students attending educational eld trips and conferences) will be excused and deemed an \"Authorized Absence\". Authorized absences do not relieve the student of the course assignments or responsibilities and instructors may require students to complete course work before the absence. Before the student's absence, the student will provide the instructor(s) with written notice of the dates of expected absence. Classroom Conduct Each instructor has the authority to establish and enforce reasonable rules of conduct in their courses. A student who engages in behavior that interferes with the educational environment of the class may be administratively dis-enrolled with the approval of the academic Department Head and Academic Associate Dean for the course, and with notication to the Provost. Any student who has been administratively dis-enrolled from a class may appeal that decision to the Dean of the College where the course was offered within ten days after notication of the dis-enrollment. Student Performance Assessment Individual student performance and learning outcomes in a course are measured and evaluated by the course instructor and reported to the student in the form of grades. Each instructor has the authority to establish assignments and other assessments (such as exams and quizzes) and to assign grades based on the student's performance on those assessments. The instructor determines the nal grades for the course and reports to the University Registrar as described in the grading section of this catalog. Any student who believes that their academic performance has been evaluated unfairly may appeal the grade through the University's Academic Appeals process as provided in this Catalog. Academic Program Assessment New Mexico State University is committed to providing its students with a quality education and a supportive learning environment. Academic Program Assessment is a continuous improvement process achieved by identifying a program's desired learning outcomes, evaluating the extent to which those outcomes are collectively achieved by students in the program, and then implementing changes to enhance and improve the collective program outcomes. For assessment to be effective, students must be actively aware of and engaged in assessment activities. Academic Program Assessment requires participation of students who are expected to provide feedback on personal, professional and academic development and to participate in a variety of assessment exercises. Assessment activities may be a part of regular graded course assignments, or may require students to engage in other activities as outlined in the course syllabus. Assessments may include course projects, exams, exit interviews, standardized tests, surveys, focus groups, etc. Data gathered through these assessments is published only in aggregate form. Learn more about NMSU's Academic Program Assessment at https://assessment.nmsu.edu/New Mexico State University - Do\u00f1a Ana 39 Exam Week and Final Examinations NMSU designates the last week of each semester as \"Exam Week\" during which each course has only a single 2 hour meeting time for a mandatory culminating activity which may be a nal examination or some other course-related activity. The University Student Records Ofce (USRO) establishes the Final Examination Schedule (https:// records.nmsu.edu/nal-examination-schedule/) for each semester. Examinations are typically held in the course's standard lecture/lab room. Some departments hold Departmental Exams where all students for all sections of a particular course must take the nal examination simultaneously. The Departmental Exams' date, time and location are indicated on the Final Examination Schedule. For courses that were not scheduled to meet at the specic times listed under \"Regular Class Time\" on the USRO's Final Examination Schedule, the instructor and course department coordinate examination dates, times and locations with NMSU's Academic Scheduling ofce (575) 646-4790. Final exams for weekend courses are held during the regular class period on the last day of class. The nal exam or culminating activity must not be rescheduled for a different date, time or location, except with the department head's permission and the enrolled students' unanimous consents. During the week before Exam Week, instructors cannot hold examinations lasting more than one class period. Any student having more than three examinations scheduled in any one day may, no later than the week prior to exam week, notify the instructor of the examination scheduled latest in the day to obtain an alternative date for that examination. (If the fourth exam is a departmental exam, the instructor of the third exam will make alternate arrangements for that exam upon request.) Students who believe that their instructor(s) have not honored Exam Week requirements may appeal to the instructor's department head. Developmental Evaluation The academic skill level of all entering rst-time students at the time of registration is evaluated based upon ACT scores, SAT scores, and/ or alternative placement assessments. The student's eligibility to enroll in university-level English and Mathematics courses depends on this evaluation. Students who have not demonstrated adequate preparation for university-level courses must take developmental courses. Developmental courses are included on the transcript and will be included in the calculation of the GPA, but the developmental course credits do not count towards a degree. Basic Academic Skills All undergraduate students must demonstrate Basic Academic Skills in both English and mathematics before enrolling in any upper-division course (numbered 300/3000 or higher). These requirements ensure that each student in the upper-division courses has the ability to succeed without compromising the learning experience of other students. The completion of the Basic Academic Skills requirements does not necessarily result in the award of academic credit nor satisfaction of university general education requirements in English and mathematics. (Students should consult the General Education Courses and Requirements section in this chapter for these requirements.) Transfer students with 45 or more credits are allowed to enroll in upper- division courses for only one semester before satisfying the BasicAcademic Skills requirements. The Basic Academic Skills requirements may be satised in a variety of different ways as listed below: English Basic Skill Demonstration Options (achieve one of the following): ACT English Score of 30 Coursework - ENGL 1110G , or equivalent, completed with a grade of C- or higher. Equivalents: the following are deemed equivalents to ENGL 1110G for the purpose of satisfying Basic Academic Skills in English: ENGL 1110H - completed with a grade of C- or higher ENGL 1110M - required for International students who took the TOEFL examination CLEP Exam score of 57 or higher in freshman college composition English Advanced Placement (AP) Exam score of 3, 4, or 5 English Composition Transfer Credits - 3 or more credits with a grade of C- or above, transferred from accredited post- secondary institutions (International students may be required to take ENGL 1110M Composition I Multilingual as noted above.) Credits from Non-accredited Institutions - As a general rule, NMSU does not accept credits from non-accredited institutions. Students with 3 or more credits of college-level English composition with a grade of C- or higher from a non-accredited institution may, however, challenge the Basic Academic Skills requirement in English and ENGL 1110G Composition I course requirement by submitting a theme paper written under the supervision of, and demonstrating achievement of ENGL 1110G Composition I learning outcomes as determined by, the Department of English. Mathematics Basic Skill Demonstration Options (achieve one of the following): ACT Mathematics Score of 23 Coursework - any one of the following courses or course combinations completed with a grade of C- or higher in each course: MATH 1130G Survey of Mathematics MATH 1215 Intermediate Algebra MATH 1220G College Algebra Any mathematics course numbered 1250G or above (prex MATH) excluding MATH 1996 Topics in Mathematics and MATH 2992 Directed Study Basic Skills Exam Passing Score - offered twice a semester by the Department of Mathematical Sciences Calculus AB, Calculus BC or Statistics Advanced Placement (AP) Exam score of 3, 4, or 5 IMPORTANT NOTE: Basic Academic Skills Demonstration fulllment options may not appear on the transcript, result in the award of academic credit, or satisfy general education requirements. The Basic Academic Skills requirements are used solely to determine eligibility for enrollment in upper-division courses. All students should seek to complete the Basic Academic Skills requirements as early in their academic program as possible. Students who postpone completing Basic Academic Skills may be unable to progress toward degree completion in a timely manner.40 The NMSU System Academic Regulations Independent Study and Directed Reading Courses Independent study courses and directed reading (other than those designated in the catalog with a subtitle), are for students capable of and sufciently motivated to undertake self-directed study with limited oversight of a faculty member. Only students who have completed at least 28 credits at NMSU under traditional grading, with a cumulative GPA of 2.5 or better, can enroll in independent study courses. No student is entitled to enroll in independent study and enrollment requires the consent of an instructor who agrees to supervise and evaluate the student's learning activities in the course. Students seeking registration in an independent study course should prepare an independent study proposal to present to the individual faculty member(s) in the relevant discipline for consideration. At a minimum, the proposal should include the topic of study, a brief survey of the literature or other resources on the subject, and a description of the proposed written product or another tangible outcome of the independent study. The relevant academic department for the discipline may have additional requirements. Each college determines the maximum number of credits that may be earned in independent study courses. Adjusted Credit Option The adjusted credit option provides eligible undergraduate students who earned a low grade-point average (less than 2.0 cumulative) during their rst few semesters to reset their GPA calculation. This option may be used only once and is not reversible. These are the consequences of exercising the Adjusted Credit Option: 1.All of the student's academic history pre-dating the request, including all NMSU course credits previously attempted or completed, transfer coursework, CLEP, ACT, advanced placement, special examination, and/or military service are included in the adjustment and designated as \"ADJUSTED CREDITS\" on the transcript. These credits are no longer included in the cumulative grade point average calculation. 2.Courses carrying an academic grade of S, CR, C- or better, earned prior to the grading period in which the student requested this option, are treated as earned academic credit and need not be repeated, except where a higher grade is required in the student's academic program. 3.Courses carrying an academic grade of U, CD, D or F, earned before to the grading period in which the student requested this option, remain on the student's transcript, but no academic credit is provided for these courses. The student must repeat these courses to obtain academic credit. 4.The student's academic transcripts will continue to reflect all coursework, including courses falling under the adjusted credit option. In no circumstances will a transcript be issued that does not include all courses attempted at this university. 5.The student's current academic status, eligibility for employment, and nancial aid may be impacted. Probationary status and eligibility for on-campus employment are not affected by the exercise of the adjusted credit option. 6.The repeat rule for courses starts anew. 7.The student will not be eligible for the award of an associate degree until earning thirty (30) or more additional credits after exercise of the Option. 8.The student is eligible for University honors at graduation upon completing a minimum of 60 academic credits at NMSU, after theadjusted credit option is exercised, with a resulting grade point average that satises University regulations for honors. After carefully considering the consequences indicated above, eligible students may exercise the Adjusted Credit Option by paying a fee of $10 and submitting an adjusted credit option application to the University Student Records Ofce. Application forms are available on the University Student Records Ofce website and can be approved by the Director of the Center for Academic Advising and Student Support or the Associate Dean for Academics in the student's college or the Academic Vice President at the Community Colleges. Only students meeting the following criteria are eligible to exercise the Option: 1.No awarded baccalaureate degree 2.Enrolled as a degree-seeking or non-degree undergraduate student 3.A cumulative grade-point average of less than 2.0 at NMSU 4.Fewer than 60 credits accumulated (including both transfer and NMSU credits) Credit by College Level Examination Program (CLEP) Prior to or during a student's enrollment at NMSU, credits may be earned through the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) of the College Entrance Examination Board. CLEP is a national program of credit by examination that offers the opportunity to earn credits for college- level achievement wherever or however the student learned. Earned CLEP credit will be treated as transfer credit without a grade, will count toward graduation, and may be used in fullling specic curriculum requirements. A current NMSU CLEP policy and test schedule information is available through Testing Services DACC East Mesa, RM 210. Testing Services may be reached at: (575) 528-7294. Credit by Examination Any enrolled student with a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 currently attending classes may, with permission of the appropriate department, challenge by examination any undergraduate course in which credit has not been previously earned except an independent study, research or reading course, or any foreign language course that precedes the nal course in the lower-division sequence. The department in which the course is being challenged shall determine the manner of administering the examination and granting permission. Students may not enroll in a single course, challenge it by examination, and drop it during the drop/ add period, unless they enroll in an additional course. In exceptional cases in which a student demonstrates outstanding ability in a course in which they are already registered, they may be permitted to challenge the course. A student desiring to apply for special examination may obtain the necessary forms from the University Student Records Ofce. The fee for challenging a course is the same as the approved tuition rate. Courses may not be challenged under the S/U option. The special examination privilege is based on the principle that the student, exclusively, has the responsibility for preparing for a special examination. Credit for Military Service New Mexico State University will award academic credit to United States military personnel for courses and Military Occupational Specialties (MOS), based on the American Council of Education Guide (ACE) as well as through national standardized tests, such as CLEP, AP, PEP and DANTES. Credit for military training is in accordance with NMSU Faculty Senate Legislation Proposition 24-07/08, which was passed in May 2008. Military Training and Military Occupational Specialties (MOS) must haveNew Mexico State University - Do\u00f1a Ana 41 a recommendation evaluation by ACE (in the ACE Guide) for credit to be awarded. Courses accepted for transfer credit become part of the student's ofcial NMSU transcript and academic record. If a student wishes to appeal a decision regarding the acceptance of military training/ education and/or MOS for academic credit, the student must submit a written statement of appeal to the Dean of the College to which the student has applied. The Dean will review the merits of the appeal and render a decision. The decision of the Dean is nal. Only Primary MOS (s) are eligible for academic credit in the initial review and evaluation. Credit for Duty and/or Secondary MOS may qualify for academic credit if the student petitions the college's Academic Dean. Primary MOS is the primary specialty of a soldier and reflects the broadest and most in-depth scope of military experience. Veterans, active-duty personnel, National Guard and Reservists who are current students or students applying for admission to New Mexico State University may be granted academic credit on a case-by-case basis upon evaluation of military transcripts - the Joint Service Transcript (jst.doded.mil) and the Community College of the Air Force transcripts. Course equivalencies and credit hours awarded for a particular NMSU degree are determined by colleges and/or academic departments. Credit hours may be awarded for specic courses toward degree requirement, or as elective credit. The number of credit hours awarded will be determined by the college and/or academic department. NOTE: Students submitting military transcripts for credit evaluation must keep in mind the Maximum Time Frame policy. See Financial Aid (http:// catalogs.nmsu.edu/nmsu/nancial-aid-scholarship-services/) Section. Graduate Course Deciencies Students admitted with departmental deciencies may be required to take diagnostics tests and additional qualifying examinations. They must complete satisfactorily, in a manner specied by the major department, all undergraduate course deciencies as prescribed by the department responsible for the graduate program. Courses taken to satisfy deciencies will be listed on the undergraduate transcript; however, these course grades will not be calculated in the student's graduate GPA or graduate hours. With the permission of the student's advisor and the head of the department, courses to meet undergraduate deciencies may be taken under a S/U option (with S being a grade satisfactory to the professor), and such courses will not affect the maximum number of S/U graduate credits permitted. Short Courses for Graduate Students Short course(s) that are numbered 450/4500 and above have been approved to carry graduate credit. Graduate students must be registered for the short course(s) to receive graduate credit. Concurrent enrollment of graduate students in regular and short courses for the fall/spring semesters is allowed, provided the combined total credits does not exceed 15. All short courses carrying one-semester credit will be graded on a S/U basis, and these credits will be counted toward the student's limit of S/U credits. Challenging Graduate Courses A graduate student may challenge a graduate course by examination, please see the Graduate School for more information. University Grading System Each course department or instructor establishes the system for assessing student performance in achieving course learning objectives. Students should consult the course syllabus for a description of the grading system used in each course. At the conclusion of each course, instructors are required to report a nal grade reflecting the instructor's assessment of each student's performance. Shortly after the end of the term, students can access their grades through the MyNMSU portal. No other grade notication will be issued. The nal grade is reported on the student transcript. Instructors may elect whether to use fractional grading (the use of the plus and minus) in assigning nal letter grades. The NMSU system for nal grades is expressed in letters, which carry grade points that are used in calculating the cumulative grade-point average, as shown in this table: Letter Grade Grade Points per Unit of Credit A+ 4.0 A 4.0 A- 3.7 B+ 3.3 B 3.0 B- 2.7 C+ 2.3 C 2.0 C- 2.0 D+, D, D- 1.0 F 0 W- Withdrawal 0 N- Grade not submitted 0 CR- Credit authorized, but not letter grade0 IP- In progress 0 RR- Progress in undergraduate course0 PR- Progress in graduate thesis 0 S- Satisfactory work10 U- Unsatisfactory work 0 I- Incomplete work 0 AU- Audit 0 1 S grades are grades that are satisfactory to the professor and are normally equivalent to the letter grade of C- or higher. Any courses for which only CR, S or PR is awarded, but no traditional letter grade is given, will be included in the total number of earned hours but is not computed in the grade-point average. Traditional letter grades are those which are used in the grade point average determination: A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D- and F. In computing the overall grade- point-average, the total credits in which grades of A+ through F have been assigned is divided into the total number of grade points earned. Midterm and Six-Week Early Performance Grades A Six-Week Early Performance Grade (sometimes referred to as Midterm Grade) for courses numbered 100/1000-299/2999 will be posted and available to students through the MyNMSU portal. The purpose of the early grade posting is to ensure that students have an opportunity to address any performance issues. Students should be mindful that the Six-Week Early Performance Grade reflects a students' performance42 The NMSU System Academic Regulations on only that portion of the total coursework that has been graded at that time. Any student who is doing poorly, or not as well as they would like, should meet with the instructor to discuss how they can improve. Students who have concerns about their progress in multiple courses or who are considering withdrawal from course(s) must meet with their academic advisor. In courses numbered 300/3000 or higher, the posting of Early Performance Grades is optional and may occur through the online course management system rather than the MyNMSU portal. However, prior to the last day to withdraw from a course, upon request, instructors will provide information to students about their progress in the course. Retention of Grading Records Individual assignments and exams that are not returned to students should be retained by the instructor or department through the end of the subsequent regular semester. The records used to compute individual nal grades should be retained for two years after the completion of a course. If a nal grade is appealed, these records are kept for at least two years after the completion of the appeal. Departments, colleges, or the library may require that records be kept for longer periods. Minimum Grade Requirement for Undergraduate Students Undergraduate degrees require a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher for degree completion. Although D+, D, or D- can be considered passing, some departments have higher grade requirements for the courses within their program and/or their program as a whole. Students should check with their departments regarding specic course grading requirements for their particular degree program. Minimum Grade Requirement for Graduate Students Graduate degrees require a cumulative graduate G.P.A. of 3.0 or higher. Although B- and C grades (including C+ and C-) earned at NMSU may be counted toward the requirements for a graduate degree in some programs, this grade does not reflect acceptable graduate-level performance and may cause the cumulative G.P.A. to fall below the 3.0 required for graduate students. Some departments have higher grading requirements for courses in their programs. Students should check with their departments regarding specic course grading requirements for their particular degree program. Courses in which a student earns a D or F grade do not ever satisfy graduate degree requirements; however, these grades will be calculated in determining the students' cumulative grade-point average. To obtain academic credit, students must retake courses in which a grade of D or F was earned. S/U Grading S/U grading allows the student to attempt to earn course credit without having a course grade included in their grade point average calculations. Under S/U grading, the instructor assigns an S grade for satisfactory achievement of the course learning objectives (normally equivalent to the letter grade of C- or higher) and a U grade for unsatisfactory performance in the class.Designated S/U Courses Each academic college may designate courses in which the grading will be on a basis of S or U for all students enrolled in the courses. Credits in designated S/U courses are not included in the limitations on the number of S/U credits a student may take and are not subject to the student eligibility requirements described below. Election of the S/U Grading Option - Undergraduate Students In courses other than those designated as S/U for all students, eligible individual students may elect the S/U Grading Option, subject to the regulations stated below. To be eligible for the S/U (satisfactory/ unsatisfactory) Grading Option, undergraduate students must meet the eligibility requirements and obtain the approval of an academic advisor. Eligibility requires the completion of 28 credits at NMSU under traditional grading, with an overall average of 2.5 or better. (Upon approval of the adjusted credit option, students must re-establish eligibility.) Non- degree seeking students may take courses under the S/U option without regard to eligibility requirements. However, these courses may not be subsequently applied toward an undergraduate degree at NMSU. The S/U option must be elected as part of the course registration and may not be added once the course registration period closes. Other than honors courses and courses ofcially designed as S/U, the following limitations apply to courses in which the S/U option is elected: 1.No more than 7 credits per semester or 4 credits per summer session. 2.Not to exceed a total of 21 credits towards a degree. 3.Not a required course for the student's major. Students electing the S/U option should be mindful that upon a change of majors, the new major department may require a traditional grade for a course within that major that was previously completed with an S grade. In such cases, the student may request that the original instructor process a change of grade form to apply a traditional grade, however, if more than 2 years have elapsed or if the instructor is no longer at NMSU, such a change will not be possible and the student may be required to retake the course or obtain a traditional grade through a course challenge. Election of the S/U Grading Option Election - Graduate Students With approval from their advisor and department head, graduate students in good academic standing may elect the S/U option, at the time of registration, for courses taken outside the major department, subject to the regulations stated below: 1.No more than a total of 6 credits of elected S/U courses are permitted in the master's degree. 2.Doctoral candidates may take an additional 6 credits under the S/U option after application to candidacy. I Grade Designation The letter grade of I (incomplete) is given for passable work that could not be completed due to circumstances beyond the student's control that develop after the last day to withdraw from the course. In no case is an I grade to be used to avoid the assigning of D, F, U or RR grades for marginal or failing work. Examples of appropriate circumstances include documented illness, documented death or crisis in the student's immediate family, unexpected military deployment and similar circumstances. Other job-related circumstances are generally not appropriate grounds for assigning an I grade. Students requesting an I grade are responsible for providing satisfactory evidence of such circumstances. (In the case of medical records, instructors should reviewNew Mexico State University - Do\u00f1a Ana 43 the information provided, note that adequate medical documentation was provided for review, and return the documentation to the student. Under no circumstances should the instructor retain any medical records or indicate the specics of any medical condition in the academic records.) The refusal to grant an I grade may be appealed in the same manner as any other nal grade. To assign an I grade, the instructor must complete the \"I grade Information Form (https://records.nmsu.edu/les/2021/06/Incomplete- Grade-Form_Revised_06142021_.pdf)\" by the deadline for nal grade submission in the semester the student was enrolled in the course, and have the form delivered to the associate dean of the course college. The instructor must indicate on the form whether the student will be given the option to complete the remaining coursework and have the I grade changed to the earned letter grade. If so, the instructor should indicate the steps necessary to complete the remaining coursework. The I grade form should either be signed by the student in person or digitally, or the associate dean must send a copy of the document to the student's ofcial permanent address or university email address, as recorded in the University Student Records Ofce, with a notation on the form that the student was not available for signature. The I grade will be permanent in instances where (1) the instructor did not provide an option to complete the coursework, (2) the instructor left NMSU prior to completion of the coursework and grade change, or (3) the student failed to complete the coursework by the relevant deadline, and the instructor did not indicate that the I grade would be changed to the earned grade upon failure to complete. In such instances, the student will be required to re-enroll in the course to receive credit (in which case the permanent I grade and the subsequently earned letter grade will both appear on the transcript). The student is entitled to have the I grade removed from the transcript only if, within 12 months or any earlier deadline established by the instructor on the \"I Grade Information Form\" and prior to graduation, the student completes the remaining coursework, as specied on the I Grade Form, in a manner satisfactory to the instructor. If the student fails to complete the coursework, the instructor may change the I grade to any appropriate grade (including D, F, or U) only if the instructor stated that this would occur on the \"I Grade Information Form.\" The instructor should assign whatever grade was earned for the entire course. To change the I grade, the instructor must complete a \"Change of Grade Form,\" obtain the signature of the associate dean for the course, and submit the form to the University Student Records Ofce. RR Grade The RR grade may be assigned only in undergraduate developmental courses (CCDE, CCDL, CCDM & CCDR) and indicates that the student has made substantial progress toward completing the requirements of the course. It carries neither penalty nor credit, so a student must re-enroll and successfully complete the course in order to earn credit. The grade of RR may be received only once in any given course, and is a permanent notation on the student's transcript. W Grade Designation The W grade is assigned only in courses when the student withdraws or is administratively dis-enrolled from the course after the last day to drop the course. The W grade is permanent.Effect of Change of Grade The effect of a change of grade on a student's academic standing (academic warning, probation or suspension) depends on the date the transaction is ofcially recorded on the student's academic record. If the transaction is recorded before the student begins another semester, the grade change (such as replacing the I grade with an earned grade) is included in the grade-point average calculation in order to establish the student's academic standing. If the transaction is recorded after the student begins another semester, for the purpose of calculating academic standing, the new grade is included with any other grades earned for the semester in which the grade change is processed. Repeating Courses for a Change in Grade Undergraduate students: may repeat courses, for a change in grade, when the original grade earned was a D or F. Las Cruces Main Campus students are not allowed to count repeated courses towards the minimum 15 credits required to retain merit-based institutional scholarship. Once a grade of C- or better is earned, the course will then be substituted in the calculation of the grade-point-average and students will no longer be able to repeat that course for change of grade purposes. Student transcripts will continue to show the grade awarded for each course attempt. If the student's original grade was a D and he/she repeats the course, but receives a F, the second grade will not be substituted for the original. Graduate students: may repeat courses to achieve a higher grade, but the grade assigned for each attempt will remain on the transcript and will be counted in the grade point average calculation. Grade Point Average Grade point average (GPA) calculations are based solely on courses taken at NMSU or under an approved National Student Exchange. Grading in Graduate Research In grading both master's and doctoral research, thesis and dissertation work in progress, the instructor reports for each enrollment period the grade PR (progress) or U (unsatisfactory) rather than a traditional letter grade. These assigned grades are permanent notations on the student's transcript. Only those credits graded PR (Progress) accumulate toward the minimum number of research credits required. PR indicates that the student has devoted an adequate amount of time to the work scheduled but does not indicate the quality. U indicates that the student has stopped work or is doing work of unacceptable quality. At the conclusion of the nal oral examination, or when the thesis/ dissertation is submitted for the nal signature of the graduate dean, the instructor will report the nal S or U grade for that semester. If the thesis/ dissertation and the performance in the nal oral examination are found to be acceptable, the instructor will report an S (satisfactory) grade. If the thesis/dissertation or the performance in the nal oral examination is found to be unacceptable, the instructor will report an U (unsatisfactory) grade. If a student accumulates a total of two U (unsatisfactory) grades in courses numbered either 599/5999, 600/6991, 700/7000, or any other graduate level project/research type courses with S/U grading, the student will be placed on provisional status. If three U (unsatisfactory) grades are reported for these courses, the student will be dismissed from the Graduate School. .44 The NMSU System Academic Regulations For more information regarding how withdrawals impact tuition refunds, please see the Tuition, Fees & Other Expenses (http:// catalogs.nmsu.edu/nmsu/tuition-fees-expenses/#newitemtext) section of the catalog. Withdrawal from a Single Course Any student wishing to formally withdraw from a single course, after the last day to drop has passed, can do so through their Academic Advisor or the University Student Records Ofce. All such withdrawals will be registered on the student's transcript with the \"W\" grade indication. For students wishing to withdrawal from all courses, please see the section on Withdrawal from NMSU. Leave of Absence from the Graduate School Students who are working on advanced degrees and plan to have an interruption in studies, for a calendar year, should request for a leave of absence through their department head. The student must submit a formal letter through their department head to the Dean of the Graduate School, an email will not be accepted. The request should include the beginning date and the anticipated ending date for the period of absence. A graduate student on leave of absence will be expected not to use university facilities and place no demands upon the university faculty and staff, and, therefore will pay no fees. Time spent in the \"leave-of-absence\" status will not be counted toward the advanced degree time limits. A graduate student who fails to register for one calendar year without obtaining a leave of absence from the Graduate School will be considered withdrawn from the university, by the Graduate School. In order to resume their studies after such absences, the student must go through the formal readmission process. Administrative Withdrawals In the event that a student has stopped attending class without formally withdrawing, stopped using the online Learning Management System, or has a history of persistent unexcused absences or failures to complete assignments, the University reserves the right to remove the student from the class by means of an administrative withdrawal. An administrative withdrawal may be requested under the following circumstances: 1.At the beginning of the semester, if a student misses the rst two (2) class meetings or online activities. 2.At any point in the semester, if a student misses four (4) consecutive class meetings or online activities. 3.If over the course of the semester, the student persistently fails to attend class or fails to complete assignments. In NO case is an administrative withdrawal used to avoid the assigning of D, F, U or RR grades for marginal or failing work. Administrative withdrawals are subject to the same refund rules as student initiated withdrawals (100% refund prior to census and no refund after census)/ To request consideration for an administrative withdrawal, the instructor must complete the Student Absence/Lack of Progress Report (https:// records.nmsu.edu/les/2020/03/Student-Absence_Lack-of-Progress- Report_03092020.pdf), found on the forms page of the University Student Records Ofce webpage, and route for approvals. The University StudentRecords Ofce is ultimately responsible for processing the administrative withdrawal. Upon receipt of a fully approved Student Absence/Lack of Progress Report, from the Dean's Ofce, the Student Records staff will notify the student that they will be withdrawn from the class within 48 hours unless they appeal the action. This notication will be sent to the student's ofcial NMSU email address. Students wishing to appeal the administrative withdrawal, should reply to the Student Records' notication email, with a valid reason for non-attendance / non- completion of coursework, within 48 hours of the email delivery time stamp. If the appeal circumstances are determined reasonable and accepted, the student will not be withdrawn from the class and will be expected to actively participate in all future meetings and coursework. The Student Records Ofce will notify the instructor, Department Head and Associate Dean of the determination, via ofcial NMSU email. When an administrative withdrawal is initiated for a student who is representing the university at an ofcial out-of-town event any administrative withdrawals will become effective upon the student's return from the event or ve days after the drop slip fully approved form is submitted to the Student Records Ofce. Military Withdrawal New Mexico State University understands that our military students may be called to active duty, specialized training, or disaster relief efforts with little notice. U.S. active duty military students wishing to withdraw from all their classes must present their orders and their request for full withdrawal, as indicated below. However, the below policy does not pertain to a student's basic and/or annual training. A student who has an order for training is encouraged to formally request, through the proper military chain of command, a postponement of their orders until the summer or the end of the semester they are currently enrolled in. If a student's request for postponement is denied, the student may then follow the below steps but must provide documentation that their postponement request was formally denied. All NMSU students that have been called up for active duty must take the following steps to withdraw from all their classes: 1.Military and Veterans Programs (MVP): TA/VA students ordered to Active Duty must provide a copy of orders to the MVP ofce, in Corbett Center Student Union, Room 244, or by email mvp@nmsu.edu . To assist in reporting accurate information to their military service or the VA Regional Ofce, the student should also provide, in writing, the last day of class attendance. 2.NMSU University Student Records: All students presenting their orders to the University Student Records Ofce, (575) 646-3411, or records@nmsu.edu, will receive a military withdrawal from classes and full tuition and fees refund for that semester. 3.Bookstore : Students who still have their receipts for textbooks purchased the semester in which they are called to active duty will be given a full refund for these textbook purchases when they present their orders. Please contact the bookstore for assistance at (575) 646-4431 or nmsu@bkstr.com. Student Medical Withdrawal A student medical withdrawal applies to a student who becomes seriously ill, injured or hospitalized and is therefore unable to complete an academic term for which they are enrolled. This action applies toNew Mexico State University - Do\u00f1a Ana 45 all courses a student is registered for in the affected semester(s). The student cannot select which courses they want to withdraw from and which they want to remain registered for when exercising this option. The students' attending physician must provide a letter, on ofcial letterhead with an original signature, stating the date(s) within the semester that the student was under medical care and must withdraw because of that medical condition. This letter must be submitted within the semester or no later than one academic year after the end of the term for which the withdrawal is being requested. Once the information is reviewed a nal determination will be made if the student is eligible for the consideration of tuition or other refunds (students receiving funds awarded by the University Financial Aid and Scholarship Services should be aware of policies regarding withdrawal from the University). At the Las Cruces campus, medical withdrawal begins and ends at the University Student Records Ofce. At all other campuses, medical withdrawal begins at the Student Services Ofce but is ultimately nalized with the University Student Records Ofce on the Las Cruces campus. Medical Conditions of a Family Member Withdrawal A student who is withdrawing because of a medical condition of an immediate family member must submit a letter from the family member's attending physician. This action applies to all courses a student is registered for in the affected semester(s). The student cannot select which courses they want to withdraw from and which they want to remain registered for when exercising this option. It must be on ofcial letterhead with an original signature, stating the date(s) within the semester that the student's immediate family member was under medical care and that the student must withdraw to attend to the immediate family member's medical condition. This letter must be submitted within the semester or no later than one academic year at the end of the term for which the withdrawal is being requested. Immediate family member, in this instance, includes a spouse; a domestic partner, as dened in the NMSU Policy Manual 7.04; a child, parent or legal guardian; a sister or brother and a grandparents or a grandchild. Familial relationships that are created by law are also included (i.e. mother/father in law; half or step siblings); any other relationships can be considered on a case-by-case basis. Once the information is reviewed a nal determination will be made if the student is eligible for consideration of tuition or other refunds (Students receiving funds awarded by the University Financial Aid and Scholarship Services should be aware of policies regarding withdrawal from the University.) At the Las Cruces campus, medical withdrawal begins at the University Student Records Ofce. At all other campuses, medical withdrawal begins at the Student Services Ofce. Withdrawal from NMSU Withdrawal from any NMSU campus is an ofcial procedure that must be: 1.Initiated by the student (using the Withdrawal form) 2.Have all necessary signatures (as indicated on the form) 3.Be approved and processed through the University Student Records Ofce, located on the Las Cruces Campus Students who withdraw from all courses for the semester should do so in person through the University Student Records Ofce. However, students who are unable to come in person may submit an e-mail usingtheir NMSU e-mail account to records@nmsu.edu (). Students who leave without following the ofcial procedure are graded appropriately by the instructor. Applicable dates for the last day to withdrawal are published on the approved university academic calendar or under important dates at: http://registration.nmsu.edu (http://registrar.nmsu.edu). A student who withdraws from all classes for the semester will retain access to their NMSU account per current policy but will lose access to other services and privileges available to enrolled students. Financial information concerning drops and withdrawals can be found at http://uar.nmsu.edu/withdrawals/. Financial Aid Recipients should contact University Financial Aid and Scholarship Services before withdrawing. Students receiving funds awarded by the University Financial Aid and Scholarship Services should be aware of policies regarding withdrawal from the University. The Federal Higher Education Act requires the University to calculate a Return of Federal Student Aid Funds for students who withdraw (ofcially or unofcially) from all classes on or before the 60 percent attendance point in the semester. Using a pro-rata schedule, the percentage of the semester attended is used to calculate the amount of the student's earned versus unearned Federal student aid funds. The unearned portion of Federal student aid funds will be returned to the appropriate aid program(s). Students withdrawing from classes are responsible for payment of any balance due after the required return of Federal student aid funds. Graduation Requirements For specic graduation requirements for any degree offered at NMSU please see the Degrees, Majors, Minors and Other Academic Programs of Study (http://catalogs.nmsu.edu/nmsu/regulations-policies/ #academicprogramsofstudytext) section, as well as the departmental sections for those requirements. These requirements will include the minimum GPA, total credits and specic course requirements for graduation. Applying for a Degree Any students that are in their nal semester of classes are considered degree candidates and are required to submit an \"Application for Degree\" as well as pay graduation fees for each degree being sought. The application for Degree form is available online through the myNMSU website. It must be completed and submitted by the designated deadline for that semester. The fees for the Las Cruces campus are all listed in the Tuition, Fees and other Expenses (http://catalogs.nmsu.edu/nmsu/ tuition-fees-expenses/) section of the catalog, once a student submits the application the fee will be included in the total cost for the semester or session in which the candidate anticipates completing their degree requirements. If degree requirements are not completed during the semester/ session the student originally applied for, the student must then reapply and pay the appropriate fees. A $50 late fee applies to applications received after the application deadline, and no applications will be accepted after the posted deadline date. A student must specify which catalog they are using for their degree requirements in order for the university to determine if the requirements are met and if a degree can be certied. The latest date for substitution or46 The NMSU System Academic Regulations waiver of required courses for degree candidates is two weeks after the last date of registration for full or summer terms. Attendance at the Commencement Ceremony Commencement is a symbolic ceremony, that students can elect to participate in after they have applied for their degree (https:// commencement.nmsu.edu/apply-to-graduate/ ). Participation in commencement does not, in itself, mean that a student is considered an NMSU graduate. In order to be awarded a degree, a student must fulll university requirements as determined by academic colleges. The degree will reflect the graduation date from the application for degree in which all degree requirements were determined by the academic colleges. The academic colleges will conrm students' eligibility to participate in the commencement ceremony that is held at the end of the fall and spring semesters. Eligible candidates who are in the process of completing their nal degree requirements and degree recipients from the previous summer session will participate in the fall ceremony. Students who are in the process of completing their nal degree requirements in the spring can participate in the spring ceremony. However, Bachelor degree candidates that wish to participate in a spring commencement, prior to completing degree requirements in summer school may do so if they meet the following conditions: 1.Receive permission from the Academic Dean of their college 2.Show a minimum cumulative grade-point average of 2.0 3.Only need 12 or fewer credit hours to complete their degree requirements 4.These remaining credit hours must be offered in the upcoming summer schedule of classes 5.Submit a degree application and approved petition form (available in the Dean's ofce) by the last day to apply for a degree in the spring semester. Academic Regalia Each college may approve distinctive symbols to be worn by the top 10 percent of its graduates at commencement. Only one symbol may be worn by each graduate. In addition, the student with the highest honors in each college may wear a crimson- colored gown. No other symbolic additions to academic regalia are allowed without the approval of the Academic Deans Council. Diploma All fees and bills owed the university must be paid in full before a student may receive a diploma or ofcial transcripts. The degree title and major(s) will be printed on the diplomas, in accordance to the degree application award, determined by the academic colleges. Academic honors will also be printed on the diplomas below the degree and major(s). The name on the diploma will reflect the student's current ofcial NMSU records. Name changes are only processed for currently admitted students. Diplomas will be mailed to graduates approximately eight weeks after the individual colleges certify the degree requirements and the nal grades have been processed by the University Student Records Ofce. The diploma will be mailed to the address specied on the degree application, unless an address change was requested before the last day of the semester.Undergraduate Academic Standing When a student does not maintain adequate academic standing, he/ she is placed in Academic Warning. If the student's academic standing does not improve, the placement progresses to Academic Probation I. Continued unimproved academic standing moves a student into Academic Probation II, then nally, Academic Suspension. Each stage imposes more structure and limitations on the student in order to help them return to normal academic standing. The intent is not to punish, but to help the student return to normal academic standing and success. Since some of these limitations involve limitations on the number of credit hours, students on Probation or Suspension may be subject to loss of nancial aid. It is the student's responsibility to determine the impact of their changed academic standing on their nancial aid. Notication to students of academic warning, probation, or suspension appears on the student's grade report at the end of each grading period. Undergraduate Academic Warning Issued only once, the rst time a student's cumulative GPA falls below a 2.0 while in good academic standing. The University Student Records Ofce will send the student a notication detailing the consequences should the cumulative grade point remain below a 2.0 at the conclusion of the semester. A student on Academic Warning remains eligible for all extracurricular activities as governed by the rules of the specic activity. While under Academic Warning the following restrictions apply: 1.The student cannot enroll in more than 15 hours of coursework during the semester. 2.The student may be required to enroll in a 3-credit hour special study skills/time management course specically designed for students on Academic Warning, or an equivalent course approved by the appropriate associate dean or CAO of their campus. 3.Students may be required to enter into a contract with their advisor, approved by their department head that places further stipulations on Academic Warning. The contract may include, but is not limited to the following: 4.The student may be required to take at least one repeat course to try to improve their GPA. 5.Except for the special study skills/time management course, the student's coursework may be restricted to their major. 6.The student may be required to get tutoring help. 7.The student may be required to see an academic counselor on a specied time schedule. 8.The number of credit hours a student may register for may be restricted (due to extenuating circumstances such as the student's workload commitments). The associate dean or CAO may place the student on Academic Probation I should the student not adhere to the stipulations of the contract. If the student's semester GPA is less than a 2.0, and the cumulative GPA remains below a 2.0 at the end of the semester on Academic Warning, the student is placed on Academic Probation I. If the semester GPA is greater than 2.0 but the cumulative GPA is still less than 2.0, the student will remain on Academic Warning. If the cumulative GPA is greater than a 2.0 at the end of the semester then the student is returned to good academic standing.New Mexico State University - Do\u00f1a Ana 47 Undergraduate Academic Probation I This occurs when a student under Academic Warning has a semester GPA less than 2.0, and the cumulative GPA remains below 2.0 at the conclusion of the semester or if the student maintains a semester GPA greater than 2.0 while on Academic Probation I but the cumulative GPA is still less than 2.0. Academic Probation I will also occur if a student falls below a 2.0 cumulative GPA from Good Academic Standing if Academic Warning already occurred in a previous term. Under Academic Probation I the following conditions apply: 1.The student cannot enroll in more than 13 hours of coursework during the semester. Note: Students falling below 12 credits in any one semester will jeopardize their nancial aid. Should this occur, students should see the associate dean in their college as soon as possible to try to implement corrective measures. 2.The student may enter into a contract or individualized education plan with their advisor and be approved by the associate dean or CAO that place further stipulations on Academic Probation I. The associate dean or CAO may place the student on Academic Probation II or Academic Suspension should the student not adhere to the contract stipulations. 3.Students on Academic Probation receiving educational benets from the Veterans' Administration must obtain counseling from the Military & Veterans Programs Ofce. 4.Students admitted under special provisions whose transcripts indicate less than a 2.0 GPA are admitted on Academic Probation I. The student must maintain a semester GPA equal to or greater than 2.0 until such time that the cumulative GPA is greater than 2.0 at which time the student goes back to good academic standing. Until the transition happens the student remains on Academic Probation I. The student will be placed on Academic Probation II if they cannot maintain a 2.0 semester GPA, and the cumulative remains below a 2.0 GPA, while under Academic Probation I. A student on Academic Probation I remains eligible for all extracurricular activities as governed by the rules of the specic activity. Undergraduate Academic Probation II Academic Probation II is issued in two ways. The rst is when a student falls below a semester 2.0 GPA and the cumulative GPA remains below a 2.0 while on Academic Probation I. The second is when a student maintains a semester GPA greater than 2.0 while on Academic Probation II, but the cumulative GPA is still less than 2.0. The following restrictions are in place for student's in Academic Probation II: 1.The student cannot enroll in more than 7 credit hours of coursework during the semester. 2.As with rule 2 under Academic Warning and Academic Probation I and at the discretion of the associate dean or CAO, the student will be required to enter into a contract with their advisor, approved by the associate dean or CAO, to place further stipulations on Academic Probation II. The associate dean or CAO may place the student on Academic Suspension should the student not adhere to the stipulations of the contract.The student must maintain a semester 2.0 GPA or higher until the cumulative GPA reaches a 2.0 or higher, at which time they are placed on good academic standing. A student unable to maintain a semester GPA of 2.0 or higher, and the cumulative remains below 2.0 GPA, while under Probation II will be placed on Academic Suspension. A student on Academic Probation II remains eligible for all extracurricular activities as governed by the rules of the specic activity. Continuing in Probationary Status Students may continue to enroll while on Academic Probation I or II provided they maintain a semester GPA of 2.0 or higher. If they withdraw from the university while on Academic Probation, they continue on that same level of Academic Probation. Removal of Academic Probation Such academic standing is removed when the cumulative GPA is raised to 2.0 or higher, with the following exceptions: 1.a transfer student may not remove probation by summer work alone; 2.if an I grade is removed after the student has enrolled, the new grade's effect on academic standing is based on its inclusion with grades for the term for which the student is enrolled; 3.exercise of the Adjusted Credit Option does not change academic status until subsequent grades are earned. Academic Suspension When a student does not achieve a semester 2.0 GPA or higher, and the cumulative remains below a 2.0 while under Academic Probation II, they are placed on Academic Suspension. Students under Academic Suspension are not allowed to take NMSU courses while under suspension. Students on Academic Suspension must sit out a minimum of 1 semester and apply for re-admission. Under certain conditions, a student may be re-admitted at NMSU under regular status while under Academic Suspension when satisfactory progress has been demonstrated at another college or university (see Readmission- Degree Seeking). Credits earned at another university or college while under Academic Suspension from NMSU or another university or college will be accepted at NMSU only after the student demonstrates satisfactory progress over a period of two semesters after being re-admitted or admitted to NMSU. Acceptance of transfer credits that count toward degree requirements is still governed by the rules established by the student's respective college or campus. Summer Attendance Impact on Academic Standing A student may use summer classes to get a warning or probationary status removed. Students suspended at the close of the spring semester may have their Academic Suspension rescinded if they attend a summer session at NMSU or one of its Community College campuses. Such attendance must raise the combined spring semester and summer GPA to 2.0 or better. Under no circumstances may a student on Academic Warning or Academic Probation be allowed to register for an overload. The current academic status is continued if the student withdraws from the university and the probation or suspension status applies to all subsequent enrollments until the cumulative GPA is 2.0 or higher.48 The NMSU System Academic Regulations Graduate Academic Probation and Suspension Graduate Academic Standing is based on the student's semester GPA and cumulative GPA. The student must maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or higher to remain on Graduate Academic Good Standing. Graduate Academic Probation I : A graduate student is placed on Graduate Academic Probation I when the student's cumulative GPA drops below 3.0 and the previous academic standing is Graduate Academic Good Standing. If a student on Probation I earns a semester GPA above 3.0 but the cumulative GPA remains below 3.0, the student continues on Graduate Academic Probation I Graduate Academic Probation II : If the semester GPA of a continuing or re-admitted graduate student on Graduate Academic Probation I drops below 3.0 then the student is placed on Graduate Academic Probation II Graduate Academic Suspension : If the graduate student cannot maintain a semester GPA of 3.0 or higher and the cumulative remains below 3.0 GPA while under Graduate Academic Probation II, the student will then be placed on Graduate Academic Suspension. Students on Graduate Academic Suspension are barred from enrolling in graduate-level courses at NMSU while on suspension. Graduate students on Graduate Academic Suspension must sit out a minimum of one semester. Graduate students on suspension who wish to continue Graduate School after suspension must re-apply to the department and Graduate School. The student must also petition College Academic Dean or the Graduate School Dean, based on the major and degree the student is pursuing to be removed from Graduate Academic Suspension. At this time the graduate academic suspension status will be evaluated for possible readmission to the department. Should the suspension be lifted, the graduate student is placed on Graduate Academic Probation II or Graduate Re-admit on Probation II until such time that the graduate cumulative GPA equals or exceeds 3.0. If you have questions about your academic standing, please contact your department academic advisor or Graduate Dean's ofce. Student Academic Code of Conduct The Student Academic Code of Conduct (SACC), applicable to both undergraduate and graduate students, provides procedures for reviewing and resolving of alleged or suspected academic misconduct within a reasonably prompt time frame. The full SACC is found in the university's published Administrative Rules and Procedures (ARP), specically ARP 5.10 and ARP 5.11. While it is essential to refer to the detailed governing rules in the ARP, the process is summarized as follows: An institution-wide Academic Conduct Ofcer is responsible for processing each case of alleged academic misconduct. The accused student is provided notice of the allegation and has the right to participate during the fact-nding process. The student may contest the investigative ndings or sanction in a formal review before a university Hearing Panel. Either party to the matter has the right to a nal appeal of the results or a Level II sanction to the Ofce of the Provost. The SACC distinguishes between Level I Sanctions and Level II sanctions, depending upon the severity of the offense and other factors. The Level I sanction includes a formal warning. Graduate students' offenses and repeat undergraduate offenses are subject to a Level II sanction,even if less svere. Level II sanctions consist of a notation of academic misconduct on the student's academic transcript. The full policy, examples of academic misconduct, report form and a flowchart of the procedures for resolving alleged student academic misconduct is available at: Policies ARP 5-10 (https://arp.nmsu.edu/5-10/ ) ARP 5-11 (https://arp.nmsu.edu/5-11/ ) of (https://arp.nmsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/ sites/26/2018/01/Appendix-5-11-A.pdf ) Privacy Rights The following information has been designated as directory information and is subject to release to the public under the Buckley Amendment (PL 98-380), \"The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974:\" student's name, class level, college and major, dates of attendance, degree(s) earned, honors and awards, address, telephone number, NMSU email address, Aggie ID number, most recent previous educational institution attended, place of birth, and some information about students involved in recognized activities and sports. Other information regarding disclosure of student data is posted on the University Student Records Ofce website (https://records.nmsu.edu) and in the University Student Records Ofce (USRO), in compliance with the Act. Requests for withholding directory information must be led in writing with the USRO. A student may choose to hide his/her address and phone number from the campus phonebook through the myNMSU portal. This will only hide the information from the public but the records will still be ofcially kept within the USRO. Social Security Numbers in Student Records As required by law, social security numbers are collected from prospective and current students who are either applying for admission to the university or plan to seek employment on campus. The social security number is a condential record and is maintained as such by the university in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. In addition, the university is mandated by federal tax regulations to provide tuition and fee payment information to the student and the Internal Revenue Service so that applicable educational tax credits may be computed. The social security number is required for tax reporting purposes. Change in Demographic Information Students wishing to make a legal name change, citizenship change, social security number update or a gender update can do so through theNew Mexico State University - Do\u00f1a Ana 49 University Student Records Ofce (USRO). All students will need to ll out the \"Demographic Change form\" located at https://records.nmsu.edu/ forms/ and provide one of the following documents to the USRO. Legal name changes will only be processed for students currently enrolled at NMSU or any of its Community Colleges. 1.Legal name change : students will need one legal documentation with the new name on it. This can be a Government Issued ID (drivers license, state card or valid passport), a Birth Certicate, a Court Order, a Marriage Certicate/Divorce Decree or a Certicate of Naturalization/I551 Card. Note: Documentation is not required to add/ delete hyphen, space, apostrophe, or to abbreviate a middle name to initial. 2.Citizenship change: Certicate of Naturalization or I551 card. 3.Social Security Number Update : students will need to provide an original signed Social Security Card. Unsigned cards will not be accepted. 4.Gender Update : students will need to bring a Government Issued ID (drivers license, state ID card or valid passport) and a Revised Birth Certicate Students may update their \"preferred name\", which is the name used in lieu of a student's legal name, on certain documents, such as, the email display name, learning management system, the phonebook, class rosters and advisee lists. This can be done by the student through the myNMSU portal and does not need to be done at the USRO. For more information about the specic documents that are needed please contact the University Student Records Ofce at (575) 646-3411. Changes in Residency Status for Tuition Purposes The University Student Records Ofce (USRO) does not determine the laws and rulings for determining Residency, these are state laws that the USRO simply administers. An individual must establish legal residency in New Mexico before he or she is entitled to pay in-state tuition rates. The student's initial residency status is determined at the time of admission, any changes to this status must be initiated by the student through the USRO. A continuing student, classied as a non-resident, who has satised the requirements to establish residency may submit a Petition for In-State Residency Tuition Classication along with the required supporting documentation to the USRO Ofce. Petitions must be led on or before the third Friday of the semester for which the student is requesting resident tuition. For specic information about the process of petitioning for In-State Residency or for information about who is eligible for residency for tuition purposes please visit the https://records.nmsu.edu/residency/ website or the University Student Records Ofce on the Las Cruces campus. Ofcial Transcripts An ofcial transcript is the University's certied statement of your complete NMSU academic record in chronological order by semester and year. It includes the student's coursework, grades and any degrees that were awarded. Any credit hours earned through transfer work are listed as the equivalent course at NMSU. Grades are not transferred, nor are they used to calculate the NMSU grade point averages. Ofcial transcripts will not be released if the student is in debt to the university.Transcripts can either be ordered in person at the University Student Records Ofce or online at https://records.nmsu.edu/transcripts/, there will be a fee for these that may vary depending on the total number of transcripts ordered and the type of delivery method that is selected. A student can request two types of transcripts an electronic one, which is sent as a secured PDF or a printed hard copy that can be delivered in a sealed envelope. The name that will appear on the student's transcript will match the name on the student's ofcial NMSU record. Name changes will only be processed for students currently enrolled at NMSU or any of its Community Colleges. Purging of Student Files All academic les for students who attend NMSU are kept for ve (5) years following the student's nal term enrolled. Only archival documentation will be retained. The les of students who do not enroll within one year after being admitted are destroyed. Graduation Requirements A student may specify choice of either the current catalog at the time of admittance or a subsequent catalog, provided the selected catalog is not more than six years old when (s)he satises the requirements for graduation. In all other cases, the student will be subject to the current catalog. Students planning to graduate must clear all of their accounts with the DACC Cashiers Ofce. Delinquent accounts due to outstanding balances for tools, books, and personal materials should be cleared in the community college's Cashiers Ofce, located in DASR 102B. Graduation with Honors See the section titled, \" Recognition for Academic Achievement (http:// catalogs.nmsu.edu/nmsu/recognition-academic-achievement/).\" Associate's Degree Associate's degrees are of two types. The academic associate's degree prepares students to transfer to a baccalaureate program and generally includes credits toward the rst two years of a four-year degree. Academic associate's degrees include the Associate of Arts, the Associate of Science, and other named degrees that link to a specic major (the Associate of Education, for example). Other associate degrees, typically called Associate of Applied Science, prepare students for entry into the workforce. Credits for these programs may or may not apply toward a four-year degree. Associate degree-seeking students who are interested in a dual degree should consult with their academic advisor. The Associate of Arts and the Associate of Science degrees cannot be earned together. The Associate of General Studies degree may not be earned with other associate degrees. Students interested in transferring to NMSU or another four-year institution should check the appropriate sections of the university catalog for more information. Requirements for the two-year associate degrees are found in the respective catalogs and sections concerning these degrees. The following requirements apply to all associates degrees: 1.Minimum Credit Hours: a minimum of 60 credits (excluding \"N\" sufx courses). Some programs of study require coursework in excess of the 60 credit-hour minimum.50 Graduation Requirements 2.New Mexico General Education- state mandated general education courses (as specied in General Education section); such courses are designed with a \"G\" a.For Associates credits 3.GPA requirement: Students must have a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or better in all courses taken at NMSU or one of its community colleges. a.For Associates Degrees: students must earn a C- or better in classes they take to meet the Basic Skills requirement (ENGL 1110G and one of several math course options). b.For Applied Associate Degrees: Basic Skills requirements do not apply, but if the student plans to pursue a Bachelor's degree at any point in the future it would be highly recommended. 4.Residency - A minimum of 15 of the 60 credits for the associate's degree must be completed at NMSU or one of its community colleges. Individual academic programs may have additional requirements. 5.Major : All requirements for at least one major eld of study as specied in the college and departmental sections of the respective catalog. Associate Major An associate major, consisting of at least 18 credits, may include courses from more than one department. Requirements for the Associate Majors are specied in the respective Community College Catalogs. Certicate of Completion The Certicate of Completion requires a minimum of 16 credits (other Title IV requirements must be met to be eligible for nancial aid) and has been approved through the academic review process. These courses can be a subset of those required for a corresponding Applied Associates Degree. These certicates are recorded on the student's transcript. Requirements for certicates are found in the respective catalogs and sections concerning these programs. The following requirements apply to all certicates. 1.Minimum Credit Hours : The number of credit hours varies from certicate to certicate. Students must successfully complete the total number of credit hours as outlined in the respective catalogs and sections describing these certicates. 2.GPA requirement: Students must successfully complete all courses for the certicate as outlined in the catalog.

DACC holds commencement exercises at the end of the spring semester in May. Eligible candidates for degrees and certicates are encouraged to participate in the commencement ceremony. Students wishing to participate in spring commencement prior to completing degree requirements in the following summer session should call (575) 527-7530 for specic requirements. Developmental Studies, First Year Experience, and General Education Courses Developmental Studies Mission and Value Statement Our mission is to provide general education and developmental instruction designed to meet individual educational goals and foster lifelong learning. By providing rigorous curriculum through interdisciplinary instruction that honors and recognizes the academic and workforce needs of our diverse community of lifelong learners, the DACC developmental studies programs are student-centered, and encourage students to become risk-taking and self-motivated learners.Developmental/First Year Experience Courses Developmental courses are designed to help students acquire the skills and attitudes necessary for college success. Developmental Studies includes English, math, reading, language, and study skills. Developmental Math and English are identied by an \"N\" that appears after the course number. Developmental Studies courses are included on the transcript and will be calculated in the academic grade point average, but do not count toward a degree. On the other hand, First Year Experience (FYEX) courses do carry academic credit and are designed to help students acquire the attitudes and strategies necessary for college success. Students' placement in developmental studies courses will be determined by one or more of the following instruments: High School GPA, ACT, SAT, Accuplacer, Math Placement Exam, and locally developed tests or surveys. Students must achieve a C- or better in courses with \"CCD-\" prexes to continue on to the next course. Course descriptions appear near the end of this catalog and are listed by course prex (the letters appearing before a course number). The various prexes represent different areas of study as shown: CCDE: Developmental English CCDM: Developmental Mathematics CCDR: Developmental Reading FYEX: First Year Experience General Education Courses General Education courses at NMSU are state-certied under the model for general education. This model emphasizes the development of ve transferable, essential skills that all college graduates need for success: Communication Critical Thinking Quantitative Reasoning Personal and Social Responsibility Information and Digital Literacy General education courses taught at DACC are lower-division, university- level courses that are the same as those taught at NMSU. They are identied by the \"G\" that appears after the course number. In addition to meeting DACC graduation requirements, they may also be used to meet requirements for bachelor's degree programs at NMSU. DACC students are given priority in enrollment for general education courses taught at all DACC campuses. The priority enrollment period ends two weeks prior to the beginning of each semester or summer session. General Education & Transfer Options Many of the credits earned at Do\u00f1a Ana Community College can be applied toward degrees at New Mexico State University, as well as at other colleges and universities. It must be noted, however, that courses are not automatically accepted for transfer credit, and they frequently must be evaluated by the receiving institution before transfer credit can be given. Because of such uncertainties, it is imperative for students52 General Education considering transferring to another college or university to consult with their academic advisor prior to enrolling in courses at DACC. The menu items on the left, under \"Applying DACC Credit Towards Bachelor's Degree Programs,\" link to information about courses and programs for which there are established transfer agreements. General Education The following core matrix of approved courses are guaranteed to transfer and meet general education requirements at any New Mexico public college or university. The New Mexico General Education Requirements commonly offered at DACC are listed here. For a complete list of all NMSU courses that meet the New Mexico General Education Requirements, consult the current NMSU Undergraduate Catalog. Associates Degree The New Mexico General Education Requirements General Education at NMSU provides all students with a broad foundation and common framework upon which to develop knowledge and skills, social consciousness and respect for self and others, thus enabling them to function responsibly and effectively now and in the future. General education courses at NMSU can be identied by the G sufx. In accordance to state law (Post-Secondary Education Articulation Act) (https://www.srca.nm.gov/parts/title05/05.055.0006.html), the New Mexico Higher Education Department has established a state-wide model for General Education. Within the General Education model, is nine credits of electives that will be determined at an institutional level.

Students will then take an additional course in either Area III or Area IV for 3-4 credits depending on the students selection (i.e. Area III is 4 credits, Area IV is 3 credits). Alternatives for Meeting General Education Requirements (9 credit hour rule) Students taking nine or more credits in a specic subject area, even though the courses are not designated as General Education courses, will have met the general education requirements for that subject area. The courses can meet both major and general education requirements for the degree. For example, a student may complete ARTS 2610 Drawing54 General Education II, ARTS 1240 Design I and ARTS 1250 Design II (9 hours) and thereby satisfy one course from the Area VI: Creative and Fine Arts category even though none of those courses carries a G sufx. Please check with the Center for Academic Advising and Student Support. Transferring Courses Within Degree Programs To facilitate the transfer of courses within certain degree programs, New Mexico colleges and universities have collaborated to develop transferable discipline modules. These are made up of an agreed-upon number of hours and courses. When discipline module courses are taken in addition to the 35-hour general education core, the total number of hours in a transfer module are approximately 64. Student Responsibility in the Transfer Process New Mexico's colleges and universities have collaborated to produce guides to assist students who plan to transfer before completing a program of study. Course modules are designed to help students select courses carefully so that they may transfer with little or no loss of credit. However, planning for effective transfer with maximum efciency is ultimately the student's responsibility. Responsible transfer planning includes early and regular consultation with the intended degree-granting institution to assure that all pre-transfer coursework will meet the requirements of the desired degree. Transfer Credit Appeal Process All New Mexico public post-secondary institutions are required to establish policies for receiving and resolving complaints from students or from other complainants regarding the transfer of coursework from other public institutions in the state. A copy of NMSU's transfer credit policy may be obtained from the University Registrar's Ofce, or from: Deputy Secretary for Academic Affairs Higher Education Dept. 2048 Galisteo St. Santa Fe, NM 87505-2100 Applied Associates Degree The New Mexico General Education Requirements General Education at NMSU provides all students with a broad foundation and common framework upon which to develop knowledge and skills, social consciousness and respect for self and others, thus enabling them to function responsibly and effectively now and in the future.

For example, a student may complete ARTS 2610 Drawing II, ARTS 1240 Design I and ARTS 1250 Design II (9 hours) and thereby satisfy one course from the Area VI: Creative and Fine Arts category even though none of those courses carries a G sufx. Please check with the Center for Academic Advising and Student Support. Applying DACC Credit Toward Bachelor's Degree Programs Many DACC courses may be accepted at NMSU and other New Mexico public colleges and universities. When planning to apply DACC credits toward a bachelor's degree program, it is best to consult with advisors at both DACC and the university that has been selected for continued study. Articulated Programs of Study A DACC program is said to be \"articulated\" when, with adequate planning, a majority of the credits earned in the DACC program may be used to satisfy degree requirements for a baccalaureate degree at another institution. Articulation plans have been developed for the following DACC programs: Any applied associate degree to the Bachelor of Applied Studies offered by the NMSU College of Arts and Sciences Any transfer associate degree to the Bachelor of Individualized Studies offered by the NMSU College of Arts and Sciences Associate of Arts Degree to the NMSU College of Arts and Sciences Associate of Science Degree to the NMSU College of Arts and Sciences Computer- and technology-related associate degree programs to the NMSU Information and Communication Technology bachelor's degree program in the Engineering Technology Department, NMSU College of Engineering Computer- and technology-related associate degree programs to programs leading to the Bachelor of Applied Science in Operations Management and Supervision and the Bachelor of Applied Science in Career and Technical Teacher Education at Western New Mexico University Criminal Justice to the Department of Criminal Justice in the NMSU College of Arts and Sciences Dental Hygiene to the Bachelor of Science in Dental Hygiene at the University of New Mexico Early Childhood Education and Education programs to the NMSU College of Health, Education and Social Transformation General Engineering to bachelor's degree programs in the NMSU College of EngineeringHospitality Services Management to the School of Hotel, Restaurant and Tourism Management in the NMSU College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences Pre-Architecture to the UNM School of Architecture and Planning and to Texas Tech University Pre-Business to the NMSU College of Business Public Health to the Department of Health Science, NMSU College of Health and Social Services Partially Articulated Programs A signicant number of the credits earned in the following associate degree programs at DACC will apply toward meeting bachelor's degree requirements of specied departments at NMSU: Any associate degree in allied health to the Department of Health Science in the NMSU College of Health, Education and Social Transformation Aerospace Technology to the Mechanical Engineering Technology bachelor's degree program in the NMSU College of Engineering Automation and Manufacturing Technology to the Mechanical Engineering Technology bachelor's degree program in the NMSU College of Engineering Business Management to the Department of Agricultural Economics and Agricultural Business in the NMSU College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences Civil/Survey Technology (Drafting and Graphics Technologies Program) to the Civil Engineering Technology bachelor's degree program in the NMSU College of Engineering Computer- and technology-related associate degree programs to the Information Engineering Technology bachelor's degree program in the Department of Engineering Technology, NMSU College of Engineering Creative Media Technology to the Bachelor of Creative Media at the NMSU Creative Media Institute Electronics Technology to the Department of Engineering Technology in the NMSU College of Engineering Hospitality and Tourism to the School of Hospitality, Restaurant, and Tourism Management, NMSU College of Agricultural, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences Mechanical Drafting and Solid Modeling to the Mechanical Engineering Technology bachelor's degree in the NMSU College of Engineering Nursing to the Department of Nursing, NMSU College of Health, Education and Social Transformation Surveying Technology to the Geomatics bachelor's degree program in the NMSU College of Engineering Career Technical Education programs.

NOTE: Students who plan to transfer to another institution should always consult that institution's catalog for the most current information. Common Course Numbering Crosswalk The Post-secondary Education Articulation Act (https://hed.state.nm.us/ resources-for-schools/public_schools/nm-course-numbering- system/ ) charges the New Mexico Higher Education Department withestablishing and maintaining a common course numbering system, in consultation with faculty. To this end, the common course numbering system includes both equivalent (Common) and unique courses. Common Course: is any course that is offered at multiple institutions throughout the state, has the same prex/number combination, the same title, the same description, and at least 80% of the learning outcomes for the course are the same. Unique Course: is any course that is unique to the institution (the NMSU system), has a prex/number combination, title, description and learning outcomes that are unique to the institution (the NMSU System). The table below shows the previous NMSU System-wide course prex/ number combination, the future Common Course Numbering prex/ number combination, and an indicator of whether the course is deemed Common or Unique throughout the state.

It offers some of the highest salaries in the industrial sector, along with ample opportunities for rapid advancement. Automation and manufacturing technicians are responsible for production operation, as well as equipment monitoring,126 Automation and Manufacturing Technology adjustment, maintenance, and repair in both routine and emergency situations. Using modern industrial production equipment, DACC's Automation and Manufacturing Technology program provides training for desirable entry-level positions in electromechanical automated processes, as well as skills upgrading for those already working in the eld. The program encourages the development of problem-solving skills, enabling students to adapt quickly to rapidly changing conditions brought on by automation and new technologies. The program is based on skills standards established for the high-tech manufacturing industry by the American Electronics Association's Workforce Skills Project, among others. Students learn systems interfacing and automation using digital control circuits, programmable logic controllers (PLC), and computer-controlled interfaces. Hands-on preventive and corrective maintenance procedures are taught in modern laboratory facilities using the same state-of-the-art, automated production equipment found in the manufacturing industry. The curriculum includes rst-year DC, AC, digital logic, and solid-state electronic-circuit analysis courses from the Electronics Technology program. Whether taking classes or working on a job site, students enrolled in this program will be required to perform the same job duties and be able to meet the same physical requirements that they will as a graduate in the eld. Depending where they nd employment, graduates may be required to lift and carry 50 pounds safely, to work safely using hand and power tools, to work safely on electrical equipment, to ascend and descend ladders, and to stand, squat, stoop, or kneel for long periods of time.

Dental assistants are people who like helping others, enjoy working closely with patients and other members of the dental team. They tend to like working with their hands. In fact, assistants frequently are relied on as the dentist's \"other set of hands.\" Thus constantly challenging the dental assistant to expand and grow their knowledge and skill sets.208 Dental Assistant There is no lack of variety in the types of tasks that dental assistants perform. They prepare equipment, materials, and instruments for patient care; perform sterilization and disinfection procedures; provide patients with instructions both before and after dental procedures ; create temporary crowns, bleaching trays, custom trays, & custom tted sport mouth guards; provide coronal polishing and fluoride treatments place pit & ssure sealants; take impressions of teeth; take patient vital signs, record or review medical histories and medications; provide individualized oral hygiene instruction for patients and/or parents: create study casts (molds); expose, develop, and mount dental radiographs; anticipate dental provider needs for patient procedure perform a variety of other duties surrounding patient care, infection control, and radiology They may also be responsible for administrative tasks, such as billing, patient verication, scheduling of various types of treatment appointments, ordering and material inventory. Assistants may work in a general-practice ofce where a dentist provides multiple types of treatment, including restorative/operative work (llings), prosthetics (crowns, bridges, and dentures), and perhaps some surgery. They may want to specialize for work in periodontics, oral and maxillofacial surgery, endodontics, pedodontics, or orthodontics. In the state of New Mexico, dental assistants can become certied to perform the following expanded duties: radiology (taking x-rays), coronal polishing (polishing of teeth and removal of stains), fluoride treatments (the act of placing fluoride on a patient's teeth), and sealant placement (used to prevent decay). These certications are obtained through the State Dental Board and are a portion of the Dental Assisting National Board Certication Exam. The Dental Assistant program at DACC is nationally accredited by the American Dental Association, Commission on Dental Program Accreditation. It is also recognized by the New Mexico State Board of Dentistry as a continuing-education provider.

Associate of Applied Science Degree Certicate of Completion The Do\u00f1a Ana Community College Diagnostic Medical Sonography (DMS) Program is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP) upon the recommendation of the Joint Review Committee on Education in Diagnostic Medical Sonography (JRC-DMS). The program's assessment and outcome report can be found on the following https://dacc.nmsu.edu/dms/program-outcomes- assessment-reports/ Sonography is an allied health specialty that uses high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound) to image many structures in the body. Sonographers function as members of the healthcare team by providing and evaluating high quality images that aid physicians in the diagnosis and treatment of their patients. Sonographers are highly motivated, independent, critical thinkers who enjoy one-on-one patient interaction. Employment opportunities are available in a variety of settings, such as hospitals, physicians' ofces, and veterinarian practices. There are also opportunities in sales, education, management, research, marketing, and product development. Because job prospects in the Las Cruces-El Paso area occasionally are limited, it may be necessary to conduct a wider job search. Training involves a combination of academic courses and a clinical internship in the ultrasound department of area hospitals and clinics where students will gain hands-on training under the supervision of registered diagnostic medical sonographers and will work alongside physicians and other health-care professionals. Coursework covers abdominal and OB-Gyn ultrasound, pediatric sonography, acoustic physics and instrumentation, and introductory vascular technology. Students will participate in lab activities and learn to write case reports and journal article reviews. The clinical sites include facilities in Las Cruces, Alamogordo, Ruidoso, and Silver City, New Mexico, as well as El Paso, Texas. The Diagnostic Medical Sonography program offers a certicate track for students who already possess an associate degree in a medically related, allied healthcare program or a bachelor's degree in a related eld. The associate degree track is designed for those who do not meet the entrance requirements for the certicate-track program. Once accepted into the Diagnostic Medical Sonography program the curriculum for certicate and associate degree pathways is identical . Students in the Diagnostic Medical Sonography program are required to complete and pass a variety of background/screening measures that include a security background check, FBI ngerprinting and drug screening, in order to participate in the clinical education portion of the program. Past criminal violations may prevent a student from completing the program and gaining employment in the eld.New Mexico State University - Do\u00f1a Ana 217 Students who satisfy program requirements are qualied to apply for national certication examinations in the specialty areas of Abdominal and OB/GYN Sonography. These examinations are administered by the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonography (ARDMS) and/or the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT). Licensing requirements vary by state; New Mexico requires sonographers to obtain a state license. Continuing education beyond graduation is required to maintain credentials earned by the ARDMS and ARRT; and for maintaining state license in New Mexico. Required Physical and Cognitive Skills Sonography students must be able to do the following: 1.Read, write and communicate effectively in English. 2.Possess emotional and physical health sufcient to meet the demands of the profession. 3.Position, move, and lift patients in wheelchairs and stretchers. 4.Maintain prolonged arm positions necessary for scanning. 5.Position and move ultrasound equipment on wheels (up to 500 lbs.) 6.Effectively operate sonographic equipment. 7.Evaluate sonograms, acquiring appropriate diagnostic information. 8.Integrate diagnostic sonograms, laboratory results, patient histories and medical records, and adapt sonographic examinations as necessary. 9.Use independent judgment to acquire the optimal diagnostic sonographic information in each examination performed. 10.

(For more information, refer to the section titled, \" Dual Credit Program (p. 13),\" within this catalog.) Pre-Architecture Program Overview Students planning to pursue a professional career in architecture may nd it more convenient and economically advantageous to begin their studies closer to home. The DACC Pre-Architecture program, which culminates in an associate of applied science degree, consists roughly of the rst two years of a standard, bachelor's degree curriculum in architecture. Currently, the most popular transfer universities for DACC Pre-Architecture students are the University of New Mexico and Texas Tech University. Both offer in-state tuition rates and have signed articulation agreements with DACC providing for the smooth and efcient transfer of credits. However, acceptance into a transfer university's architecture program is not automatic nor is it guaranteed. Students must follow the regular application procedures of the chosen university. In addition, DACC cannot guarantee placement into a transfer university's architecture program at any particular level, as such matters are totally dependent on how the university in question may evaluate transcripts, portfolios and other required materials against its own acceptance criteria. For example, in order to be accepted at UNM, a nal grade of B- or better is required in ARCH 1120 Introduction to Architecture and ARCH 1110 Architectural Drawing, and a nal grade of C- or better is required in all other courses in the DACC Pre-Architecture curriculum. Potential architecture students should contact a Pre-Architecture advisor at DACC for assistance with course scheduling and transfer procedures (575) 527-7592. Students in the Pre-Architecture Program are required to purchase a windows-based computer or laptop with a webcam and microphone, at an approximate cost of $1,200, that is capable of running the software packages utilized in the program. For minimum computer or laptop technical specications and requirements, students should contact the department. Drafting and Design Technologies students are also required to have and maintain reliable broad-band internet access. In addition to required textbooks, Pre-Architecture students should also expect topurchase drawings tools, model-making materials, and other art-related supplies at an approximate cost of $200 per semester on average. Credit Transfer to Bachelor's Degrees in Engineering Technology or Geomatics at NMSU The Architectural Technology, Civil/Survey Technology, Mechanical Drafting and Solid Modeling, and Surveying Technology associate degree programs include courses that allow students to earn credits that may be transferable into one of the engineering technology or geomatics programs offered by NMSU. These courses allow students to maximize the number of credits applicable to an NMSU Engineering Technology or geomatics program, while also making it possible to earn an associate degree for immediate employment in a drafting related eld. Students should contact a Drafting and Design Technologies program advisor for the most current information and requirements related to these credit transfer opportunities (575) 527-7592. Additional Program Information Students in the Drafting and Design Technologies options or Pre- Architecture program receive training from highly qualied faculty through online instruction and/or in modern classrooms and laboratories equipped with the latest in computers, peripheral equipment, and professional software. The Drafting and Design Technologies program is housed at the DACC East Mesa Campus (see map (https:// dacc.nmsu.edu/marketing/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/09/Map- to-East-Mesa.pdf )). Classes are scheduled during the day and evening hours, as well as during the summer, to serve both full- and part-time students, including local high school students who are participating in the dual credit enrollment program. Courses are available at the various DACC locations, as well as selected high schools in the area. In the case of the Drafting and Design Technologies options, the majority of classes are delivered online, allowing the students to pursue a certicate of completion or degree through distance education.

People's lives often depend on the quick reaction and competent care of emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics. Emergency medical services (EMS) professionals may work at any of four different levels: First responder, EMT - basic, EMT - intermediate, and paramedic. Upon successful completion of training, students are eligible for employment in many types of emergency medical systems nationwide in re departments, municipal services, private ambulance services, federal services, industry, hospital emergency departments, and hospital-based ambulance systems. The demand for EMS professionals is increasing. DACC offers all levels of EMS education, as well as an opportunity to earn an associate of applied science degree at the paramedic level. Successful completion of an EMS program will allow for certication/licensure testing at the state and national level. At each EMS program level, students gain additional knowledge and skills to enable them to function in the clinical and eld settings with nurses, physicians, and other healthcare professionals. In classes, students learn about anatomy and physiology, the pathophysiology of diseases, traumatic injuries, pharmacology, and cardiac care. Students acquire skills through laboratory practice, clinical experience in hospitals, and eld experience with ambulance services throughout the state. Students may be scheduled at a variety of clinical and eld sites which include areas outside Las Cruces. Program Accreditation The Emergency Medical Services Program is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (www.caahep.org (http://www.caahep.org)) upon the recommendation of the Committee on Accreditation of Educational Programs for the Emergency Medical Services Profession (CoAEMSP).

Fire Science Technology Associate of Applied Science Degree Certicate of Completion: Basic Fireghter (575) 528-7321 Every year, re and other emergencies take thousands of lives and destroy property worth billions of dollars. Fireghters help protect the public against these dangers. They are frequently the rst emergency personnel at the scene of a trafc accident or medical emergency and may be called upon to put out a re, treat injuries, or perform other vital functions. Employment of reghters is expected to grow about as fast as the average for all occupations. According to the United States Fire Administration, nearly 70 percent of re companies are staffed by volunteer reghters. Most job growth will occur as volunteer re-ghting positions are converted to paid positions. In addition to job growth, openings are expected to result from the need to replace reghters who retire, stop working for other reasons, or transfer to other emergency service entities. Do\u00f1a Ana Community College provides training for reghting personnel through its Fire Science Technology program, which is accredited by the International Fire Service Accreditation Congress (IFSAC). Students will receive training in the basic concepts of reghting and will participate in live evolution that will give them real experience in the reghting career eld.

Regardless of industry trends and forecasts, one thing remains certain\u2014engineers are an essential component to developing new ideas, and furthering the many elds of engineering. From mechanical engineering to environmental engineering, to civil engineering, thereis opportunity for graduates to put their professional practice where passion lies. If a student has thought about the eld of engineering or any of its many subelds as a career, an associate degree can be a good starting point to pursue higher education. Within an associate's degree program, students become familiar with the many subelds of engineering, allowing them to identify where their specic professional interests lie when they progress to a four-year institution. The small classes at DACC result in a student/instructor ratio that allows personal interaction, which strengthens the educational process. This is particularly a great benet in higher levels of math and science courses. Community colleges have a higher retention rate and success rate. In addition, the cost of attending a community college for the rst two years greatly reduces the cost of an engineering degree. The General Engineering degree is designed to provide students a set of courses that will articulate into the four-year engineering programs at New Mexico State University, the University of New Mexico, and New Mexico Tech as well as the Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology at New Mexico State University. This program will make available to a far wider range of students the ability to pursue their dreams of becoming engineers. Within the program, they will learn the business aspects of engineering, a foundation of what it takes to be successful in the eld and the trends in a growing, energy-conscience market. Once students have completed the associate's degree, they are well on their way to a bachelor's degree program in their selected eld. The individual students must work closely with an Advisor to select the best options for successful transition to the four-year institution of their choice. For high school students who are interested in a career in engineering, courses in mathematics and science are essential.

Every new home, hospital, university building, shopping mall, or ofce complex requires installation mechanics, service technicians, operating engineers, maintenance foremen, and trained crews to keep complex environmental systems operating efciently. The heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration industry is one of the country's most stable. The supply of qualied, trained people has not kept pace with the demand, and new opportunities are constantly developing. The demand for trained HVAC/R graduates is also increasing due to Environmental Protection Agency requirements that refrigerants be handled by a certied technician. Technicians knowledgeable in heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration are also needed in defense, space exploration, and manufacturing. Because climate control is important wherever microprocessors are used in manufacturing or scientic research, skilled technicians are in demand in these elds. Many experienced technicians own and manage their own businesses. The Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration program at DACC uses training facilities equipped with the most modern test equipment and tools available. As a student, you will learn to\u2014 service, repair, and maintain heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration systems; read and interpret technical drawings, schematics, and symbols to diagnose and troubleshoot problems in a system; evaluate, diagnose, and service various mechanical and electrical controls; apply the mathematics related to the heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration trade; handle customer relations, shop management procedures, and record keeping relative to the trade; properly use special tools and testing equipment; and become certied in Section 608, EPA Certication. Students will complete a one-credit Job Shadowing course during their rst semester that will allow the student the opportunity to see rsthand the daily activities of a HVAC technician. A unique practicum training program is offered during the nal semester to provide students with eld experiences. Working side by side with journeymen technicians, students are offered an opportunity to practice and rene their new skills. After the rst semester, full-time heating, air conditioning, and refrigeration students must purchase a personal set of technician's tools (approximate cost, which may vary, $1300). The tool set includes the basic tools that most employers require on the job. Part-time students will purchase only those tools required by the specic course(s) in which they are enrolled. Students must also purchase an iPad at theapproximate cost of $400 that will be used to access course materials and document completion of course competencies. Students will also provide their own medical/accident insurance. They need to be in good physical condition and possess the ability and desire to work with their minds and hands. The curriculum is competency and performance based and uses multimedia classroom instruction and hands-on laboratory exercises. Classroom and laboratory hours are listed in the Schedule of Classes.

Job prospects in the Las Cruces/El Paso area are occasionally limited, but nationwide there is faster-than-average job growth with many opportunities for persons seeking entry-level positions. Students in the Radiologic Technology program receive training both in the classroom and in clinical settings, where they work alongside nurses, physicians, and other health-care professionals. In the classroom, students learn about the anatomy and function of the human body, radiographic physics and equipment, and radiographic procedures. Students acquire skills in radiation protection for the patient and for the health professional. Laboratory activities teach the proper positioning of an injured or ill patient. Clinical work offers students training in diagnostic radiology and introduces the student to various other imaging modalities. The clinical work is offered in Las Cruces, T or C, Alamogordo, Artesia, Carlsbad, Deming, Ruidoso, Silver City, and El Paso. Graduates of the program are eligible to take (and must pass) the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT) national certication exam in order to obtain employment in this eld.

Respiratory Therapy practitioners work side-by-side with physicians, and other healthcare professionals in the hospital setting. They set up oxygen, perform pulmonary function testing, set up and maintain ventilators, administer respiratory drugs, and evaluate patient health status. Respiratory therapy is a rapidly growing, people-oriented profession. The demand for practitioners is increasing in New Mexico and throughout the United States. While most graduates continue to nd employment in hospitals, opportunities are opening up with medical equipment suppliers and agencies providing home health care to pulmonary patients. The Respiratory Therapy program at Do\u00f1a Ana Community College is a full-time program that leads to an associate of applied science degree. Through classroom instruction and laboratory practice, students develop the knowledge needed to care for patients. They acquire additional hands-on experience in the clinical setting at surrounding hospitals. The curriculum and clinical hour content is based on the National Standard Curriculum from the American Association of Respiratory Therapy (AARC) and the national accrediting body, the Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care. Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care (CoARC) 1228 (http://www.coarc.com) The Respiratory Therapy Program is also accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care. The program is designed to prepare students to have mastered competency in assessment, diagnosis and treatment of the cardiopulmonary patient. Upon completion of the program graduates are eligible to sit for their national licensure certication and registry examinations. Required Skills and Abilities Students should be able to demonstrate good oral expression (speech clarity) and written comprehension, critical thinking skills, the ability to hear through a stethoscope or augmented listening device, and physical stamina (e.g., the ability to stand for long periods of time, manipulate342 Respiratory Therapy respiratory therapy equipment, and move/lift patients and equipment up to 50 pounds, unassisted).

Graduates of this program have found work in New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, Arizona, California, Vermont, New Hampshire, Iraq, and Puerto Rico. More than 400 graduates have begun careers in the water eld, working in such diverse areas as the semiconductor industry, the food processing industry, aerospace industry, electrical power industry, city water and wastewater departments, municipal or contract analytical laboratories, water reuse or recycling plants, metal plating companies, engineering consulting rms, and state planning ofces. While jobs are widely available, training programs like this one are rare. As the treatment of water becomes more technical, municipalities and industries rely on training programs to ll their needs. Students in this program learn how to clean water to make it safe for drinking and how to purify water to a high quality for use in computer chip manufacturing, food processing, or steam generation. They will also learn how to treat wastewater so it can be safely returned to the environment or reclaimed for benecial use. Instruction also includes maintaining equipment such as pumps, motors, valves, and chemical feeders; laboratory testing and analysis; water and wastewater chemistry and microbiology; applied math; and some basics of supervising and managing a water utility, including budgets, preventive maintenance schemes, and billing. Various course assignments requiring laboratory data sheets, simple process control spreadsheets, and term papers enable students to sharpen their computer and writing skills. General studies in basic algebra, speech, and technical writing round out the curriculum. Whether taking classes or working on a job site, students enrolled in this program will be required to perform the same job duties and be able to meet the same physical requirements that they will as graduates in the eld. Depending where they nd employment, graduates may be required to work in inclement weather, lift up to 50 pounds from the ground, work safely around hazardous chemicals using appropriate safety equipment such as a self-contained breathing apparatus, work safely in conned spaces, ascend and descend stairs and ladders to reach equipment, work safely around heavy equipment, work safely and effectively on uneven surfaces, and stand for long periods of time on concrete floors. Some positions in the eld require certication and the licensing agency may not provide special testing accommodations. Opportunities for students to gain new knowledge and skills in operations, maintenance, and laboratory areas are provided through classroom training, hands-on laboratories, eld trips, guest lectures, and training on the program's own water and wastewater plants. Before graduating, students will spend a minimum of 180 hours at an internship site with a municipality or industry. Students have found co- ops at water and wastewater plants and laboratories in Albuquerque, El Paso, Las Cruces, Socorro, Hobbs, Silver City, Mesilla, and Glorieta, and with industries such as Intel and Kurita America. Financial aid beyond loans, grants, work-study monies, and DACC scholarships include nine private scholarships specically for Water Technology students:346 Water Technology 1.Max Summerlot Memorial Scholarship, given to a water technology student in his or her second year in the program; 2.Cynthia Hiers-Robinson Current-Use Scholarship; 3.Pruett Raymond Madson Memorial Scholarship 5.two scholarships presented by the New Mexico Water and Wastewater Association; 6.two scholarships presented by the Southwest Section of the New Mexico Water and Wastewater Association; and 7.one scholarship presented by the Central Section of the New Mexico Water and Wastewater Association.

Advanced Welder Associate of Applied Science Degree Certicate of Completion Welders are in greater demand today than at any time during the past 30 years, and the job outlook is expected to remain excellent throughout the foreseeable future. They are needed in energy exploration and production and are required in virtually every eld or industry that uses parts made of metal. Simply stated, welders are people who join metals such as steel, stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, brass, bronze, copper, and nickel. Welding processes vary depending on the application. Extremely delicate and precise items, such as aerospace components and jewelry, may be welded using electron beams, lasers, and plasma, while huge structures for buildings and bridges are typically welded using submerged arc and flux core. Welding may take place in almost any setting: in a laboratory,New Mexico State University - Do\u00f1a Ana 351 out-of-doors, or even underwater, as in the case of offshore, oil-and-gas platform construction. According to the US Department of Labor, job prospects for welders are excellent, with comparable projected job growth in New Mexico. Increases in welder wages have kept pace with or exceeded those of other occupations since 2002. The DACC Welding Technology program is nationally accredited by the American Welding Society (AWS), and is taught by nationally qualied instructors. DACC welding instructors have extensive welding experience (nuclear, pressure vessels, aerospace, etc.), numeous welding certications (SMAW, GTAW, GMAW, FCAW, SAW), and extensive experience teaching welding technology. Several DACC welding instructors are AWS Certied Welding Educators (CWE). several of which are also AWS Certied Welding Inspectors (CWI). The DACC Welding Technology program performs hundreds of welder performance qualication tests every year. DACC welding instructors hold AWS national endorsements for multiple welding/fabrication codes. The program is competency and performance based, consisting of lectures and hands-on laboratory exercises. Students learn to weld steels, stainless steels, and aluminum alloy plate and pipe with ve welding processes. They also learn basic fabrication skills, oxy-fuel cutting, plasma cutting, and air-carbon arc cutting. The DACC Welding Technology Program is one of a handful of programs, nationwide, that has an orbital TIG unit that allows students to join tubing as small as one-quarter inch in diameter. Students are also exposed to heat treating of steel and its effects with a heat-treating oven. Students are eligible to join SkillsUSA, an organization for high school and post-secondary students that promotes leadership and sponsors skills and leadership competitions at the state and national levels. In addition, students may become members of the American Welding Society (AWS) and participate in the activities of the new AWS El Paso Section. All students who complete the certicate or associate degree will graduate as certied welders in one or more welding processes on steel, stainless steel, and/or aluminum. (It is important to note that, although some local welding jobs may not currently require certication, nearly all welding jobs nationwide do require it.) DACC welding instructors are well known nationally and have many job contacts in the United States. Since the technical requirements for the certicate are the same as those for the associate degree, a student may complete the certicate program rst and then later apply all the credits earned in the certicate program toward the associate degree. This associate degree then may be applied in its entirety toward the bachelor of applied studies degree offered by NMSU. Alternatively, those planning to teach at the secondary level may apply up to 36 credits earned in the Welding Technology associate degree program toward a bachelor of science degree in Agricultural and Extension Education. To enter the Welding Technology program, a high school diploma or GED is required, along with good overall health, eyesight, and hand- eye coordination. Students must purchase tools and personal safety equipment, usually costing about $750. Whether taking classes or working on a job site, students enrolled in this program will be required to perform the same job duties and meet the same physical requirements that they will as a graduate in the eld. These requirements include the ability to achieve performancequalications using a variety or processes while welding materials in different positions. Depending where they nd employment, graduates may be required to work in extreme temperatures, to lift and safely move 50 pounds, to have good eye-hand coordination, to work safely around compressed gasses and electrical equipment, to ascend and descend ladders, to work safely in conned spaces and awkward welding positions, and to tolerate a noisy working environment. NOTE: Students must receive a nal grade of C- or better in all required WELD courses/Technical Requirements and achieve a cumulative grade-point average of at least 2.0. A grade of C- or better is required in ENGL 1110G Composition I and designated Mathematics courses.

Student Handbook The NMSU-DACC Student Handbook is divided into the six sections whose titles appear in the menu on the left under \"Student Handbook.\" Questions concerning the policies and procedures in this handbook should be directed to: Ofce of the Vice President for Student Services Do\u00f1a Ana Community College 2800 Sonoma Ranch Blvd. Las Cruces, NM 88011-1656 (575) 527-7530Policies in the NMSU-DACC Student Handbook are subject to change. Student Social Code of Conduct PART 1: INTRODUCTION The Student Social Code of Conduct (SSCC) is authorized by the Regents of New Mexico State University (NMSU) as set forth in the Regents Policy Manual (RPM) 5.20. Rules 5.20 through 5.26 of the Administrative Rules and Procedures of NMSU (ARP) collectively constitute the SSCC, which claries student rights and responsibilities, and the role of Student Life, overseen by the Dean of Students. Academic misconduct (e.g. cheating on an exam, plagiarism) is outside the purview of the SSCC and is governed by ARP 5.10 and 5.11 (the Student Academic Code of Conduct (SACC). The Dean of Students oversees student conduct matters for the NMSU system, including its community colleges, through the NMSU vice- president for student success. Any requirement to be fullled by the department of the Dean of Students under the SSCC may be addressed by the dean of students, or dean of student's designee at any campus. The SSCC establishes core values which support the standards of social conduct expected of NMSU Students. Violations of the standards, when proven by a preponderance of the evidence, will result in a consequence commensurate with the nature of the violation, and the severity of the resulting harm or level of risk of harm created. The SSCC also establishes procedures for: 1) reporting suspected or observed misconduct, 2) fact nding, 3) educational conferences, 4) issuance of Charge, and 5) hearings, sanctions and appeals. The SSCC is organized as follows: 5.20 SSCC - Overview of Student Social Code of Conduct (SSCC) PART 1: INTRODUCTION PART 2: CORE VALUES PART 3: DEFINITIONS AND ROLES PART 4: ADMINISTRATION OF SSCC 5.21 SSCC - Student Rights and Responsibilities 5.22 SSCC Conduct Standards 5.23 SSCC - Interim Measures 5.24 SSCC - Amnesty for Emergency Reporting PART 1: PURPOSE PART 2: REPORTING RESPONSIBILITIES PART 3: SITUATIONS JUSTIFYING GRANT OF AMNESTY PART 4: AMNESTY CONDITIONED UPON COMPLIANCE PART 5: LIMITATIONS ON GRANT OF AMNESTY 5.25 SSCC - Consequences for Violation PART 1: STUDENT CONDUCT RECORD PART 2: TYPES OF SANCTIONS PART 3: GUIDELINES FOR IMPOSING SANCTIONS PART 4: PETITION FOR RELIEF FROM INDEFINITE SANCTION 5.26 SSCC - Conduct Case Procedures PART I: GENERAL GUIDANCE572 Student Social Code of Conduct PART 2: CASE INITIATION PART 3: EDUCATIONAL CONFERENCE PART 4: ASSESSMENT OF FACTS; ISSUANCE OF FORMAL CHARGE PART 5: PRE-HEARING PROCEDURES PART 6: HEARING PROCEDURES PART 7: SANCTIONING CONFERENCE IN 3.25 CASES (DISCRIMINATION AND TITLE IX) PART 8: APPEAL PROCEDURES PART 2: CORE VALUES The core values that underpin the social conduct standards set forth in ARP 5.22 are as follows: 1.Community : NMSU Students welcome all individuals into their academic and social activities to enhance the learning and social environments. 2.Integrity : NMSU Students exemplify honesty, honor and a respect for the truth in all of their actions. 3.Social Justice : NMSU Students recognize the dignity of every person, anticipating and appreciating how their decisions and actions may have an impact on others. NMSU Students are just and equitable in their treatment of all members of the community, and take action to discourage and challenge others who may seek to harm or diminish the worth of others. 4.Respect : NMSU Students show consideration and positive regard for each other and for members of the community, through their words and actions. 5.Responsibility : NMSU Students accept responsibility for their own conduct and its impact upon self, others and the community, seeking guidance and assistance as necessary and appropriate. PART 3: DEFINITIONS AND ROLES Terms dened for purposes of the SSCC are capitalized throughout the SSCC, to denote such dened status. 1.Appeal Ofcer : The individual who decides whether to accept a Respondent's or Complainant's appeal from a Hearing Ofcer's decision and imposition of Sanctions, and if accepted, reviews the hearing record, the appeal petition and any response to the petition, and issues a decision regarding the appeal. The Appeal Ofcer cannot have been directly involved in the investigation, the decision to initiate a charge or the original determination by the Hearing Ofcer. For NMSU's Las Cruces campus, Student Life's vice president for student success or designee serves as Appeal Ofcer. For the community colleges, each campus president or designee serves as Appeal Ofcer. In the event these ofcials are not available to serve (e.g. scheduling conflict, conflict of interest, lack of objectivity due to prior involvement), the provost and senior vice president for academic affairs or designee will serve as Appeal Ofcer. 2.Case Administrator : The individual designated to facilitate the SSCC process, and who is not eligible to serve as either Hearing Ofcer or Appeal Ofcer. The Case Administrators from the community colleges work in coordination with the Dean of Students. The dean of students designates the Case Administrators, and may also elect to serve in this role. 3.Charge : A formal written notication to a Respondent 1) informing them that they are the subject of an SSCC conduct investigation, 2) describing the misconduct they are alleged to have committed or participated in, and 3) describing the provisions of the SSCCthe alleged conduct violates and the likely sanction, should such allegation be proven or admitted to by Respondent. 4.Complainant (aka Reporter): A person who submits a complaint or report to the Dean of Students, or other appropriate NMSU employee, indicating that a student may have violated the SSCC Conduct Standards and/or who asserts injury, damage or loss (to person, property, or reputation) as a result of a student's alleged behavior. 5.Day: A business day, dened as Monday through Friday 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., except for those days designated as ofcial NMSU holidays or subject to an ofcial university closure. 6.Dean of Students : In upper case, \"Dean of Students\" denotes the NMSU department headed by the dean of students (located on the 2nd floor of the Corbett Center Student Union Building), which is a component of the Student Life Division.

See ARP 5.26 (http://arp.nmsu.edu/5-26/ ) Part 4. 8.Hearing Ofcer : An NMSU employee or agent, other than the Case Administrator, who conducts the fact-nding hearing in non-3.25 cases conduct cases, and renders a determination based on a preponderance of the evidence. Upon a nding of responsibility for a violation of the SSCC by OIE in a 3.25 case, or a determination by the Hearing Ofcer in a non-3.25 case, the Hearing Ofcer imposes an appropriate Sanction. The dean of students appoints the Hearing Ofcer or may serve as the Hearing Ofcer. 9.Interim Measures : Individualized services or resources offered to or required for parties involved in a conduct case, including both supportive and temporary protective measures. (See ARP 5.23 - Interim Measures ) 10. Investigate/tion: The follow through on an alleged SSCC violation to ascertain the facts related to the alleged details and circumstances. Investigations may be a part of an Educational Conference, may result in additional charges, or may result in dismissal of the SSCC case. This determination is made at the sole discretion of the Dean of Students and/or designee. 11. Notice : A written communication which may be delivered in person, by U.S. mail, or through secure electronic transmission to or from the addressee's ofcial NMSU email account.

The Support Advisor may consult with and advise the Student at any time during the course of the relevant meeting or outside the meeting. The Support Advisor may raise legitimate objections to questions during an investigatory interview or hearing, but may not answer questions on behalf of the Student or unreasonably delay or interfere with the proceeding. 22. Title IX : Title IX refers to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and its implementing regulation at 34 C.F.R. Part 106. This federal law prohibits the exclusion of any person from participating in or from receiving benets of, or any discrimination in, educational programs or activities, based on their (See RPM 3.25 - Equal Opportunity and Prohibition of Unlawful Discrimination, ARP 3.25- Discrimination, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct on Campus (http://arp.nmsu.edu/3-25/ )). PART 4: ADMINISTRATION OF SSCC 1.Authority of Dean of Students : Before initiating a conduct case, the Dean of Students will determine whether the allegations of misconduct fall within the Dean of Students' authority. The Dean of Students (or community college designee), has authority to open and pursue conduct cases, including conducting or directing investigations, educational conferences, assessment of facts and sanctions, pre-hearing tasks and hearings including the imposition of sanctions, under these circumstances: a.Alleged Student misconduct occurs on NMSU Property; or b.Alleged Student misconduct has a substantial nexus with NMSU Property or a substantial impact on a member of the University Community. Such an impact is recognized when the misconduct: i.substantially interferes with or causes substantial harm to the NMSU mission, its nances, or reputation; ii.occurs at or in connection with an NMSU sponsored event;iii.involves an NMSU ofcial or volunteer acting in their ofcial capacity; or iv.creates a threat to the safety and security of NMSU property or any member of the NMSU Community. c.The alleged misconduct rst came to the attention of NMSU within the prior one year period; however, in the case of serious misconduct, the vice president of student success and the OIE Director may grant permission for a conduct case to be initiated after the one year time period has expired. 2.Concurrent NMSU Disciplinary Proceedings: Based on a Student's role within the NMSU Community, the Student may be subject to more than one set of conduct standards and consequences for the same misconduct. Examples of dual or multiple roles students may have include that of a campus resident, student athlete, member of ROTC or other student organizations, enrollment in dual credit courses or Early College High School. The various rules and processes related to each of these roles apply independently from the SSCC, and may occur concurrently; the outcome of one may or may not affect the outcome of the other process. 3.Concurrent SSCC Cases and Court Proceedings: Misconduct under this SSCC may result in proceedings under both the SSCC and civil or criminal law. Generally, an SSCC conduct case proceeds without regard to the pendency or status of any criminal investigation or other legal proceedings. Determinations made or sanctions imposed as a part of an SSCC process shall not be subject to change because criminal charges were dismissed, reduced, or resolved in favor of or against the criminal law defendant. Academic Code of Conduct Student Academic Code of Conduct Section 2 The Student Academic Code of Conduct (SACC), applicable to both undergraduate and graduate students, provides procedures for the review and resolution of alleged or suspected academic misconduct within a reasonably prompt time frame. The full SACC is found in the university's published Administrative Rules and Procedures (ARP), specically ARP 5.10 and ARP 5.11. While it is important to refer to the detailed governing rules in the ARP, the process is summarized as follows: An institution-wide Academic Conduct Ofcer is responsible for processing each case of alleged academic misconduct. The accused student is provided notice of the allegation and has the right to participate during the fact nding process. The student may contest the investigative ndings or sanction before a neutral third party hearing panel member. Either party to the matter has the right to a nal appeal of the ndings or a Level II sanction to the Ofce of the Provost. The SACC distinguishes between Level I Sanctions and Level II sanctions, depending upon the severity of the offense and other factors. The Level 1 sanction includes a formal warning. Offenses by graduate students and repeat offenses, even if less serious are subject to a Level II Sanction. Level II sanctions include a notation of academic misconduct on the student's academic transcript. The full policy, examples of academic misconduct, report form and a flowchart of the procedures for resolving alleged student academic misconduct is available at:574 Grievance Procedures Policies ARP 5-10 (https://arp.nmsu.edu/5-10/ ) ARP 5-11 (https://arp.nmsu.edu/5-11/ ) Examples of ) Grievance Procedures NMSU Policy 5.05 - Student Grievance Procedures PART 1: SCOPE AND PURPOSE This rule applies throughout the NMSU System. Any undergraduate or graduate student who believes that they have been treated unjustly by an NMSU process or person may seek redress through the appropriate university process. If there is a specic policy or rule applicable to the subject matter of the student's concern, grievance or complaint (hereinafter \"grievance\"), that policy or rule and its procedures will govern. This rule provides general principles governing student grievances (Part 2); identies the areas where a specic grievance process is available to the student (Part 3); and sets forth a general student non-academic grievance procedure to govern when no specic grievance resolution process applies (Part 4). If unsure about which process applies to a particular situation, students may obtain guidance from the dean of students or designee in the ofce of Student Life. PART 2: GENERAL PRINCIPLES APPLICABLE TO ALL STUDENT GRIEVANCES Unless in direct conflict with a specic provision in the other rules cited in Part 3, which provide distinct procedures for resolving certain types of student grievances, the following general principles apply: 1.Day: When used in this rule, a day means a university business day, Monday through Friday (8:00 am to 5:00 pm), excluding ofcial NMSU holidays and closures. 2.Ofcial Correspondence : Communications relating to grievances may be delivered in person, via email using the ofcial NMSU email account, or by U.S. mail to the address maintained in ofcial NMSU records. 3.Impartiality of Fact Finders and Decision Makers: Grievances will be investigated and resolved professionally by an objective individual not directly involved in the matter. When a conflict of interest or other type of bias is alleged, senior administration will assist to recommend or take action to ensure the appointment of an impartial decision maker. 4.Legal Representation : The purpose of this rule is to allow the parties to resolve grievances at the lowest administrative level in a fair andexpeditious manner, without the need for legal counsel. Grievance proceedings at NMSU are not legal proceedings and formal rules of evidence are not applicable. If any party, including the university, elects to utilize legal counsel, the attorneys may attend any meeting or proceeding to advise their client, but must not actively participate in the hearing or speak for the client. 5.Non-Retaliation : Students will not be treated adversely for having led a grievance or participated in the grievance resolution process. Claims of retaliation will be taken seriously and investigated promptly outside of the grievance process. If retaliation is substantiated, appropriate disciplinary action will be taken. 6.Prompt Resolution : The time required to resolve a grievance will vary depending upon the nature of the claim and the extent of investigation required. The grievance resolution procedures identied in Part 3 include time deadlines which apply for that process. Grievances led pursuant to the general student non-academic grievance process set forth in Part 4 below should be nally resolved within sixty (60) Days of the rst formal ling, including the appeal process, without extenuating circumstances and notice thereof. 7.Retention of Student Grievance Records: Documentation relating to student grievances will be maintained by the dean of students or designee within the ofce of Student Life, or by the ofcial(s) responsible for administration of the grievance procedures identied in Part 3, with notication to the dean of students, for a minimum of the records retention period required by New Mexico law and regulations (NMAC 1.21.2.1 et seq), and no sooner than three years from the ling of the grievance, as required by NMAC 5.99.1.19 B. The documentation maintained must include a copy of the grievance and any records reflecting the processing of the grievance. PART 3: PROCEDURES FOR SPECIFIC TYPES OF STUDENT GRIEVANCES Students, faculty and staff are directed to the following rules which provide distinct procedures for the resolution of certain types of grievances. 1.Academic Appeals : If a student's grievance involves dissatisfaction with a grade assigned by an instructor or other concern in the academic environment, the governing rules are ARP 5.13 (for undergraduate courses) or ARP 5.14 (for graduate courses). See ARP 5.13 - Review of Undergraduate Student Academic Grievances (Grade Appeals); ARP 5.14 - Review of Graduate Student Academic Grievances (Grade Appeals) 2.Reporting Cheating or Other Breach of Academic Integrity: If a student wishes to report suspected cheating or other breach of academic integrity, the governing rules are ARP 5.10 and 5.11. See ARP 5.10 - Student Academic Code of Conduct - Academic Integrity and ARP 5.11 - Procedures to Respond to Allegations of Student Academic Misconduct 3.All forms of Discriminatory Misconduct: If a student's grievance involves any type of illegal discrimination, ARP 3.25 governs RPM 3.25, Equal Opportunity and Prohibition of Unlawful Discrimination; ARP 3.25 - Discrimination, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct on Campus . Complaints by students or by third parties alleging or reporting unlawful discrimination must be reported to the Ofce of Institutional Equity at:O'Loughlin Mexico State University - Do\u00f1a Ana 575 Title IX and Section 504 Coordinator: Laura Accommodations: If a student's grievance relates to a request for reasonable accommodations based on disability, ARP 3.40 and the operational procedures of Student Accessibility Services govern. See ARP 3.40 - Process for Disability Accommodation; ARP 3.25 - Discrimination, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct on Campus. 5.Service Animal or ESA Issues: If a student's grievance relates to use of a Service Animal or an Emotional Support Animal, ARP 3.45 and 3.25 are the governing rules ARP 3.45 - Assistive, Service, and Companion Animals on University Premises; ARP 25 - Discrimination, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct on Campus. 6.Bullying, Hazing or Non-Discriminatory Hostile Misconduct: If a student's grievance involves bullying, hazing or other non- discriminatory hostile misconduct, ARP 3.80 applies ARP 3.80 - Prohibition of Bullying, Hazing and Hostile Misconduct (Non- Discriminatory). 7.Student Conduct Complaints : If a student has a complaint about other general misconduct or social behavior by another student or student organization, ARP 5.20 governs. See ARP 5.20 - Student Social Code of Conduct 8.Intellectual Property Complaints: If a student's grievance involves a dispute over ownership of intellectual property, ARP 11.05 applies ARP 11.05 - Intellectual Property Management and Commercialization. 9.Employee Grievances: If a student also serves in an employee capacity, the university's HR rules will govern. See https:// www.arp.nmsu.edu (https://www.arp.nmsu.edu/) 10. Grievances by NMSU Students Residing outside of New Mexico: In addition to the other grievance procedures set forth in this rule, NMSU Students enrolled in courses on-line who reside in a state participating in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA) may obtain an additional review of their grievance from the New Mexico SARA Portal Entity. SARA is an agreement among member states, districts and territories that sets national standards for interstate offering of postsecondary distance education courses and programs and allows students to benet from educational services across state lines. (http://www.hed.state.nm.us/students/ nc-sara.aspx). Appeals to the SARA Portal are subject to the following: a.Grievances alleging false or misleading information relating to the accuracy of institutional or program accreditation status, tuition and fee expenses, course transfer information, requirements to meet professional licensure requirements or other institutional representation that are not resolved by NMSU may be appealed to the New Mexico SARA Portal Entity (http://www.hed.state.nm.us/ students/nc-sara.aspx). b.With the exception of grade appeals and student conduct matters, all other grievances not resolved by NMSU, including alleged violation of SARA policies, may also be appealed to the New Mexico SARA Portal Entity (http://www.hed.state.nm.us/ students/nc-sara.aspx) within two years from the date of the incident giving rise to the grievance. c.In the event of an appeal by a student residing in a state participating in SARA, the NM SARA Portal Entity will notify that state's SARA Portal Entity about the appeal, coordinate with thatEntity if it desires to assist with the resolution, and inform that Entity of the nal disposition. d.Questions concerning NMSU Distance Education or SARA policies and procedures may be emailed directly to online@nmsu.edu or mailed to:Distance Education New Mexico State University Milton Hall, Rm 185 2915 McFie be found at: http:// www.hed.state.nm.us/students/nc-sara.aspx and grievances may be directed to the New Mexico State Portal Entity Contact at:Alicia Armijo, SARA Coordinator New Mexico Higher Education Department 2044 Galisteo Street, Suite 4 Santa Fe, NM 87505-2100 (505) 476-8411 alicia.armijo@state.nm.us PART 4: GENERAL STUDENT NON- ACADEMIC GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE If there is no specic rule or procedure to address the subject matter of a student's concern or grievance, the general student non-academic grievance procedures, set forth below, govern. 1.Time Deadline to Initiate Grievance: Absent extenuating circumstances, a student must initiate action pursuant to this procedure within sixty (60) Days following the date that the alleged incident or issue occurred or became known to the student, whichever is later. A failure by the university to respond to the student within the applicable time limits set forth below will entitle, but not require, the student to proceed to the next step in the process. 2.Grievance Steps: a.Step 1 (Informal Grievance Resolution): The aggrieved student may (but is not required) to attempt an informal resolution directly through written correspondence or in person discussion with the involved staff member.

Film Policy In order to comply with the Federal Copyright Act (Title 17 United States Code) which governs how copyrighted materials, such as lms/movies, may be used, it is strongly suggested that chartered student organizations and university departments of New Mexico State University review and adhere to the following guidelines as indicated by the Motion Picture Licensing Corporation when the proposed event involves the screening of a lm/movie on the campus. The Department of Campus Activities will be available for consultation regarding the public performance licensing procedures, but will not be responsible for ensuring that the student organization or university department have complied with the intent of the law and have secured the appropriate license.578 Additional Policies and Procedures By law, as well as by intent, the pre-recorded videocassettes and DVDs (referred to henceforth as \"Videos\") which are available in stores throughout the United States are for all purposes intended for \"home use only.\" Rentals or purchases of Videos do not carry with them licenses for non-home showings. Before you can legally engage in any non- home showings, you must have a separate license, which specically authorizes such use. Any institution, organization, company or individual wishing to engage in non-home showings of Videos should be aware of the Copyright Act's provisions governing the showing of Videos. The Copyright Act grants to the copyright owner the exclusive right, among others, \"to perform the copyrighted work publicly.\" (Section 106 -FCA) In summary, the Copyright Act mandates: 1.The rental or purchase of a Video does not carry with it the right \"to perform the copyrighted work publicly.\" (Section 202 - FCA) 2.Videos may be shown without a license in the home to \"a normal circle of family and its social acquaintances\" (Section 101 - FCA) because such showings are not \"public.\" 3.Videos may also be shown without a license for non-prot educational purposes and in certain narrowly dened \"face-to-face teaching activities\" (Section 110. 1 - FCA) because the law makes a specic, limited exception for such showings. (Sections 106 and 110(1) - FCA) 4.Other showings of Videos are illegal unless they have been authorized by license. Even \"performances in 'semipublic' places such as clubs, lodges, factories, summer camps and schools are 'public performances' subject to copyright control.\" (Senate Report No. 94-473, page 60; House Report No. 94-1476, page 64) 5.Institutions, organizations, companies or individuals wishing to engage in non-home showings of Videos must secure licenses to do so - regardless of whether an admission or other fee is charged. This legal requirement applies equally to prot-making organizations and non-prot institutions (Senate Report No. 94-473, page 59; House Report No. 94-1476, page 62) Showings of Videos without licenses, when one is required, are infringements of the established copyright. If done \"willfully and for purposes of commercial advantage or private nancial gain,\" they are a federal crime and subject to a $150,000 penalty per advantage or private nancial gain,\" they are a federal crime and subject to a $150,000 penalty per exhibition (Section 506 - FCA). In addition, even innocent or inadvertent infringers are subject to substantial civil damages ($750 to $30,000) for each illegal showing and other penalties. (Sections 502-505 - FCA) To Obtain Public Performance License Obtaining a public performance license is relatively easy and usually requires no more than a phone call. Fees are determined by such factors as the number of times a particular movie is going to be shown, how large the audience will be and so forth. While fees vary, they are generally inexpensive for smaller performances. Most licensing fees are based on a particular performance or set of performances for specied lms. The major rms that handle these licenses include: Swank Motion Pictures, Inc. http://www.swank.com (800) 876-5577 Criterion Pictures http://www.criterionpicusa.comMotion Picture Licensing Corporation (MPLC) http://www.mplc.org (800) 462-8855 Freedom of Expression Policy New Mexico State University/Do\u00f1a Ana Community College recognizes and promotes an intellectually open campus.
