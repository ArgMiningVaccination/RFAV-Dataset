For a respiratory virus, you would like a predominantly IgA response since that is the immunoglobulin type most represented in upper respiratory tissues. That has been a bugabo for vaccines against respiratory pathogens since the beginning. If you can tweak the mRNA tech to produce a more robust IgA response, that could be very beneficial and it isn't clear why the Moderna vaccine is better than Pfizer. The more you know, the more you know you don't know. I had Pfizer for the initial vaccine. When it was time for the booster, I signed up for Moderna and got that. No questions, no problem. The pharmacy scheduling system requires you to choose a vaccine provider so you have to pick one. It did not try to prevent me from picking either one.Now that they've cleared the second booster for my age group I'll be getting it soon. But my first 3 shots were Pfizer. I wonder if they'll let me get a Moderna this time around or if I'll be forced into another Pfizer???? ... I was trying to support your assertion, generally, among the brigade of downvotes. Witness the fact that vaccine side effects are worse in young people and markedly reduced in the elderly. It's complicated by the fact that the vaccine response isn't only to the spike protein but also first the lipid envelope. There are 0 professionals asserting that vaccine side effects are a proxy for correlates of protection, but I'm going to agree that both covid outcomes and vaccination side effects are inversely correlated with age. At least above 5 or whatever lower threshold you pick that eliminates the very youngest. Gotcha. I didn't make that logical progression. Yeah, the reason why children do so much better with Covid is basically because they have hyperactive immune systems. Strong initial reaction to Covid = dramatically reduced severity. So out of curiosity, are antivaxers still a big thing in the US? The vaccine has been given to such a vast part of the population that you no longer can argue that it has not been tested enough. No signs of people turning into zombies. The negative attention is gone. At least down here in Belgium, in general we don't care anymore, since patients in intensive Care are very stable. You don't want to be vaccinated? Suit yourself. 5g reception is still the same, wether you are vaccinated or not, ... Are they even doing mixed vaccines here in the States? When I got my booster, the \"official\" recommendation was to keep going with the same thing you got for your first two, and despite seeing early findings in favor of mixing (thanks, Ars) and wanting to switch, none of the places around here (Dallas) gave the option of anything other than what you'd had for your initial dosing. I got a mixed vaccine, I live in Virginia. ... I don't think hyperactive is the correct term here. I know what you're getting at though, but it's much more nuanced. Better innate immune function is probably a bit closer. The data stream will be hijacked by Google to ad targeted advertising.So out of curiosity, are antivaxers still a big thing in the US?

These drugs do not turn people into \"zombies.\" These drugs are designed to be deceptively subtle. The nanochips stream constant data to Microsoft to be aggregated and deciphered. The vaccines are not zombie drugs; they're though-police drugs.

The more you know, the more you know you don't know. AFAIK Sputnik's doses just changed the delivery vehicle (two different adenovirus shells), not the code inside.My partner and I got two shots of AstraZeneca and one of Pfizer. Anecdotal but we have yet to catch covid (we have been testing twice weekly since the UK started making LFDs available for free). Didn't Russia's Sputnik vaccine rely on a mix and match approach with different compositions in doses 1, 2 and 3? I would take any Russian studies with a heavy grain of salt but I see to remember that they exported it in significant volumes and those countries that had it (especially in Central and Sluth America) may have done studies to prove or disprove the usefulness of the approach. Fascinating stuff. The question I have is whether Pfizer and Moderna deliberately targeted the specific antibody classes during development, or whether it was just by happenstance that the vaccines trigger the different classes. I'm inclined to believe this is accidental otherwise Pfizer would have also aimed for the mucosal response. I am not 100% IgA is better than IgG & IgM. Sure the mucus is the pathway into the system, but antibodies in the blood probably prevent the virus from spreading into your body. I guess that's where the mix and match argument comes from. You want both mucus and blood. Are they even doing mixed vaccines here in the States? When I got my booster, the \"official\" recommendation was to keep going with the same thing you got for your first two, and despite seeing early findings in favor of mixing (thanks, Ars) and wanting to switch, none of the places around here (Dallas) gave the option of anything other than what you'd had for your initial dosing. ... There's 6 million dead Covid victims who had a strong and immediate initial reaction to Covid and never recovered. Did they? Citation required. Edit: 9 downvotes already, huh? I guess nobody likes the idea that a strong initial immune system response to Covid might result in better outcomes. That's why it's pointless to get vaccinated, amirite? If the sequences linked inAs a biologist non-coder I'll throw in an analogy:They don't exactly have the same ingredient. The number of nucleotides in the mRNA is different (~4,100 vs ~4,300), and that leads to a slight difference in the antigen protein produced by a vaccinated cell.Considering that both vaccines have the same active ingredient, and half their other ingredients are the same, and they both work by being injected into a person's shoulder muscle and largely remain in the muscle, I'm struggling to understand how their effect can be different other than in terms of degree due to different dosages. Ask any programmer about the impact of changing 200 lines of code. Do you have a source or know why? I was under the impression that both vaccines encoded the exact same pre-fusion stabilized Wuhan spike sequence published in January 2020. I realize that doesn't mean the mRNA has to be entirely the same, but I guess I expected it to be closer. mRNA (especially for eukaryotes) doesn't just consist of the protein coding code. It has headers and footers (untranslated regions) that are analogous to headers and include lines in programming. Just as you can have the same body code call different libraries (and whatever, we're getting beyond my knowledge of coding here), you can have the same protein coding sequence call different proteins and otherwise modify how a particular mRNA and its resulting protein is treated. In addition to these untranslated regions the Moderna and Pfizer protein coding sequences do not consist of the same codons for the same amino acids. Most amino acids have multiple three letter codes that code for the same amino acid. However some of the tRNAs (the carrier vehicles that deliver a new amino acid onto a protein chain) that recognize these codes are rarer or more frequent which has an effect both on protein translation rates and sometimes even on protein folding, as well as mRNA stability. I haven't analyzed the Moderna and Pfizer mRNAs, but this is probably not having a significant effect, as they will have pre-optimized the three letter code usage. But it might have an effect. The analogous thing in coding is compiler optimization, though the optimization in mRNA takes places on an amino-acid level as well as local and global protein levels, and at the mRNA level in terms of stability. Perhaps it's a learned behavior in response to a pattern? Biological creatures are weird that way.Well thank god you're doing your civic and moral duty and downvoting any and every post I write regardless of what it says The scales are log10 scales. The skew is closer to 200% than ~=300, 10^3 1000)I bit towards IgG and Moderna skews a bit towards IgA (figure 1) but the differences don't seem to be more than 20-25%, and usually much less. I'm the sole upvote on SraCet's original post because it is worthwhile citing whether immediate reaction to COVID infection correlates with long-term reaction to COVID. I've anecdotally read about people who seem to do well or recover fine initially after infection and then take a dramatic turn for the worse. Does immediate initial reaction to Sars-CoV-2 correlate with ultimate outcome? If so is the correlation positive or negative? And is this a strong, moderate, or weak correlation?...

Canada did the gutsy move of being one of the first western nations to aggressively push vaccine mixing more than a year ago. It paid off, but it was super controversial given unknown interaction risks \u2014 like medicine interactions. And it was super inconvenient (many nations initially didn't allow visitors with mixed vaccines). Optimization is great, but in the case of someone who is vaccinated and boosted with mRNA vaccines, it feels like chasing that last 5%. I have numerous friends who had a mild case after being boosted. The key word is \"mild.\" I'm open to getting a second booster at some point (63 years old male), but will likely wait until late summer to do it. I got boosted early December.

I figure boosting now is probably smart, because that will clear your calendar for whatever boost arrives late in the year. I don't think it's going away, I think we're just going to get COVID shots like flu shots, but maybe twice a year instead of once. Could the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines be combined into one shot? I know my last flu shot was a quad. Maybe just add the J&J, Pfizer, and Moderna into one shot? Iceland did it as an accidental process. First the government suggested J&J for my age group + gender since it was just one dose but then that wasn't good enough so they suggested a second dose of Moderna or Pfizer. I got Moderna. A few weeks later turned out that this had a higher than expected rate of issues related to my age group + gender so when they said everyone should get a third shot the only remaining one was Pfizer. So I have the three of them. Obviously anecdotal but last week my wife had covid (omnicron, 2 days of flu symptoms) and we took not specific preventative measures and I seemingly did not contract the infection based on daily lateral flow tests. I'm somewhat contributing that to the multiple vaccines but it does seem random. Multiple people at work have stories of whole families getting omnicron but one being left out but the combination of vaccines that person had seems random (all three, 3x moderna, 3x pfizer).
