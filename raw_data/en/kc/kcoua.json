(CMO) Keywords: COVID -19, vaccine, messenger RNA, adverse effects EVIDENCE S UMMARY There are no specific guidelines for use of messenger RNA ( mRNA ) vaccines or contraindications to mRNA vaccines. No large trials of any mRNA vaccine have been completed yet. The only evidence on safety of mRNA vaccines comes from small phase I and phase II trials of SARS -CoV -2 vaccines, with follow -up typically less th an two months . Systemic adverse events such as fatigue, muscle aches, headache, and chills are common. Severe systemic adverse events were reported by 5 to 10 percent of trial subjects. Localized adverse events such as pain at the injection side are comm on. Both systemic and local adverse events usually are resolved within one or two days. The rate and severity of adverse events appears to be higher for the second dose of vaccine than for the first. Higher vaccine doses appear to increase the rate and sev erity of adverse events. Larger trials of SARS -CoV -2 vaccines are in progress, with results expected in mid -2021. There is not sufficient evidence to support any conclusions on the comparative safety of different mRNA vaccines. Direct e vidence on the comparative safety of mRNA vaccines and other vaccines is lacking. \u00a9 Copyright 2020 by the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania. All rights reserved.

Pharmaceutical manufacturers and government agencies are working urgently to develop a vaccine against this virus. The first of these vaccines are expected to gain Emergency Use Authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration this month. Several different products are in development for potential use in the United States (Table 1), and they use different technologies to stimulate the desired immune response in vaccine recipients. The vaccines that are expected to receive authorization for use soonest are based on a novel lipid-encapsulated messenger RNA (mRNA) technology . The purpose of this Evidence Advisory is to identify and summarize high -level evidence on the safety of mRNA v accines . Evaluation of the vaccines' effectiveness is outside the scope of this report. mRNA vaccines used for therapeutic purposes such as those used in cancer or HIV treatment are also outside the scope of this report. This report may include evidence on mRNA vaccines used against other diseases , including influenza, cytomegalovirus (CMV), rabies, and Zika , thought it will be indirect evidence for the purpose of predicting the safety of SARS -CoV -2 vaccines . Presently, no such vaccines are licensed for use in the United States (1). Table 1.

The scope was limited to existing guidelines from public health agencies and profes sional societies , systematic reviews, and medical center policies . The report found that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal -Fetal Medicine sought to balance the possible risks of vaccination with the risks of remaining unvaccinated, and recommended shared decision -making by women and their physicians. Guidelines from United Kingdom sources recommended against COVID -19 vaccination for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Guidance from Penn Medicine and other US medical centers generally followed the ACOG and SMFM positions. Current UPHS policy The University of Pennsylvania Health System does not have any written policy documents relevant to this topic. All UPHS hospitals, outpatient, and home care entities are vaccinating employees against SARS -CoV -2 using mRNA vaccines. The vaccinations are not mandatory.

This is likely due to the lack of FDA or European approval for any mRNA vaccines before this month . General guidance on COVID -19 vaccination has been issued by Public Health England (Table 11). It is of low quality ( Table 12) and based on limited evidence. Because no clinical trials involving children have been reported yet, and children have less risk of serious il lness or death from COVID -19, vaccination of children is not recommended. For a summary of guidance on COVID -19 vaccines for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, please see the CEP Ra pid Guidance Summary on that topic. Table 11. Guideline recommendations Organization Recommendation Notes Public Health England 2020 (2) SARS -CoV-2 vaccine trials have only just begun in children and therefore, there are, very limi ted data on safety and immunogenicity in this group. Children and young people have a very low risk of COVID -19, severe disease or death due to SARS -CoV-2 compared to adults and so COVID -19 vaccines are not routinely recommended for children and young peop le under 16 years of age. Individuals who have immunosuppression and HIV infection (regardless of CD4 count) should be given COVID vaccine in accordance with the recommendations and contraindications stated in the Protocol and Green Book COVID -19 chapter . These individuals may not make a full antibody response and should therefore continue to follow advice to avoid exposure unless they are advised otherw ise by their doctor. Local reactions at the injection site were found to be fairly common after vaccination with BNT162b2. Over 80% of trial parti cipants reported pain at the injection site. This occurred within 7 days after the injection and resolved after a few days General guidance on COVID -19 vaccination. No specific guidance regarding mRNA vaccines. Table 12.

The first (3) was published in May 2020 with searches completed April 17, 2020. At that time, only one trial of an mRNA vaccine was found, and results of it had not been reported. The second systematic review (4) has not been peer -reviewed and published, but a preprint of the authors ' manuscript was posted to the medR xiv server on November 4, with searches completed on October 20. Five trials were meta -analyzed in this review, but only one of them (5) involved an mRNA vaccine. That trial was very small, and while it found a higher rate of adverse events in the vaccine group than in the placebo group, that difference was not statistically significant. All of the reported adverse events were minor, most were localized, and all resolved within days. A \"living\" systematic review of COVID -19 vaccine studies is planned; its protocol was published in November 2020 (6). Serious adverse events will be a primary outcomes measure of the review, and minor adverse events will be a secondary outcome. There is no project website reported yet. Table 13. Systematic review findings Reviewer Findings Comment Yuan 2020 (4) Adverse event data from five clinical trials was meta -analyzed. Most of the reported adverse events were localized and all adverse events resolved within a few days. The one trial of an mRNA vaccine (5) included only 36 subjectsand differences between vaccine and placebo group were not statistically significant. Unlike the other trials, the mRNA vaccine trial did not report adverse reactions by specific type. Overall risk of bias wa s not assessed, but the mRNA vaccine trial was at risk of attrition bias.

Checcucci 2020 (3) A phase I trial of mRNA -1273 was in progress: results were not yet published. Six trials of other SARS -CoV-2-specific vaccines were also i n progress, along with three trials of BCG vaccine for prevention of SARS -CoV-2 infection. Review of SARS -CoV-2 vaccines. Table 14.

Funding described, no conflict Y Y CEP modified AMSTAR scale available at www.uphs.upenn.edu/cep/methods Primary studies Because of the urgent nature of the topic and the absence of high -level evidence, we proceeded to review and analyze results from primary studies of mRNA vaccines ( Table 15). All of the mRNA vaccine safety data published to date is from early -phase clinical trials. Some of the data comes from non -peer-reviewed and unpublished manuscripts, as noted in the table. This data should be used with caution. The studies are all small: they lack sufficient power to detect and assess the probability of uncommon adverse events, so the absence of such events in these trials should not be taken as evidence these events may not happen when mRNA vaccines are used more widely. Phase III trials that may yield more information on these events are in progress ( Table 16) but the ir results should not be expected until mid -2021. Because the trials published to date were small, and done in part to optimize dosing, we will analyze their results only qualitatively. No serious events as defined in FDA guidance (life -threatening, dis abling, or requiring hospital ization) were reported in any of the trials. However, both systemic adverse events such as fatigue, headache, muscle aches, and chills; and localized adverse eve nts such as pain at the injection site were very common in all o f the trials. Most of the adverse events were mild, and resolved within one or two days. Serious events, defined as events that temporarily interfered with subjects' everyday activities, were reported by approximately 5 to 10 percent of study subjects. These too resolved within one or two days. While there is not sufficient data to statistically test these observations, a few trends are seen in the data. First, the r ate of adverse events and the rate of serious adverse events were higher after a subject 's second injection compared to the first one. Second, subjects receiving higher doses of the vaccine reported more adverse events and more severe adverse events. There is a possible trend towards a reduced rate of adverse events in older subjects than i n younger ones. There is not sufficient data to permit any conclusions about the comparative safety of specific vaccines. While one study reported on mRNA influenza vaccines and another reported on a respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, there is not suffi cient evidence to draw more generalized comparisons of the safety of mRNA vaccines compared to other types of vaccines.

Completion -projected primary completion date -not updated since before November 15, 2020 Conclusions The current evidence base on messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines is made up entirely of small early -stage trials, nearly all of which examined only short -term outcomes. They lack sufficient power for test ing the statistical significance of most results, and for assessing the risk of serious but uncommon adverse events. The size of these trials and their dual purpose in evaluating dosing and safety precludes quantitative synthesis or GRADE analysis of their results, but there are a few trends that appear to be consistent across the different studies. Systemic adverse effects such as fatigue, headache, muscle aches, and chills are common following administration of mRNA vaccines, but they usually resolve wi thin a day or two. Localized adverse effects, most notably pain at the injection site, are also common, and also resolve within a day or two. The rate of severe adverse effects (severe enough to interfere with a person's daily activities) appears to be in the range o f 5 to 10 percent. The rate and severity of adverse events increases with vaccine dose. The rate and severity of adverse events also appears to be greater following a second dose of vaccine than following the first.

All rights reserved. 15 Larger clinical trials of mRNA vaccines against the SARS -CoV -2 coronavirus are in progress, and their results are expected in mid - 2021. Once evidence f rom those trials is published, more certain conclusions about the safety of these vaccines may be reached . Additional trials will be necessary to determine the relative safety of mRNA vaccines and vaccines using more established technologies. Clinical gui dance specific to the use of mRNA vaccines is lacking at this time, because of the lack of clinical evidence.
