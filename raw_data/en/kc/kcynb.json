Page 3 of 103 1. Summary A literature review was undertaken to understand the potential sources of tropane alkaloids (TAs) in the diet. Following the literature review a sampling plan was developed to carry out a survey of UK foods to determine their tropa ne alkaloid content. Sources of contamination were identified as Datura type seeds and the increase of Convulvulus type weeds in fields of food crops. Sampling was carried out for the UK FSA and as a part of a wider EFSA survey. A total of 286 samples were analysed for TAs and calystegines for the EFSA survey . 227 UK samples (197 cereal products, 10 green beans and stir fry vegetables and 20 teas) were analysed for TAs, and 59 UK samples (44 potatoes and 15 aubergines) were analysed for calystegines as part of the EFSA survey. An additional 5 2 UK retail samples ( 20 cereal based infant foods, 11 single grain flours and maize products, 12 oilseeds and 9 teas), and 17 single grain flours sampled directly at mills were analysed for TAs on behalf of the FSA . Samples were analysed by LC -MS/MS, the method underwent validation and demonstrat ed satisfactory method performance by meeting the requirements of Commission Regulation (EC) No 401 /2006 and SANCO/12751/2013 for method performance characteristics. Over all the TA levels were low or not detected in most products , including, cereal based products (flours, maize products, breakfast cereals, bread, pasta, biscuits), oilseeds, and green & black tea . Atropine and scopolamine were the main TAs detected , but m illet, sorghum and other flours contained the broadest range of tropane alkaloids, with one sample of yellow millet containing up to 10 different alkaloids. This sample contained 9.8 \u00b5g/kg atropine and 12.9 \u00b5g/kg scopolamine as well as 8 other alkaloids an d had a total TA content of 33.6 \u00b5g/kg. Cereal based infant foods are the only products with maximum levels of TAs of 1 \u00b5g/kg each for atropine and scopolamine (3). Four out of 66 UK samples were found to exceed these levels in this survey, (3/46 for the EFSA survey and 1/20 for the FSA survey). The highest level found was 3.73 \u00b5g/kg atropine , however u p to 8 TAs were measured in some individual samples. Sixteen out of 20 UK herbal teas contained detectable TAs. The highest level found was 129 \u00b5g/kg a tropine in a peppermint tea. Tea infusions were prepared from a selection of 20 tea samples from the wider EFSA survey and analysed for TAs at RIKILT. On average, it was found there was a transfer efficiency of the alkaloids from the dry tea to the infusion of 47%. Samples of potatoes and aubergines purchased in the UK were analysed for calystegines at RIKILT. Forty fo ur samples of potatoes and 15 samples of aubergines were analysed. Calystegine A3, calystegine B2 and calystegine B4 were predominantly detected in potatoes. The highest level found was 310 mg/kg Page 4 of 103 calystegine A3. Calystegine A3, calystegine B1 and detected more frequently in aubergines. Calystegine B2 was detected at the highest concentration in aubergine, the highest level detected was 124.8 mg/kg .

The aims of the project were to carry out a literature review to understand the potential sources of tropane alkaloids in the diet, then to carry out a survey of foods from across Europe to determine their tropane alkaloid content. The literature survey was completed using published literature and and incidents reported by RASFF as information sources. The results of the literature review were used to develop th e sampling plan . Sources of contamination were identified as Datura type seeds in some products and the increase of Convulvulus type weeds in fields of food crops. Tropane alkaloids are molecules which contain a substituted tropane ring in their structu re. They are secondary metabolites that occur naturally in many members of the plant family Solanaceae as well as several other genera such can act as anticholinergics or stimulants , the most well known being atropine and scopolamine . Some of t hese plants have been responsible for numerous episodes of human poisoning, either through deliberate misuse due to their hallucinogenic properties, or accidental ingestion, especially in children . The samples identified as being the most important to sample were: cereal based foods including those that contain millet, sorghum and poppy seed; infant foods, including those containing millet, sorghum; some maize prod ucts; single grain flours , especially buckwheat; canned or frozen green beans and vegetable mixes and herbal teas. In total 286 UK samples were analysed for the EFSA survey for TAs and calystegines , (197 cereal products, 10 green beans and stir fry vegeta bles and 20 teas were analysed for TAs and 44 potato samples and 15 aubergine samples for calystegines). An addition al 69 samples (52 UK retail samples comprising 20 cereal based infant foods containing millet, 11 single grain flours and maize products, 1 2 oilseeds and 9 teas), and 17 single grain flours sampled directly at mills were analysed for TAs. Calystegines (another group of tropane alkaloids) were also included in the review. These are inherent toxins mainly found in Solanaceae plants. Potatoes and aubergines were included in the sampling plan as the major potential source of calystegines in the diet. A small number of peppers were also analysed by RIKILT. A major conclusion of the review was that it is important to include as many TAs in the analytical method as possible , therefore the method included all TAs for which reliable analytical standards were available. All samples were analysed by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Method validation was carried out for cereal s (single - flours and cereal based products ) and teas. The method has been demonstrated to meet the Page 6 of 103 required performance criteria for atropine and scopolamine by the results of the validation exercise and QC data generated during the survey. I n addition Fera participation in two Proficiency Tests run by the EURL for atropine and scopolamine in cereals and teas using this method gave 100% satisfactory results. Overall the TA levels were low in most major staple (cereal based) foods. Single - grain flours, and most cereal products contained very low levels or no detectable TAs. Oilseeds and black and green tea also contained no significant levels. The only maximum levels in force for the samples included in the survey are maximum levels of 1 \u00b5g/kg each for atropine and scopolamine in cereal based infant food as set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/239 (amending Regulation (EU) 1881/2006) . Four infant food samples were found to exceed these levels, the highest level found was 3.73 \u00b5g/kg atropine. The samples were all analysed as received, but would require reconstitution before consumption. Herbal teas were found to be commonly contaminated with TAs. Sixteen out of 20 teas from the UK contained detectable TAs. The highest level found in a UK he rbal tea was 129 \u00b5g/kg atropine in a peppermint tea. Tea infusions were prepared from a selection of teas and analysed for TAs at RIKILT. On average , for the 20 tea samples tested from the wider EFSA survey , it was found there was a transfer efficiency of the alkaloids from the dry tea to the infusion of 47% . UK purchased samples of potatoes and aubergines were analysed for calystegines at RIKILT. The two vegetables showed different contamination patterns. Levels in potatoes were on the whole higher t han aubergines, with calystegine A3, calystegine B2 and calystegine B4 predominantly detected in potatoes. The highest level found was 310 mg/kg calystegine A3. Calystegine A3, detected in aubergines. Calystegine B 2 was detected at the highest concentration in aubergine, the highest level measured was 124.8 mg/kg. Overall levels of TAs found in the survey were low, with very few incidences of the atropine and scopolamine found. The relevance of the other compound s measured is hard to evaluate due to the lack of toxicity data about these compounds. Valuable additional information about the occurrence of TAs other than atropine and scopolamine has been obtained and so has added to the understanding of the possible presence of these compounds in food. Herbal teas were the other product that contained the highest levels of TAs. This seems to be similar to the occurrence of pyrrolizidine alkaloids in teas , presumably caused by the unintentional inclusion of TA contai ning weeds in the tea product as green leaf plant teas such as peppermint were found to contain TAs at the highest levels .

Introduction Tropane alkaloids (TA) are secondary metabolites which naturally occur in plants of several families including Brassicaceae , and Solanaceae (e.g. mandrake, henbane, alkaloids are ( -)-hyoscyamine (an isomer of atropine) and ( -)-scopolamine are the main alkaloids found in TA producing plants. TAs are antimuscarinic agents that are antagonists of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors primarily present in the autonomic effector sites inner vated by parasympathetic (cholinergic postganglionic) nerves but also in the central nervous system (CNS). In humans, the predominant peripheral antimuscarinic effects are decreased production of secretions from the salivary, bronchial, and sweat glands, dilation of the pupils (mydriasis) and paralysis of accommodation, change in heart rate, inhibition of micturition, reduction in gastrointestinal tone and inhibition of gastric acid secretion. Chemical food contaminations leading to human i ntoxications are rare but do occur (2), but are only generally reported when they lead to patients being hospitalised. Often they have been caused by errors in preparing herbal preparations and tea. TAs can, furthermore, contaminate food when the weeds are harvested wit h the crop. Common practices for cleaning cereals are not always sufficient to remove the weed plant parts. The concentration of the tropane alkaloids thus entering the food chain is expected to be very low. More recently, it has been disclosed that a g roup of very polar tropane alkaloids, the calystegines are found in various edible plants of the Solanum genus and in the weed Convolvulus . This is a group of 14 different compounds with calystegine A3, calystegine B2 and calystegine B4 the most important (3). Expected levels in specific foods can be high. In early 2016 Commission Regulation EU (No) 339/2016 came into force setting maximum limits of 1 \u00b5g/kg each for atropine and scopolamine in infant foods (3). In the European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) CONTAM Panel opinion on tropane alkaloids (4), only limited occurrence data were available . Most of the data used for the assessment was left censored, i.e. below limt of detection or limit of quantification , and a reliable exposure assessment could on ly be carried out for two tropane alkaloids (( -)-hyoscyamine (atropine) and ( -)-scopolamine ), for food and one age class (toddlers) . The CONTAM panel was unable to carry out a risk assessment due to the absence of useful occurrence data and therefore made the suggestion that additional data should be obtained and recommended occurrence data for various TAs as well as atropine and scopoloamine should also be collected . EFSA published a call for a European wide survey for TAs. RIKILT Wageningen Fera Science Ltd., York, UK , formed a consortium that was awarded the contract to carry out the EFSA survey. The UK Food Standards Agency ( FSA) provided matching funding for Fera to undertake the EFSA survey, as well as funding the analysis of additional samples collected in the UK. The additional UK Page 13 of 103 sampling plan was designed in conjunction with the FS A with the aim of testing specific products of interest that were not included in the EFSA survey. 8. Aims and Objectives of the Study A series of tasks were completed in order to achieve the following objectives on two Phases of the project . 8.1. Objectives a nd tasks for Phase 1 Identify relevant tropane alkaloids (TAs) , in addition to atropine and scopolamine , that should be measured in the survey . Identify at least five relevant food matrices that should be sampled . The feasibility of measuring these compounds by assessing analytical methods and the availability of standards should be described. Prepare a method development and validation plan. To achieve th ese objectives , a thorough review of available literature wa s carried out. The information from the literature review was used to inform and support the design of the sampling plans for the EFSA and FSA surveys . 8.2. Objectives and Tasks for Phase 2 Develop and validate methodology that would be suitable for the anal ysis of the sample types identified in the literature study for all the analytes of interest that had been identified. RIKILT, as EFSA lead partner, was responsible for co -ordinating this, and the supply of analytical standards and Quality Control (QC) ma terials to all partners . Perform the sample collection for the EFSA study , and the FSA study agreed in accordance with the sampling plans agreed in Phase 1 . Fera was required to purchase a target of 275 samples of cereals, cereal products, herbal teas and vegetable products to analyse for tropane alkaloids for the EFSA survey . It was agreed at an early stage that sampling would be carried out over two time periods; May-November 2015 and January -May 2016 to allow for possible seasonal variation to be taken into account. Fera was also required to collect a target of 50 UK specific samples, over the same two time periods. Analyse the selected tropane alkaloids in the food samples collected using the validated analytical method. Samples were analysed using the methods provided by RIKILT and validated in -house at Fera using LC -MS/MS. Compile the data from the analysis in the EFSA standard description format. Page 14 of 103 Prepare a final report for EFSA, that provides justification of the choice of analytes and sample ty pes, the method used and its validation data, the sampling procedure and the results of all individual samples. RIKILT, as lead contractor produced an EFSA format report that was published on the EFSA website ( 5). During sampling some additional samples were received , or the relative numbers in some categories were different. All samples received were included in the survey, therefore the total numbers analysed are slightly higher than the target numbers for both the EFSA and additional UK samples. In total 286 samples were analysed for EFSA, and 69 as additional UK samples. This report describes the Fera contribution to the overall project and the results of the additional UK samples that were analysed. 9. Literature review 9.1. Literature review parameters To complete the first objectives stated above a full literature was carried out. The literature se arch was performed at the start of the project in March 2015, using search terms and a n agreed strategy. Searches were carried out through the Fera Information Centre and its available on -line sources. The search did not include literature that was not i n the English language. As well as published scientific literature the EU RASFF system was also searched for reports of incidents involving tropane alkaloids to help inform the sampling plan. 9.1.1. Results from the literature review The literature study is presented in full in Annex 1 and is included as Annex A in the EFSA report EFSA -Q-2014 -00320 (5). It reviews the occurrence of TAs in food plants and in co -occurring weed plants that both contain TAs and have a strong potential to contaminate foods. TAs for which no standard were believed to be available and cocaine and other TAs used for recreational drugs were excluded. The search provided about 3,500 results with the majority associated with atropine and scopolamine. In view of the considerable quant ity of data concerning the occurrence and toxicity of atropine and scopolamine and the EFSA interest in the remaining TAs the focus of the review is on the less familiar TAs including calystegines. During the course of the project (until May 2016), new av ailable information was added, where appropriate. No new extended literature search was performed after March 2015 . Page 15 of 103 9.2. Conclusions and Recommendations from the literature review Several conclusions and recommendations were reached from the literature review . The first was that information on the occurrence of TAs in food in the EU is scarce, in addition, the information available was not always pertinent to food, e.g. many reports relate d to horticulture or occurrence of TAs in non -edible plants or parts of plants such as roots and flowers. 9.2.1. TAs to be included in the survey The majority of available information relate d to atropine and scopolamine and little information, (often dated ), was available on the other TAs occurring in foods. Knowledge on toxic effects of TAs, other than atropine and scopolamine, was scarce , and therefore it has been concluded (e.g. EFSA opinion) that all TAs should be considered toxic and it is advis able to measure all TAs for which an analytical standard is av ailable. A list of target compounds was prepared and is given in Table 1. These were the compounds for which reliable analytical standards could be obtained. Table 1. Tropane alkaloids included in the survey Tropane Alakloids included in LC -MS method sources The literature review g ave extensive information on the occurrence of the different alkaloids in different plant species. Recorded cases of human intoxications with TAs were discussed, most of these inciden ts seem to have been caused by accidental ingestion of non -food plants or from mistaken identity of plants rather than food Page 16 of 103 contamination incidents. Recent food contamination incidents from RASFF reports were also reported . It is very difficult to predict which co -occurring weeds, and thus which TAs, will be present in the food in the EU. With respect to cereal crops contamination with weeds, the major weeds currently contaminating food crops in the EU are Datura sepium (Calystegia sepium ). Toxic weed plants from outside the EU likely to contaminate foods imported into the EU are Solanum species S. ptycanthum , S. nigrum , S. viarum and S. torvum . These plants are common in cultivated fields and have been harvested with peas, snap beans and soya beans . Other invasive solanums that are common in the USA and Asia are S. viarum and S. torvum (turkeyberry). Therefore there is a need to analyse all foods for all TAs for which an analytical standard is available. 9.2.3. Food types to be included in the sampling plan The EFSA Opinion on tro pane alkaloids in 2013 indicated a high proportion of cereal -based food for infants and young children were contaminated with TAs , cereal -based food intended for both toddlers and infants were also contaminated to a lesser extent (4). Contamination was also r evealed in food and feed based on oilseeds, especially sunflower seeds, and in millet and related plants such as sorghum. From RASFF reports, the greatest incidence of contamination has been caused by the presence of Datura seeds in millet (mainly organic and mainly originating in Austria) and Datura fruit (berries) in processed bean -based vegetables. Frozen green beans have also been contaminated with Solanum and poppy seeds with Hyoscyamus (henbane). Although not wholly related to reports found on TAs during the literature review the widespread con tamination of herbal tea products with pyrrolizidine alkaloids and a single incidence of contamination of tea prepared from marshmallow root with A. belladonna root suggested there might be a requirement to survey herbal teas from areas with potential trop ane-containing plant growth. Calystegines were also included in the review. Whilst there were many reports of contamination by Datura tropanes there we re no reports of calystegine contamination of foods in which they do not occur naturally. There appear ed to be widespread and sometimes heavy growth of Convolvulus in cereal fields, but it was concluded consumer exposure to calystegines w ould be greater and more sustained through consumption of potato and other vegetable products, e.g. aubergine. Page 17 of 103 9.3. Recommenda tions from the Literature review 9.3.1. Recommendations - Foods to be analysed for co -occurring TAs , (e.g. atropine, scopolamine, tropine, convolvine etc.) Processed cereal foods intended for babies, infants and toddlers (include a high proportion of organic p roducts ). Processed and unprocessed cereal foods for adults, including some samples with poppy seeds and products containing millet (include a high proportion of organic products) . Processed foods and flours based on buckwheat, including some samples with poppy seeds products containing millet (include a high proportion of organic products) . Canned and frozen vegetables with a high proportion of green beans. Tea, specifically herbal teas (based on recent experience with pyrrolizidine alkaloids ). 9.3.2. Recommendations - Foods recommended to be analysed in the EFSA survey for inherent TAs (calystegines) Potato products of all types and cultivars to be analysed as priority crop. Aubergines - to be analysed based on consumption patterns in the EU. In addi tion it was also recommend ed: To include samples from more than one harvest year. Food samples should be obtained from as many different sources as possible, including from outside the EU. 10. Sampling 10.1. Sampling Plan Following the literature review the sampling plan was developed. Sampling for UK samples was conducted by Fera. Samples were purchased throughout the UK and prepared according to a protocol agreed with EFSA and the FSA. Sampling was conducted during th e time periods May to December 2015 and January to May 2016. Samples were purchased from retail outlets around York, and some were purchased in Scotland. A significant proportion were also purchased Page 18 of 103 from specialist suppliers and health food companies via the internet, these were from a variety of UK locations. As far as possible the sampling scheme from Commission Regulation (EC) No 401/2006 laying down the methods of sampling and analysis for the official control of the levels of mycotoxins in foodstuff s was followed . A minimum of 3 packs of the same batch were purchased and combined to produce a sample of a minimum 1 kg. It was possible to achieve this when Fera staff made the purchases in store, however the on -line retailers were not always able to f ulfil this, e.g. they did not supply sufficient number of packs, or supplied packs from different batches and therefore some samples were less than 1 kg . Samples were stored under suitable dry conditions, frozen if necessary, before being prepared and ho mogenised. 10.2. Sampling Plan and Samples - EFSA samples The final sampling plan that was used for purchase of the samples is given in Table 2. It was agreed that the tea samples would include; chamomile, mint, rooibos (redbush), fennel, lemon balm, and nettle. Food products from organic production were collected for all food categories, approximately 25% of the samples were organic. Page 19 of 103 Table 2. Sampling Plan for EFSA survey samples.

Sampling Plan and Samples - Additional UK samples A sampling plan was agreed with the FSA for the additional target of 50 UK samples. The FSA specifically asked for samples of oilseeds, infant foods that contained buckwheat, millet or sorghum as an ingredient as well as products of EU origin and ethnic o rigin (i.e. Asia, Africa) to be collected as these were also identified as a potential source of tropane alkaloids but were not included in the EFSA sampling plan. The plan included green and black tea samples as these had been excluded from the EFSA surv ey. In addition to the samples collected above , nabim (National Association of British and Irish Millers) supplied 17 samples of mainly UK grown and milled cereals sampled directly at UK mills .

Sample Homogenisation and Preparation for Analysis Sample preparation was carried out according to a protocol that was agreed between the project partners and EFSA at the start of the project and complied with the requirements of Regulation (EC) (No) 401/2006 laying down the methods of sampling and analysis for the official control of the levels of mycotoxins in foodstuffs . In all cases where multiple packs were purchased these were combined to produce a composite of ~1kg. The whole sample was milled and homogenised to ensure sample homogeneity . Cereals and t ea samples were milled to a fine powder using a Retsch centrifugal mill . All vegetables, including potatoes and aubergines were cryogenically milled. Samples of potatoes and aubergines bought in the UK, were cryomilled at Fera and then sent frozen by courier to RIKILT for calystegine analysis. In all cases samples were subdivided into three aliquots and were stored at -18\u00b0C after preparation until analysis. Page 21 of 103 11. Materials and Methods 11.1. Chemicals and Reagents For extraction, methanol (HPLC grade) (Sigma -Aldrich, Gillingham, UK) and water (18.2 M/cm Purelab Ultra laboratory purification system) (Elga, Marlow, UK) and formic acid solution (Fisher) were used. 7 N ammonia in methanol used for elution of solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridges was from Sigma -Aldrich. Strong Anion exchange cartridges - Strata -X-C 200 mg/6 ml, 33 \u00b5m (Phenomenex) were used to clean -up sample extracts. Methanol, (UPLC /MS grade) (Biosolve, Dieuze, France via Greyhound, Birkenhead, UK) and ammonium carbonate were used for eluent preparation for LC -MS/MS analysis. All calibration standards were sourced and verified by RIKILT using LC -MS and in some cases NMR. RIKILT supp lied all analytical standards to the project partners to help ensure parity and consistency in results between the partners. To compensate for matrix effects during LC -MS/MS analysis, isotopically labelled internal standards, atropine -d3 and scopolamine -d3, were used. No other isotopically labelled standards were available. A list of all the TAs included in the metho d is given in Table 1. 11.2. Method Development and Validation 11.2.1. Validation Analyses The methods used were developed and in -house validated by RIKILT and copies of the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were di stributed to all partners in the EFSA project. The final method used by all partners for TAs is given in Annex 2. RIKILT sourced and provided all analytical standards and QC materials and distributed these to the partners. Each partner undertook in -hous e method validation for the methods supplied by RIKILT for cereal products and teas. It was agreed that as only a small number of green bean / vegetable mix samples were included that validation was not required and an overspike of each sample would be in cluded in that analytical batch. Validation for calystegine analysis was not done at Fera as RIKILT analysed the UK samples for calystegines. The samples were prepared at Fera and analysed by RIKILT. The method was validated by the three partner labora tories, and the SOP of the method used is given in Annex 5. 11.2.2. Validation Criteria There are no specific regulations or guidance documents that stipulate how to validate a method for the quantification of plant toxins in food products. Therefore i t Page 22 of 103 was decided, that the guidance document on analytical quality control and validation procedures for pesticide residues analysis in food and feed SANCO/12751/2013 (6) would be used. Regulation (EU) 2016/239, that introduced limits for tropane alkaloids i n infant foods, makes no specific reference to method performance characteristics. However, it does state that sampling for control of plant toxins should be performed in accordance with the rules of Regulation (EC) 401/2006, this regulation also sets met hod performance criteria for mycotoxins analysis. It was decided to apply the general requirements on performance characteristics derived from SANCO/12751/2013 and Regulation (EU) No 401/2006 (amended by Regulation (EU) No 519/2014) for mycotoxins for th e validation and analysis of tropane alkaloids. The performance parameters are given below: LOD: 3 times S/N calculated from lowest matrix or extract spiked sample LOQ: 10 times S/N calculated from lowest matrix or extract spiked sample Linearity: 0.99 for matrix or extract matched calibration curve Recovery: 60 to 120 % for Datura -type TA; 70 to 110 % 20 % Reproducibility (RSDR): 2 \u00d7 value derived from Horwitz Equation (modified by Thompson) for Datura -type TA; 2 \u00d7 value derived from Horwitz Equation for calystegines Measurement Uncertainty (U): <50 % The linearity of the LC -MS/MS measurement was established through calibration standards in solvent, covering the relevant concentration range. From these initial in-house validations, the linearity, recovery, repeatability, selectivity, LOQ and limit of detection (LOD) were derived. In addition, the stability of retention time and ion ratios in solvent standards and extracts were determined. Identification of anal ytes was based on retention time and ion ratio of coinciding peaks for at least two diagnostic transitions in the correct abundance ratio. The LC-MS SOP states that Retention Time should be within 2.5 % of the mean of the standards. The ion ratio of the two diagnostic ions (least abundant/most abundant) in the samples should be consistent with that obtained during validation and not deviate more than \u00b1 20 %. Page 23 of 103 11.3. Validation plan 11.3.1. Validation plan for TAs in cereal products A validation protocol for cereals was produced by RIKILT and all partners followed this. A summary is given in Table 4. The validation involved the analysis of replicate samples at different spiking conc entrations (1, 5 and 25 \u00b5g/kg). Each batch contained one main product that was spiked at three levels, as well as other, similar matrices , that were included as Quality Control (QC) samples. The validation series covered the following products: breakfast cereals , single grain flours, bread, and cookies. Full validation (3 series) was carried out for breakfast cereals, 1 validation series was performed for each of the other matrices (Table 4). Table 4. Samples selected for validation . Matrix Product 1 Product 2 Product 3 Breakfast cereals Multi -grain based cereal for young children Wheat bran flakes for breakfast Muesli with fruit and nuts Single grain flours Buckwheat flour Millet flour* Sorghum flour* Bread Wheat bread Multi -grain bread with seeds* White bread* Cookies Biscuits with fruit Sweet plain biscuits* Biscuits for children* Products listed with an * were included as additional QC samples in the validation of the method (when validating product 1). For breakfast cereal samples product 2 and 3 were used as QCs when validating product 1; product 1 and 3 were used as QC for prod uct 2 validation, and products 1 and 2 were QC for product 3 validation. 11.3.2. Validation plan for herbal teas A second protocol for validation of the method for teas was also received from RIKILT, which followed the same principle. This used green tea as matr ix to be validated, as it was difficult to find a blank tea matrix of any of the tea types that were included in the survey. The validation plan was followed with some additional analyses for black tea and all the product types selected for the survey. Page 24 of 103 11.3.3. Validation for calystegines For potato and aubergine no naturally blank materials were available. Therefore it was decided to use naturally incurred materials and check the method for repeatability and extraction efficiency by means of these materials. T he extraction efficiency was determined by extracting the samples twice. 11.4. Analytical Method - Extraction and Clean -Up The Standard Operating Procedure (method description, SOP) for extraction, clean - up and analysis of tropane alkaloids was provided to al l partners by RIKILT. The final version used for the survey and method validation is included here as Annex 2. Samples were extracted by shaking with an acidified methanol and water mixture. After centrifugation an aliquot of extract was cleaned up by s trong cation exchange SPE. The cleaned -up extracts were evaporated to dryness, reconstituted and filtered before being analysed by LC -MS/MS . As LC -MS/MS was accredited SOP for LC -MS analysis at Fera was followed. This stipulates criteria for ion ratio and retention time acceptance following the criteria outlined in SANCO/12571/2013 (Pesticides criteria document). Further details of the LC -MS/MS conditions methods used at Fera are given below in section. 11.5. Preparation and extraction of herbal tea infusions (Herbal) tea infusions were prepared at RIKILT according to a standardised protocol ISO 3103 (ISO, 1980) (8). Sample portions of 2 gram of dry, ground, homogenised (herbal) tea were transferred to paper tea filter bags (t -sac size 2, t -sac, Hannover, Germany), which was positioned in a 250 ml beaker. Boiling water (150 ml) was poured into the beaker, making sure that the tea bag was fully immersed. The sample was left to stand for 4.5 min, and subsequently, the tea bag was gently swirled around by hand in the beaker for 30 s. The tea bag was removed from the beaker and before d isposal most of the adhering infusion was gently pressed out into the beaker. An aliquot of 37.5 mL tea infusion was transferred to a polypropylene tube of 50 mL and 75 \u00b5L of formic acid was added. The tube was centrifuged for 15 min at 3500 rpm and all of the supernatant was used for SPE clean -up. For clean -up by SPE, an OASIS MCX 150 mg/6 cc (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) was used. The cartridges were conditioned with 6 mL of methanol and equilibrated with 6 mL 1% formic acid in water. The cartridges wer e loaded with 37.5 mL of tea infusion, washed with 6 mL methanol/water/formic acid, 75/25/1 (v/v/v) and dried under vacuum (using a vacuum manifold) for 5 -10 min. TAs were eluted from the Page 25 of 103 cartridges with 6 mL of methanol containing 0.5% ammonia (dry or ad ded from 25% conc. ammonia solution). Further steps in the sample preparation were identical as described above for cereal -based products and dry (herbal) teas. 11.6. LC-MS/MS analysis for tropane alkaloids in cereals and teas 11.6.1. LC-MS/MS Instrument settings For all LC-MS/MS methods the following conditions and equipment were flow: bar Source temperature: 150 oC Cone gas flow rate: 100 L/h Collision gas flow 0.15 mL/min Resolution: Unit mass SOP ( Annex 7.2.3 ) The SOP provided suggested LC-MS/MS parame ters, but with all methods of this type some optimisation for each specific instrument is required to ensure the best performance of the method. Therefore t he source tune parameters above differ slightly from those in the SOP (Annex 2 section 8.2.1) , as t hese were found to give the best results for the instruments used for the study. 11.6.2. LC-MS/MS Method - Chromatography conditions The following chromatography used: Column: Acquity BEH C 18 1.7 \u00b5m (150 x 2.1 mm) (Waters) Column temperature: 50 oC Injection volume: 2 \u00b5L Mobile phase A: 10 mM ammonium carbonate in water Mobile phase B: Acetonitrile Page 26 of 103 The LC gradient profile for the determination of tropane alkaloids is given in Table 5. The gradient profile differs slightly from that in the SOP (Annex 2 section 8.2.2) by the addition of the flush step at 99 % B . This was introduced to ensure the column and LC system were clean after each injection and prevent late eluting material carrying over from one injection to another. Table 5. Gradient timetable: Time / min % B Flow Rate 0.0 0 0.40 2.0 0 0.40 12.0 60 0.40 0 0.40 20.0 0 0.40 11.7. Data Analysis and Quantification Mass Lynx software (Waters) was used for dat a-evaluation. Peak assignment and integration were manually verified by the operator. Quantification was based on multi -level calibration using solvent standards . Where available a 3d-labelled internal standard was used to internally standardise the method, and inherently correct analytical results. 11.8. Quality Control All survey samples analysed at Fera were analysed with an acco mpanying overspiked sample so specific recovery information was obtained for each sample . Any sample found to be positive was repeated, with appropriate dilutions, to confirm the residues and levels present. In some cases where there were large concentra tion differences in the analytes in the samples this meant the sample was reanalysed multiple times at different dilution rates. For each batch of survey samples, one or more spiked samples (QC materials supplied by RIKILT) were included to assess method performance between batches and recovery for different commodities. MMRS samples ('after -spikes') were also included to allow an assessment of matrix effects and 'true' recovery. All calibration standards were supplied by RIKILT so all partners used comm on calibrants. Blank samples and spikes were supplied by RIKILT and were included in each batch. Solvent based calibration solutions were used for analysis and the QC in each batch increased instead of using matrix matched calibrants . Page 27 of 103 During the survey the European Reference Laboratory (EURL) for Mycotoxins organised two proficiency tests (PTs) for the analysis of atropine and scopolamine. One was for cereal products and the other was for tea samples. Analysis of these PT samples was carried out at th e same time as the survey analyses and results were submitted to the EURL. Fera performed well in both PTs, obtaining satisfactory Z-scores for all results for atropine and scopolamine for all matrices. This demonstrates the method is working well for atropine and scopalamine . 11.9. Reporting of Results The limit of detection (LOD) of the method was defined as the concentration of each analyte required to give a chromatographic peak with signal to noise (s:n) ratio 3. This was assessed by extrapolation f rom the s:n ratio of each analyte in the lowest calibration standard and then applying a correction for recovery to determine the LOD in matrix. The limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method was defined as the concentration of the lowest calibration sta ndard with s:n 3 and with a peak area fitting a calibration line with residuals 30 % and r2 0.95, again with a recovery correction applied to obtain the LOQ in matrix. Results were expressed as a numerical value corrected for recovery where the resi due was above the LOQ. Where no residue was detected the result was reported as <LOD, and the calculated (corrected) LOD given . Results were assessed and the recovery value calculated for individual analytes in all samples. Each sample was assessed and a n individual limit of quantification (LOQ) calculated. This took into account the apparent recovery from a spiked sample, therefore samples with a lower recovery had a higher apparent LOQ than might be suggested by measuring signal to noise (s : n) from s olvent calibration standards. This is a 'truer' representation of what could be measured in each sample type. Results are reported corrected for recovery and are in \u00b5g/kg , apart from calystegine results which are in mg/kg . Where labelled internal standa rd was added to the sample before extraction recovery correction was inherent to the procedure. For final reporting to EFSA a standard approach was adopted by RIKILT where the lowest calibration standard, or that which gives acceptable signal:noise was us ed as the reporting limit to ensure that all data was reported in a standardised format (Table 6, Table 7), (EFSA, 2016). This approach was also adopted for the UK samples. T herefore , in some cases, the true calculated reporting limits were lower than those reported for EFSA samples . For a small number of the additional UK samples low levels of TAs were measured at a concentration below the assigned reporting limit. These results are presented in parenthesis in the table s and have been reported for in formation only . For some Page 28 of 103 matrices, for example, some single grain flours, and the black and green tea samples , it was necessary to increase the reporting limit as there was a significant background that reduced the signal to noise ratio, or the recovery w as low. These are also highlighted in the results tables ( Table 23 to Table 27). 12. Results and Discussion 12.1. Method Validation Results - Cereals Initial validation was completed and t he data from this validation highlighted several problems, including problems with chromatography for some analytes, interferences in the chromatograms for some analytes, with poor peak shapes and variable LOQs for some matrices, buckwheat being the one of worst. It was concluded that using matrix matched calibration standards did not improve the analysis, unless the matrix was exactly the same as sample under test. Changes were made to the initial protocol to add a methanol wash during SPE, increase the ammonia content of the SPE elution solvent and to modify the chromatography conditions to use ammonium carbonate in the mobile phase. It was found that the pH is critical to the chromatographic performance for these analytes and best performance was obta ined when the mobile phase was maintained at pH 10 or higher. The validation was repeated and full results are given in the Validation Report attached as Annex 3. Recovery was determined from spiking samples before extraction and clean -up. This however also has the drawback of including any matrix effects (suppression or enhancement) and therefore the recovery value reported is not a 'true' recovery. The actual recovery of the procedure can be measured by comparison of the Matrix Matched Recovery sample s (MMRS) samples, which were spiked after extraction and clean -up, with samples spiked before extraction and clean -up. The MMRS samples were spiked at a level of 10 \u00b5g/kg. The summary of these results is given in Table 6 as well as the standardised LOD and LOQ values used to report data to EFSA. Page 29 of 103 Table 6.

In all cases the performance criteria for recovery and repeatability from Regulation (E C) No 401/2006 were met except for muesli and bread where the average recovery for bread matrix spiked at 1 \u00b5g/kg scopolamine which was outside the 60 to 120% recommended range. In all cases the MMRS recovery was acceptable. The apparent recovery values observed for the other analytes were much improved compared to the initial validation analyses, however there were instances of low recovery. However when the MMRS recovery values were considered, these values for the most part, were within the acceptable range, although tropinone and acetylscopolamine recovery was below 50% for several products. Buckwheat flour Page 30 of 103 was a problematic matrix with very low apparent recovery for many analytes, although true recovery from MMRS spikes was acceptable. In all cases the repeatabili ty of the method was very good with a maximum RSD (within batch variability) of 13% observed, even at the low spiking level of 1 \u00b5g/kg. This is well within the performance criteria from Regulation (E C) No 401/2006. The validation of all four partner labo ratories is presented in the EFSA report and there is excellent agreement between the laboratories. 12.2. Method Validation Results - Teas The final SOP (Annex 2) also includes the modified procedure for teas. The modification was to load half the volume of s ample extract onto the SPE cartridge. The concentration of the required calibration standard solutions was therefore also different. The validation plan used was as described in section 11.3. A copy of the Fera validation report for teas is given as Annex 4. Although less sample extract was cleaned -up before analysis the tea sample s contained numerous interferences in the chromatograms, particularly for the lower m/z tropanes. In some cases (tropine, scopoline and convolvine) these interferences, or a high background, affected the analyte peak such that it was necessary to quantify using a different transition to that specified in the SOP. In cases where interferences could not be avoided and affect quantification of the spikes, the spike concentrations have been corrected by subtraction of the calculated concentration in the associ ated blank. In the case of nortropinone, an interference made it impossible to quantify the spikes at 1 \u00b5g/kg. A summary of the recovery data obtained for the 10 \u00b5g/kg spikes as well as the standardised LODs and LOQs for Fera are given in Table 7. Validation data for all partners is given in the EFSA report, the data produced by all laboratories was very consistent. Page 31 of 103 Table 7.

QC samples were also run with each batch of tea samples. These QC consisted of blank green tea, a sample of this green tea spiked at 10 \u00b5g/kg at Fera, a sample spiked at 10 \u00b5g/kg at RIKILT and a blank extract spiked at a level equivalen t to 10 \u00b5g/kg after extraction and clean -up (i.e. MMRS). In addition, an MMRS was also prepared for each of the eight different types of tea which were sampled. These were used to calculate the actual recovery by comparison with the same sample spiked be fore extraction and clean -up. This actual recovery takes into account the whole analytical procedure and accounts for any matrix suppression or enhancement effects that occur in the mass spectrometer. Therefore it is a real indication of the performance of the method. Lemon balm gave the lowest recoveries of all the products tested in the validation with recoveries in the range 23 - 74%. Most alkaloids gave acceptable recovery performance, however the low molecular weight Page 32 of 103 tropane alkaloid compounds tend ed to have lower recovery for all sample types. Repeatability was excellent for all analytes at all levels in all matrices tested with RSD values ranging from <1% to 19% for 6 replicate analyses at any individual level, even where recovery values were low . The large variation in \"recovery\" values for the same analyte in different types of tea highlights that it would not be possible to accurately quantify residues in a particular tea using matrix extracted standards in a different type of tea. For this reason, survey samples were analysed using solvent calibration standards, with each sample analysed alongside an overspike to allow individual recovery values to be calculated. 12.3. Method validation Results - Herbal tea infusions Validation of the procedure f or the preparation of herbal tea infusions and analysis of the infusions was only conducted at RIKILT who carried out all analyses of tea infusions. The validation focussed on the extraction of the TAs from the tea infusion. However, the efficiency of ex traction of TAs from the solid tea during tea preparation was also taken into account. Low LODs and LOQs could be achieved for many of the Convolvulaceae -type and Datura -type TAs. For the low MW TAs the LODs and LOQs were higher, but this was in accordan ce with the results obtained for the dry teas. Recoveries from tea infusion varied between 70 and 100% with acceptable repeatability for most TAs, except for a few low MW TAs. The efficiency of extraction of TAs from dry tea during tea preparation was be tween 60 and 85% for most TAs. Exceptions were the Convolvulaceae -type TAs which were extracted with lower (50 - 60%) efficiency and apoatropine that had an extraction efficiency of 43%. This compound is relatively lipophilic that may not be extracted well with (hot) water. The low MW TAs were extracted efficiently, indicating that evaporation from the hot infusion is likely to be negligible . 12.4. Method performance The method was less robust for some of the low molecular weight tropane alkaloids that elute very early in the chromatography run. Due to the early elution time these compounds are more prone to poor peak shape and subject to interferences which makes qua ntification difficult in some cases. If in the future it is decided these compounds are significant or need to be controlled then it may be appropriate to consider developing a separate targeted method for them, perhaps using Hydrophobic Interaction Liqui d Chromatography (HILIC). The current method, as it is a multi -toxin method that covers a broad range of molecular weights and polarity and pKa values, is by necessity a compromise as it cannot be optimised for all analytes as they are chemically differen t. It was suitable for this large survey to give Page 33 of 103 an insight into the levels of tropane alkaloids and the high level of QC analyses included with the survey gives a high degree of confidence for the results reported. 12.5. Method validation results - calystegin es The method validation for calystegines was carried out at RIKILT and the two other partner laboratories. RIKILT validation results for the potato and aubergine method validation are are shown in Table 8, as all UK samples for calystegines were analysed by RIKILT. Good recoveries (between 83 and 98%) were obtained for the calystegines. On the basis of these results it was decided to report the results without correction for the recovery. Table 8.

Sample results - EFSA samples The full results of the EFSA samples were submitted to EFSA and FSA in the EFSA SSD spreadsheet format . The results were reported in a standardised format for LOD and LOQ to allow consistency within the overall data set. Overall in the EFSA survey 1305 samples were analysed for the 24 TAs, and a further 404 samples were analysed for calystegines. In total 227 UK samples (197 cereal products , 10 green beans and vegetables and 20 teas) were analysed for TAs for the EFSA survey. Sixty -nine UK samples ( 48 cereal products , 12 oilseeds and 9 teas) were analysed as additional UK samples. A summary of the TA results for the UK samples analysed at Fera for the EFSA survey is given in Table 9. The full results of all UK EFSA samples are given in Table 12 to 27. In addition 44 samples of UK retail potatoes and 15 samples of UK retail aubergines were analysed for calystegines by RIKILT for the EFSA survey, so 286 UK samples were analysed in total. Page 34 of 103 13.1. Cereal products results At least one sample of each of the cereal food categories was found to contain tropane alkaloids, although in many cases the levels measured were extremely low. Buckwheat contained the fewest residues with only 1 sample out of 18 found to contain very low levels of atropine and scopolamine (<1 \u00b5g/kg total) (individual result s in Table 12). 13.1.1. Breakfast cereal results Breakfast cereals w ere also found to have infrequent low levels of tropane alkaloids, with only 2 out of 30 samples containing alkaloids (Table 13). Atropine and scopolamine were the on ly alkaloids found . The h ighest level s found were and 0.38 \u00b5g/kg scopolamine high bran cereal . 13.1.2. Maize product results Maiz e products showed a similar contamination pattern, with 2 out of 13 products found to contain alkaloids, but only atropine and scopolamine were detected (Table 14). The sample that contained the highest level of 0.63 \u00b5g/kg atropine and 0.16 \u00b5g/kg scopolamine was a corn meal product from an ethnic supermarket (S16 - 003305) . 13.1.3. Bread and pasta results Only 5 out of 33 bread and pasta samples contained tropane alkaloids, although in addition to atropine and scopolamine , one other a lkaloid (anisodamine) w as also detected. The highest level of any alkaloid f ound in these products was 0.15 \u00b5g/kg , with no sample above 1 \u00b5g/kg total alkaloids (Table 15). 13.1.4. Biscuits and baked goods results Biscuits and baked goods were also found to contain alkaloids, although again at very low levels (Table 16). In total 5 out of 32 samples contained detectable alkaloids, atropine was found i n 5 samples and scopolamine was also detected in two of those samples . The highest level found was 1.23 \u00b5g/kg atropine and 0.65\u00b5g/kg scopolamine in sample S15 -100636, a sample of buckwheat galettes (pancakes). 13.1.5. Millet, sorghum and other flours results Millet, sorghum and other flours contained the broadest range of tropane alkaloids, with one sample containing up to 11 different alk aloids. This was sample S16 -Page 35 of 103 003153, a sample of yellow millet supplied by an on -line retailer. This sample contained 9.8 \u00b5g/kg atropine and 12.9 \u00b5g/kg scopolamine in addition to 8 other alkaloids. The total alkaloid content was 33. 6 \u00b5g/kg . Overall 3 out of 25 samples of millet and other cereals contained tropane alkaloids (Table 17). Page 36 of 103 Table 9.

Infant foods results Of the 46 infant foods analysed for this part of the survey 1 4 were found to contain tropane alkaloids, with some samples containing as many as 8 different alkaloids (Table 18). Seven samples were found to contain atropine above the reporting limit of 0.05 \u00b5g/kg, with three of these above the regulatory limit of 1 \u00b5g/kg laid down in Regulation (EU) No 339/2016 (3) . Five samples contained detectable residues at very low levels below the reporting limit, but these have not been reported as positive findings due to the higher uncertainty associated with these results. The highest level of atropine found was 3.73 \u00b5g/kg in a sample of fruit crunch cereal (S15 -100580) . This sample also contained 0.51 \u00b5g/kg scopolamine, which was the highest level of scopolamine found in these products. Four samples contained tropine at concentrations ranging from 109 to 773 \u00b5g/kg . These samples also contained several other alkaloids , mainly the convolamine type indicating the source was Convolvulaceae -type plants . Sample S16 -003181 contained the highest of tropine (773 \u00b5g/kg), it also contained 1.25 convolamine, convolidine, fillalbine, pseudotropine, scopolamine and tropinone. A similar pattern was also seen in sample S15 -100583. These products both contained millet as an ingredient, but also contained vegetables including red pepper, which was a f ood type identified in the literature search as a possible source of alkaloids. It should be noted that all baby food samples were analysed 'as received'. In some cases the products would be reconstituted with water or milk before consumption. The samples that contained the highest levels of alkaloids, including those that exceeded the regulatory limit for atropine, were all dried products that would be reconstituted before consumption . 13.2. Vegetable results Only 10 samples of green beans and stir fry mixes were analysed in the survey as these were considered to be a low risk source of alkaloids in the diet. Three of the vegetable samples were found to contain alkaloids although none contained atropine or scopolamine (Table 19). The highest level found was 571 \u00b5g/kg tropine in SS16 - 003258 a sample of frozen stir fry vegetables. The sample also contained convolamine, convolidine, fillabine, pseudotropine and t ropinone although at much lower levels than tropine. T wo other samples showed similar patterns of alkaloid occurrence, but the tropine levels were much lower at 24.1\u00b5g/kg (S16 -003262) and 27.9 \u00b5g/kg (S16 -003264), both were stir fry mixes. None of the gre en beans contained tropane alkaloids. Page 38 of 103 13.3. Herbal tea results 13.3.1. Dry herbal tea results The tea samples were the products that were mo st frequently found to contain tropane alkaloids (Table 20). Twenty herbal tea samples were analysed , 16 were found to contain some tropane alkaloids . Of the 16 samples containing TAs, 8 contained scopolamine and 1 0 contained atropine above the reporting limit of 0.1 \u00b5g/kg each . Several other alkaloids were also found in the samples . One sample of peppermint tea contain ed eight different alkaloids. This sample (S16 - 003243) contained 50.2 \u00b5g/kg atropine and 34.1 \u00b5g/kg scopolamine. The highest level of atropine measured was 129 \u00b5g/kg in sampl e S16 -003246 , a This and tropine) at low concentrations. These concentrations were measured in the dry tea from t he tea bags. It must be noted that the analysis of the teas was quite difficult particularly for tropine and tropinone. There were interferences in the chromatograms and for some analytes the third choice of transition had to be used to quantify the ana lyte as the other transitions contained interferences. This resulted in higher reporting limits (LOD and LOQ) for these products than some of the other samples tested in the survey (Table 7). Some of the tropine results were not confirmed as either it was not possible to determine two transitions to calculate an ion ratio to confirm the results or because the ion ratio of two t ransitions failed as one contained an interference. The levels reported for tropine ranged from 1 to 14 \u00b5g/kg, but only one result was confirmed. Results for atropine and scopolamine were not affected as internal standards were used. As part of the EFSA study, Fera was asked to carry out some confirmation analyses for some samples of tea initially analysed by VSCHT, Czech Republic. They had found high levels of alkaloids, particularly convolvine, at concentrations up to 8 mg/kg. RIKILT had not been able to confirm these results and Fera was asked to carry out third party analysis to confirm the results. The results Fera found were more aligned to the VSCHT results, although the highest level found was 4074 \u00b5g/kg convolvine in the sample that VSCHT had r eported >8000 \u00b5g/kg. This sample also contained several other alkaloids including tropine, atropine and scopolamine. Most alkaloid levels were in good agreement between the three labs, it was only the convolvine concentration that varied. The reason for the discrepancy between results is still not clear but could be due to inefficient extraction or saturation / overloading of the clean -up columns. Fera's results were included in the SSD spreadsheet submitted to EFSA , and are reported in the EFSA survey report (Mulder et al, 2016) . Page 39 of 103 13.3.2. Results for herbal tea infusions RIKILT studied th e efficiency of the transfer of TAs from herbal tea to the tea infusion by using a selection of contaminated dry herbal teas. Twenty herbal teas from all partners were selecte d that contained the highest TA content and in which at least one TA was present at 10 \u00b5g/kg. Detailed results of the infusions from UK samples were not reported separately to Fera. The results of the infusions are reported as collated data in the EFSA r eport as a percentage of the concentration reported for the dry tea (page 56, Figure 12, Mulder et al, 2016) . Tea infusions were prepared using a standardised protocol (ISO 3103, ISO 1980) ( Section 11.5). The results obtained for the tea infusions were compared with those obtained for the corresponding dry teas, to calculate the extraction efficiency of the boiling water. A relatively wide variation was observed , however it was concluded that in general the extraction from the dry tea by infusion was less than 100% (or more precise ly: less than 100% compared to the solvent extraction procedure used for dry tea). Transfer efficiency was hig hly variable, but on average a transfer of 47% was obtained for the 20 teas included in the study across all TAs measured . Atropine and scopolamine were both present in 19/20 of these samples and for these two compounds the average transfer efficiency was 54% and 42% respectively . Higher average (70%) extraction efficiency for infusion preparation had been derived for the TAs, including atropine (71%) and scopolamine (84%) during the initial method validation . However this was performed with dry tea samp les that were spiked with TA standards before infusion preparation. The transfer from the incurred survey samples was lower as the TAs are bound within the tea matrix, whereas for the spiked samples the TAs are on the surface of the tea leaves. The highest level of atropine found in a UK tea sample was 129 \u00b5g/kg. If it is presumed a tea bag is 2g, and that approximately 50% of the atropine is extracted during infusion preparation then a drink prepared from this material would contain 129 ng of a tropine . Due to the heterogenous nature of the contamination this will vary but it gives an indication of likely intake from this product. Page 40 of 103 13.4. Calystegine results - Aubergines and potatoes A summary of calystegine results is given in Table 10. All samples contained some detectable calystegines. Calystegine A3, calystegine B2 and calystegine detected in potatoes . Calystegine A3 was detected at the highest concentration (max followed by calystegine B2 and A5 was present in a small number of samples (6 samples ) at low levels. Calystegine B3 was not detected in any of the UK potato samples. The full results for potatoes are given in Table 21. Calystegine A3, calystegine B1 and calystegine B2 calystegine A3, calystegine A5 and calystegine not detected in UK bought samples . Calystegine B2 was detected at the highest concentration in aubergine , the highest level found was 124.8 mg/kg (Table 22). Table 10.

Cereal products Results - UK samples A summary of the FSA survey sample results is given in Table 11. 13.5.1. Single grain flour results Five single grain flours purchased in retail stores did not contain detectable tropane alkaloids. The samples were wheat flour, rye and spelt (Table 23). Seventeen samples were collected and supplied by nabim (National Association of British and Irish Millers). These were mainly wholemeal wheat flour, but also included one buckwheat and one millet flour. Samples for use in ethnic foods were requested and two samples were specifically labelled as chapatti flour. Most of the Page 41 of 103 samples were of UK origin but the buckwheat and millet were from China, and two wheat flour samples were labelled as produced from grain from Kazhakstan & Russia. No alkaloids were detected in any of the samples above the reporting limits (Table 24). 13.5.2. Maize products results Six maize products were analysed, of these 2 contained low levels of tropane alkaloids. One sample of polenta and 0.06 \u00b5g/kg a sample of gluten free pa sta (S15 -100708) contained a very low level of atropine (0.05 \u00b5g/kg) (Table 23). Table 11.

Infant foods results Twenty samples of infant foods were analysed, of these 9 samples were found to contain tropane alkaloids with several samples containing multiple alkaloids (Table 25). The sample that contained the highest level of tropane alkaloids was S15 - 100702, a cereal based savoury meal that contained millet and vegetables including red pepper. In fact, it was the same product that was found to contain the highest levels for the EFSA samples. It contained 1.14 \u00b5g/kg of atropine, 0.26 \u00b5g/kg scopolamine as well as 492 \u00b5g/kg tropine and several other alkaloids (8 i n total). As Page 42 of 103 noted above all samples were analysed 'as received', the samples with the highest levels of alkaloids would be reconstituted before consumption. A sample of ready to eat Thai curry (S16 -003292) contai ned 7 alkaloids, convolamine, convolidine and a trace amount of atropine. Three other ethnic baby foods also contained low levels of varying amounts of convolidine, nortropinone, pseudotropine, tropine (0.88 \u00b5g/kg ) was found in a sample of a savoury cereal based product that also contained vegetables and millet (S16 -003294). The cereal based products were sampled to contain millet or sorghum as an ingredient, however ther e appeared to be a consistent pattern that the breakfast cereal or products containing fruit did not contain tropane alkaloids, whereas the savoury or main meal products that contained vegetable s did contain tropane alkaloids. Also, all four samples of re ady to eat ethnic meals contained detectable alkaloids , these were vegetable based, although some did contain meat, but had little if any cereal ingredients . This could suggest that the contribution to the alkaloid content comes from the vegetable ingredi ents and not the cereal component . Only one sample exceeded the EU maximum level for atropine, this was sample S15 -100702, which was just above the 1 \u00b5g/kg limit. 13.6. Oilseeds results Twelve samples of oilseeds or oilseed containing products were analysed, a nd only one was found to contain very low levels of atropine (0.11 \u00b5g/kg ) and scopolamine was sample S16 -001242 which was a sample of organic flaxseed (linseed) from Canada. 13.7. Black and green tea results Nine samples of black (5 samples) and green (4 samples) of tea were analysed (Table 27). Two sample s contained low levels of scopolamine, one at 0.15 \u00b5g/kg (black tea S16 -003249) and one at 0.05 \u00b5g/kg (black tea, S16 -003241) although this level was below the reporting limit of 0.1 \u00b5g/kg and could not be confirmed by ion ratio. 14. Conclusions A comprehensive literature review was completed . This highlighted possible sources of tropane alkaloids in foods , and foods likely to be contaminated with TAs . Th is information was used to deve lop the sampling plan s used for the EFSA and FSA Page 43 of 103 survey s. Sources of contamination were identified as Datura type seeds in some products and the increase of Convolvulus type weeds in fields of food crops. Calystegines were also included in the review. These are inherent toxins found in mainly Solanaceae plants. Potatoes and aubergines were included in the sampling plan as the major source of these compounds in the diet Food types identified as being the most important to sample were cereal based foods including those that contain millet, sorghum and poppy seed; infant foods, (containing millet, sorghum ); maize products, single grain flours , especially buckwheat; canned or frozen green beans and vegetable mixes and herbal teas. Oilseeds, black & green tea, some cereal products and infant food, in particular ethnic infant food or infant food containing millet were sampled for the UK only survey . Potatoes and aubergines were included for calystegine analysis. The review concluded very little is known about the toxicity of TAs other than atropine and scopolamine . Therefore as many TAs as possible should be included in the analytical method. TAs for which reliable analytical standards are available were included to increase the knowledge base about the o ccurrence of these compounds in foods. Method validation was carried out for cereals and teas. Overall the method is satisfactory for most analytes, the validation showed recovery met the required criteria, and the method had good repeatability. The method has been demonstrated to meet the required performance criteria for atropine and scopolamine by the results of the validation exercise and QC data generated during the survey and participation using this method in a PT run by the EURL for atropine a nd scopolamine g ave 100% satisfactory results. A total 227 UK samples (197 cereal products, 10 green beans and stir fry vegetables and 20 teas) were analysed for TAs for the EFSA survey. Green beans and vegetable stir fry mixes contained TAs at levels from <1 \u00b5g/kg up to 571 \u00b5g/kg tropine, up to 6 TAs were found in individual samples. An additional 52 UK retail samples (20 cereal based infant foods, 11 single grain flours and maize products, 12 oilseeds and 9 teas), and 17 single grain flours sampled di rectly at mills were analysed for TAs on behalf of the FSA. Overall the TA levels were low in the additional UK samples. Of 11 cereal based foods only 2 contained very low levels of TAs. Oilseeds and green & black tea showed similar results, only 1 out of 12 and 2 out of 9 samples respectively contained TAs at trace Page 44 of 103 levels. UK milled flours (17 samples) did not contain any TAs. Infant foods were the category where most TAs were detected, 9 out of 20 samples contained TAs, with up to 8 TAs measured in i ndividual samples. One sample contained atropine at 1.14 \u00b5g/kg. For the breakfast cereals 2 out of 30 samples contain ed alkaloids , only a tropine and scopolamine were detected. The highest levels found were 0.67 \u00b5g/kg atropine and 0.38 \u00b5g/kg scopolamine in a high bran cereal. Only 2 out of 13 maize products contained TAs, again only atropine and scopolamine were detected. For bread and pasta only 5 out of 33 samples contained TAs, as well as atropine and scopolamine one other alkaloid (anisodamine) was also detected. A small number of biscuits and baked goods contained alkaloids at very low levels. In total 5 out of 32 samples contained atropine and scopolamine was also detected in 2 of those samples. The highest level found was 1.23 \u00b5g/kg atropine an d 0.65\u00b5g/kg scopolamine in buckwheat galettes (pancakes). Millet, sorghum and other flours contained the broadest range of tropane alkaloids, with one sample containing up to 10 different alkaloids. This was a sample of yellow millet that contained 9.8 \u00b5 g/kg atropine and 12.9 \u00b5g/kg scopolamine as well as 8 other alkaloids. The total TA content was 33.6 \u00b5g/kg. Overall 4 out of 25 samples of millet and other cereals group contained tropane alkaloids. Cereal based infant foods are the only products includ ed in th is survey where maximum levels of 1 \u00b5g/kg each for atropine and scopolamine are in force (3). Four out of 66 UK samples were found to exceed these levels in this survey, (3/46 for the EFSA survey and 1/20 for the FSA survey). The highest level found was 3.73 \u00b5g/kg atropine. All the samples that exceeded the limit were dry products, they were analysed as received but would be reconstituted before consumption. The se products contained vegetables , including pepper, as well as c ereal and it is likely these were the source of the TAs. Vegetables from the Solanaceae family were identified in the literature review as a possible source of tropane alkaloids . Several infant foods contained high levels of tropine (up to 773 \u00b5g/kg), an d up to 8 different alkaloids were also found in some samples. The results from some of the vegetable samples analysed (high tropine levels) would support this. The relevance of the other TAs measured is hard to evaluate due to the lack of toxicity data about these compounds. Herbal teas were found to be commonly contaminated with TAs. Sixteen out of 20 teas from the UK contained detectable TAs. The highest level found was 129 \u00b5g/kg Page 45 of 103 atropine in a peppermint tea sample . Tea infusions were prepared fr om a selection of teas and analysed for TAs at RIKILT. On average it was found that approximately 47% of the TAs present in naturally incurred dry tea transferred to the infusion. UK purchased samples of potatoes and aubergines were analysed for calyst egines at RIKILT. Forty four samples of potatoes and 15 samples of aubergines were analysed. The two vegetables showed different contamination patterns. Levels in potatoes were on the whole higher than aubergines . Calystegine A3, calystegine B2 and cal ystegine B4 were predominantly detected in potatoes . The highest found was 310 mg/kg calystegine A3. Calystegine A3, calystegine B1 more frequently in aubergines . Calystegine B2 was detected at the highest concentration in aubergine, the highest concentration measured was 124.8 mg/kg.

INTRODUCTION The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has delivered a scientific opinion on the risks to human and animal health related to the presence of tropane alkaloids (TAs) in food and feed. Although more than 200 different TAs have been identified in various plants, data on their toxicity and occurrence in food are limited and the EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) could only perform a risk assessment on ( -)-hyoscyamine and ( -)- scopolamine (EFSA 2013). Results were reported on the levels of TAs in 124 food samples collected in the Netherlands and Germany. Most of the food samples (83 %) did not contain detectable TAs but almost all of the food samples that did contain TAs were in the food category 'Cereal -based food for infants and young children' especially those products intended to be to be reconstituted with milk or other appropriate nutritious liquids. They comprised simple cereals (wheat, maize, rye, oats, rice and mixtures thereof). The CONTAM Panel recommended that the occurrence of TAs in food either naturally or as contaminants be better characterised. This report reviews the occ urrence of TAs in food plants and in weed plants that both contain TAs and have a strong potential to contaminate foods. The objective was to provide a recommendation of the food samples to be analysed for TAs within the EFSA project. The information was o btained by means of a literature search using the terms of an agreed strategy provided in the Appendix, and through studies in the Fera Information Centre and its available on -line sources. The search did not include literature that was not in the English language. TAs for which no standard were believed to be available, and cocaine and other TAs used for recreational drugs were excluded. In view of the considerable quantity of data concerning the occurrence and toxicity of atropine and scopolamine and the EFSA interest in the remaining TAs the focus of the review was on the less familiar TAs including calystegines. 1.1 Chemistry of TAs 1.1.1 -tropane -triol) short chain acids such as acetic acid, propanoic acid, isobutyric acid, isovaleric acid, 2 -methylbutyric acid, (+) --hydroxy --phenylpropionic acid, tropic acid Atropine and esters (3 -hydroxytropane) and S -(-)-tropic acid. The alkaloid part of TAs is a two -ringed structure characterized by a pyrrolidine and a piperidine ring sharing a single nitrogen atom and two c arbon atoms. The asymmetric -carbon of tropic acid esters allows the formation of two stereoisomers. Hyoscyamine is synthesised in the plant as the optically active S -(-)- form and undergoes racemisation over time, so that both the R -(+)- and the S -(-)- forms are found in plants in varying Annex 1. Literature review on Tropane Alkaloids in Food ratio (Eich 2008). Analytical extraction procedures may affect the isomerisation and usually do not distinguish between the products and so in this review the name atropine will refer to the racemic mixture or an unspeci fied isomer. TAs are synthesized in the young root cells and translocated to the aerial parts of the plant (Hashimoto et al. , 1991). The synthesis proceeds from ornithine and produces tropinone and then tropine (Zhang et al. , 2007) which is esterified to f orm littorine. Littorine is transformed to (-)-hyoscyamine by at least two routes and scopolamine is formed from ( -)-hyoscyamine (Li et al., 2006). Tropinone reductases are key enzymes of TA formation. Two different tropinone reductases are involved, one forming tropine, leading to esterified alkaloids, and the other forming pseudotropine that is converted to the related TA known as calystegines (Dr\u00e4ger 1994, Keiner et al. 2000). Figure 1. Structures atropine and scopolamine 1.1.2 Calystegines Calystegines are polyhydroxy alkaloids with a nortropane skeleton. About 15 calystegines are known, and those most C1. Not all of th ese are available commercially as reference standards. Figure 2. Structures of the most common calystegines OOH ONCH3 OOH ON OCH3 Alkaloids in Food 2. IDENTIFICATION OF RELEVANT ASSOCIATED PLANTS: To identify the TA containing plants that might contaminate food, cases of intoxication by TAs reported in the EU were studied and associated plants characterised. In addition the European Union's Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) was searched for alerts and notifications on TA or the presence of TA producing plants. 2.1 Reported cases of intoxication in the EU Many reports of the acute effects of TAs in humans have resulted from deliberate ingestion in order to experience hallucinogenic effects (Boumba et al. 2004). Accidental ingestion of tropane - containing plants is also comparatively common. Seven people were poisoned by consumption of cooked wild collected spinach (blites) that contained leaves of Datura innoxia (Papoutsis et al. 2010). The cooked vegetabl es contained atropine and scopolamine at 0.8 and 1.2 mg/kg, respectively. The patients recovered with hospital treatment. Serious poisoning of a nine year old boy resulted from the ingestion of 20 -25 Atropa belladonna berries (Lange et al. 1990), the sympt oms being confused with a psychosis. A similar confusion surrounded the accidental poisoning of an elderly but healthy man with A. belladonna berries (Trabattoni et al. 1984). Three of four adults who ingested cooked ripened A. belladonna berries became de lirious with visual hallucinations, one becoming comatose. One other adult and four children exhibited mild peripheral anticholinergic symptoms (Schneider et al. 1996). Plant exposures are the fourth most common category of poisoning in Germany, accountin g for 22% of paediatric exposures. 58,641 cases involving 248 different plant genera were reported from 1998 to 2004 of which about 10 % of cases had noticeable symptoms. In a separate German analysis of 111,313 calls to a regional poison control centre ov er a twenty year period from 1974, 56% referred to children and 44% to adults with plant ingestion being the cause of 9.7% of cases. Analysis of severe poisonings by plants reported to the Swiss Toxicological Information Center from 1966 to 1994 showed that of 24,950 cases the clinical course was either mild or unknown (Jaspersen -Schib et al. 1996). Poisoning was severe in 152 cases whi ch could be associated with 24 plants which included A. belladonna (42 cases), Aconitum napellus (4 cases) and Hyoscyamus niger (3 cases). From 174 exposures of children toxic plants recorded in the Czech Republic over a 6 -year period from 1996 to 2001 th e most frequent cases (15%) resulted from ingestion of Datura seeds (Vichova et al. 2003). Screening the literature for reports on food -related intoxications led to eleven cases concerning TAs described within the period from 1978 to 2010, as reported in a review by Adamse and van Egmond (2010). Five of these cases concerned documented or suspected contamination of different types of herbal teas; i.e. burdock ( ( Ilex paraguariensis ) tea (CDC, 1995). Annex 1. Literature review on Tropane Alkaloids in Food In the survey data reported in the EFSA Opinion of 2013 (EFSA 2013) of food samples from the Netherlands (112 samples) and Ger many (12 samples) 93 were within the food group \"Food for infants and small children\" of which 19 samples in the \"Simple cereals that are or have to be reconstituted with milk or other appropriate nutritious liquids\" had mean atropine + scopolamine concent rations of 4.5 \u00b5g/kg at the Lower Bound limit and 4.9 \u00b5g/kg at the Upper Bound limit with the major contamination frequency (50%) being in the cereal products that were indicated specifically for toddlers (a total of 28) with food for both toddlers and inf ants, having lower levels in five products. Datura is an invasive wild plant that appears to readily contaminate buckwheat ( Fagopyrum sagittatum ) and have serious health effects even at low doses (clinical manifestations were reported from ingestion of buc kwheat seeds contaminated at a level of 190 seeds of D. stramonium per kg of buckwheat seeds (Perhari 2005). Buckwheat products are attractive to people who are intolerant of the gluten found in wheat. In Slovenia in 2003, 73 cases of domestic food poiso ning with mild to moderate effect were associated with ingestion of a traditional dish containing buckwheat flour, which is commonly used in Slovenia (Perhari 2005). Four samples of the flour were shown to contain atropine and scopolamine but it is not cl ear if the scope of analysis included other TAs. The whole buckwheat grain contained up to 190 seeds of Datura stramonium per kg of grain. Atropine and/or scopolamine was detected (> 3 \u00b5g/kg) in 20 of 43 buckwheat samples with the highest levels (26 mg/kg and 12 mg/kg of atropine and scopolamine respectively) found in the flour consumed by a family of eight people. The level of consumption was between 53 and 140 \u00b5g/kg body weight for atropine and between 25 and 64 \u00b5g/kg body weight for scopolamine. In Slove nia all buckwheat flour and buckwheat flour products were recalled and legislation on grain purity and buckwheat flour amended. This incident was followed up by a survey of 75 samples of buckwheat grain and buckwheat food products collected in Slovenia (P erhari et al. 2013). The survey samples comprised 12 wholegrain buckwheat, 13 samples of groats, 34 flour, 8 pasta, 4 bread and 4 ganci (semi - prepared fermented buckwheat product) products. Fifty of the products were analysed by gas chromatography with m ass spectrometry (GC -MS). 18 samples contained atropine and scopolamine at levels above the limit of quantification (LOQ) of 30 \u00b5g/kg. Of these eleven were flours, four were pasta, and three were \"ganci\". The maximum contamination level of 26 mg/kg atropi ne and 12 mg/kg scopolamine was in buckwheat flour from Hungary. Of the 18 positive samples 11 were from Hungary, 4 from the Czech Republic, 2 from China and 1 from Slovenia. The TA content of the positive samples was 1.9 mg/kg atropine and 1 mg/kg scopola mine with a median content of 0.25 and 1.0 mg/kg, respectively. An episode of buckwheat contamination was reported by Rancic and Spasic (2009). A large consignment (about 3000 kg) of buckwheat flour imported from a neighbouring country into Serbia in 2001 was analysed after a case of poisoning was reported. Seeds resembling those of D. stramonium were separated and analysed by automated multicolumn high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection which confirmed the presence of atropine and scopolamine. Annex 1. Literature review on Tropane Alkaloids in Food Atropine and scopolamine were found in buckwheat in France in 2007, and examination of the data in 2008 led to the setting a provisional threshold level of 0.02 mg/kg in flour intended for human consumption in France. The sum of atropine and scop olamine in the samples measured in 2007 was above 1000 \u00b5g/kg in ten samples with a maximum of 7.4 mg/kg. Five samples of buckwheat grain and 29 samples of buckwheat flour were measured in 2008 of which the sum of atropine and scopolamine exceeded 1 mg/kg i n two samples (Afssa 2008). A stock of Breton buckwheat that contained seeds of Datura caused poisoning in a large area of south -eastern France in September 2012 after it was purchased by a mill in the Alpes de Haute Provence (Glaizal et al. 2013). All of the victims had consumed bread, or in two cases homemade foods, prepared from organic buckwheat flour. The flour was sold in various bakeries and specialty food stores but was supplied by the same source, which was a grain company operating throughout the European Union. Tens of tons of this stock were distributed to four specialized organic mills in Brittany and to a lesser extent in Provence. Flour produced from the seeds was sold in over one hundred bakeries and was passed to retail outlets, organic sho ps, and restaurants. Contaminated flour or finished products such as black bread, and pancakes, etc. were distributed from the only mill located in Provence to not only the six departments of the Provence -Alpes -C\u00f4te d'Azur region but also to Corsica, Rhone -Alpes and Languedoc -Roussillon. Within less than 2 months, 24 people from the Provence -Alpes -Cotes d'Azur and Languedoc - Roussillon regions went to accident and emergency departments with symptoms of intoxication. Poisoning by buckwheat contaminated with Datura was confirmed in most (19) of these patients who were from 12 different households. In Rhone -Alpes, 14 people from 9 different households were intoxicated. The distribution chain and chemical analysis linked the contamination of buckwheat to seeds o f Datura sp. in the Breton area. Levels of atropine and scopolamine in the flour sent to the Proven\u00e7al region were much higher (16,467 and 7,042 mg/kg respectively) than in other mills (no data were provided for Brittany). Cases of poisoning were recorded from some places over a month after the withdrawal and in Rh\u00f4ne -Alpes a case was reported after five months. In 2011 Caligiani et al. (2011) measured atropine and scopolamine in buckwheat fruits, flours and retail foods sold in Italy. No TAs were found abo ve an LOQ of 1 \u00b5g/g in buckwheat fruits (2), flours (7) or food products made from buckwheat (3 pasta, 2 porridge, 1 cracker, and 1 flakes). Eight adults were poisoned in the Netherlands in 2013 in two or more incidents involving consumption of herbal tea prepared from dried marshmallow root (approximately 20 g), some of the cases were linked, and in all cases the tea came from the same supplier (van Riel et al. 2014). A similar case was reported in France with the herbal tea being purchased in The Netherl ands. The atropine content of the tea was high (1 -10 mg/g) and the plant source believed to be Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade). The Althaea officinalis was harvested in Bulgaria and sold only in The Netherlands. The patients had anticholinergic sympt oms (dry mucous membranes, nausea, blurred vision, hallucinations, tachycardia, and urinary retention) typical of tropane poisoning. Frozen mixed vegetables contaminated with Datura stramonium were sold via the largest market chain in Finland in May of 2013 (Termala et al. 2014). A total of 28 poisonings were suspected and 10 patients had anticholinergic symptoms. The products were recalled and Annex 1. Literature review on Tropane Alkaloids in Food 30,000 customers were warned to avoid the vegetabl es. It was pointed out that the outbreak could have lasted much longer on account of the potential long storage time of the frozen product. A single case of poisoning by a tea (described as a 'biodrug') in Germany, causing 'respiratory insufficiency' was r eported by a physician in 2001 (BfR 2006). 2.2 Search of the EU RASFF system A search of the RASFF Rapid Alert system produced relevant results from the search terms: \"Atropine\", \"Datura\", \"Solanum\" and \"Hyocyamus\". No results were obtained for the names of other TAs or other TA -producing plants. All results for \"Scopolamine\" were also returned under the \"Atropine\" search. The RASFF system contained notifications and/or alerts for atropine, scopolamine, Datura , Solanum , and Hyoscyamus as shown 1. Datura and atropine/scopolamine Six reports to RASFF concerned the occurrence of atropine and scopolamine in buckwheat (Fagopyron esculentum ) flour. All were reported by Slovenia. Two in 2006 reported atropine (35 - 37 \u00b5g/kg) and scopolamine (48 -65 \u00b5g/kg) in flour from Ukraine and the Czech Republic. One in 2009 reported atropine (110 \u00b5g/kg) and scopolamine (47 \u00b5g/kg) in raw material from Hungary, one in 2012 reported atropine (20 \u00b5g/kg) and scopolamine (6 \u00b5g/kg) in flour from Slovenia, and two in 2013 report ed atropine (14 -18 \u00b5g/kg) and scopolamine (6 -11 \u00b5g/kg) in buckwheat flour from Austria prepared from raw material from Slovakia and the Czech Republic. In addition there were seven reports of atropine contamination in millet, usually with scopolamine. Between 2006 and 2014 there were seven RASFF Notifications or Alerts of D. stramonium seeds in food of which six related to millet. A level of 130 \u00b5g/kg was reported in 2006 in organic millet from Austria and from Hungary. A second case concerned seeds found in brown millet ( Uroclora ramosa ) from Austria, three further notifications were for Datura seeds in organic millet from Austria. Datura seeds were also found in vegetable and bacon stir -fry mix from Spain, in 2013 in frozen vegetable -bean -seed mix from Be lgium made from raw material produced in Spain, and in 2014 in organic baby food (apple, pear and millet) manufactured in Germany. The baby food contained atropine at levels between about 4 and 32 \u00b5g/kg. In one of the 2006 incidents in Austria, a dish made from millet and carrot that was contaminated with seeds from D. stramonium was responsible for poisoning eight people, of whom one required hospitalisation. The millet contained about 50 seeds/kg grain (Fretz et al . 2007). D. stramonium fruits (presumably unripe seed cases) were found in canned green beans from Hungary in 2006 and again in 2007 and also in beans from Spain in Finland in 2013. Solanum In 2015 plant material of Solanum nigrum was rejected at the border of Portugal after the attempted import of food supplements from India. Solanum nigrum fruits were reported in 1982 Annex 1. Literature review on Tropane Alkaloids in Food in frozen green beans (from France) sold in Greece, in 1985 in beans in Germany, in 2004 in two samples of frozen green beans in France, and in 2013 in young g reen beans from the Netherlands. Hyoscyamus Seeds of Hyoscyamus niger (henbane) were found as contaminants in poppy seed from the Czech Republic in 2007 and 2008. The contamination level was between 0.13 % and 0.42 %. Two of the samples were sold in the S lovak Republic and the third in the Czech Republic. 2.3 Literature search results for plant species that could potentially contaminate field crops in the EU. Plant species that could potentially contaminate field crops in the EU were identified from the search results and from searches of databases of weed science organisations. Plants identified in these searches that were designated problematic as agricultural weeds and are also known to contain TAs are described below. In addition to the searches carri ed out using the Fera Information Centre the databases of and reports issued by the following weed science organisations were searched: The European Network on Invasive Alien Species (NOBANIS) (http://www.nobanis.org/) The Global Biodiversity Information F acility (http://www.gbif.org/) The International Weed Science Society (http://www.iwss.info/) The European Weed Research Society (EWRS) (http://www.ewrs.org/) The EWRS Invasive Plants Working Group. The EWRS Weed Mapping Working Group. Association Fran\u00e7ais e de Protection des Plantes (conference proceedings) Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Malherbolog\u00eda (http://www.semh.net/) The Italian Weed Research Society The Plant List maintained by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and Missouri Botanical Garden (http://www.theplantl ist.org/) 2.4 Results The major plant species that contaminate field crops in the EU or had a strong potential to do so were identified as Solanum and Convolvulus species with a lesser risk from species \"Black nightshade' was the most frequently reported Solanum weed although confusion with related similar species is very likely. Annex 1. Literature review on Tropane Alkaloids in Food It is an annual weed growing to 0.6 x 0.3 m. which flowers in late summer. I t produces fruits that are at first green and might be unseen in vegetables. These turn black on maturity and might then be mistaken as edible fruits. S. nigrum ranked joint 13th in a comparison of the overall importance of European weeds published by Schroeder et al. (1993). It ranked 6th in importance in relation to infestation of maize and sorghum. Solanum elaeagnifolium known as 'yellow tomato' or 'silverleaf nightshade' is a highly infective toxic weed of vegetable crops, cotton and pastures in the eastern Mediterranean countries (Boyd et al. 1984, Mekki 2007). It is considered one of the worst weeds in the world. S. elaeagnifolium became invasive in many countries after it wa s unintentionally introduced to Europe and is now widespread in or considered a risk to Albania, Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, France, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Malta, Morocco Portuga l, Spain, Romania, Russia, Serbia and Montenegro, Slovenia, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. It colonizes roadsides, pastures and grasslands and infests crops. Maize, sorghum and wheat are considered to be very affected by S. elaeagnifolium which c an be abundant in fields. In Morocco it has caused serious damage to maize crops (Gmira et al. 1998, Taleb and Bouhache 2006). According to a report from the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organisation (EMPPO 2006) the plant is present in the five continents and in several countries where it is invasive. Solanum plants that have weed status in Russia with the potential to spread westwards are: Solanum S. carolinense is a native o f the USA but spreading in Russia. It is an extremely competitive weed that infests corn and other grain crops, potato, soybean, and tomato. (AgroAtlas Project 2009). S. cornutum is a native of Mexico and the southwest USA now found in the European part of the Former Soviet Union, and described as a pernicious quarantine weed of spring grain crops, poisonous to animals (AgroAtlas Project 2009). Convolvulus species Convolvulus arvensis (Field bindweed) is considered one of the worst weeds in the world by agriculturists and horticulturists (Austin 2000). It grows very successfully in temperate and Mediterranean climates where it is a weed of cereals, beans and potatoes. It is problematic in France, Germany, Greece, the former Yugoslavia, and many countries out side Europe. C. arvensis ranked joint 7th in a comparison of the overall importance of European weeds, 15th in the rankings for its importance in spring cereals crops and in winter rapeseed, and 6th in maize and sorghum (Schroeder et al. 1993, Schimming et al. 2005, Shukla et al. 2006). Ka\u00e7an et al. (2013) described weeds as a major obstacle to sunflower seed production in Turkey. C. arvensis was among the major weeds found in 2012. Brassicaceae Cochlearia species (scurvy grass) are annual Brassicaceae plants that do not have an impact on crops but were the first brasssicas to be shown to contain tropanes. Calystegines were found two species ( Berteroa incana and Bunias orientalis ) that can be invasive we eds. Berteroa incana is an invasive and toxic weed, especially of alfalfa and clover forages, although the identity of the Annex 1. Literature review on Tropane Alkaloids in Food toxin has not been confirmed. Bunias orientalis is a brassica native to the Caucasus and southern Russia. It has spread rapidly throu ghout Europe through the human use as animal feed is now naturalized in many countries in Europe and is still spreading intensively (Birnbaum 2006), especially in Estonia where it is listed as particularly invasive and fast -spreading. Calystegines were als o found in two minor weeds ( Barbarea vulgaris and Bunias erucago ) that have been proposed as human salad or vegetable foods (PFAF 2015), and in a be considered a health threat. Brassica tournefortii (Sahara mustard, African mustard, Asian mustard , Mediterranean turnip, Sahara mustard, Tournefort's birdrape, wild turnip, is a native annual herb in Europe, common in disturbed sites such as roadsides and abandoned fields, but is not considered invasive in Europe. B. tournefortii is found in the Middl e East and in the European and neighbouring countries Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Egypt, Greece, Italy, Morocco, Spain, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. It is widely used as food in some North African countries. Brassica elongata (elongated mustard, long -stalked rape) is a biennial or perennial herb that is native to Eastern Europe, Russia and Central Asia. In some areas it competes with native flora and has the potential to spread. B. elongata is cultivated in Estonia (USDA ARS 2006). Brassica campe stris L. (Wild turnip) This plant is generally distributed as a weed in temperate zones of Europe and is cultivated plant in parts of the Middle East and Asia. It is found throughout the Western part of Russia, in the Caucasus, Western and in Eastern Siber ia. It has been described as a pernicious weed infesting all spring crops, both grain and vegetative types (AgroAtlas Project 2009) Datura Datura is a frequent contaminant of food crops as is evidenced by the reports under the RASFF system. However there were no further descriptions of the scale of the associated weed problem in the results from the search. Datura stramonium was among the maj or weeds described as a major obstacle to sunflower seed production in Turkey in 2012 (Ka\u00e7an et al. 2013). Hyoscyamus albus This is the henbane plant which has been described as a natural weed in much of Europe (Williams 1982, Hanf 1983, Williams and Huny adi 1987). Others Atropa belladonna and Physalis species contain TAs but are not reported as troublesome weeds in Europe. Mandragora autumnalis , the main Mediterranean species of the mandrake plant contains many toxic tropanes (Hanu et al. 2005) but is no t particularly effective as a weed. Hyoscyamus niger (Black Henbane ) is a w eed of poppy, wheat, and millet crops. This plant produces very many seeds, up to 400,000 per plant (AgroAtlas Project 2009). The literature Annex 1. Literature review on Tropane Alkaloids in Food search did not provide information on th e scale of the associated weed problem but again the RASFF reports indicate a significant degree of food contamination. The Australian native trees Duboisia leichhardtii and D. myrporodes that grow well in the warmer parts of Europe contain high concentr ations of atropine -like alkaloids especially atropine and scopolamine but the trees are too few in number to cause a weed problem. 3 IDENTIFICATION OF RELEVANT FOOD PLANTS WITH INHERENT TA: Adamse and van Egmond (2010) listed a number of TAs in food with examples of international poisoning incidents based on misidentification. Most food plants that naturally contain TAs belong to the Solanaceae family, which is one of the most diverse and varied groups of plants with 90 genera and just over 4000 species. I t is found worldwide with the majority of species in Central and South America. Food plants of the Solanaceae family relevant for food consumption in the EU were identified. They are listed in Table 2. 3.1 Food plants of the Solanum family with relevance for food consumption in the EU Plants of the genus Solanum do not contain atropine or scopolamine (Griffin and Lin 2000). Potato Solanum tuberosum Potatoes similarly originated in South America and have become a staple item in the European diet since the 1 8th century. Tomato Lycopersicon esculentum Tomatoes were imported from South America to Europe in the 15th century and has since been grown and hybridised extensively in Europe. The cultivated L. esculentum can be hybridised with S. Aubergines are believed to originate in Asia or Africa but it has been grown in the Mediterranean basin since the 7th century. Several minor species physically similar to aubergine are cultiva ted on a small scale for food, including scarlet and gboma eggplants ( spp Peppers comprise very many species of which five - the sweet bell pepper ( C. annuum ) and domesticated. solanums: Cape Physalis peruviana The Cape Gooseberry ( P. peruviana ) is a popular fruit in much of Europe but not eaten in quantity. This plant and the related P. alkekengi (Chinese lantern, bladder berry) contain several tropane and secotropane alkaloids in the roots and/or leaves (Griffin and Lin, 2000) but there Annex 1. Literature review on Tropane Alkaloids in Food are no reports of the TAs in the edible parts (fruits). The roots of P. alkekengi contain the minor TAs tigloid ine, 3 -tigloyloxytropane, cuscohygrine and phygrine over the range 0.02 to 0.025 % fresh weight or 0.084 -0.104 % dry weight (Basey and Woolley, 1973). Tamarillo or Tree Tomato Solanum betaceum This is popular in New Zealand where it is eaten raw as a frui t or vegetable dish and also cooked, but is receiving attention in Europe. Some related species also have edible fruits. It has not been reported to contain TAs. Tomatillo Physalis philadelphica or Physalis ixocarpa This fruit is becoming popular in Europ e as a result of interest in Mexican foods. Its cultured root has been shown to contain calystegine A3 but not A5, B1 or B2 which were present in related species ( Azemi et al. 2006). Goji berry (Lycium ) The fruits of Lycium barbar um (goji berries) plants have recently been marketed as foods beneficial to health. Plant parts of Lycium have a history of use for medicinal purposes in China but in the West usage is restricted to the berries of L. barbarum (Pottera 2010). The berries are generally produced in and exported from China but the plant is believed to originate from the Mediterranean Basin (Genaust 1996) and might be cultivated in Europe in future. Others Solanum muricatum (pepino), S. betaceum (tree tomato), and S. quitoense (naranjilla) are popular in Mexico and South America and have potential to become popular in Europe, as does S. melanocerasum (garden huckleberry) . 3.2 Food plants of the Convolvulaceae family with relevance for food consumption in the EU The most relevant food plants of the Convolvulaceae are Ipomoea , of which about 700 species are found in most tropical and subtropical regions. The most important plant is the sweet potato or yam ( I. batatas ). Sweet potatoes are grown in many countries and consumed throughout most of the world (Zhao et al. 2005, Bovell -Benjamin, 2007). Another ipomoea, I. aqu\u00e1tica is a food crop in much of Asia, where the leaves are consumed as a rich source of nutrients and essential amino acids. Som e related ipomoea species eaten to a lesser degree are I. alba L., I. albivenia, I. involucrata and I. leptophylla . 3.3 Food plants of the Brassica family with relevance for food consumption in the EU Many Brassicaceae plants are part of the staple Europea n diet, particularly those from the species B. oleracea , including broccoli, cauliflower, kale and Brussel sprouts. Other commonly consumed brasssicas are B. napa (turnip, white turnip) B. rapa (swede, rutabaga, Chinese cabbage), the colloquial names of wh ich vary across Europe. Other Brassicas are consumed to a lesser but growing extent in Europe, including kohlrabi In addition many are consumed at lower Annex 1. Literature review on Tropane Alkaloids in Food level as ingredients or spices, such as brown mustard ( B. juncea ), black mustard mustard ( Sinapis alba 3.4 Other plants The leaves and fruits of the white mulberry tree Morus alba have been shown to contain calystegines ( Asano et al. 1994, Singhal et al. 2010, Bajpai et al. 2012, Singh et al. 2013). The white mulberry is a tree of economic importance in Asia as the leaves are the sole food source for silkworms and they are sometimes eaten as vegetable. M. alba is considered a weed in the USA and is found in warmer European countries. The fruit is consumed in Asia and the USA and is becoming popular in Europe, although the red ( M. rubra ) and black ( M. nigra ) species are preferred. Calystegines have not been reported in these two species. Summary In summary the most important food plants that nat urally contain TAs have been identified as the Solanums (potato, aubergine and pepper), and the calystegine containing brasssicas (cabbage, broccoli) and sweet potatoes. 4 ASSESSMENT OF THE TA 4.1 TA in the food plants TA in the food plants Overviews of the TA in the food plants and associated plants were provided by Draeger et al. (1995), Griffin and Lin (2000) and by Pomilio et al. (2008). Draeger et al. (1994) and Asano (2000) surveyed the occurrence of calystegines in edible fruits and ve getables, and detected some or all of calystegines A3, B1, B2, and C1 in samples of the and Convolvulaceae tested (Asano et al. , 1997a, 1997b). A review of the occurrence of calystegine alkaloids in food plants was prepared by Watson et al. (200 0) who reported their presence in over 70 varieties of potatoes other edible species such as aubergine and sweet potato. The presence of calystegines in human foods such as potatoes, eggplants, and sweet potatoes poses the question as to the effect that th ese compounds might have on humans. Calystegines in food plants 4.1.1 Potatoes Calystegines have been found in all edible solanaceous plants (Asano et al. 1997a), and potato plants contain calystegines in all parts. They have been measured in over 70 edibl e varieties of potatoes (Nash et al. 1998, Watson et al. 2000, Friedman et al. 2003). Potatoes measured by Dr\u00e4ger (2004) contained calystegines at up to 2,300 mg/kg fresh weight in their sprouts and up to 450 mg/kg in the peel of the tuber. Annex 1. Literature review on Tropane Alkaloids in Food Nash et al. (1993) reported a total calystegine level of 10 mg/kg fresh weight in the tuber flesh and Asano et al. (1997a) reported 3.4 to 7 mg/kg total tuber fresh weight. Calystegine A3 and B2 were measured in potatoes at a total alkaloid content of 3.5 to 7 mg/kg fre sh weight (Watson et al. 2000). The ratio of B2:A3 was typically 2:1. Keiner and Dr\u00e4ger (2000) reported details of the variation of calystegine levels in various parts of a single cultivar (Liu) of S. tuberosum during the life cycle of the plant. In the mature plant total calystegines reached 25 to 75 mg/kg in the leaves and about 100 to 250 mg/kg in the growing tuber. Directly after harvest the tubers contained a maximum of about 400 mg/kg calystegines in the e yes and skin, which rose to maxima at 5 months after harvest to 1000 mg/kg in the skin and 3000 mg/kg in the young sprouts emerging from the tuber when stored in the dark at +4C. Calystegines A3, B2 and B4 were the most prominent and could be quantified i n all tissues (roots, tubers, leaves, sprouts and eyes), and calystegines A5, B1 and B3 were believed to be present in very small quantities (< 10 mg/g fresh weight). N -methyl calystegine B2 was not detected in any part. Contrary to potato glycoalkaloids, calystegine levels in the skin do not increase on exposure to light but actually decrease. The major changes in calystegine levels during tuber production and post -harvest probably account for the variations in the levels reported in the literature. Calystegines in potato (and probably other vegetables) are stable through cooking and other food processing operations (Watson et al. 2000). Storage of potatoes at 5 \u00b0C increased the proportions of the 4 -O-alpha -D-galactoside of calystegine B2 and the trih ydroxylated calystegine A3. Watson et al (2000) reported the calystegine content of seven prepared potato products cooked following the recommended domestic procedures. All products contained calystegines A3 and B2. The highest levels were in French fries for microwave cooking (A3 and B2 at 15 and 20 mg/kg fresh weight respectively), instant mashed potato (9 and 23 mg/kg respectively), and potato crisps (5 and 21 mg/kg respectively). 4.1.2 Aubergines TAs have been reported in the fruit of the aubergine o r eggplant (Nash et al. 1993, Das and Barua 2013). The fruit contained calystegine A3 at 0.3 and B2 at 0.5 mg/kg fresh weight (Asano et al. 1997a). There has been some interest in the grafting of food plants on to the root stock of related species for food production. There is a single report of poisoning associated with consumption of aubergine that that been grafted on to the root of metel (Oshiro et al. 2008). 4.1.3 Peppers Capsicum annuum has been found to contain high levels of calystegines. As ano et al. (1997a) reported calystegines B1, B2 and C1 at 12, 37, and 4 mg/kg fresh weight respectively in C. annuum, but no A3. pepper B2 but no A3 or C1. Annex 1. review on Tropane Alkaloids in Food 4.1.4 Brasssicas Brassicaceae species used as food do not contain atropine or scopolamine (Griffin and Lin, 2000), however the leaves of the majority of Brassicaceae contain calystegines. Calystegines are accumulated throughout the life cycle of brassica plants and are found in all parts. Brassica oleracea (broccoli) has been reported to contain calystegines at concentrations up to 30 mg/kg dry weight (Dr\u00e4ger, 2004, Brock et al. , 2006). Calystegine A3 was present at mg/kg and at 4 mg/kg; B. rapa (turnip/oriental cabbage) A3 mg/kg; (Brussel A3 alone at 5 mg/kg; and nigra (black mustard) contained A3 at 1 mg/kg, A5 at 5 mg/kg, B2 at 3 mg/kg and B3 at 4 mg/kg (Schimming et al. 2005). 4.1.5 Sweet The Convolvulacea contain convolvine (3 -veratroyloxynortropane), and convolidine (3-vanilloyloxynortropane) (Griffin and Lin, 2000). In a survey by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC -MS) of the composition of 129 convolvulaceous species belonging to 29 genera (all 1 2 tribes) Schimming et al. (2005) found from one to six calystegines in 62 species belonging to 22 genera of all tribes except Cuscuteae . Ipomoea had the number Calystegines B1, B2, B3 and C1 have all been reported in the sweet potato I. batatas , as well as in the related I. alba, I. aquatica,, I. carnea, I. eremnobrocha, I. obscura, I. pes -caprae, setifera, I. violacea and I. hederifolia (B1, B2, C1 only). The levels of calystegines reported in the edible I. bat atas tuber by Asano et al. (1997a) were B1 and B2 (1.1 -19 mg/kg fresh weight). 4.1.6 Cape Gooseberry The Cape contains no hyoscyamine, 3 --tigloyloxytropane in the root (Beresford and Woolley 1974, Griffin and Lin 2000). The roots also contain the secotropane alkaloids (+) -physoperuvine, racemic physoperuvine and (+) which are metabolit es of TAs (Sahai and Ray, 1980). Both leaves and roots contain tropine, 3 --tigloyloxytropane, 3 --acetoxytropane, hygrine, methylpyrrolidinylhygrine, physoperuvine, and cuscohygrine (Kubwabo et al. 1993). The related P. alkekengi contains calystegine B2. In analyses by Asano et mg/kg and B2 at 0.048 mg/kg fresh weight. A study of the potential of the root of P. peruviana root for use as a functional food found that it contained cuscohygrine, withanolides and flavonoids. Five compounds were isolated and their structures elucidated by different spectral analysis techniques. Animal experiments showed that root extracts improved oxidative stress, liver fu nction and kidney disorders, protecting the liver and kidney against fibrosis (El -Gengaihi et al. 2013). Annex 1. Literature review on Tropane Alkaloids in Food 4.1.7 Goji berry The fruits from an Indian goji berry plant have been reported to contain atropine at a level 9.5 g/kg and hyoscyamine at 2.9 mg/kg dr y fruit at (Harsh 1989) but this degree of contamination would have led to poisoning incidents. A later investigation of the atropine content of eight samples of goji berries from China and Thailand based on liquid chromatography -mass spectrometry (LC -MS) foun d atropine in one sample of dried berries at 0.019 mg/kg whereas for seven others the level was <0.01 mg/kg (Adams et al. 2006). A further evaluation by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) published by Klenow et al. (2012) concluded that the original test was not specific for tropanes and the plant was probably misidentified Lycium europaeum . Analysis of the chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) showed an atropine content of 0.59 mg/k g for fruits of L. europaeum and atropine at the detection limit (0.01 mg/kg) in the fruits of L. barbarum from China (Klenow et al. 2012). The roots of L. chinense contain at least 14 calystegines and N -methylcalystegines and other compounds with -glucosidase inhibitory activit y (Asano et al. 1997b). 4.1.9 White mulberry The leaves and fruits of the white mulberry tree Morus alba have been s hown to contain calystegines but they have not been found in the red or black varieties M. rubra and black M. nigra (Singhal et al. 2010, Bajpai et al. 2012, Singh et al. 2013 ). Asano et al. (2001a) fou the plant includin in the leaves, 2 -hydroxymethyl - 3,4-dihydroxy -pyrrolidine -N-propionamide in the root -O--D-galactopyranosyl calystegine B2 and 3,6 -dihydroxynortropane in the fruit. 4.1.10 Other plants The berries of Atropa belladonna have been mistaken for edible berries such as bilberries, blueberries, cranberries, and huckleberries, and the leaf has been mistaken for Malva sylvestris (mallow), used occasionally as a vegetable (Adamse and von Egmond 2010). Several parts (leaves, seeds and root s) of other plants such as Datura have been mistaken for common vegetables and herbs. 4.2 TA in the associated plants Calystegines in associated plants 4.2.1 Datura species The TA profiles of Datura species have been much studied and over 65 TAs have bee n reported. Most of the information relates to atropine and scopolamine which predominate in all species investigated (Berkov et al. , 2006, Doncheva et al. , 2006, Philipov et al. , 2007). TA patterns in Datura are influenced more strongly by environmental f actors than by genetic ones, but the proportion of the less common TAs in the seed of European Datura is low compared to those of atropine and scopolamine. Ionkova et al. (1994) reported quite high levels of apoatropine (3 - apotropoyloxytropane) in the see ds of a cultured plant (calculated as 27 % of the gas Annex 1. Literature review on Tropane Alkaloids in Food chromatography -mass spectrometry response). Very few other TAs were reported in seeds in these studies, with the greatest variety of TAs being in the leaf tissue, It is likely therefore that atropine an d scopolamine are the metabolic end products for storage in the seed. 4.2.2 Atropa belladonna Atropa belladonna contains mainly atropine and scopolamine both in leaves and seeds, with lesser concentrations of apoatropine (Dhar and Bhat, 1982, Martinsen et al. 1991, Ashtiania and Sefidkonb 2011) and traces of tropine, belladonnine and, 6 --hydroxyhyoscyamine (Arraez - aposcopolamine, littorine ( Nakanishi et al. 1998). Also reported present are scopolamine and apoatropine (Evans 1979), hyoscyamine N -oxide (Phillipson and Handa 1975). Tropanes are present in all parts of the plant but the total TA levels vary considerably b etween different varieties and harvesting stages (Dhar and Bhat, 1982). Atropine increases during growth with apoatropine appearing later (Clair et al. 1976). Atropine and scopolamine are always the major TAs (Simola et al. 1988) with atropine always the m ost abundant, up to 10 mg/g dry weight in the root and 3 mg/g in the leaves. Scopolamine was present at 0.6 mg/g in the root and 0.4 mg/g in the leaves of plants measured by Zarate et al. (1997). Fresh plants from Iran A. belladonna L. contained about 3% t otal TAs in the leaves 8 % in the roots, 1 % in the stem and 5 % in the seeds (Ashtiani and Sefidkon 2011). Hyoscyamine N-oxide is produced with the highest concentrations in the fruit (Phillipson and Handa 1973, 1976). An overview of quantitative data ava ilable in the literature is given in the EFSA Opinion (EFSA 2013). The range of total atropine + scopolamine was 20 to 5,000 mg/kg in leaves and 960 to 7,300 in seeds. A. belladonna also contains calystegines (Dr\u00e4ger 1993, 1994, 1995). Calystegines were lo cated in all parts but mainly in the young upper leaves (Dr\u00e4ger et al. 1995) where the levels vary but can reach about 400 mg/kg dry weight (Bekkouche et al. 2001). The presence of calystegine B4 is unconfirmed. 4.2.3 Hyoscyamus niger Atropine and scopol amine are also the major TAs in Hyoscyamus niger which unusually has a higher scopolamine level than that of atropine. H. muticus (Egyptian henbane) is particularly rich in TAs (Oksman -Caldentey et al. 1987, Mandal et al. 1991). Hyoscyamus albus contains calystegines A3, B2, B3 and B1 in cultured roots (Dr\u00e4ger et al. 1994). 4.2.4 Convolvulus arvensis The TAs of Convolvulus arvensis have been studied by Asano et al. (1997a) and Asano (2000) and others. Early studies (Evans and Somanabandhu 1974, Jennet -Siems and Eich 1994, tropinone, ferulyl tropinol and 3 -tropinol. De Simone et al. (2008) found that the roots of C. arvensis contain calystegines A3, A5, B1, B2, B3 and B4. The most frequently encountered calystegines were A3, B1, B2 and B3, while distribution of N1 and C1 was more limited. Bekkouche et al. (2001) did not detect A5 or B4. De Simone et al. (2008) found ed compounds convolidine (3 -vanilloyloxynortropane), convolamine ( aerial parts of C. arvensis plants which had poisoned horses were not shown to contain calystegines (Todd et al. 1995) but pseudotropine (a biosynthetic precursor of the calystegines) meso -cuscohygrine, a cuscohygrine stereoisomer and traces of tropinone were found. C. arve nsis contains hygrine (Evans and Somanabandhu 1974, Jennet 3 --tropinol (Jennet -Siems and Eich 1994, Todd et al. 1995). Todd et al. (1995) found no calystegines in the aer ial parts but Schimming et al. (2005) reported calystegines A3, A5, B1, B2, and B4, with the flowers containing only A5 and B2. Bekkouche et al. (2001) reported that the most frequently encountered calystegines were A3, B1, B2 and B3, while distribution of N1 and C1 was more limited. was to contain Asano et sativa , (camelina), cal ystegines A3, A5, B2 and B3, at levels of 1 to 5 mg/kg (Schimming et al. 2005). 4.2.6 Plants that contain TAs but are not considered to be likely to contaminate food Mandragora - A number of poisonings by the mandrake Mandragora autumnalis have been repor ted in Italy, the native habitat for this plant (Piccillo et al. 2002). However it is not a seriously invasive weed. M. autumnalis and M. vernalis contained -ditigloyloxytrop ane. Belladonnine was present in the dried roots, but could not be detected in fresh roots (Jackson and Berry 1973). Scopolia - Contains several TAs but is not seriously invasive (Asano et al. , 1996). Duboisia - Duboisia leichhardtii is a tree cultured in Australia the leaves of which contain calystegines C1 and C2 (Kato, et al. 1997), but the plant is not considered invasive in Europe. 4.3 Available toxicity data of individual TAs Toxicity data for the TA compounds can be considered more reliable than that obtained for plant poisoning as several of the plants described in this review contain toxins in addition to the TAs, in particular potatoes contain glycoalkaloids often cited as the active agent. 4.3.1 Atropine type TAs The atropin e type TAs are anticholinergic compounds and the poisoning symptoms are due entirely to inhibition of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) and the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Ingestion of TAs causes a variety of sympto ms including: a dry mouth and upper digestive and respiratory tracts, hot red skin, pupil dilation (mydriasis) and blurred vision, changes in heart rate, tachycardia, and respiratory depression, urinary retention, ataxia, speech disturbance, disorientation and visual hallucinations. Studies in Annex 1. Literature review on Tropane Alkaloids in Food mice have shown no clear evidence of teratogenicity (Arcuri and Gautieri 1973). Atropine and scopolamine are in bacterial assays (EMEA, 1998). The metabolic pathways of atropine and scopolamine differ. Atropine has a high oral bioavailability (Lewis and Elvin -Lewis, 1977) whereas scopolamine does not (Ali -Melkkil\u00e4 1993). Data for other TAs are not available. Following absorption, both alkaloids have a high volume of distribution (EMEA, 1997, 1998). The t oxic effects are derived from cleavage of hyoscyamine into an and tropic acid by esterases and Scopolamine undergoes oxidative demethylation and first -pass metabolism mediated by cytochrome P450 3 A, so that only a small fraction (<5%) of the dose is excreted as the parent compound, however, the oxidation products have not yet been identified. Most atropine (60%) is excreted unchanged in the urine but for scopolamine urinary excretion is lower than 5% (Putcha et al. 1991, Ali -Melkkil\u00e4 1993, EMEA 1998, Renner et al. 2005, Chen et al. 2006). 4.3.2 Calystegines Calystegines are potent inhibitors of -glucosidase (Molyneux et 1993, Asano et al. 1995, 1997a, Asano 2000). Calystegines of the roots of C. arvensis and of the hedge bindweed ( C. sepium ) are potent inhibitors of -glucosidase. They cause neurological dysfunction associated with glycosidase inhibition and lysosomal storage disorders (Watson et al. 2001). In studies using mammalian tissues A sano et al. (1997a) found that calystegines B1 and C1 were potent competitive inhibitors of the bovine, human, and rat -glucosidase activity and calystegine B2 was a strong competitive inhibitor of the -galactosidase activity in liver. Calystegine B1 is also a potent competitive inhibitor of almond -glucosidase and bovine liver - galactosidase but it does not inhibit -galactosidases. Calystegine B2 is also a potent competitive inhibitor of almond -glucosidase and coffee bean -galactosidase (Asano et al. 1995). Mice fed convolvulus alone ate it readily but soon showed excitement and then depression, anorexia, hunched posture and death. Lesions were found in their stomachs and livers, with acute gastritis erosions and ulcerations, and hepatic necrosis. Mice offere d bindweed as a choice ate it but had far milder effects. Human -xylosidase was inhibited by all calystegines tested. Calystegines A3 and B2 selectively inhibited the rat liver -glucosidase activity. Calystegine A3 is weaker than calystegine B2. Calysteg A5, had no activity against any glycosidases. Calystegine B3 (a 2 -epimer of calystegine B2) has weak inhibitory activity, suggesting that the equatorially oriented -OH group at C2 is necessary for strong binding at the active site of glycosidases. Conv olvine blocks M2 and Asano et al. (1997a) proposed that the potent inhibition of mammalian glucosidases in vitro raised concerns that calystegines were toxic to humans consuming large amounts of plants that contain them. 4.3.3 Minor TAs There is very little information on the toxicity of individual TAs other than atropine and scopolamine. Pseudotropine causes intestinal contraction in the dog, followed by an inhibition of Annex 1. Literature review on Tropane Alkaloids in Food spontaneous contractions but tr opine augments intestinal contractions (Hamlte 1931 quoted in Todd et al. 1995). Cuscohygrine suppresses an immune response in mice (Watson et al. 1983). Anisodine produces four known metabolites (norscopine, scopine, hydroxyanisodine, N-oxide anisodine) a s determined in rat plasma following ingestion (Chen et al. 2006). 5 IDENTIFICATION OF THE RELEVANT TA FROM FOODS AND ASSOCIATED PLANTS Some assessment was made of toxic weed plants from outside the EU likely to contaminate foods imported into the EU. The demand for soya beans in the EU exceeds its cultivation and over 30 million tons are imported each year of which about 5% is used directly as an ingredient in human foods. So ya is frequently contaminated by seeds of toxic Solanum species often described as black nightshade ( Solanum nigrum L.) but which black nightshade ( Solanum ptycanthum ). The plant is common in cultivated fields and its fruits have been harvested with peas, snap beans and soybeans. Other solanums invasive and common in the USA and Asia are Solanum viarum and Solanum torvum (turkeyberry). A report from Adamse and van Egmond (2010) clearly points to contamination with seeds from D. stramonium (Jimson weed or thorn apple) as the most common problem, however the authors indicate that seeds from other Datura spp. as well as berries of Atropa belladonna and seeds of Hyoscyamus niger have been reported as impurities in food. TAs are found in the plants that are herbaceous and therefore more likely to act as weeds, and in many plants less likely to be found in Europe or in the vicinity of food crops, such as Iochroma now known as Calystegia sepium (Goldmann et al. 1990). Specialised Nutrition Europe (SNE) is a trade association rep resenting the specialised nutrition industry across the European Union. SNE members are the national associations of 17 EU Member States and their companies produce foods for specific groups', including the foods specifically intended for infants and young children. An unreported survey by SNE carried out in 2014 confirmed data from the Dutch authorities that showed contamination risks in sorghum and millet. SNE has expressed its favour in setting up an Indicative Value of 250 \u00b5g/kg for the sum of hyoscyami ne and scopolamine in sorghum, millet and buckwheat used to manufacture cereal - based foods for infants and young children (SNE 2014). http://www.anid.pt/attachments/article/45/alkaloids.pdf 6 IDENTIFICATION OF RELEVANT FOOD MATRICES USING THE FOLLOWING CR ITERIA: 6.1 Foods associated with intoxications with TA 6.1.1 Foods associated with the TA containing weeds Foods that have been associated with TA intoxications from weeds are cereal -based foods, particularly those intended for infants and young children and foods based on particular seeds, principally buckwheat, millet, poppy and sunflower. A second important category is vegetables, Annex 1. Literature review on Tropane Alkaloids in Food particularly green beans, both frozen and canned, which are occasionally contaminated with Datura fruit and with toxic species of Solanum . 6.1.2 Foods containing inherent TAs Potato and potato products have had occasional historical poisoning associations but as acute symptoms are mild the incidence might be underreported. 6.2 Consumption levels A summary of the consumption levels of the tropane -containing plants in European countries for which data was available via the FAO/WHO Chro nic Individual Food Consumption Database - summary statistics (CIFOCOss) was obtained as published in 2015 (FAO/WHO 2015) and a summary of this is provided in Table 3. Data are provided in grams of plant per kg body weight per day (g/kg bw/day), although d ata have not been reported for some important countries. The data show that the highest levels of potato consumption to occur in children in Bulgaria (about 3.5 g/kg bw/day), in adolescents and children in the Czech Republic (2 -3 g/kg bw/day), in adults and elderly people in Hungary and adults in Spain. There are no data for potato consumption in Belgium, France and the UK. The highest levels of fresh tomato consumption are in Italy and Bulgaria (about 3 g/kg bw/day). The highest levels of brassica consumpt ion are in the North Western European countries, and the highest consumption of green beans (included on account of more regular tropane contamination) are in France, Belgium, and Bulgaria. Summaries of the consumption levels of the TA -containing plant foo ds and of foods that have been contaminated with TAs in 19 European countries (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, Romania, Spain, Sweden, United Kingd om) as reported by the EFSA Food Consumption Database are provided in Tables 4 -11. The tables generally show the number of subjects of the survey, the number of consumers of the products, and the average consumption in grams per day for all consumers. It should be noted that for some food categories the number of consumers are too low to allow a statistically robust analysis of the consumption. The EFSA consumer descriptions are for pregnant women, lactating mothers, infants, toddlers, other children, adolescents, adults, elderly, and very elderly. In most tables the consumer descriptions have a number prefix to enable sorting by age. Where there is more than one entry for a consumer description this is because data for more than one consumption survey is reported. Table 4 shows the average consumption in grams per day for all subjects (i .e. for the general population) and all consumers (those individuals who actually consume the products) of a range of potatoes and potato products. Boiled potatoes are the major product in this group. Table 5 shows a breakdown by country of the data suppl ied in Table 4 filtered to show only the higher consumers, i.e. the 95th percentile, those consuming more than the average quantity. The heaviest consumers are in northern, western and central Europe and tend to be adults and elderly. Annex 1. Literature review on Tropane Alkaloids in Food Table 6 shows the ave rage consumption in grams per day for infants, toddlers and other children of cereal based foods for infants and young children. High consumers are shown in bold. In this table (only) data are reported for all subjects including the non -consumers, in order to show the range of consumption in these vulnerable groups. There appears to be evidence of some targeting of subject groups in the data for Finland and Germany where in some cases several hundred subjects provide no consumers and in other cases there ar e a number of consumers. Consumption levels appear much higher in the data for toddlers in Spain. Table 7 shows the average consumption in grams per day for high consumers of aubergines. There were approximately 4,000 consumers from 80,000 subjects, with a n average intake of 1.5 grams/day. The highest consumers by some margin were in Romania and Italy. Table 8 shows the average consumption in grams per day for high consumers of beans with and without pods. These data are provided on account of the occasiona l contamination of green beans and vegetable mixtures with Datura. From 7289 subjects there were approximately 2700 consumers of beans without pods. There were 7402 subjects and 2424 consumers of beans with pods with an average intake of 2.5 and 4.0 grams/ day respectively. The highest consumers of beans without pods were across a range of ages in the UK where subjects typically consumed 7 x the European average. However these are likely to be beans cooked and canned in tomato sauce, in which contaminating v egetable material from Datura would be more easily identified. For beans with pods the high consumers were in the Netherlands, Romania and Spain (3 to 5 x the average). Table 9 shows the average consumption in grams per day for all consumers of buckwheat products. In the case of Latvia, the presence of a high proportion of consumers is associated with a particularly high consumption level. These factors indicate that the product is popular in that country. In other countries elevated consumption levels are also related to a higher proportion of consumers. Table 10 shows the average consumption in grams per day for all consumers of millet products. The proportion of consumers is low but notably higher in toddlers and other children in Finland. In most countri es the consumption level does not greatly exceed the European average. Table 11 shows the average consumption in grams per day for all consumers of poppy seeds. Consumption levels are highest in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania. 6.3 Availability of these foods on the EU market. All of the foods described above are available on the EU market to degrees that vary with location. The foods that have been contaminated with TA -containing weeds are easily available across the EU. Many food plants with endo genous TAs (potatoes, aubergines, peppers, sweet potatoes) are widely available while others such as Cape gooseberry and goji berries have limited availability or market demand is current low. Annex 1. Literature review on Tropane Alkaloids in Food 7 Recommendations The EFSA Opinion indicates contamination of a high proportion of cereal -based food for infants and young children, and a lesser contamination of a high proportion of cereal -based food intended for both toddlers and infants. Other contamination has been revealed in food and feed based on oilseeds, esp ecially sunflower seeds, and in millet and related plants such as sorghum. From reports under RASFF the greatest incidence of contamination has concerned Datura seeds in millet (mainly organic and mainly originating in Austria) and Datura fruit (berries) i n processed bean -based vegetables. Frozen green beans have also been contaminated with Solanum and poppy seeds with Hyoscyamus (henbane). Considering the widespread contamination of herbal products with pyrrolizidine alkaloids and a single incidence of con tamination of tea prepared from marshmallow root with Atropa belladonna root there might be a requirement to survey herbal teas from areas with potential tropane -containing plant growth. Regarding contamination of cereal crops with weeds, the major weeds c urrently contaminating food crops in the EU are sepium (Calystegia sepium ). Whilst there are many reports of contamination by Datura tropanes there are no reports of calystegine contamination of foods in which they do not occur naturally. There appears to be widespread and sometimes heavy growth of Convolvulus in cereal fields, but consumer exposure to calystegines will be greater and more sustained through consumption of potato products. Toxic weed plants from outside the EU likely to contaminate foods imported into the EU are Solanum species S. ptycanthum, S. nigrum, S. viarum and S. torvum. These plants are common in cultivated fields and have been harvested with peas, snap beans and soya beans. Other solanums invasive and common in the USA and Asia are S. viarum and S. torvum (turkeyberry). The primary recommendations are for a focus on: Processed cereal foods intended for babies, including a high proportion of organic products. Processed cereal foods intended for infants and toddlers, including a high proportion of organic products. Processed and unprocessed cereal foods for adults, including a high proportion of organic products, including some samples with poppy seeds and where identified some products containing millet. Processed foods and flour based on buckwheat, including a high proportion of organic products, including some samples with poppy seeds and where identified some products containing millet. Canned and frozen vegetables with a high proportion of green beans. Annex 1. Literature review on Tropane Alkaloids in Food Potato products of all types should be analysed for calystegines with perhaps a recommendation to extend the survey in future to the field cereal products, especially if the extracts can be saved for a suitable time. Regarding a focus on the geographic regions for sampling it can be assumed that in ignorance of the scale and location of the sampling that led to e.g. the RASFF reports it might be unwise to aim too strongly at the countries where problems have been reported previously. The review has highlighted the emerging potential for food contamination from non -food weed plants that are encroaching on fiel d crops in Europe. Convolvulus species (bindweeds) present a particular problem that should be addressed in future projects. 8 REFERENCES Biastoff, S. and B. Draeger. 2007. Calystegines. In.

Fera Validation report for tropane alkaloids in cereal products Summary A method validation study for a method for tropane alkaloids in cereal products was completed. The method uses Strong Cation Exchange Solid Phase Extraction Clean -up (SCX SPE) followed by determination by UPLC -MS/MS. The validation data showed variable performance of the method for different analytes. The two main analytes of concern that will be regulated (atropine and scopolamine) showed accepted method performance when compared to method performance criteria from R egulation (EU) No 401/2006. The better performance of these analytes can be attributed to the use of isotopically labelled internal standards for these two compounds. The other analytes gave variable performance; some met the criteria from Regulation (EU ) 401/2006, while others did not. The most common problem was occurrence of interferences in the chromatography for the early eluting compounds. A modification to the initial clean -up procedure was made for this validation to reduce these interferences. This worked to some degree. The other change that helped improve the chromatography was the use of ammonium carbonate in the LC Mobile phase. It was found that the pH was critical to the chromatographic performance of the method, and that pH 10 and abo ve gave the best results in terms of peak shape and separation. In the previous validation it was shown that the use of matrix matched calibration series did not appear to assist with the analysis of different samples with many ingredients and complex matr ices. Therefore solvent calibration standards were used for this validation and for the analysis of the survey samples. All survey samples will be overspiked to determine apparent recovery. 1 Introduction This report describes the procedure and the perf ormance characteristics of a test method for the LC-MS analysis of 24 tropane alkaloids in cereals and cereal products. The tropane alkaloids 3-scopolamine are used as internal standards. Validation of the method was performed by the analysis of six matrices, each with six replicate spikes at two concentrations (1 ng/g and 5 ng/g), quantified using solvent calibration standards. The matrices used for the validation were three breakfast cereals (multi -grain based cereal for young children, wheat bran flakes for breakfast and muesli with fruit and nuts), plain flours, bread and cookies. Each matrix was analysed alongside QC sample s prepared by spiking a similar matrix at 10 ng/g and also alongside QC samples spiked by RIKILT. Recovery was assessed via the inclusion of extracts spiked after extraction and clean -up at a concentration equivalent to 10 ng/g. Annex 3. Fera Validation report for tropane alkaloids in cereal products The limit of detection (LOD) of the method was defined as the concentration of each analyte required to give a chromatographic peak with signal to noise (s:n) ratio 3. This was assessed by extrapolation from the s:n ratio of each analyte in the lowest matrix -extracted calibra tion standard. If there was a peak present in the blank (e.g. due to injection carry -over), the LOD was defined as the concentration required to give a peak area 2 x that in the blank. The limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method was defined as the concentration of the lowest calibration standard with s:n 3 and with a peak area fitting a calibration line with residuals 30 % and r2 0.95. In cases where the calibration graph did not meet these criteria, the LOQ reported is the concentration of t he lowest calibration standard included in the graph used to generate the indicative concentrations reported. 2 Materials and Methods Sample extraction, clean -up and analysis were performed following Standard Operation Protocol for LC-MS/MS analysis of TA s in cereals, cereal products, (herbal) dry tea, (herbal) tea infusions and stir - fry vegetable products, SOP for EFSA project Occurrence of TAs in food, Patrick Mulder & Patricia L\u00f3pez S\u00e1nchez, February 2016, version g. This SOP is attached as Annex 2. Any deviations from the SOP are recorded belo w. The validation protocol used by all partner laboratories is included here as Appendix I to this validation report. 2.1 Standards Stock solutions of the individual tropane alkaloids at 100 \u00b5g/mL were provi ded by RIKILT. A mixed standard at 1000 ng/mL was prepared by pipetting 200 \u00b5L of each stock into a 20 mL volumetric flask and making up to the mark with methanol. This mixed standard was then further diluted to 100 ng/mL by pipetting 1 mL into a 10 mL v olumetric flask and making up to the mark with methanol and to 10 ng/mL by pipetting 100 \u00b5L into a 10 mL volumetric flask and making up to the mark with methanol. Stock solutions of the individual internal standards at 100 \u00b5g/mL were also provided by RIKIL T. A mixed internal standard solution at 1000 ng/mL was prepared by pipetting 250 \u00b5L of each stock into a 25 mL volumetric flask and making up to the mark with methanol. This method of preparing the mixed standard solutions differs from the SOP (see SOP s ections 1.2 - 2.2). 2.2 Reagents All reagents used were of an equivalent quality to that specified in the SOP ( Annex 2 section 3) and mixed solvents were prepared in the same way (scaling up or down for quantity required). The elution solvent used was 1 % a mmonia in methanol, which was prepared by dilution of 7 N ammonia in methanol (21 mL 7 N ammonia in methanol was mixed with 229 mL methanol). This method of preparation differs from the SOP ( Annex 2 section 3.2.4). The mobile phases used were those speci fied for the \"alternative UPLC conditions\" in the SOP ( Annex 2 7.2.2), namely (A) 10 mM ammonium carbonate and (B) acetonitrile. Annex 3. Fera Validation report for tropane alkaloids in cereal products 2.3 Equipment The equipment used was equivalent to that specified in the SOP ( Annex 2 section 4) with the following exceptions : An orbital shaker (AQS) was used instead of an overhead shaker. Samples were dried under nitrogen on a dry block sample concentrator, not in a TurboVap. Samples were collected after elution and dried down in glass sample tubes instead of polypropylene. Samples were filtered using 0.2 \u00b5m nylon syringe filters into glass vials instead of using 0.45 \u00b5m polypropylene PTFE filtervials. A smaller particle filter was required to use with the UPLC column and it was found that the samples would not pass through 0 .2 \u00b5m PTFE filters, possibly due to swelling caused by the aqueous solvent. The SPE cartridges chosen were Phenomenex Strata -X-C, 33 \u00b5m, 200 mg, 6 mL. Annex 3. Fera Validation report for tropane alkaloids in cereal products 2.4 Sample Extraction and Clean -Up Sample extraction and clean -up was performed following the SOP ( Annex 2 section 6), with the changes to equipment noted above. An additional change from the SOP was that buckwheat extracts were microcentrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 minutes after reconstitution to avoid blocking the 0.22 \u00b5m nylon syringe filters. The calib ration standards concentrations, samples and spikes included in each batch followed Protocol for the validation of LC -MS/MS analysis of TAs in breakfast cereals, plain flours, bread and cookies, Patrick Mulder, Version g (see Annex 2 ). The QC included with each validation batch therefore differs slightly from that specified in the SOP. The matrices used are shown in Table 1. Calibration standards were prepared in solvent in a range equivalent to 0.1 -50 ng/g (0.1 -50 ng/mL in the vial). The use of cali bration standards prepared in solvent deviates from the SOP, which specifies the use of matrix extracted standards.

For each batch, weighing, spiking and extraction were performed on one day and the extracts collected after centrifugation and stored in the fridge overnight. After SPE clean -up, evaporation and reconstitution the sample vials were stored in the fridge for a maximum of two nights before LC -MS analysis. They were not stored in the freezer as specified in the SOP ( Annex 2 section 6.4) due to concerns about expansion of the aqueous sample in the insert vial on freezing. Matrix -matched recove ry samples (MMRS) were prepared by taking two additional aliquots of the validation matrix through the clean -up and evaporation procedure and then adding 10 \u00b5L of the tropane alkaloid mixed standard at 1000 ng/mL, 40 \u00b5L methanol and 450 \u00b5L water. This met hod differs from the SOP ( Annex 2 section 6.4). Annex 3.

Fera Validation report for tropane alkaloids in cereal products These source tune parameters differ slightly from those i n the SOP ( Annex 2 section 7.2.1) 3 Results and Discussion Chromatographic peak shapes were generally improved compared to the previous validation . However , some of the issues noted during the initial validation were still observed. For example, tailing was observed for some analytes (particularly tropine, scopoline, convolidine and fillalbin). Many of the problems were associated with the low molecular weight, early -eluting compounds as these elute with very little or no organic solvent in the mobile ph ase and would probably benefit from being run under completely different chromatography conditions. Changes in peak shapes were also observed when comparing matrix and solvent, or during a batch. Because it was known that all the samples contained the an alytes it was possible, for these batches, to work out which peak should be integrated, although consistent integration was often very difficult. Identifying whether a peak is the correct one will be much more difficult for survey samples. Despite the mod ifications to the clean -up procedure to improve washing and elution, there were numerous interferences in some chromatograms, and in several cases these interferences were not fully resolved from the analyte peaks which made consistent integration of the p eaks difficult. This was particularly true for tropine and nortropinone. In several cases an interference made it necessary to raise the LOD and/or LOQ for that analyte to a concentration where the contribution from this interference would be minimal. I nterferences had a much larger influence on the LOD and LOQ than the actual response of the instrument. The instrument sensitivity for these analytes is very good, with low (sub ng/g) concentrations giving good signal to noise. Therefore it may be possib le to reduce the interferences and improve the method performance further by reducing the amount of sample extract loaded on the SPE cartridges (to prevent overloading the cartridges with matrix) or by making a further dilution of the cleaned up extract af ter re -constitution to dilute matrix effects. Dilution of extracts was assessed for some samples and it did improve the chromatography observed. Carry -over into the next injection(s) was observed for some analytes. Matrix washes were used to minimise ca rry-over into the samples as this seemed more effective than a simple solvent wash. In many cases the problem of carry -over was compounded by negative intercepts on the calibration graph which gave an unrealistically high calculated concentration for rela tively small carry -over peaks. Results for the analysis of each analyte in the six matrices included in the validation are shown in tables 2 to 7. The recovery values reported for the QC samples are corrected using the associated blank except where any residue in the blank appears to be caused by carry -over from a previous injection (i.e. where there is a similar residue in the preceding wash). Because the validation spikes were quantified using solvent calibration standards the value reported as 'recov ery' is actually a combination of recovery and the relative response of the analyte in matrix compared with solvent (i.e. matrix suppression or enhancement of signal). The RIKLT QC samples give a separate indication of recovery as these were pre -spiked ma terials received from RIKILT, but again these results give combined recovery and relative response of analyte in matrix compared with Annex 3. Fera Validation report for tropane alkaloids in cereal products solvent. The actual recovery of the extraction procedure can be measured by comparison of the MMRS samples, which were sp iked after extraction and clean -up, with samples spiked before extraction and clean -up. The MMRS samples were spiked at a level of 10ng/g. These values are, for the most part, within an acceptable range, although tropinone and acetylscopolamine recovery w as below 50% for several products. Buckwheat flour was a problematic matrix with very low apparent recovery for many analytes, although true recovery from MMRS spikes was acceptable. This highlights the problems of matrix suppression on analyte signal : noise and also explains the variation in LOD/LOQ and variation in spikes observed between many of the products. These are caused by interferences and difficulties with peak shapes, not by poor recovery. Buckwheat is one matrix that would benefit from usi ng a reduced amount of sample extract for clean -up as the matrix is so complex it seems it may have overloaded the clean -up cartridges as the final extracts were not as well cleaned -up as other matrices and were often difficult to reconstitute and filter. 4 Conclusions The method gave acceptable performance for atropine and scopolamine. In all cases the performance criteria for recovery and repeatability from Regulation (EU) No 401/2006 were met except for muesli and bread where the average recovery value s exceeded 120%, with highest level of 131% for the 1 ng/g scopolamine spikes in bread which is outside the 60 to 120% recommended range. In all cases the MMRS recovery was acceptable. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were also accepta ble for atropine and scopolamine. For the other analytes in many cases the method performance for the MMRS recovery was acceptable according to the criteria in Regulation (EU) No 401/2006, however the recovery for tropinone was consistently around 50% or less. The method is very repeatable for all analytes, RSD values for replicate spikes were consistently below 10%, the maximum variability observed was 13% which is well within the acceptable performance criteria. It was recommended to use a matrix extra cted calibration series for the initial validation and survey. The original validation data showed that unless the calibration matrix is exactly the same as the test samples this has no benefit and in fact can make results appear worse. For this validati on and the analysis of the survey samples solvent calibration standards have been used. For the survey samples an overspike of each test sample was also prepared to allow a positive control of every sample and to gain information on individual recovery va lues. In its current form the method is suitable for atropine and scopolamine but the results for some of the other analytes may still have a degree of uncertainty due to interferences observed in chromatography. This is not so apparent during validation as all samples are spiked, but becomes more of an issue for peak identification for test samples. Annex 3.

Fera Validation report for tropane alkaloids in teas 1 Introduction This report describes the procedure and the performance characteristics of a test method for the LC-MS analysis of 24 tropane alkaloids in tea. The tropane 3-scopolamine are used as internal standards. Validation of the method was performed by the analysis of tea with six replicate spikes at three concentrations (1 ng/g, 5 ng/g and 25 ng/g), quantified using calibration standards prepared in solvent. The matrix used for the validation was green tea supplied by Rikilt. Three additional types of tea - peppermint, fennel and black tea - were included as QC spikes at 10 ng/g, and green tea spiked at 10 ng/g was provided by Rikilt. Recovery was assessed via the inclusion of extracts spiked after extraction and clean -up at a concentration equivalent to 10 ng/g. The limit of detection (LOD) of the method was defined as the concentrat ion of each analyte required to give a chromatographic peak with signal to noise (s:n) ratio 3. This was assessed by extrapolation from the s:n ratio of each analyte in the lowest calibration standard and then applying a correction for recovery to deter mine the LOD in matrix. The limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method was defined as the concentration of the lowest calibration standard with s:n 3 and with a peak area fitting a calibration line with residuals 30 % and r2 0.95, again with a reco very correction applied to obtain the LOQ in matrix. 2 Materials and Methods Sample extraction, clean -up and analysis were performed following Standard Operation Protocol for LC-MS/MS analysis of TAs in cereals, cereal products, (herbal) dry tea, (herbal) tea infusions and stir - fry vegetable products, SOP for EFSA project Occurrence of TAs in food, Patrick Mulder & Patricia L\u00f3pez S\u00e1nchez , February 2016, version g (see Annex 2 ). The changes that were made to the SOP that are relevant for analysis of teas a re highlighted in red text. Any deviations from this SOP are recorded below. The same SOP was also used for analysis of green beans and mixed vegetables, due to the small number of samples analysed it was not required to carry out validation for these matrices, instead each sample was analysed with a single point standard addition (overspike). 2.1 Standards Stock solutions of the individual tropane alkaloids at 100 \u00b5g/mL were provided by Rikilt. A mixed standard at 1000 ng/mL was prepared by pipetting 200 \u00b5L of each stock into a 20 mL volumetric flask and making up to the mark with methanol. This mixed standard was then further diluted to 100 ng/mL by pipetting 1 mL int o a 10 mL volumetric flask and making up to the mark with methanol Annex 4. Fera Validation report for tropane alkaloids in teas and to 10 ng/mL by pipetting 100 \u00b5L into a 10 mL volumetric flask and making up to the mark with methanol. Stock solutions of the individual internal standards at 100 \u00b5g/mL were also provid ed by Rikilt. A mixed internal standard solution at 1000 ng/mL was prepared by pipetting 250 \u00b5L of each stock into a 25 mL volumetric flask and making up to the mark with methanol. This method of preparing the mixed standard solutions differs from the SOP (see Annex 2 sections 1.2-2.2). 2.2 Reagents All reagents used were of an equivalent quality to that specified in the SOP (Appendix I section 3) and mixed solvents were prepared in the same way (scaling up or down for quantity required). The elution solvent used was 1 % ammonia in methanol, which wa s prepared by dilution of 7 N ammonia in methanol (21 mL 7 N ammonia in methanol was mixed with 229 mL methanol). This method of preparation differs from the SOP (Appendix I section 3.2.4). 2.3 Equipment The equipment used was equivalent to that specifie d in the SOP (Appendix I section 4) with the following exceptions: An orbital shaker (AQS) was used instead of an overhead shaker. Samples were dried under nitrogen on a dry block sample concentrator, not in a TurboVap. Samples were collected after elution and dried down in glass sample tubes instead of polypropylene. Samples were filtered using 0.2 \u00b5m nylon syringe filters into glass vials instead of using 0.45 \u00b5m polypropylene PTFE filtervials. A smaller particle filter was required to use with the UPLC column and it was found that the samples would not pass through 0.2 \u00b5m PTFE filters, possibly due to swelling caused by the aqueous solvent. The SPE cartridges chosen were Phenomenex Strata -X-C, 33 \u00b5m, 200 mg, 6 mL. Annex 4. Fera Validation report for tropane alkaloids in teas 2.4 Sample Extraction and Clean -Up Sample extraction and clean -up was performed following the SOP ( Annex 2 section 6), with the changes to equipment noted above. The validation batch consisted of green tea (blank material supplied by Rikilt) spiked at 1 ng/g, 5 ng/g and 25 ng/g. Six replicat es were prepared at each spike level and the blank material was also analysed. QC samples of peppermint, fennel and black tea were spiked at 10 ng/g and the blank materials were also analysed. Green tea spiked at 10 ng/g was provided by Rikilt. This inf ormation is summarised in Table 1. Calibration standards were prepared in solvent in a range equivalent to 0.1 -50 ng/g (0.1 -50 ng/mL in the vial). The use of calibration standards prepared in solvent deviates from the SOP, which specifies the use of matri x extracted standards. Table 1: Matrices used for validation spikes and QC tea S16-002254 Black tea S16-002255 Green tea Rikilt The batch was weighed, spiked and extracted on one day, and the extracts collected after centrifugation and stored in the fridge overnight before clean -up. After SPE clean -up, e vaporation and reconstitution the samples were refrigerated prior to analysis by LC -MS. They were not stored in the freezer as specified in the SOP ( Annex 2 section 6.4) due to concerns about expansion of the aqueous sample in the insert vial on freezing. Matrix -matched recovery samples (MMRS) were prepared by taking two additional aliquots of the blank green tea through the clean -up and evaporation procedure and then adding 450 \u00b5L water and 50 \u00b5L of the tropane alkaloid mixed standard at 100 ng/mL. This method differs from the SOP (Annex 2 section 6.4). 2.5 LC-MS Analysis Samples were analysed using an Acquity UPLC system to BEH 18 \u00b5m x 2.1 mm) (W aters) Column temperature: 50 oC Annex 4.

Compounds with the m/z were chromatographically well resolved. Annex 4. Fera Validation report for tropane alkaloids in teas The response for the majority of analytes was generally linear, although not necessarily over the full range (equivalent to 0.1 -50 ng/g). In some cases (nortr opinine, pseudotropine and scopoline) the s:n of the lower calibration standards was poor, therefore they were excluded from the graph. The lowest calibration standard was also excluded from several other graphs because the response at that concentration was non -linear. Some analytes showed non -linearity for the calibration standard equivalent to 50 ng/g; in most cases this can be attributed to saturation of the detector but for other analytes it is unexplained. There were numerous interferences in the ch romatograms, particularly for the lower m/z tropanes. In some cases (tropine, scopoline and convolvine) these interferences, or a high background, affected the analyte peak such that it was necessary to quantify using a different transition to that specif ied in the SOP ( Annex 2 section 8.2.3). In cases where interferences could not be avoided and affect quantification of the spikes, the spike concentrations have been corrected by subtraction of the calculated concentration in the associated blank. In the case of nortropinone, an interference made it impossible to quantify the spikes at 1 ng/g. Carry -over into the next injection(s) was observed for many of the analytes. Wash injections were included in the run, including washing with an injection of blank matrix because this seemed to be more effective than a solvent blank injection for some analytes. Carry -over appears as a very small residue in the matrix blanks for some injections, but not at a level that will affect quantification of the spikes. Resu lts for the analysis of each analyte in the six matrices included in the validation are shown in Table 2. If there was an interference or residue in the blank the results have been corrected by subtraction of this residue before reporting the mean or reco very values. No results are reported for the black tea QC samples because an LC pump error resulted in elution at the wrong retention time therefore peaks were lost outside the acquisition windows. Because the validation spikes were quantified using calib ration standards prepared in solvent, the value reported as \"recovery\" is actually a combination of recovery and the relative response of the analyte in matrix compared with solvent (i.e. matrix suppression or enhancement of the signal). The actual recove ry of the extraction procedure can be measured by comparison of the MMRS samples, which were spiked after extraction and clean -up, with samples spiked before extraction and clean - up. The MMRS recovery results reported in Table 2 are calculated by comparis on of the MMRS with the 5 ng/g and 25 ng/g spikes. Results for atropine and scopolamine are inherently corrected for recovery and matrix effects by the inclusion of the internal standard. Calibration graphs for these compounds were prepared by plotting th e ratio of the analyte : internal standard against concentration, rather than the peak area against concentration. The large variation in \"recovery\" values for the same analyte in different types of tea highlights that it would not be possible to accuratel y quantify residues in a particular tea using matrix extracted standards in a different type of tea. For this reason, samples will be analysed using solvent Annex 4. Fera Validation report for tropane alkaloids in teas calibration standards, with each sample analysed alongside an overspike to allow individual recove ry values to be calculated. QC samples were also run with each batch of tea samples. These QC consisted of blank green tea, a sample of this green tea spiked at 10 ng/g at Fera, a sample spiked at 10 ng/g at Rikilt and a blank extract spiked at a level e quivalent to 10 ng/g after extraction and clean -up (i.e. MMRS). In addition, an MMRS was also prepared for each of the eight different types of tea which were sampled. These were used to calculate the actual recovery by comparison with the same sample sp iked before extraction and clean -up. This actual recovery takes into account the recovery of the analyte through the whole analytical procedure and accounts for any matrix suppression or enhancement effects that occur in the mass spectrometer. Therefore it is a real indication of the performance of the method. Lemon balm gave the lowest recoveries of all the products tested in the validation with recoveries in the range 23 - 74%. Most alkaloids gave acceptable recovery performance, however the low molec ular weight tropane alkaloid compounds tended to have lower recovery for all sample types. Repeatability was excellent for all analytes at all levels in all matrices tested with RSD values ranging from <1% to 19% for 6 replicate analyses at any individual level, even where recovery values were low. The QC data for the tea batches is shown in Table 3. MMRS data is in table 4. Note that because the MMRS were prepared using real samples rather than blanks, the actual concentrations measured in the spikes a nd MMRS depends on whether there was any residue in the sample.
