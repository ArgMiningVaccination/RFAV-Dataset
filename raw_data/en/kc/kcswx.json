It was not an easy death. He survived five bouts of PCP, but his body could not cope with disseminated KS, fungus in his lungs, MAC, CMV and other infections, all at the same time. Mark began on AZT in 1988, and was therefore one of the first to benefit from his own AIDS treatment activism. I got to know Mark at that time, when we were both involved in the planning of the 1988 national demonstration at the FDA, demanding approval of life-saving medicines. Mark was one of the thousands of people for whom AZT and pentamidine and other prophylaxes-the hot news of the late 80sprolonged life, bought them some time. Not enough time. I loved Mark, and I am left with sadness and a cold anger. Eleven years, three antivirals, hundreds of promising treatments \"in the pipeline.\" George Bush is lying when he says that $2 billion are spent on AIDS research. In actual fact, the research budget has never been more than $500 million. AIDS treatment money is shrinking too. Because much Federal money for AIDS is now funneled into the Ryan White CARE Act, it is easy to see that inadequate appropriations are being divided among more people, making the expenditure per patient significantly smaller. Almost no one is spending any money on AIDS prevention. And we are on the eve of destruction: the Harvard AIDS Institute estimates that 100 million people worldwide will be infected by the year 2000. In my more despairing moments, I think it is the end of the world. Yes, there is reason to hope. There is an explosion of scientific investigation and practical medicine for opportunistic infections and possible antivirals with real power. There are more agencies and organizations to deal continued on p 14 AN INTRODUCTION TO ('A IMMUNE-BASED THERAPY V presented by Dr. Robert Schooley and reported by Walt Senterfitt Dr. Schooley is a leading AIDS academic researcher as well as treating physician, and is chair of the Immune Based Therapy Working Group of the national AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG). His presentation to the LA Physicians AIDS Forum is a good introduction to immune-based therapies, though not intended to be comprehensive. A somewhat different perspective is offered in a related article on page 12 by Stephan Korsia, the Coordinator of Treatment Education Programs at APLA. Immune-based therapy for HIV infection is an area that has generated a lot of controversy. In the early phases of the AIDS epidemic, much discussion of potentially effective treatments centered on trying to stimulate the immune response, given this is an immunologic disease. Later on, as early immunologic therapies were disappointing and drugs like AZT showed promise, most efforts to develop therapies were directed at the etiologic agent, HIV. Immune based therapies may now be returning to prominence, depending on what results we see from laboratory studies and clinical trials over the next 12 to 18 months. CONCEPTS OF IMMUNE-BASED THERAPIES There are two different general concepts of immune-based therapies. One concept emphasizes AIDS as a viral disease associated with gradual decline of general host immune responsiveness. As that responsiveness declines below a certain threshold, one sees the onset of various opportunistic infections and tumors. The way to deal with this decline is to find ways to stimulate the general host immune responsiveness. The take home message, though, is that these general immune response modifiers which include cytokines like interleukin-2 and the so-called immunomodulators like isoprinosine and immuthiol and Imreg-have been quite disappointing. The tests of the non-cytokine immunomodulators have failed to demonstrate sufficient selectivity in boosting general immune response and thus have failed to convince many people that they are bona fide anti-HIV agents. THE INTERFERONS As to the cytokines, several have been tried, most extensively the interferons. There are multiple reasons one might consider interferons in the context of HIV. Interferons have direct antiretroviral action against HIV itself. They are immunomodulators with capacity to stimulate immune response against HIV itself as well as against some of the associated opportunistic infections. They have also been used against Kaposi's sarcoma. Interferon alpha, beta, and gamma are also synergistic, in vitro, against HIV with other antiretroviral agents with other modes of action. continued on p 13 [Page 2](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0361.009/2) BEING ALIVE Sean Kinney President Ken Thompson Vice President Jim Slaten Secretary Michael Reynolds Treasurer Wendy Arnold (Speakers' Bureau), Gilbert Cornilliet (Newsletter), Robert Dal Porto (LIFE AIDS Lobby Delegate), Don Long, M.D., Larry Long (Support Group), Fran McDonald, Carlos Morales-Angeles (Newsletter-Spanish), Walt Senterfitt Ferd Eggan Executive Director 1 NEWLE,.\"TlTER/3 ' FINDING YOUR VOICE by Michael Lawrence Dwiggins In memory of Fred Clark Circulation: 10,000 Staff: Kevin Bowman Ed Casson Gilbert Cornilliet Jorge Correa Ferd Eggan John Hornung John Johnson Michael Kalla Lori Levine Charles Lucas Carlos Morales Walt Senterfitt Jim Stoecker Jim Slaten Please direct all correspondence to Jim Stoecker.

We also have an extensive library of books and periodicals designed to give you the best tools for fiqhtinq back aqainst HIV! \"How did you get it? Is your family supportive? What's it like knowing you're going to die?\" Sound like tough questions? You bet- especially if you are sitting in front of a room full of strangers and someone has just asked you such questions. It happens each time a member of Being Alive Speakers Bureau gives a 'presentation. They are answered, or not answered in some cases, drawing on each individual's unique experience of living with their disease. This very experience is a powerful tool for outreach to the community. As a form of education, it is unequaled in its ability to cross educational, cultural, economic and gender lines. The speaker is the expert on living with this disease. In sharing that experience, the whole gamut of HIV education can be presented-transmission, prevention, treatment, surviving, even thriving, and sometimes facing the inevitable process of dying. Contained in the context of personal experience, the information finds an eager and attentive audience. It is my experience, corroborated by other Bureau members, that a wonderful form of empowerment takes place through speaking. Empowerment you say? Absolutely! Imagine the quiet terror you might feel just before addressing a group, knowing you will be disclosing your HIV status to these strangers. All the things we fear-rejection, judgment, isolation-stare you starkly in the face and must be confronted. Those few words, \"I am infected with HIV\" or \"I have AIDS\" can be the most fearsome and simultaneously the most liberating words you will ever speak. To own your disease publicly is an act of heroism as well as a unique area of coming out. To tell your truth to strangers in the hope that they will benefit from your experience both validates you and honors the listener. The response is most often warmth and support. Displays of such per sonal courage have a peculiar way of drawing out our better human qualities. Make no mistake-personal disclosure of one's HIV status requires courage of a high order, but it is more than worth it. Sure, there are the occasional crass remarks and whispers, the avoided handshake or hug, the judgmental statement, even overtly hostile questions. Yet even these in the hands of a seasoned speaker offer an opportunity for honesty and, if answered in a forthright manner, contribute further to your empowerment. These very things require we look more deeply into our own judgments and fears in order to respond appropriately. Such incidents are few and eventually become the colorful anecdotes shared with fellow speakers. Speakers Bureau volunteers present themselves to all types of groups-public and private, educational institutions, medical facilities, business groups, professional organizations, clubs and churches. We give interviews, write articles, and occasionally show up on TV and in videos. This disease affects all of us so we make ourselves as available as possible. There are many experiences awaiting anyone willing to take up the formidable challenge of HIV education. Is public speaking for everyone? Probably not. There is however only one way to find out. You will be bigger, the community will be better and maybe, just maybe, someone will not get infected because you had the courage to put words to your experience and speak it. Are you interested in speaking or would you like to schedule an engagement? Call or write the Speakers Bureau at the Being Alive office. Also at the Sunset office, on the second Sunday of the month, from 4 to 6 pm the Speakers Bureau holds its regular monthly inservice. This meeting is open to all. V BEING ALIVE STATEMENT Being Alive is an organization OF and FOR people with HIV/AIDS. We understand the pain and the fear; how easy it is to hide, how difficult it can be to come to terms with this disease and reach out. Being Alive is the means we have created to help us connect with each other, bring others like us out of isolation, and take charge of our lives, our care and our destiny.

Although the idea of prophylaxis against opportunistic infections is becoming widely accepted, you should know that the-efficacy of prophylaxis has only been clearly demonstrated scientifically for Pneumocystis. For PCP prophylaxis, current recommendations are for persons with CD4 less than 200 and/ or CD4 percentage less than 20% to be placed on one of the following regimens: * Oral TMP-SMX (bactrim or septra) - double-strength pill three times weekly (some use daily) (If mild rash occurs, but no accompanying fever, nausea or sloughing of mucus membranes, it may be appropriate to continue the medication. Consult your health care provider.) * Oral dapsone - 100 mg orally three times weekly (some use 50 mg daily) * Aerosolized pentamidine - 300 mg inhaled monthly. Other people for whom PCP prophylaxis is indicated include: anyone with a history of PCP, another AIDS-defining 01, or undergoing chemotherapy for an AIDS-defining neoplasm (KS, non-Hodgkins lymphoma). Although there has been no formally proven efficacy (i.e. published in the medical literature) of prophylaxis for other Ols, there has been an evolving standard of care over the last few years. Below, you will find a chart of suggested prophylaxis regimens for a number of opportunistic infections. These regimens are taken from three highly respected sources. Treatment Issues is published by the Gay Men's Health Crisis in New York. Project Inform, headed by Martin Delaney, is headquartered in San Francisco. Critical Path AIDS Project is a Philadelphia-based organization. You will note that there are agreements and disagreements among these suggested prophylaxis regimens. Remember: these are not proven therapies. We do not yet have definitive answers. Some actually oppose the use of prophylaxis therapy. They cite the fact that long term, low dose therapy (prophylaxis) can encourage the development of resistant organisms (as has been shown with fluconazole and cryptococcus.)

For the past dozen years the gay community has had, in most instances, only itself to turn to for HIV social services since our own government and-let's give discredit where it's due-a large part of the American people, too, sat idly by and did nothing to fight the greatest epidemic in history. My greatest sorrow as an American has been to witness this massive betrayal of our fellow countrymen, unprecedented in our history. Social services, taking care of our own, has received short shrift in the era of HIV. Those who rallied to this crisis truly define the word pride-gay or otherwise. Whether you worked an hour per week at a local AIDS organization or devoted night and day to caring for someone desperately sick, you have individually the satisfaction of knowing the goodness of your deeds and collectively the knowledge that you've made history. And history it has been. When has there ever been a demonstration of decency and compassion on such a tremendous scale? Looking at all of you around me at CSW and the Candlelight Memorial, you who have so concertedly served your brothers and sisters-gay and straight-and you who have thereby earned your places in the sun, it was no wonder to me that I have come to regard people like you to be the standard by which the true measure of a person is judged. Gay Pride-you're the greatest, so of course you're proud! AIDS EDUCATION FOR THE DEAF This organization recently celebrated its fifth birthday and puts the emphasis of its operations, just as their name says, on education as the most effective way to impede the spread of HIV. Their services include rap sessions for deaf persons, orientation for health care workers to sharpen their effectiveness with deaf patients, and maintenance of a library that includes videos in sign language and captions. And this is just a partial list of the fine things they do. They have a drop-in center where one to-one peer counseling with volunteers is available. All volunteers are thoroughly trained to accurately answer questions and make referrals (volunteers are always welcomegive them a call).. AIDS Education for the Deaf is located at 6565 Sunset Blvd., Suite 415, in Los Angeles; phone 213.962.0874 (voice) or 213.962.0870 (TDD). 1992 RENTAL ASSISTANCE The new forms for this year's Rental Assistance are now ready. Those who requested them from me in advance should have received them by now; if not, please call me. In lieu of calling the state to obtain one (the published phone number seems always to be busy), just call me if you want a form. Please note that the state is accepting these forms through August 31 only, so act now. GRIFFITH PARK PICNIC This year again I'm having a picnic for the folks at Being Alive; I think it'll be a complement to their activities with Connect!. Last year's picnic was a lot of fun and this is a great way to have a nice afternoon with old friends while you meet new friends, too. Because of different likes, dislikes, and dietary requirements, the picnic is BYOLBring Your Own Lunch, a good idea (to be safe, also bring a hat and sunguard). I'll bring two huge tarps and spreads to provide shade and seating for everybody, refreshments (sodas, juices, and so on), munchies (chips, dips, crackers, cookies), picnic goods (paper plates, cups, napkins, forks), diversions (frisbees, checkers, cards, some nifty kites), first aid items, too. And I learned my lesson last year. This year I'm also bringing soap, towels, and toilet paper for the bathroom in the park! The picnic will be in Griffith Park on Sunday, July 12 from noon on. If you're interested, call me for directions to our picnic spot in the park. (Please note that on Sunday, July 12 only, there will not be the usual afternoon support group at Being Alive in Silver Lakewe'll be at the picnic.) (Fran McDonald has been in Social Services for 21 years and welcomes your calls at 213.664.4772.) ~ ONE PWA'S EMPOWERMENT by Ken Thompson After living with AIDS for over five years, I still have unresolved fears, raging angers and hopeless nights, but they are fewer and less frequent. The change did not just happen. It was eased by learning that I did matter, first to myself and then to others, that I did have choices, even if they all seemed inadequate, and that there was a place like Being Alive where others knew of my experiences and feelings because they too had felt them. In this process, empowerment started to be more than a word. It became knowledge of medicines and protocols. It was someone saying \"therchange doctors if you don't like like your treatment.\" It evolved into \"we can make a difference together.\" We can see a difference in our County hospital system. We can see a difference in how people with HIV/ AIDS perceive themselves and, more importantly, how we who are infected and affected by the disease reach out to others with information, with peer support, and with a clarity of purpose I have never felt before. I am not the same person I was five years ago. My anger has been focused into advocacy, my fear has translated into teaching others how not to fear, and my hopelessness has become the power to speak my truth, regain my dignity and in a small way let others know there is life after AIDS if one wants it. To me, this is empowerment. It is the freedom to live the rest of my life, not to wait for the inevitability of my demise. (Ken Thompson is Vice-President of Being Alive's Board of Directors.) V DEFUSING THE FEAR AROUND DEATH On Saturday, July 11, at Being Alive's Silver Lake office, Cassandra Christenson, RN will discuss how we can, layer by layer, unveil the mysteries, the fears, the unwanted truths and begin the process of defusing the fears around the unwelcome issue of death. Ms. Christenson has been involved with this issue for many years as a practicing RN and through her work with The Center for Living. She will speak firstto Being Alive's group facilitators at 11 am and then at noon to any of you who need to learn more about your own feelings, fears or uncertanties surrounding death. 1 4 ewlttr ul O19 [Page 5](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0361.009/5) ON LOOKING GOOD WHEN YOU FEEL SO BAD by Lori Levine A popular topic at support group meetings has been the annoyance of looking good when you feel so bad. Daily, I hear sincere complaints from HIV+ people who have been told how good they look when they are experiencing some of the more taxing symptoms of HIV: endless fatigue and debilitating fevers, or even toxic reactions to the only antivirals available to us. It is so irritating when you have the energy of a snail, you feel like you are dying and people always respond with-\"but you look so good!\" Is that supposed to wipe away the pain and suffering of living with a potentially fatal virus which is constantly attacking our only physical and emotional defenses in the most insidious ways-because we look good? Sure some of us don't have wasting syndrome, and may even have some extra poundage. Yes, many of us look great-it's genetics, or we have spent hundreds of dollars in the process-but this doesn't mean we aren't as sick as we feel. Others never seem to believe that we really aren't well, when their perception of our appearance reflects otherwise. The first support group I attended was populated completely with men and myself (the usual story for women in the beginning of the epidemic). There was a memorably handsome man who looked fantastic, yet was always complaining about how sick he was feeling. He hadn't had the energy to work in a few months and most days he couldn't even get out of bed. Every time he went to see his doctor, the staff always remarked about how good he looked and consequently he didn't receive the same attention as his emaciated peers. Nobody really believed he was that sick because he looked so good! He died less than a month later. Did you ever notice how the really sick looking patients get all of the doctor's time, and the healthier looking ones have to make due with whatever time the doctor has left? Imagine the dilemma of the healthier looking yet sicker individual. Recently, I heard a story of a previously robust individual who had just recovered from a severe bout of wasting syndrome and was consequently told by several \"friends\" how much better he looked without the extra weight that he had been saving up for just such an occasion. This encourages emotional problems and diseases like anorexia. It isn't just our vanity that is at risk here. There is a serious psychological impact placed on an individual who constantly has to prove how ill he/she is in order to have others recognize the seriousness of the situation. Throughout history, women have been expected to look glamorous under any circumstance. Living with HIV has become a very difficult situation for us to cope with in light of this. Nobody told us that AZT, ddl, and ddC will manifest different side effects in us, such as extreme water retention and bloating in our faces, upper bodies, and abdomen. This isn't always easy to camouflage. I wish the health care providers would listen to us and offer this information to women who are just beginning the drugs. We're expected to keep our hair dyed and styled, even when it is falling out due to toxic medications. Our make-up is expected to look good even when our hands are too shaky to apply it. So we do all of this, and what happens: nobody believes we are ill! Many of us have handicapped parking placards because we really don't have the ability to walk long distances, but unless we look like we are dying-which many of us don't-we receive hostile stares and comments from onlookers as if we were robbing some poor crippled individual of their rights and parking space. This is so unfair considering we know how crippling HIV can be for many of us. Yes, many of us look great-it's genetics, or we have spent hundreds of dollars in the processbut this doesn't mean we aren't as sick as we feel. What about when you make yourself go to a party and you are feeling so exhausted and fatigued that you cannot stay awake another minute? But because you look so good the host pressures you to stay and \"have some fun.\" Talk about peer pressure. Who can have fun when they are feeling like sh-t! Sometimes we need a day or week off of work because we have fatigue or some other annoying symptom-but if we look goodthe boss and co-workers think we are faking! Many friends and family have problems dealing with what is happening to us. It hurts them to see us, as much as it hurts us to see our sick friends suffering which brings us to another dilemma. Very often we do our best to protect our loved ones which in some cases means making ourselves look as good as we can, to spare others the anguish of seeing us visibly weak and ill, even when we are wincing in pain on the inside. We do this at the expense of our own health because the result is others feel better when we look better-but this process gives us stress, and we get sicker. Where lies the balance? I don't believe the old adage about \"fixing ourselves up will cheer us up because if we look better we'll feel better. Whoever made this up didn't have HIV! We don't want people feeling sorry for us so we do the best we can to avoid itwhich can include improving our facade to avoid pity. This results in the opposite effect, so people forget how sick we really can be and expect the same behavior and responsibilities from us as a completely well individual. This kind of stress, as well as the constant feeling of having to keep up appearances, will also add to destroying the immune system. Then there are those who never look sick, no matter what is going on. What's a good looking HIV+ person supposed to do? Make ourselves look sick to satisfy others that we are weak? Make ourselves look healthy so others don't notice we are sick? We can't help it if we look too good or don't! And what difference should this make in our daily interactions or in the services we require? I say just be yourself and hope for the best. I think the most difficult situation is keeping up appearances for the family. Very often they are in real denial, hoping \"for the best\" and believing \"a cure is just around the corner\" and \"everyone noticed how great you look.\" Well sure, because if we looked as bad as we feel, you'd all lose your hope, and sometimes your hope is the only thing that keeps us going. It's a vicious circle and an even more vicious virus. Please let there be an end to this nightmare soon. (On a personal note, good-bye to Tom Ingalls, my good friend and a great camera man whose young life was stolen by this dreadful disease June 26, 1992.

V July 1992 V Newsletter [Page 6](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0361.009/6) BEING ALIVE MEDICAL UPDATE - JUNE 1, 1992 presented by Mark Katz MD and reported by Jim Stoecker CONFERENCE ON CLINICAL CARE OPTIONS Critical Care America, a national organization with a large HIV-focused treatment network, sponsored an important conference in late April. Titled \"Clinical Care Options for HIV Disease,\" the conference brought together researchers from all over the US. A number of papers were presented over the four days of the conference. AN ADVOCATE FOR EARLIER TREATMENT Dr. Lawrence Corey of the University of Washington spoke on translating research into clinical practice. In the course of his remarks, Dr. Corey came through as a strong advocate for earlier treatment of HIV disease. He explained that, in his view, waiting until T-cells fall below 500 to begin treatment of a chronic infection is like waiting until the kidneys are half destroyed to begin treating hypertension. (Hypertension may slowly destroy the kidneys over time.) Corey concluded that he personally thought that a physician should begin treatment as soon as they diagnose someone as HIV+. Corey's lecture was considered somewhat controversial. Not all agreed that earlier treatment was the way to go. Some physicians feel that antiviral therapy has a limited effect no matter when it is begun. Others, however, agreed that the sooner antiviral therapy is begun the better. Today we have no definitive answer on when antiviral therapy should begin. The trend of medical opinion, however, has been to begin treatment earlier. Before the availability of AZT, there was no treatment to consider. When AZT was introduced, the drug was used on those with less than 200 Tcells. Further studies changed the standard to recommending antiviral therapy begin at less than 500 T-cells. Now we are hearing researchers advocate even earlier intervention. There is an ongoing study in the US that is looking at whether intervention at greater than 500 T-cells makes a difference. Since this study involves people with high T-cells to begin with, it will take some time to get significant results. Nonetheless, we should be seeing some data in 1993 that will contribute to the ongoing discussion of when best to start antiviral therapy. SKIN CONDITIONS IN HIV DISEASE Dr. Clay Cockerell of Dallas addressed the issue of the numerous skin conditions that plague many people with HIV disease. Almost any skin condition that has been defined seems to occur more often in people infected with HIV. In fact, the skin may be the organ most affected by HIV over the course of time. The most common skin condition among those HIV+ is seborrheic dermatitis, seen as dry, flaky skin. Dr. Cockerell estimated that at least 50% of his HIV+ patients have this condition at some point. Steroid medication is used as treatment and sometimes an antifungal is added. Another common skin condition is folliculitis which shows up as small pimples. Sometimes these are caused by a bacteria and can be treated with a common antibiotic. Among those HIV+, there is often found a particular kind of folliculitis that does not culture out to a bacteria. This is commonly referred to as \"itchy/bumpy\" syndrome because of the bumps on the skin that itch. The official name for this condition is eosinophilic pustular folliculitis. Eosinophils are a certain type of white blood cell that gravitates to the follicles and causes inflammation. Dr. Cockerell reported success in treating this type of folliculitis by using ultra violet light or tanning booths. Although HIV+ people are commonly cautioned to avoid exposure to the sun, with some conditions such exposure might be beneficial. Dr. Cockerell also talked about treating molloscum contagiosum. This is another fairly common skin condition in HIV+ people, occurring in about 25-30% of those infected with the virus. Molloscum appears as a cross between a pimple and a wart and is usually found on the face or in the genital area. Currently, there is no generally accepted treatment, although the molluscum can be removed for cosmetic purposes. Cockerell suggested the use of either liquid nitrogen or Retin-A as potential treatments for this skin condition. SURROGATE MARKERS: P24 AND CD8 Dr. Robert Schooley of Denver presented a paper on surrogate markers and clinical practice. He spoke first about the measuring of p24 antigen. This is one of the markers looked at in the later stages of HIV infection. The problem is that p24 antigen has not been a consistent or accurate marker for disease progression. Many times p24 antigen is stuck next to an antibody and is thus not detectable by current tests. Dr. Schooley explained that there is now a chemical technique that can free up p24 and thus gives a higher likelihood of finding p24 antigen than we have had in the past. Even with this new technique for dissociating p24 antigen, only about half of PWAs will show positive for p24. Thus, we can conclude that p24 is not a very significant or useful marker. For an individual who does test with high p24, however, this knowledge may help direct the course of clinical care. Dr. Schooley also talked about the role of CD8 cells and their potential use as prognostic markers. For the past few years, researchers have suspected that CD8 cells (or T8 or T-suppressor cells) play a greater role in HIV disease than had previously been thought. CD8 cells work with CD4 cells to ward off infection. Once the CD4 has been turned on by a germ or invading pathogen, the CD8 goes into action to help produce the antibody that can destroy the offending germ. In nonHIV infected people, there are more CD4 cells than CD8 cells and thus the ratio of CD4 to CD8 is greater than one. In the early days of HIV treatment, the ratio of CD4 to CD8 (calculated by dividing CD4 count by CD8 count) was looked at as one way of gauging disease progression. For most, the ratio was less than one; CD8 count was greater than CD4 count. While we once viewed this ratio reversal with alarm, researchers now suggest that the higher the CD8 count the better the prognosis may be. The role of CD8 is still not fully understood; we do not yet know just what CD8 is doing. The trend, however, is to view high CD8 as a potential cofactor in forestalling HIV progression. If we are saying that persons with higher CD8, all other things being equal, may do better than those with lower CD8, then our old use of the CD4/CD8 ratio is no longer valid. A low ratio may mean higher CD8 and not just lower CD4. We need more information on just what this all means. TREATING MILD TO MODERATE PCP Dr David Hardy of UCLA addressed the conference on the management of opportunistic infections. His presentation centered on a nine month long study that compared Bactrim to the new Burroughs-Wellcome drug, BW566C80, as standard treatment for mild to moderate PCP. Dr Hardy concluded that BW566C80 was equally successful in treating mild to moderate PCP as Bactrim. BW566C80, moreover, showed significantly [Page 7](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0361.009/7) PEOLE ITHHI/AIS A TIN C ALIIO There were people in the study that had to go off one drug or the other. Patients went off Bactrim because of the side effects, whereas patients quit BW566C80 because it simply did not work. So, if BW566C80 works for a PCP patient, it is of equal treatment value as Bactrim with a good deal less toxicity. An additional advantage of BW566C80 is that it is an oral drug, rather than an IV. Word now is that the FDA may approve BW566C80 for PCP treatment sometime within the next year. SURVEY OF DISEASES FOUND IN HIV+ IN US ArecentJournaloftheAmerican Medical Association published a report on the spectrum of disease found in people with HIV in the US. This is the first major study to look at the prevalence of certain medical conditions among the HIV infected. Over 7600 patients who received care at some 50 clinics throughout the nation during 1990-91 were included in the study. About one third of this study population had a diagnosis of AIDS. This means that for every person diagnosed with AIDS, there were two other people with HIV who needed some medical care. Among the study population, about 25% had less than 100 T-cells. About 12% were in the 100-200 range and 33% in the 200 -500 range. This leaves about 30% above the 500 T-cell level. The most common condition found was thrush or oral candidiasis, detected in 34.3% of the study population. Oral hairy leukoplakia, found in almost no other population than the HIV+, was diagnosed in almost 10% of those in the study. PCP was diagnosed in 15.9% of those seen by the clinics. About 10% of the study population were women. Among the participants, 11.2% were found to have vaginal candidiasis and 3% pelvic inflammatory disease. MORE ON TB AND HIV Tuberculosis is not an opportunistic infection. If you are HIV+, however, and you are exposed to TB, there is a greater likelihood of actually coming down with TB. There is a problem detecting TB exposure in those who are HIV+. To test for the presence of TB, a skin test is placed on the forearm. If the area of the test turns red to a distance of greater than 10 mm, this is considered proof that the individual has been exposed to TB. What makes the skin turn red is the presence of sensitized lymphocytes. In people with HIV, where the lymphocyte count may be low, the body may not be able to react appropriately to the skin test. Because of this, a convention was set up a few years ago that accepts a 5 mm redness as indicative of TB exposure, if the individual being tested is known to be HIV+. Now researchers are reporting that even this 5 mm criterion still misses a significant number of people who are HIV+ and exposed to TB. Sorme have suggested dropping the accepted redness reaction to 2.5 mm. All people who are HIV+ should have the TB skin test, even if the result might possibly be inconclusive. And if your T-cells are low and possible TB symptoms appear, appropriate diagnostic studies, such as chest x-ray and sputum analysis, should be done. TB is readily treatable and if a person is HIV+ and exposed to TB, the treatment protocol for TB should be fully carried out. COMPOSITION A AS COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY The Immune Enhancement Project in Berkeley recently reported on its study of Composition A as complementary or alternative therapy for HIV. Composition A consists of some 20 herbal substances that have antiviral and/or immune boosting effects. The herbs are taken in pill form and the dosage is 15-20 pills a day. The Project studied 150 HIV+ individuals who followed a 12 week course of Composition A. Four categories of results were plotted: well being, energy level, general physical condition, and activity level. These are subjective criteria, of course, but a majority of participants did report improvement in all four categories. Among the 150 participants, 30 different symptoms were identified. Again, a majority reported improvement in whatever symptoms they had been experiencing. These results are subjective measures, but they do point up the potential value of complementary or alternative therapies for treating HIV. We need more studies of such alternative approaches. For information on Composition A, you can call the Immune Enhancement Project at 510.252.8711. STRESS MANAGEMENT, EXERCISE AND DEALING WITH HIV The Journal of Clinical and Consulting Psychology reports on an interesting study conducted at the University of Miami. Researchers recruited 86 homosexual men who did not know their serostatus. The men were randomized into three groups. One group was put on a program of stress man agement/relaxation techniques. A second group was given a daily exercise regimen to follow. The third group served as a control; they continued their usual routine. Five weeks into the study, all participants were tested for HIV. Thirty-three of the 86 were found to be positive. Researchers noted that the control group members who found out they were HIV+ were significantly more depressed than the members of the other two groups who had similar news. The HIV+ in the relaxation group had an initial average CD4 of 482, but six weeks into the study, the average CD4 had risen to 651. And, ten weeks into the study, the HIV+ in the exercise group had statistically significant higher T-cell counts than the HIV+ in either of the other two groups. It is difficult to know what to make of this study. Wht this Miami study and the study on Composition A point out is that there are options for dealing with HIV beyond the AZT/ddl/ddC approach that we hear so much about. Complementary or alternative therapies should be explored and considered by anyone who is HIV+. TREATING CRYPTOSPORIDIUM INFECTION Cryptosporidium infection is quite common with HIV and causes serious diarrhea. For some, anti-diarrheal therapy works well and the infection is self limited. For others, the infection persists. A recent study in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that the mean CD4 for those with self-limiting infection was 312, whereas those with a persistent infection had a mean CD4 of 57. The researchers further noted that all those studied whose CD4 was over 180 cleared cryptosporidium spontaneously with only anti-diarrheal treatment. In contrast, 87% of those whose CD4 was below 180 had persistent disease. There is no antibiotic treatment that serves as the standard of care for cryptosporidium. One treatment that has been suggested is the drug Humatin. Researchers in a recent Journal of AIDS study reported an 85% inhibition of cryptosporidium by Humatin in the test tube. In people, however, the drug has worked less well. Researchers now postulate that the diarrhea suffered by the person infected with cryptosporidium prevents adequate absorption of Humatin. This malabsorption may be what renders the drug ineffective. They recommend extensive anti-diarrheal therapy and then treatment with Humatin at 500 mg, four times a day. v I Juy 192 V ewsltte [Page 8](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0361.009/8) BEING ALIVE WOMEN AND CLINICAL TRIALS by Mary Lucey and Nancy MacNeil Every HIV+ woman should be aware of the clinical trials that are going on throughout the US. These trials offer participants access to new medications or to therapy they might not otherwise obtain. In addition, many of these trials provide free basic health care. The largest number of trials in this country are being conducted by the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG). This is a federally funded network of some forty hospitals and universities around the country. In fact, the bulk of our federal AIDS research dollars goes into conducting ACTG trials. THE PAST AND PRESENT SITUATION Up until recently, clinical trial participants have been almost exclusively gay, white, middle class men. Some trials simply excluded women for reasons that can only be termed paternalistic. Researchers were concerned about possible pregnancy or with the need for child care. Other trials, while not actively excluding women, made no effort to bring us actively into the process. This situation is now slowly changing. Researchers no longer write trials that intentionally exclude women. On the other hand, trials written exclusively for women focus on our fetuses or newborns, not on how HIV manifests itself specifically in women. Too often, we still see trials that are not open to women because they are structured along patient profiles that are profiles of men. Attempts are being made to recruit more women for clinical trials. Even so, many women have not found the means to access these trials. For the past ten years, many gay, white, middle class men have learned to access the ACTG system to extend their lives. It is now time for women to find a way to make better use of this vital resource Currently, there is more accessto women than in fact is being used. Getting women to participate in trials, however, is a hard sell. Many women have fears about being experimented on, although most of these ACTG trials could not truly be termed experimental and are safe. The only way to make this treatment option more available to women is for HIV+ women to come forward and tell researchers what exactly is wrong with current trials and what obstacles are still preventing women from accessing ACTG trials. We also need to advocate for trials that are intentionally designed to provide treatment and therapies for women. ADVANTAGES OF PARTICIPATING IN CLINICAL TRIALS Some clinical trials offer women an opportunity to take advantage of the very latest developments in therapies and treatments. This is the chance to \"get in on the ground floor.\" Other trials offer free drugs that have already shown promise. For many women, these trials provide access to therapy that they otherwise might not have. For the past ten years, many gay, white, middle class men have learned to access the ACTG system to extend their lives. It is now time for women to find a way to make better use of this vital resource. Most drug trials include free medical care and monitoring. This free, often long term, health care is probably the most valuable benefit that a woman receives when participating in a clinical trial. STAGES OF DRUG TESTING There are three distinct stage of drug testing. Phase I trials happen very early on when researchers do not know much about the drug. Usually they do not know the right dose, or the optimum way to use the drug, or sometimes even how safe it might be. Phase I trials are an experimental place to be. For women in search of basic health care, these trials should be avoided. On the other hand, we desperately need women to participate at this level or we will never have baseline data for women. We need to know how new drugs work on women, as well as how they work on men. Phase II trials are used to refine the therapeutic uses of promising drugs. By this point, dosage and safety have generally been established. By Phase III, researchers have a good sense of a drug's therapeutic value and correct dosage. Most Phase III trials involve comparisons of drugs that have proven to be effective. Both Phase II and III trials are good opportunities for women in search of basic health care and monitoring.

You can also search through a copy of AMFAR's AIDS/HIV Treatment Directory or the Southern California HIV Treatment Directory. Both there publications are available at Being Alive's library in Silver Lake, at APLA's library in Hollywood, and at the West Hollywood Library's HIV Information Center. NEXT ACTG MEETING The next ACTG meeting will take place November 3-6 in Washington, DC. HIV+ women should consider being on hand for this public forum. This will provide an opportunity to express our concerns directly to the research teams and a chance to advocate for better designed trials that meet the specific needs of women. Watch this Newsletter for more information on this meeting. SOME FINAL THOUGHTS When deciding to participate in a clinical trial, there are serious choices to be made. Free health care, monitoring and drugs are going to come with some strings attached. Be sure that you fully understand what you are getting into. Do some homework to determine which trial will most benefit you. Read the consent documents closely. Be aggressive in asking questions and challenge the medical establishment in issues pertaining to women with HIV/AIDS. As women, we have the right to extend out lives and accessing these trials is one way of doing that. (Mary Lucey and Nancy MacNeil are members of ACT UP/LA's Women's Caucus.

It can help keep your strength up and prevent weight loss and the breakdown of body tissues. There are some days when you just feel tired and have no desire to eat. This can be caused by infection, pain, worry, or the side effects of certain medications. When you are unable to eat, your natural immunity becomes weaker. Yet this defense system of your body is more important to you now. Therefore, it is especially important to eat well on days when you feel poorly. People who eat well are better able to cope with the side effects of treatment. The following suggestions should be helpful. * Eat small meals more often. Stock up on your favorite snacks and foods. These will be useful to eat between meals. * Eat some food every hour or two whether you feel hungry or not. * When you have energy, plan meals a week ahead of time and cook larger quantities; freeze the extra for use when you feel too tired to cook. * Accept the help of a friend to organize your kitchen shelves. Keep the most used items within easy reach, at eye level. Heavy items should be stored on lower shelves to avoid dropping them while being pulled out. Use a step stool to reach items on the upper shelves. * Ask your friends or family to cook or bring you food. * Make and use a grocery list so you will not forget anything while shopping. This will also be useful for your friends who may be helping you with grocery shopping. * Cooking takes time, but there are appliances available that can help put meals together in minutes. * Microwave oven: Use to reduce cooking time and minimize the pots and pans needed to reheat foods. A good, small sized oven can be bought for under $100. * Blender or food processor: There are days when eating solid foods appears time consuming or tedious, or you may have difficulty swallowing solids due to ulcers in the mouth or throat. Drinking feels easier. You can blenderize solid foods to a liquid. A high calorie, high protein shake may replace a meal. A food blender may cost anywhere from $16 to $50. Hand-held blenders are easy to use and clean-up. * An electric can opener: This can be an energy saver when you are using canned foods and don't want to wrestle with a manual can opener. * Limit fried foods or fatty foods which may make you feel too full and keep you from eating more frequently. * Limit low caloric drinks such as water or diet sodas. They can make you feel full and prevent you from getting enough calories from the meal. * Keep ready-to-eat and processed foods on hand. Buy chopped, frozen vegetables, sliced cheese, sliced breads, cutto-size meats. They take less time to prepare and can be used as meals in combination with other foods or as quick snacks between meals. * Nutritional supplements such as Enrich, Ensure, Sustacal-liquid or puddings, Lipisole will be very helpful in providing essential nutrients when you are unable to eat or to add as snacks. When you have milk intolerance, you can use nutritional supplements to make rich shakes. The following table will help you with suggestions for quick meals.

US EXCLUSION OF HIV+ VISITORS AND IMMIGRANTS CONTINUES by Walt Senterfitt One year ago, the Bush-Reagan administration robbed us of a significant and hardwon victory. Sponsored by Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the Immigration Reform Act of 1990 swept away many prejudicial exclusion provisions inserted over the years by various \"reactionaries-of-the-day\" from Pat McCarran and Joseph McCarthy to Jesse Helms. The use of homosexuality to preclude travel or immigration was erased outright. The authority to remove AIDS and HIV infection from the exclusion list was given to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Dr. Louis Sullivan), who announced his intention to do so in regulations that were to take effect June 1, 1991. Rightwingers outside (led by Helms, Dannemyer, Wildmon, Shelton) and inside the government (led by now-Attorney General William Barr) mobilized against the change and Sullivan decided to join them. At first, he withdrew the new regulations \"for six weeks of further study and comment.\" Sullivan then extended this time table last August to \"permanent further study,\" i.e. the new regula tions were killed. The HIV-excluding Helms Amendment to the immigration laws re GRUPOS DE APOYO PATROCINADOS POR BIENESTAR: LATINO AIDS de julio y continuando; de 7-9 pm. 3938 Sunset Blvd., LA 213.660.9680 Tambien, las celulas t de los hombres en el de relajaci6n aumentaron casi un 50% hombres VIH positivos en el grupo de ejercicio tuvo el mas alto nivel de celulas t de los tres mayoria de los participantes, y sabemos que hay una considerable variaci6n de celulas T durante el mains intact. The INS has issued no new regulations substantively increasing anyone's rights. There have been only a few procedural memos relating to the limited options of requesting waivers from exclusion. Waivers are possible only for HIV+ people who: * are applying for a tourist visa of 10 days or less to attend a specific conference, * are spouses, children, or parents of someone who is either a U.S. citizen or an eligible permanent resident, * are political or war refugees, or * are in the process of pursuing an amnestyrelated citizenship application filed before that program expired. To have a waiver application considered, one must show one of the following: * there are humanitarian reasons compelling the waiver; * it is in the public interest of the US to keep you here or let you come; * there are compelling reasons of family unification. In addition, one must demonstrate all of the following: * there is no risk to the public health of the US in the person's being here; * there is no risk of transmission of HIV to others; and transcurso del tiempo en cada uno. y terapias complementarias. V Sno federal or state agency could possibly have to bear any part of the cost of medical care (this is usually interpreted to mean the person must have insurance). Attorneys report that another applicable provision of the immigration law, requiring proof that one will not become a \"public charge,\" is being applied with new rigor to exclude people, rather than directly invoking the anti-HIV provisions. The waiver applications are processed very slowly. One problem is that a single INS Associate Commissioner in Washington has to personally approve every application; the regional offices can only recommend. A number of people have died while awaiting determination. The bittersweet \"good news\" is that if one is already here and has properly applied for amnesty or refugee status to which one would otherwise be entitled, one can remain here with employment authorization while awaiting a decision. An ACT UP Immigration Working Group is planning various actions to keep the immigration issue before the world press and the participants in the Amsterdam conference. These plans include an opening march past the consulates of the US and other countries practicing exclusion, leaving some coffins at each one, and a closing demonstration at the Anne Frank House and Museum.

Have you ever wondered what rationale lies behind the claim that the immune system of people with HIV needs to be boosted like some sort of space shuttle fighting gravity? And is there any potential danger of turning the whole experience into an immunological Challenger disaster? Before the advent of AIDS, immune boosting meant to temporarily increase the effectiveness of the immune system to fight an infection more quickly or to prevent infections from becoming symptomatic. Nowadays, immune boosters are also proposed as long-term treatments to help the immune system keep HIV and opportunistic infections in control. People with HIV have been conditioned to seek therapies that will boost their immune system-mainly because HIV disease is always presented as a deficiency that requires correcting. Media and researchers have consistently presented symptomatic persons with HIV as not being immunocompetent, and in bad need of a kick in their immunological ass. This attitude has a profound influence on the way people with HIV see themselves, on what they are expecting from a treatment, and on what AIDS research it trying to accomplish. Whether at Stanford University or at our favorite health food store, immune boosting has become a national sport. However, some of the players are starting to wonder whether there is a point to the game. Recently, a wealth of scientific information has begun to accumulate that suggests that stimulating the immune system may be more harmful than beneficial, especially in people with early disease. Without being too technical, let's say that immune cells exist in two states: active and inactive. Inactive cells are activated when the body is exposed to an infection or anything else that requires an immune response. Researchers have known for a while that it is rather difficult, if not impossible, to infect an inactive immune cell with HIV. In addition, infected cells need to be activated to produce HIV particles. The consequence is that anything which stimulates immune cells (such as an infection by any of the well-publicized cofactors, or an immune booster) has the potential to both increase the production of virus by infected cells, and increase the vulnerability of uninfected cells to HIV. Do you smell the coffee? In addition to this oh-so-minor inconvenience, scientists are starting to find evidence that HIV might not be the killer-that we love to hate-of T-cells. Several other studies seem to indicate that some T-cells may be falling victim of a yet-unsuspected assassin, the immune system itself! This hypothesis is often referred to as the \"auto-immune\" hypothesis. Auto-immune diseases are diseases in which the immune system goes bonkers and starts attacking part of the body itself. More and more researchers are beginning to believe that HIV can fool the immune system into pushing immune cells into a war against each other. Physicians often report many similar symptoms between HIV disease and Lupus (an auto-immune disease), as well as a significant incidence of auto-immune syndromes in people with HIV (against their platelets, their nerve endings, their skin). What will happen if you boost an immune system that is already overactive in a selfdestructive manner? Finally, a recent study from the Pasteur Institute published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine found that T4 cells from people with asymptomatic HIV disease have the unfortunate habit of committing suicide when activated by (guess what?) an immune booster (in this case, a substance isolated from the Pokeweed plant). T-cells, like many cells in the body, have the power to pull the trigger on themselves when told to do so, and this property might well play an important part in the loss of T4 cells observed in the late stages of HIV disease. So, still willing to run for anything that will stimulate T-cells? Whether at Stanford University or at our favorite health food store, immune boosting has become a national sport. However, some of the players are starting to wonder whether there is a point to the game. When researchers started using Interleukin-2 to restore T-cells (Interleukin-2 is a natural \"hormone\" we secrete to increase the production of new T-cells), they observed that T-cell counts were increasing but so was the amount of HIV in patients' blood. Further studies used AZT to try to prevent this in creased viral production. In every study of the immune-boosting effects of vaccines on people with HIV (such as gp 120 and gp 160), researchers are carefully studying the amount of HIV in each patient, as well as the eventual onset of auto-immune problems. However, nothing is known about the effects of other \"immune boosters,\" such as Echinacea, Astragalus, Reishi and Shiitake mushrooms, and the dozens of other compounds that are floating around our communities. Are we putting oil on the fire by using these substances? For years, reputable Oriental Medicine practitioners have described people with HIV disease as having an \"unbalanced\" immune system, rather than a deficient one. Qing Cai Zhang, MD, one of the authors of AIDS and Chinese Medicine and a practitioner in New York, recer4ly gave a talk in Los Angeles where he proposed to change the meaning of the acronym AIDS to Acquired Immune Dysfunction (not Deficiency) Syndrome. Oriental practioners have been using herbs that are said to have both immunostimulant and immunosuppressive properties, depending upon whether one has an overactive or a deficient immune system. Examples of such \"immunobalancing\" plants are the Chinese Cucumber (from which Compound Q is extracted) and the local craze, bitter melon. Acupuncture is also claimed to regulate a dysfunctional immune system. Western medicine is also looking into HIV treatments which may act by \"cooling\" a hyperactive immune system. Cyclosporine, a widely used immunosuppressor, is experiencing a new wave of interest after disappointing early trials. T8 cells, also known as Suppressor T-cells because they tend to put the lid on the immune response, are being drawn from patients, grown in a special device and re-injected into the original donor. Immunoglobulins are being administered intraveneously by some physicians in the hope of reducing the immune system's workload. Placental extracts are being injected because of the placenta's immunosuppressant properties during pregnancy. More importantly, physicians are stressing the importance of protecting oneself from infections that can last a lifetime, such as herpes, Epstein-Barr, CMV, syphilis, hepatitis C. These infections, most of which can be avoided by practicing safer sex, repeatedly stimulate an immune response and may hasten the progression of the disease by increasing virus production and exhausting the immune system. The next time you hear about yet an other immune booster which sends T-cells into orbit, remember that we need more 12 Newsletter V July 1992 [Page 13](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0361.009/13) PEOLE ITHHI/AIS A TIN C ALII0 research to determine whether it really is the proper strategy. If you decide to give it a try, be sure to have your physician follow the amount of active virus in your body (with tests such as p24 antigen, blood viremia). And don't forget that your immune system also deserves some rest! (Stephan Korsia is Coordinator of Treatment Information and Education at APLA. He may be reached at 213.962.1600, ext 270.) V IMMUNE-BASED THERAPIES continued from page 1 In vivo, most of the experience with interferons has been with KS. Interferon alpha has been most useful against KS in those individuals who have a well-preserved general immune responsiveness, in terms of tumor response. Those whose tumor responded to interferon tended to also have a decline in p24 antigen, indicating a general anti-HIV effect. INTERLEUKIN-2 Another cytokine tested extensively in people is interleukin-2, also know as T-cell Growth Factor. There was a lot of enthusiasm about this substance several years ago. Its major problem in clinical use is its very short serum half-life. This has been partly dealt with by combining it with another substance (called polyethylene glycol or PEG) to extend the half-life. IL-2 must be given intravenously and, for reasons that are not clear, this IV administration via indwelling catheters (e.g. Hickman) has been associated with higher incidences of bacterial infection or sepsis than one would expect. There has also been considerable systemic toxicity reported, including central nervous system toxicity, with IL-2, including the PEG form of it. I think there may be a niche for the \"PEGalated\" form of IL-2, especially in people with advanced disease. Dr. Merigan of Stanford is about to publish a paper showing that such folks, if they can tolerate the drug, show some modest but sustained rises in CD4 cells after infusions. Still, it's important to bear in mind that IL-2 and any of the cytokines are very nonspecific agents. What we need to be using is Patriot missiles and what we're firing with cytokines are SCUDs. We need to be doing clinical trials of much more specific agents. HIV-SPECIFIC IMMUNE RESPONSES The alternative or flip-side of this general immune boosting concept is to concentrate on the other part of the body's response to HIV, the very specific anti-HIV responses of the immune system. The motivation is that the initial or primary HIV infection is followed by a very long period of latency associated with a relatively low level of viral replication. One theory holds that this \"down modulation\" of HIV replication during the latent period is associated with the emergence of HIV-specific immune responses that successfully maintain this low \"viral load\" over a long period of time. I refer to this as a theory, because -at this point the connection between the two phenomena is not proven. This theory further posits that at some point there is a waning of the HIV-specific immune response. Then multiplication oif the virus is no longer suppressed and more and more immune system cells are infected. More infection leads to deteriorating overall immune function, resulting eventually in Ols and/or tumors. A variant of this theory says, rather than some general sort of waning, that viral diversity (through mutations) increases and overwhelms the HIV-specific response. The immune system gradually loses its earlier control of viral multiplication, because it gets fatigued from trying to cope with too great a variety of viral targets. DATA ON IMMUNE RESPONSES What are some the data behind this concept of a relationship between immune response and viral burden? Some of the first data correlating viral burden (i.e. the amount of HIV present in the blood cells and serum) came from Dr. David Ho's lab when he was here at Cedars-Sinai and UCLA. In crosssectional analysis, he showed a hundred-fold increase in viral burden between asymptomatic and ARC patients and again between ARC and AIDS. Similar results were reported by Dr. Larry Corey's group in Seattle, showing a strong correlation between viral burden, CD4 cell loss, and symptoms of immune decline. Assuming the HIV-specific immune response is responsible for the long period of latency, the most important research task is to figure out which elements of this response are the most important and which can be manipulated to sustain a successful response longer or indefinitely. Do we have evidence that the HIVspecific immune response actually kills HIV? Once again, some of the best data come from David Ho. First he showed that the effect of AZT in HIV-infected plasma is to reduce the viral load about ten-fold. Then he looked at primary HIV infection (i.e. right after a person is first infected with HIV), and found a comparable viral load to that of very ad vanced disease. But in primary infection, the body (or host) rapidly brings that viral load down a thousand-fold. In other words, the body's own early immune response is 100 times more powerful against the virus than is AZT at its best. ASPECTS OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE Now what are the aspects of the immune response that might be associated with this power? The two that have been most focused upon are neutralizing antibodies that bind to infectious virus and render that virus either noninfectious or less infectious, and cytotoxic T-cells (a type of T8 cell), so-called killer T-cells, that recognize certain antigens on the surface of infected cells and attack and kill these infected cells before a spread of the infection can occur. If one-looks at immune-based therapies in this light there are two general classes of therapy that have been employed. Some have aimed at increasing the anti-HIV humoral or passive immune response, as in the trials of transfusing serum from people at earlier, latent stages of infection into those with advanced disease. In the next six months to a year, I think you will see more efforts to use monoclonal antibodies to accomplish the same thing. The other kind of approach is to try to enhance the cellular immune response. These include the therapeutic vaccine studies and the ex vivo expansion of the killer T-cells, taking them out of the body and cloning or otherwise expanding them and then putting them back in. PASSIVE IMMUNOTHERAPY The passive immunoglobulin approach is undergoing a community based clinical trial here in Los Angeles. The approach is also being tested to try to prevent vertical transmission from infected mother to child and to prevent transmission to exposed workers or patients in health care settings. One of the problems with this approach is that it is not clear that humoral immunity is pivotal in preventing disease progression. There are certainly neutralizing antibodies present both early and late in disease, but one of the things we don't know is whether or not loss of these antibodies is associated with loss of control of the virus in infected individuals. Perhaps the biggest problem is the genetic diversity of the virus. We think that neutralizing antibodies work against the envelope (outer coating) of the virus, and particularly one region of the protein which makes up this envelope. This region, however, is the most variable part of the virus (it's known as the \"V3 loop\"), changing considerably as different strains evolve. The danger is continued on p 14 I Juy 192 VNewlettr 1 [Page 14](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0361.009/14) I BEING ALIVE IMMUNE-BASED THERAPIES continued from page 13 that neutralizing antibodies used therapeutically will be too narrow or restricted to block all the different strains present in an individual. Some researchers are working on ways around this, such as a \"cocktail\" of different antibodies or cloned antibodies directed at a different part of the envelope, but there are clearly going to be major problems. VACCINE THERAPY The last approach I'll discuss is so-called vaccine therapy. This is something that many people, including myself, thought was a bit bizarre several years ago. We thought it strange that if you injected a little more inactivated virus into people who have tons of virus floating around that you could somehow elicit an immune response not present to the whole virus. But some people, including Robert Redfield and Deborah Burke at Walter Reed, noted that both the humoral and cellular immune response was not commensurate to the amount of virus (or antigen) floating around. They speculated that if you innoculated HIV-infected people with a protein from the viral envelope, especially those with a large portion of their immune systems still intact, you could elicit a new immune response. They found that about two-thirds of their first study participants responded with new immune responses. Subsequently, they found that those classified as \"responders\" did better clinically than those considered \"nonresponders,\" in terms of higher in T4 cells, and so forth. The real question here is what's the cart and what's the horse. The most simplistic view of the results is that the vaccine enabled those who responded to it to boost their immune response and regain control of viral replication. Another, perhaps more appropriate, view is that the vaccine just identified those people whose immune response system could still identify and react to the virus and thus predicted those who were going to do better anyway. Other studies (of several different vaccines or immunogens) are now being conducted, both within and outside of the ACTG system. Some early reports have stated that the immune response Redfield initially found in people with greater than 500 T-cells can also be found in people with much more advanced disease. The key questions remain: Does immune response to a vaccine predict a better clinical outcome? If so,what is the best immunogen? v BUYING TIME continued from page 1 with the legal, psychological, social, economic suffering of people with HIV/AIDS. Some governments have made a genuine effort to combat AIDS. But all that was too late to save my friend's life. All the millions of Ryan White dollars, all the AZT/ddl/ddC in the world, all the WHO coordination cannot erase the sad fact that AIDS is still not a \"manageable chronic disease,\" as we hopefully said, spitting into the wind, in 1989. Instead, AIDS has become normalized. We are all too numb to grieve as each of us accumulates a hundred dead friends. We are all too busy managing our own health. AIDS demonstrations become part of the spectacle of AIDS: we die, we protest; they do nothing. Eleven years of epidemic, and George Bush still believes AIDS is a problem of behavior, and that we can be saved if we change our sexual lives. I for one don't want his compassion; I want his signature on appropriations bills. But I don't want just the appropriations, either. I serve on the CARE Act Planning Council in LA, and I see some disturbing trends that seem to characterize the AIDS effort nationwide. I suspect they obtain in all the post-industrial Western nations. US resident PWAs and those in other countries should be vigilant. First, AIDS planning has come to mean AIDS agencies, not PWAs. Yes, agencies need to survive and grow to address the epidemic. Yes, agencies offer organization, expertise and truly committed helpers to us who have HIV disease. But agencies originated because we were sick. We are not AIDS victims, not AIDS patients, not AIDS clients. We are the subjects of the epidemic; we are the reason AIDS agencies exist and raise money, the reason those compassionate professionals have jobs. However, the comparatively large AIDS expenditures that developed nations can muster have spawned the same kind of pimping off human suffering that we witnessed in the anti-racist and anti-poverty programs of the 70s in the US. Agencies and individuals loudly proclaim their dedication, but their applications for government contracts are increasingly aimed toward flashy, fundable services rather than the daily needs of people with AIDS. One example should suffice: several competing applications were made to the Los Angeles HIV Planning Council for psychiatric services, with an immense cost to pay the MDs. Virtually no applications were made for support groups, programs of medi cal information for patients, or any services that would help individual PWAs cope with their own problems. Yes, prolonging the life of PWAs with antivirals and prophylaxes means that more individuals reach a stage of extreme mental distress and brain deterioration. It is true that there is a greater need for psychiatric consultation, particularly to manage complex drug interactions; in Los Angeles, however, agencies rejected suggestions to combine their efforts and distribute psychiatric resources in common. Sadly, the bodies that regulate and distribute the resources are often pork-barrel competitions as corrupt as Pentagon defense contract bidding. Whom to blame? Despite the fact that more than fifty agencies won contracts for AIDS services in year one of the Ryan White CARE Act, there is an immense fund of unspent;ollars and an equally immense shortfall in meeting goals set by the HIV Planning Council. I have concluded that it is not just because of LA County indifference and incompetence-although those factors are very real-and it is not just because of some AIDS agencies' greed and cupidityalthough agencies increasingly lie about numbers to win contracts. The fact is, I sadly conclude, that the monies are unspendable. These funds were earmarked for services that could not be delivered because of real socal and political conditions. The Congress accepted justifiable demands that priority funding go to communities of color and women. However, the Congressional mandate did not take responsibility for the centuries-long inequalities of medical care and access to economic support. Of course emergency funds cannot be spent in communities of color where people experience healthcare as another of the oppressive structures of control. Ask an undocumented Latino in Los Angeles, or a \"guest worker\" from Malaysia living in Berlin if he/she has adequate regular healthcare. Ask if he/she wishes to risk opprobrium and discrimination, including deportation, by testing for HIV antibodies. Ask if his or her life affords opportunities for sober reflection on transmission risk and condoms or injection drug hygiene. Ask historians if any epidemic in human history has been ended by social engineering of behavior. No, no, no. The second dismaying trend is that people with AIDS play a diminishing role in their own healthcare and are being displaced by professionals and experts. Reluctance to listen to PWAs has been evident throughout the history of AIDS but is now accelerating, as medicine and case management become more complex. Few of us want to be doctors or social workers, but we do wish to be in 14Nwsete Jl.19 [Page 15](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cohenaids/5571095.0361.009/15) PEPL WTHHI0AD ATIN OAITO charge own lives. Organized groups of people with HIV/AIDS continue to believe that most of us can cope with a complex medical regimen and a bewildering array of financial challenges, given support and information. In developed countries-except for the US and South Africa-coping is made easier through a system of national healthcare. In the US, there is also a system of free healthcare, but it is the second-rate, punitive system of healthcare inflicted on the poor, usually the people of color, women and children who are the populations that are disproportionately represented in statistics of new AIDS cases. In developing countries, the question is closed: there is simply no money to provide healthcare. In all developed countries, we have had to fight with government or private doctors to make them treat us as we want to be treated. Even where good healthcare is the right of all, as in Canada, medical experts have refused the requests of PWAs for approval of new treatments. In every case, innovation has come only when PWAs themselves have turned their requests into powerful demands. The assumption that expertise is superior to personal experience is not exclusive to medical doctors and bureaucrats. Even militant organizations like ACT-UP have sometimes failed to notice that they are not the motor force of reform-they are instead the vehicle for the demands of people actually living with HIV/ AIDS. The fundamental principles of an organization of people with HIV/AIDS like Being Alive are self-empowerment and mutual aid. On the individual, personal level, this means we stay healthier if we actively supervise our own healthcare and help each other through the problems of life. By now, most experts will have read studies showing that people who attend support groups enjoy not just an improved subjective feeling of \"quality of life, but are indeed measurably healthier for a measurably longer time. It is still debatable whether Burroughs Wellcome can match that claim. It is undisputable that bureaucrats and social workers are reluctant to heed that claim. I believe that PWA coalitions should serve as the model for societal response to the AIDS epidemic. In fact, that is the point of two abstracts Being Alive will present this year at the VIlIth International AIDS Conference. As early diagnosis and more effective therapies expand the active lives of people with HIV/AIDS, our needs for information, advocacy and social support likewise grow. PWA coalitions offer a cost-effective network of those who must live with the disease, mobilized to support each other. This process of mutual aid appears to be applicable to a wide variety of diverse economic strata and cultures. I realize the limitations of this model, which is based largely on the experience of upwardly-mobile gay white men in a large city in the developed world. The practice of early intervention and self-empowerment is now being interrogated by organizations in communities of color. They have found that early intervention is indeed successful if intensive support is available, support for people whose experience with medical care and government-sponsored welfare agencies has been largely negative. Such support must cope with the already-full plate of problems caused by racial and economic discrimination. For PWAs to join together in such communities, they must also overcome the stigmatization that accompanies disclosure of HIV sero-status. However, I am convinced that mutual aid through organizations of PWAs will be possible and useful to the developing world and to the disenfranchised in the developed world. We suggest that AIDS planners in Africa, Asia, South America consider the fact that PWAs who are active in their own behalf maintain better health and maintain their ability to contribute to their own fellow citizens. We are committed to working together with PWAs from other cultures to explore these ideas. In fact, sharing our experiences and extending a network of mutual support across cultural, racial, economic and gender boundaries will be an essential task of the international fight against AIDS in this second decade. The professional medical systems and government-sponsored planning bodies will need our accumulated knowledge. We must make certain that those professional bodies are kept honest and committed to serving the diverse needs of the people with HIV/AIDS that they are mandated to serve. I realize that active advocacy-with my doctor, with my community organizations, with government--gives meaning to my life as it did to my friend Mark's. For many, it has kept us healthy just as much as medical treatment. There is healing power in our anger and in the love and support we offer each other. I wish it were enough. If it were, then Mark would be alive, as well as the 700 people with AIDS who died along with him since last Saturday night. V MICHAEL HIRIGOYEN PERHAPS HIS WORK HERE WAS DONE by Jim Slaten Michael Hirigoyen, one of the most consistent participants in our little community we affectionately call the Friday night drop in support group, volunteer and attendee at all social events, died suddenly and unexpectedly of pancreatitis and its complications (yes, he was taking ddl) on Monday, June 8, 1992. Michael's presence is already sorely missed. His kindness, his humor and his helpfulness impressed us all. He had a truck that he used to help people move; often they were PWAs he had never met before. He would see that anyone who needed it had a ride to and, from support group even if it meant driving 20 miles out of his way. In many ways, Michael was very childlike, rather guileless. One of the primary joys of his life was his participation in the All Saints sponsored art class which he attended just as religiously as group. Much of his art work adorns the offices and hallways of All Saints AIDS Services Center in Pasadena. It was ironic that the opening of this year's art show at the Pasadena Armory was held four days after his death. Michael leaves us with many fond memories. He was a genuinely gentle soul. We are all richer for having known him. He will be much missed. v F0 Connect Avypia l Beach: Intervention Team: 213.666.5495 Cara a Cara: Patients: 310.542.3019 NIH Drug Hotline: 800.TRIALS A Pacific (SIDA) AIDS LA: Cares: 310.659.4840 W.
