Based on the belief that what causes a certain symptom can also cure it, homeopathy serves to cure the cause of the symptom by introducing a remedy that promotes the body's natural response to healing. Christina Marino's Alternative Health Care Concepts is committed to classical homeopathy as one treatment technique that can work miracles in the lives of individuals. Homeopathy acts in harmony with the body and its natural defenses against infection and viruses, not against it. Many of today's modern prescription and over the counter treatments and drugs do the exact opposite. Responses such as coughing, vomiting, and fever are signs the body is attempting to relieve itself of an affliction. Homeopathy provide the exact remedy that will promote natural healing, not simply trying to rid the person of the symptom of coughing or fever, but working with that symptom to alleviate it.

However, when considering a course of homeopathy, Christina Marino wants you to be aware that \"there are no one size fits all remedies in the practice of homeopathy. The whole individual must be taken into account when prescribing a treatment and that treatment it is a very individualized regimen. A homeopath must take into complete account where the pain occurs, what causes it, what agitates it, when it is felt most often, and for how long.
